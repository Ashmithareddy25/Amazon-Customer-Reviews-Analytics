0307272702|5.0|if you are not up to GCBC I would recommend reading \\"Why We Get Fat\\". This title is much slimmer and far more readable and because of that will reach a far wider audience. Heck, you may even get your doctor to read it!  The bottom line is that Taubes recommnds eating in a manner than controls our blood sugar level, which contols the insulin level and the insulin/glucagon ratio. Controlling your homones is far more important than trying to eat low calorie and low fat. The satiety provided by eating a diet that is higher in fat and protein and lower in sugars and starches makes this diet, no let's call it a way of life, easy to follow as you are NEVER hungry. You don't have the disire to eat 90 to 120 minutes after a \\"healthy\\" high carb meal.   Remember - biology always trumps willpower. You may be able to go for a few months of being hungry and having wacky blood sugar levels but after a while you will fall of the wagon.  Taubes has done a tremendous service with this book. Read it!  If, after you read this book, you want to know how we got in the mess we are in now, read GCBC and learn the history behind the current governmental dietary recommendations. It will make your blood boil. You will never again think modern medicine has anything to do with real science.
0307592839|4.0|The adventures of Sasha and Bennie and the New York music scene are told in a spiral of story, where you are with some characters for a while - on the Lower East Side, in New Jersey - and then you spiral away from them but return later looking down on the characters from a different vantage point. While as a reader there are places on the spiral where you lose sight of some particular action, the complex world reemerges and the story continues on. I was very happy to read the happy ending for Sasha, after worrying about her for a long time. Yes, we all get older - the goon squad of the title - but we can also get better.

0307948560|5.0|My wife the super mom and attorney loved this book. She could really relate to the idea that the 1950s mom was a caged tigress wanting to work -- that's why she spent every minute of the day on her feet!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|A disapointment.  At ths rate these stories will never be resolved.  Even in real life the good guys manage to survive sometimes.  I do not understand the complex characters that just are eliminated.  The reader does expect some resolution after reading 4 or 5 books.

0767903862|5.0|This is one of those books that's best read when it falls into your lap as a break from other books. One day you're slogging your way through a tome of ungodly proportions, wondering how in God's name this book ever got published, when a book like IASC falls into your lap and you pounce on it with the enthusiasm of a bobcat devouring a goat. Soon you find you must shirk all of your daily duties until the book is finished. This, people, is not only the mark of a good book, it is the mark of a good travel book. Even better is one that makes you want to visit Australia--which is remarkable when you consider Australia has more imaginative and horrible ways to kill you than pretty much any other place on earth. It's Earth's second most inhospitable climate (the first is Antarctica).   But all Antartica can do is kill you with its cold. Australia is home to fluffy caterpillars that can kill you, species of spiders that can kill you with just a pinprick of venom, and the world's deadliest snake: the taipan. (Interesting fact: the taipan is fifty times more venomous than the world's second deadliest snake, the cobra. You get bit by a taipan and it's bye bye baby, goodbye.) Not to mention, there are sharks, poisonous jellyfish (\\"blueys\\"), and man-eating crocodiles. And desert. Lots and lots of unforgiving desert. While most Australians aren't bothered by the rest of the lot, the crocodiles even scare them.   That said, Bryson makes Australia--a country, he notes, to which Americans pay little attention (Russell Crowe notwithstanding)--sound like the world's friendliest and warmest place on planet Earth. Australians do sound like a very friendly and welcoming folk. That they managed to make a country at all is to their immense credit, though, according to Bryson, they'll not thank you for mentioning that their country essentially started off as a penal colony. (The \\"criminals,\\" by the way, were not at all a bad lot; many were only there because of harsh sentences that were common for the lower classes in England at the time. If you stole five cucumbers, you could choose between your own hanging or ... a move to Australia.)  There were many places in the book where Bryson made me burst out laughing. I tried to read a passage to a friend, but I could barely get it out because I was laughing too hard. And he's not just good as a humorist, either. He's great at the factual stuff. What otherwise might be dry and sleep-inducing comes alive in Bryson's writing, and he kept me as riveted as any high-octane novelist. He truly is a delight to read, and I can't wait to read more of his books. Highly recommended.
0142004235|5.0|this is one of the best books i have ever read. a complete masterpiece. i think this book truly goes deep into what humans are really like. there are monstrous things out there, although some people choose to not see it or accept it. but life can truly be the way this book depicts it. there is definitely good and evil, and i dont believe the character cathy seems fake at all. whoever felt that way must have a very naive outlook of this world. although this book was great it was also very sad. i still love it though.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I enjoyed this book, although I understand some of the criticisms made of it. For my the strong point was the magical world so richly described in the text. I love beautifully realised worlds of fantasy, and in this respect the book never disappointed. I read the book throughly, a feat in itself, as I often find myself skipping bits of modern books to move the story on. I found no difficulty in following the strands of the book, which I felt wove together quite nicely.  Some of the criticisms I have read about the book suggest that the game itself and the reason for it were not clear, but I did not feel this detracted from the book, as it was made clear that the men arranging the contest were both long lived enough to go through quite intricate processes both to prove a point and to amuse themselves, and amoral enough to sacrifice lives in order to get a result. The only thing I did not believe was that Celia's father was supposed to care too much about his entrants. I felt there was little evidence of this, save the moment when Celia says she hates him, which seems to have an effect. I did feel that the characters could have been better drawn and more sympathetic, but felt they fitted the setting. I loved the world conjoured by the rich description, but have to say the characters produced little in the way of emotion in me. Having said all this, I really loved the book as it was, even if it did not produce any emotional reaction.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I read this book and felt transported. I did not want it to end.  I have since bought the Audible version and listen to it most nights as I go to sleep.  I can hardly wait to give a copy of this book to my best friend for Christmas.  I can hardly wait for book two to be published.
B005P89F1C|5.0|As always, very happy with Amazon. Arrived in time, in a perfect package and in perfect conditions.<br />Unless you're a real JB fan it's not worthy to buy the Deluxe Edition 'cause you can find two of the three videos on his You Tube account and the other somewhere else on the internet.<br />But, even so I like this very much and I would recommend it.
B0055OK2T0|1.0|While the cover artwork of this movie makes it seem like a fast-paced thriller...this move is 90% chick-flick material!<br /><br />I thought there would be lots of Sci-Fi action and drama...but the majority of the film revolves around \\"cute\\" conversations between the two main leads slowly falling in love.<br /><br />This one's for the girls...not fans of Sci-Fi thrillers or action, like the movie poster suggests.<br /><br />Plus, was anyone else offended by the line in the movie when the black \\"Angel\\" character warns Matt Damon about men-in-hats ruling the world and that: \\"\\"Even people in yarmulke's!!\\"...insinuating you should be suspicious of Jewish people, because they control fate?! I found this not-so-subtle Anti-semitism distasteful!
B005O64VH8|5.0|I have almost all of their albums. This album has one really extra wonderful song on it, Powered by Nature.  Espen Gjotheim sings this song and his voice soars and your heart will surely sing along with him. I hope that more of Secret Garden albums will contain more of his vocals.

B0010SKTRA|5.0|1<br /><br />'\\"Your inner Fish\\" last week I was related to placozoa. This week I am related to sponges. I need to finish this book. I am on the edge of my seat. I can't imagine where it is going next. We really need to pay our teachers more. They give us a gift we can't repay. My latest mentor is Neil Shubin. I sure wish I had studied under him.  He puts it together and produced a great read.<br /><br />2<br /><br />Your Inner Fish is a wonderful book, an easy read, and very very logically written.  When scientists share their research in such a humble manner, it is a joy. If you are the least bit curious about where you came from, read this book.  Raphael Santore<br /><br />'
B000H4QD1O|5.0|As a huge sci-fi fan, this is one series which could have had its characters play in just about any environment and still be just as entertaining.  It is the interplay between the characters which I found unique.  The fact it all takes place on the edge of the verse just adds icing to something very entertaining. Have converted a number of non-scifi fans with this one series.  Very well written, something rarely seen nowadays.
B005MYWZKM|5.0|Ceremonials opens with an amazing, soul searching tour de force, and as the music builds past the now overplayed single \\"Shake It Out\\" we discover the true genius of this album. The vinyl sounds, well, stunning! I am spinning it with the following system: A Rega P5 -> Harman Kardon A500 Tube Amp -> Paradigm Titan v6. Not the greatest system, but good enough to make you love music and vinyl.   Unfortunately, I feel the album loses a bit of that gripping power with \\"Breaking Down,\\" which sounds kind of like it was meant for a breakup scene in a movie, or maybe a commercial. It begins to steer back on course with the next song though, \\"Lover to Lover,\\" which really puts her vocals to the test with soaring highs and a cheerful backup chorus that will appeal to Adele fans, or any Daptone label fan.   Then you throw on the next record and drop the stylus on side C with \\"No Light, No Light\\" and we're back again! Florence's voice shines through, her lyrics are powerful and the pounding of the drums, the sensuous strings and the gliding harp come together to produce a tingling effect that good music should produce. This is the type of song that makes you wish you had a bunch of tube McIntosh gear and some Wilson Alexandrias. \\"Seven Devils\\" is haunting, mysterious, and dare I say devilish! \\"Heartlines\\" relies heavily on the pounding drums to touch the listener, and for me had too much of a James Horner \\"Braveheart\\" soundtrack effect. It's not a bad song, but it doesn't have the same heart rending effect that \\"Only if for a Night\\" had. But maybe you will like it better.   Flip it over to side D and we have \\"Spectrum,\\" which starts off sounding like the intro to a trance album, utilizing some phasing, reverb and synths to create a more \\"pop\\" track. Then \\"All This and Heaven Too\\" comes on... The song is great, but I'm not sure what happened but the Highs seem a bit tremulous, which I cannot tell if it is my system that is causing this, or of it is the pressing. It's not terrible, but noticeable if you are listening to the album carefully. \\"Leave my Body\\" successfully closes the album with that powerful backup chorus, and seems to be Florence's confessional/testament. It's a transcendence, both lyrically and sonically, though I notice the same tremulous Highs as before... I will have to tweak my system and/or listen to the album on another reference system to see if it is the record or my own gear.  Conclusion: Buy this album, take it to your local Hi-Fi dealer and have them throw it on their reference system. \\"Only if for a Night\\" is an amazing opener, and really puts a system through its paces with its lows rumbling and Florence's voice soaring. Buy this album because it's great music and will impress your friends when you spin it. Buy the vinyl because you are supporting the resurgence of great fidelity, and because it's much more involving than an MP3 or hitting next on your CD player.  Sonics: 4.0  Music: 4.5  The ability to send shivers down your spine: 5.0 (Priceless!)
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|I guess this was just a big letdown. Everyone at work was reading it, and after finishing up all five of the the George R.R. Martin books, I picked up these and read them in a weekend. Lesson - Suzanne Collins can write for teens and those who enjoy a quick and light read - each of the three books was engaging yet lacking in real character development, pace or depth. The last quarter of the Mockingjay is a rambling mess of wrap up if there ever was one- it read like an early Grisham novel without the punchline.  If you like light, easy and not too developed- you will love this. If you want something that appeals to a young audience buy it, but if you want to read something that might capture you, and peak your interest, and truly make you think about the character - try Tolkien, Rowling, Lewis, or even Martin. Don't let anyone tell you Suzanne Collins is the next JK Rowling, if they do, unfriend them on Facebook as fast as you can....

B005D0RDIE|5.0|I wanted to wait for the Blu-ray version but I cannot imagine having better picture and/or sound quality than the DVD. I saw them at Madison Square Garden during this tour and they were fantastic. Watching the concert on this DVD they blew me away again. The 5.1 DTS version is magnificent. I haven't listened to the stereo version and I don't think I ever will, but I'm sure it is very good too. Rush = quality.  If Amazon had 10 stars I would give it 10 stars. No need to describe the concert, others have done that already. The way they play music so intricate and complex is close to mayhem and disaster, yet song after song they nail it, while making it look easy. Chaos controlled!
B005HEJ3SE|5.0|This episode along with all the others in the first season is classic Star Trek. From the wonderful ship to ship models (even if they're all CG now) and compelling story line this series embodifies Gene's real ideas for star trek.  this episode is really a story about ourselves as Captain Archer finds Suliban in an internment camp and proceeds to rescue them, every episode is filled with Hope and shows that compassion is one of mankind's greatest qualities along with our exploring curiosity of whats around the next bend. In short wholesome television with Great action characters and full stories I hope u enjoy it as much as I did TY.

0345529057|1.0|The kindle version sucks, so does the print version, so get the Audible version.  The narration is fabulous and will totally draw you in to the story (once you get used to his British accent).  This is a really great story that you shouldn't miss out on just because the publisher doesn't know how to print it, and Amazon charges a fortune for a digital edition.
0062060554|1.0|Before I Go to Sleep is the most annoying book I've tried to read in years...annoying principally because I find it inconceivable that it was ever published.  Watson loves to say everything many different ways rather than simply once, usually one way right after the other, which makes for a heavingly pedestrian read.  His descriptives are often repeated throughout...I became very tired of reading such as \\"I feel I'm going mad\\" and \\"he buried his face in his shirt.\\"  I can only imagine his dialog being voiced by teens and/or soap-opera actors.  Many passages beg for clarity...where is this happening?, to whom is it happening?  Overall, a serious and fair one-word description of this novel, if not \\"garbage,\\" would be \\"inept.\\"  Are there no astute editors at Harper?  This poor effort certainly didn't get one.  And it was voted best mystery or some such by some outfit or other?...Oy.

B0064T6LV8|5.0|I am an older dude so these small electronic \\"gadgets\\" are kind of difficult for me with my klutzy hands and poor eyesight.  However, I got the Pinball Deluxe game today for my Kindle Fire and I really like it.  Even \\"I\\" can use it and with little practice. Ok, I did really read the directions on how to use it, and they helped me lots.  But playing the game is easy, fun, and addictive.  No, I am not ready to challenge the online players.  (Yes, if you are really good, you can have your game scores rated along with the best of the online players.)  It actually has operating flippers and a \\"shake\\" mode to bounce the ball against some of the bumpers.  Fun app and great as I got it FREE!
1439102813|3.0|Considering the life-altering effects and prognosis of Alzheimers, I expected this book to be more insightful and poignant.  Alice, a dynamic professional woman, who is diagnosed early in the novel with early-onset Alzheimers seems oddly unemotional and detached about the entire thing.  I'm sure she wasn't, but she was written that way. She seems more analytical than distraught or heartbroken or afraid.  I know everyone reacts differently to tragedy, but this portrayal didn't feel plausible to me.  I would have liked her to throw something against a wall or have a breakdown at least once while she was still capable, to add veracity.  While I liked Alice and her family, they all seemed like actors playing their expected roles and her husband, John, seemed particularly one-dimensional.  I think the author should have chosen the personal story or the clinical one and not have tried to mix them.  The book talked about specific drugs, treatments, genetic influences, organizations, etc.  There was no high emotion, no suspense, no revelations.  I believe caregivers might enjoy this book as it does interestingly portray the thought process, or lack thereof, of the patient.  Thus, I could recommend it to anyone personally involved with this terrible disease.  Otherwise, I would probably skip it.

B005HSG3U6|4.0|I got my Kindle Fire and I love it.  Alas, the case that I ordered for it at the same time, did not arrive at home until about a week later.  This did give me a chance to get used to the Fire and, administer the basic 2-foot drop test onto the Star$$s concrete floor. Hooray!  It didn't brake, but then that was just the initial, and low force, basic test.  I hoped to receive my cover before doing additional drop-tests.  However, this MicroShell Folio cover, in white, has arrived and is excellent.  At first, I was doubtful about just how \\"good\\" it would be.  But I quickly discovered that the Fire fits in snuggly with feltish type lining and \\"plastic\\" outer half-cover greatly reduced the slipperiness of Fire.  Yes, right out of the box, the Fire is extremely slippery and easy to drop.  This cover does have an elastic band on the back that allows you to wrap around the case to keep the lid on the cover, or to retain the back-folded cover.  Plus, I find myself frequently using the elastic band as an aid in holding the Fire while I read it.  Thie is seriously a real PLUS. Another issue is that while there is a slot that can be used to hold the cover in a triangular shape for support, it is only usable in one position.<br /><br />The one real negative issue has to do with the color.  I selected white and it looked great at first. But after a week, it is already starting to get grungy.  If you are \\"cleaner\\" than I am, then this might not be a problem.  Although I wish I had selected a different color.  It does look cool when clean!  And it works really well.  Because of the chance for getting the white cover dirty, and the limited ability to vary the angle of the support, I reduced my rating to four stars.  I definitely like it, though and recommend it to others.<br /><br />All that being said, I still am on the lookout for some kind of a carrying case that will really protect the Fire from a more substantial drop and have some kind of a carrying handle.  I KNOW that I have my secondary 5-foot drop test coming up in the not too distant future...  Really, the cover is great.<br /><br />EDIT: Two days later...  I finally washed the white outer cover with dishsoap/water/washclothe (don't tell my wife...) and the cover cleaned up nicely. Pleased to see how easy it was to clean.drop test coming up in the not too distant future...  Really, the cover is great.  EDIT: Two days later...

B004UXUX4Q|3.0|The buzz about this film has been Oscar-worthy, but the actual film is a major disappointment, particularly because is was co-written and directed by Alexander Payne, whose earlier films include the brilliant SIDEWAYS and ELECTION, and whose 7-year absence from film has been deeply felt. THE DESCENDANTS feels more like Payne's ABOUT SCHMIDT, which gave Jack Nicholson a good late-career role but was still just another road movie. The film feels underwritten and too often predictable. There is little doubt where we are going, but Payne's journey to get us there is too often uncertain in tone. Scenes and incidents, some funny, others sad, are set up, and then don't pay off. Clooney gives a good, understated performance, but his character's changes, from selfish, stingy, uncaring father and husband, to loving, concerned dad and human being, are never dramatized; we're just supposed to accept it. The whole cast is good, even Nick Krause in the Keanu Reeves role from \\"Parenthood\\" (the scene where the dopey teen gives advice to Clooney about his daughter is the same as Reeves giving advice to Dianne Wiest in the earlier film). Some times it feels as though the film were too heavily edited, and the missing scenes would have answered all our questions and satisfied our emotional needs. Just hypothetical, but how else to explain the ultimate emptiness of an \\"important\\" film that just doesn't deliver?

B004LWZW8I|5.0|Friday after Thanksgiving my darling and I went to the AMC theater to watch the \\"Immortals\\" in 3D.<br /><br />During my school years I have read a lot about Greek gods and next day after watching the movie I picked up the myth book to refresh it... the Olympic Games, honoring gods, were named after Mount Olympus. On the top of it all powerful Zeus sat on a golden throne and ruled other gods and humans with his cord of gold. The myths, legends and sanctuaries of the Greeks celebrated their gods.<br /><br />\\"Immortals\\" directed by Tarsem Singh immersed me into timeless themes of good vs. evil, fear vs. courage, love vs. cruelty, brutality of fight vs. wisdom of fight... Some scenes in the movie were just magnificent:<br />- god plunging from Mt. Olympus into the sea;<br />- all scenes with Epirus Bow and arrows;<br />- child's visions concluding the movie.<br /><br />Important role of women in ancient Greek civilizations was debated at large by late UCLA's archeologist Marija Gimbutas highly valued by Joseph Campbell - read the Foreword to \\"The Language of Goddesses\\". \\"Star Wars\\" by George Lucas were solidly grounded in J. Campbell's mythology research. \\"Immortals\\" reminded me of the role of oracle - priestess Phaedra - and did it in a vibrant context of the war between the  Hyperion, the Heraklion King of Crete, and Theseus, taught and protected by Zeus himself (read plot and details on Immortals at Wikipedia).<br /><br />The movie brings us also to the discussion of why gods support some mortals and abandon others, why free will is the key in reaching our goals toward liberation and prosperity. Those questions are relevant today as well as what does it mean to be competitive today?<br /><br />Vivid contrasting colors, use of light vs. darkness, 3D dynamics, even the symbolic \\"blood\\" scenes (because you know that Gods are immortal)... - all this created unforgettable experience which we enriched by debating lines, scenes and meanings all weekend at home. I have to say that no other movie on Greek mythology made so huge impression on me.<br /><br />Congratulations to film creators at Universal Pictures and Relativity Media.<br /><br />Warm regards - Artumsion on me.  Congratulations to film creators at Universal Pictures and Relativity Media.  Warm regards - Artum
1250004217|5.0|I saw the film first (see my review) and was not disappointed by the book. What struck me as one of the virtues of the film -- the fluid movement between two periods in time -- is an even stronger asset of the book. The contemporary story follows logically from the detective efforts of the protagonist and distinguishes Sarah's Key from the almost corny kind of coincidence in Dickens. One of the chief assets of the book vs. the film is the revelation of how Julia's in-laws are affected by Sarah and her story. I particularly enjoyed Julia's father-in-law and the catharsis he experiences as a result of Julia's onslaught into the past. I was also drawn to the portrayal of the wonderful couple who adopt Sarah. This is a tight, emotionally evocative story that affected me in the same way as the movie. Sarah's Key is a far more powerful tale of the Holocaust than Schindler's List because we are allowed into the personal tragedy of Sarah on such an intimate level. Is the book better than the movie? For my money, each stands in its own right as a masterpiece.

B004GXZ69W|4.0|I use a mouse more than 10 hours in a day and my wrist,arm, and shoulder were suffering.   Many people said this device is good for wrist pain and I just trusted their opinion.  Now, I have used this for a month and found that this device is a lot helpful to prevent arm and wrist pain.   I can't say this is a perfect solution for pain, but much better than a normal mouse.   Having never used vertical type of mouse, it took 2~3 weeks to be used to it.  One thing I don't like is the wheel. the position of wheel is a bit weird and the feeling of rolling wheel is weird.  The wheel seems really cheap and awkward.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|Pearl Jam 20 takes a look behind one of the most influential, powerful, controversial and vital bands of the last two decades. Whether you've been a fan since before their formation from the remains of Green River and Mother Love Bone or novice new listener, this documentary is insightful and enjoyable for any audience while at the same time telling a true story full of emotions of this incredible band. It features some very interesting and rare video from the early days, including interviews and live shows of Andy(R.I.P.) and Mother Love Bone that any older fan will sure to enjoy. From triumph to chaos and contraversy and tragedy, it depicts it all and shows how the band persevered and why they are regarded as such a band today. Now, for the what you get on DVD/Blu-Ray, is the film and approx. 26 minutes of 'bonus' material, which a majority is seen partially in the actual film. Even on the band summary, it states there is over 1200 hours of video material collected. Now I know that would be rediculous, though incredible to release all of that(I know there is/was a bigger deluxe box set available earlier), but a little more extras could have been included for the standard editon, especially since the film itself was so very good. But overall, it is well worth the $15-20 range and is something any Pearl Jam fan young or old will sure to cherish years to come.

I had always liked \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" but not enough to buy the entire album, but once I downloaded Spotify and gave the whole album a listen I was obsessed. \\"Cosmic Love\\" is my favorite track on the album, but the entire track listing is enjoyable. There is a song for everyone on Lungs. You will not be disappointed.
B005ORVN1Y|5.0|Sector 3 of the 3-part box set of Rush's Mercury-era albums really does justice to the somewhat sub-par 1997 20-bit remasters. It's actually a revelation to how much better each album sounds. The key album and why I myself chose to purchase Sector 3 first was to get Signals, which always seemed to have audio issues. This version completely blows all other versions away, just comparing it to the '97 remaster, the difference is substantial. As with the rest of the albums in the set, each one sounds excellent. I cannot comment on the Signals DVD-Audio disc, as I haven't got to listen to it yet, but from other reviewers stated it is a real treat to hear. Now for the packaging, it is quite nice for the most part, but not including the original sleeves to each album in exchange for including the artwork in the 52-page is kind of taking away from the faithfulness to the original LP's. Even the cover arts for 'Grace' and 'Windows' is different from the original issues that came out (Grace's artwork had different colouration and Windows did not have a grey perimeter and the boy with binoculars was not pushed to the back). Despite all that, the book is nice, includes all lyrics and original photos from each album and some bonus photos from this era of Rush. Fair warning for purchasers though, the plastic translucent sleeves included in the set did scratch the discs for sliding I suppose, but nothing to major. Overall, if you're out on limb on whether or not to purchasing possibly a 3'rd set of Rush's catalog, if you were dissapointed with the first set of remasters, this set will satisfy your ears, cheers!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/30: I got properly listen to the Signals DVD-Audio, it is great! The 5.1 Surround Mix, however, does seem to feature different takes, Ged's voice seems to be running through a reverb and it might take a while to get used to, but overall it is a great addition to this great set of albums. It also has the Stereo version available, only sort of gripe is I wish you could view the photos WHILE listening to the album. Other than that, great set!ould view the photos WHILE listening to the album. Other than that, great set!

1591791707|5.0|Nonvioldent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg is the foundation text for those who are interested in communicating in an effective manner.  Not to give it all away - the book teaches how to use empathy to connect with others, hear and get heard and ultimately reach agreements where no one loses and everyone wins.  Yes, this is a tall order and Marshall Rosenberg delivers. I recommend this CD without reservation.

B003G4W49C|4.0|This book is actually really good -- it's just too bad that the author is notoriously and vehemently anti-gay.  I don't just mean that he doesn't like LGBT people; I mean he likes to tell outright lies in certain stories he writes.  I would just get this from the libary; no use padding his pockets so he can spread more of his hateful filth.
0307463745|4.0|Those reviewers giving the book one star are overly sensitive (?) to something ... this isn't really a hateful book that should arouse such intense negativity.  Will it solve all of your problems?  No.  Is it inspirational?  No.  Are there too many white pages and unnecessary drawings?  Yes.  There are some valid suggestions, and as one reviewer mentioned, the book suggests being unconventional.  Perhaps the \\"one star\\" people are corporate recruiters or work for advertising agencies.  The authors are merely suggesting that some of the management strategies arising during the 20th century are no longer valid.  Sometimes, you need to swim in your own stream, camp in your own woods and be creative.  I'll give the book 4 stars ... it won't radically change my life ... didn't put me to sleep.  I read this book on my new Kindle Fire ... 1st book.  I've had a Kindle for 2+ years.  I like Fire.
0545265355|5.0|Let me start by saying I was one of those who originally refused to read these books because I thought the idea was horrifying and I usually stray away from extremely popular novels that seem to resemble Twilight, but I was very mistaken.   I originally bought these for a 5 hour plane ride, but once I got off the plane I couldn't stop reading for 3 days, until I was done every book. I haven't been so captivated by a series since I tore through all the Harry Potter novels. I wont give anything away because that would ruin the story but I will just say these books are incredible. I still think about them even days later and I admit I cried many times. Some say these books are a bad influence on young adults and give the wrong message and are scary and wrong but I couldn't disagree more. Yes the theme isn't happy nor does it show good morals but it shows the real human condition, true emotions, what people do for power, and how people are affected by war and tragedy. In other words, it demonstrates real life in a unique futuristic way.  I would recommend these books to anyone over the age of 13, I guarantee you will love them and be moved by these books as much as I was.

1451648537|5.0|I thought this book was well written and gripping, about an inspired person and a fascinating life. There were many times I just gasped in awe and shock. I couldn't put it down and read it cover to cover as soon as I got it. It covered major events in his life and revealed the truth about the extremes in his personality. I'm purposely leaving out my judgement of his character. This is a review about the book, not Steve. Although, I have to say, I'm left with compassion for his tortured genius.   I highly recommend it.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|I recommend that you read my entire review, but if you don't have the time make the time (or you can scroll to the bottom and read my short sentence summaries).<br /><br />I have been a fan of Dylan's music for quite some time. I recently started to watch some of his performances from his 1966 European tour online. I later found out that those performances where featured in this DVD, So I bought it just for the footage from the 66 tour. I later realized that the footage from Dylan's 1966 tour only makes up a very small fraction of the feature presentation and I am very glad that it does because the rest of the of DVD is a very informative, interesting, and entertaining look at Bob Dylan's career. This Documentary is a must buy any person who wants to learn more about Bob Dylan and his musical career and I think it's so well made that it could easily appeal to any Person that's not a fan of bob Dylan's Music.<br />The feature presentation of this 2 disc DVD set is a three and a half hour long Documentary about Bob Dylan's career and the things that might have influenced it and the things it might have influenced. It starts off with Dylan's childhood and ends with Dylan's 1966 European tour. The documentary talks about way more than just Dylan's career. It also informs the viewer about Dylan's surrounding during this timeframe. If Dylan is talking about his childhood they will have old footage of his hometown to show you what it was like for him in the 1950s with period music to go along with it or if Dylan is talking about his time in New York, interviews and music will be used to inform you about what it was like to be in New York during time.  The documentary is filled with rare photos, film footage, and audio of all kinds that inform , entertain and get the point across in a way that none of the interviews can. You can tell that they really dug deep when finding some of these forms of media.  Many people besides Bob Dylan are interviewed and I got to admit Dylan'sinterviews are the least informative. Even if don't know who Joan Baez or Alan Ginsberg are their interviews will inform you more than and possibly entertain you more than Dylan's.<br />I can honestly say that I learned more about Dylan from other people's interviews, which I find interesting.  What really makes this a great Documentary the way that everything connects and builds upon on each other. This is also the reason that I would recommend this DVD to non-Dylan fans.  By doing this Director Martin Scorsese does a great job of informing the viewer while entertaining him as well. It's hard for me to explain but everything in this Presentation just fits together so well that it really keeps the viewer's attention. Nothing seems out of place or unnecessary.  They might show you footage of the Million man march, a still picture of Dylan, a song from an artist of the time period, and then an interview of Bob Dylan's manger within five minutes of each other and you will be able to make connections.  Dylan might say something about one of his songs, then another person does the same, and then that song is played. Things like this sound simple but when you see it happen during the documentary it teaches you something about Dylan, the time period ,or a certain event. Another thing that I really liked was the way that the interviews built upon each other with. For example Dylan might say something weird and shy away from the subject and then another person's interview would tell you what Dylan was trying not to talk about. This really amused me. Quite a bit of the Footage from Dylan's 1966 is used to begin, end, or transition between certain parts of this otherwise linear documentary. When this is done it usually contradicts whatever came before it or after it. For example a certain section might be about Dylan being praised and idolized at a particular time and then the footage from 66 comes after showing Dylan being booed and threatened by fans. It Needless to say when the Footage from 1966 is used in this way, it will want to make you keep watching just to see what caused such a change. If you're looking for a DVD filled with music you might be disappointed because while the feature pretention does included dozens of Dylan's song their all only snippets. Music is only a portion of what makes this Documentary entertaining, so there is not one song that is herd in its entirety. This Documentary uses music as more of a teaching tool than a means of entertainment which is way other artist's music also play a big part in this documentary. The only other thing that I could say about the Feature presentation of this two disc DVD set is that for what it is it is pretty much perfect for what it's trying to be. It will inform you about Bob Dylan's career and the time period while keeping you entertained. The only negative thing I can say is that I can see this documentary might be boring to some people because it is long and in certain sections it does get dry. This is not a problem for Dylan fans.<br />Now to talk about the other stuff. The box that the two DVDs come is a standard DVD case with a very unique and interesting picture on the front of Bob Dylan. Half of the main feature is on one disc while the other half is on the other. Of course things like subtitles and scene selection are included.  The main menu annoyed me a little because one of the choices listed is \\"Dylan performances\\", buts these performances are really just the snippets taken from the Documentary, so like in the main feature their not showed in their entirety. I was really happy when I found out that there is full length Dylan Performances in the Special features in disc two. There are only about 10 but there all rare and very good. The main reason I bought this DVD is for one of Bob Dylan's performances of Like Rolling Stone during his 1966 tour and it was part of the list of full performances. To be honest if this DVD had nothing but the 10 full length Dylan Performances and the Footage from the 1966 tour I would have bought it, but that would be unfair to non Dylan fans. To be honest again, I have not checked out any of their other extras, ever since I found the list of full performances. I think they had people covering Dylan's music and stuff like that, but who cares the main reason I still pop in the DVD is to watch the full performances.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />Main Feature<br />5/5 if you want a documentary that will teach you about Dylan's career than this is the perfect product or if you just want to see an entertaining documentary than this is the perfect product. It is a little boring at times but like Bob Dylan's career it will change and keep you entertained with new material.<br /><br />The DVDs<br />5/5<br />Menus and Discs fit the style of the Main feature very well. Could have used way more FULL Dylan performances in the special features, I am a Dylan Fan after all, but these DVDS are meant to inform and  entertain through multiple forms of media and the fact that they included quit a few FULL Dylan performances is just Icings n the cake.<br /><br />You might not like this product if<br />* You're not a Dylan or Documentary fan. YOU WILL BE BORED<br />* Expect this to be a plethora of Bob Dylan music and performances.  As I said before Music is only a portion of what makes this Documentary entertaining. If you want full length Dylan Performances comment and I will give you a Recommendation.

0439023521|4.0|This tale begins as a simple straightforward post-apocalyptic tale set in the far future when all trace of the USA has been lost within collective memory. Societal organization consists of a technologically advanced (slightly beyond our current capabilities) culture located within the \\"Capitol\\" with outlying Districts (1-12) serving as vassal states. Each District supplies the Capitol with raw materials and receives almost nothing in return beyond minimal subsistence. This current arrangement is the result of an earlier (75 years) mutiny that annihilated one District (#13) and resulted in an annual humiliation ritual where each District send 2 children (boy/girl) to battle to the death in the annual Hunger Games for Capitol entertainment and reinforcement of the Capitol's domination.  Our heroine is Katnis, a 16 year old girl who must \\"volunteer\\" for the games to save her younger sister's life. Katnis has grown up in a world where life is cheap, meaningless, and without purpose other than staying alive another day. As a character, she is a fascinating mix of childhood innocence with country bumpkin naivete. While skilled in some physical activities, she has had no guidance as to her capabilities and the games become an hour by hour exercise in survival. Along the way, she learns some important lessons on becoming an adult and slowly begins to recognize that the entire system is stacked against her.  At the same time, she recognizes that going from no one caring about your survival to having many people invested in your survival is meaningless when their interests are merely selfish. The basic story is one of survival on your own terms regardless of the consequences.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|Steve McQueen's \\"Le Mans\\" is considered as the BEST car movie EVER made for us the car-nuts. It can never be reproduced today unless it is all CGI, but it can't be real again... and that's why we like this movie so much. It can never have a trailer or a remake.<br /><br />Now finally, it is in Blu-ray.<br /><br />I, of course, have the VHS, the DVD version of this movie. (ha-ha... don't you have one of each, too?)<br /><br />The picture is still quite grainy at times on the stock section, and we can always make out a real scene from live, actual race than from the movie. Just by looking at the ride height of the 917s. They are Lolas T-70s, right?<br /><br />You and I know that we can count the number of words uttered by the few actors, but who needs them?<br /><br />The blue Ferrari 330 GTC is simply gorgeous.<br /><br />The real gain is in the sound department. The surround sound adds to the realism. Aren't we all addicted to those high shreiking 10,000 plus rpm engine songs? It sends chill down my spine. And to be able to hear a 917 when it raced from the rear speaker to the front? Well, that is what this Blu-ray DVD is all about.<br /><br />Other than that, your DVD should still be good enough to make you happy.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I'm not sure why some people don't like the case. I personally think it's almost perfect! It's very light, adds virtually no bulk to the Kindle Fire, the built-in wrapping cover is very handy as well as the strap.  The cover and the strap are glued, I hope they will last long enough and won't come off.  I just wish it was cheeper ($15-20) and has some kind of way to make it stand in portrait mode, not just landscape.
0393064476|3.0|Stephen Greenblatt, with the publication of his latest history lesson, \\"The Swerve, How the World Became Modern\\", has awakened one dormant desire in me...to learn Latin.  I grow tired of not being able to read the original Latin text and am forced to depend on the interpretations of others.<br /><br />Greenblatt has written a necessary and rich interpretation of how humanist  book hunters, not our first bibliophiles, existed during the dark ages and struggled to uncover that which lay dormant after the collapse of the Roman empire.  He would assert it was the discovery of these ancient texts that led to the world becoming modern...although he doesn't directly assert it...only in the sub-title and perhaps jacket text are the specifics of the assertion which mention a presumed influence on Galileo, Darwin, Freud, Einstein, and of course Thomas Jefferson.  He only devotes a few pages in the last chapter to discuss the role of Lucretius in the thinking of these paradigm shifting individuals.  The final proof is left unfortunately to the student.<br /><br />Greenblatt takes us on a tore of Italy during the 15th Century through the life of Poggio Bracciolini.  A well educated, seemingly middle class (if there were such a thing) scribe who rose through the ranks, with the help of a few mentors, to become a career bureaucrat on the Pope's staff in Rome.  During his career he was a learned humanist who cared deeply about ancient works and dedicated most of his life to their preservation.  Among other things his most celebrated discovery was that of the lost work of Lucretius, \\"On the Nature of Things\\" which he discovered while searching monasteries in Central Europe.  As he unveils some of the philosophy contained with this lost work he tries hard to depict the politics and the dangerous balance for a humanist standing on the toes of the Inquisition while trying to enlighten.<br /><br />Among other very astute observations pertaining to the \\"Nature of Things\\" Lucretius made the observation that all matter is composed of very small indivisible particles called atoms.  Atoms cannot be destroyed and are the building blocks of all matter.  \\"The Swerve\\" as it is called, is the continuous acting and reacting of these atoms to cause the destruction and creation of everything we perceive and interact with inside the tangible universe.  Quite a weighty thought today let alone 2000 years ago.  And the reason these weighty thoughts didn't drive a Renaissance of sorts at the time was because the growth of Christianity and specifically the Catholic Church systematically buried these notions.<br /><br />His attack on the Catholic Church is well trodden territory and easy pickings.  Yet he fails to properly credit the same Church, in fact he goes to great measure to distance his hero, Poggio Bracciolini from the Church, for providing him with the necessary means by which he could attend to his life long passion.  Whereas Greenblatt is not short on judgment when it comes to reporting on the moral failings of presumably pious members of the Church, he does not equally judge the moral failings of those enlightened individuals whom are merely employed by the Church.<br /><br />The astounding discovery here, is not so much that the writings of Lucretius (once rediscovered) had a direct influence on a world struggling to recover from the dark ages but rather it was the Roman empire itself that was becoming more enlightened and perhaps more so than anyone had previously imagined.  If Lucretius was but one of many dozens of poets/scholars who filled the Roman Empire with the enlightened thoughts of atomic particles and the greater pursuit of happiness, whose thoughts and writings were never recovered, how did this early enlightenment fail to survive the growth of the Christian Church?  Meaning, was it the deliberate work of the Church or the failings of this particular philosophy to catch-on.  In order for an idea to catch-on there has to be something to it,something more.  Christianity might just have been what society was searching for at the time. Just as the time was right for an enlightenment albeit 1,500 years later.<br /><br />Although Greenblatt writes well I can't help feeling I was in an undergraduate history class and must remember the lecture as given, thus interpreted, rather than as a graduate student wherein I might discover and debate the meaning as would, it appears ironically,  all the enlightened readers who gathered along the seashore, at the base of Mt Vesuvius, to debate modern philosophy 2000 years ago, were doing when they were frozen in time.<br /><br />Sure enough Greenblatt takes us back to that time yet what he tells us does little more to aid our understanding since his own thoughts are still frozen with Lucretius and have not advanced beyond the atoms and the void.een what society was searching for at the time.

B0055SWM08|3.0|The graphics are nothing special, but the music is very zen garden, which really does create a very serene experience. I find the premise odd and kind of tacked on: moving a &quot;raindrop&quot; with varying rules. Except the fact that we're playing with a raindrop doesn't mean anything. There is no mechanic effected because it's made of water. It might as well be a marble or a planet or just a circle.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|The Muppets is an excellent family film.  The plot is simple.  An evil land developer played by Chris Cooper wants to tear down the Muppet theater to drill for oil.  It is up to the Muppets to raise money and  put on a telethon talent show to save their beloved theater.  The problem is that all the Muppets have gone their separate ways.  Jason Segal and Amy Adams star as Gary and Mary.  They play boyfriend and girlfriend.  They have great chemistry on the big screen.  I really believe these two people are in love.  Gary's brother is a new Muppet named Walter.  He has a talent for whistling  that he shows in one of the most uplifting scenes of the film.  There is a lot of humor in this movie.  It  comes from the other Muppet favorites like Fozzie Bear and Animal, but all of the Muppets shine in this movie about team work.  Every Muppet movie has celebrity cameos.  This movie has cameos from Neil Patrick Harris, Jack Black and Selena Gomez.  One of the fun things about this movie is trying to see how many celebrities I could recognize.<br /><br />  The music is the strongest aspect of the movie. The film contains the songs \\"Me and Julio Down By The Schoolyard\\"  and \\"We Built This City\\". I love these songs from my childhood.  This film also includes the new tune \\"Life's A Happy Song\\".  The movie also contains the classic Muppet show theme and my favorite tune \\"The Rainbow Connection\\".  This song was featured in the original Muppet movie in 1979.  The hopeful spirit of this  song will always move me.  The Muppets is one of the best family films of the year.
B005NS0VNU|3.0|WTF? Once again a compilation that omits one of their greatest most atmospheric songs, Drive. The same thing goes for Bang And Blame. And they include utter garbage like Stand and Leaving New York...and even worse, Shiny Happy People? Love the two new songs We All Go Back To Where We Belong and Hallelujah, though! I rate this collection 3.5 stars! Not the classic it should've been.
1451648537|5.0|My thoughts - a powerful, yet not entirely flattering biography, of a charismatic, temperamental, narcissistic genius who was driven by perfectionism. (You may wish to skim this review if you plan on reading this book).<br /><br />Steve Jobs, a man who will not be easily forgotten, passed away on October 5, 2011 at the age of 56.  In 2009, knowing he was dying, he got Walter Isaacson to agree to write a book about his life. Over the course of the next two difficult years of Job's illness, Isaacson conducted over 40 interviews with him, his friends, family and former coworkers.<br /><br />Jobs grew up in Mountainview, CA, outside of Palo Alto, the adopted son of Paul and Clara Jobs. His biological parents --grad students, a Syrian father and American mother,  he referred to as his \\"sperm and egg bank\\". Even when he later found out who his real parents were, he always referred to his adoptive parents as his \\"real\\" parents. However, it appears apparent from reading this book, that being abandoned by his biological parents was a real issue for Job's throughout his life, and it affected the way he treated people as an adult.<br /><br />As a young boy, early on Job's realized he was brighter than his parents. This made him feel more detached. In fact in the 4th grade he tested at a 10th grade level.  Bored with school, he was also somewhat socially awkward and was often bullied at school.  He demanded that he be sent to another school or that he would stop going to school, so his parents moved to a better neighborhood. It was here where Jobs began tinkering with electronics in his garage. This is where is all begin in 1976 for Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak. The two were both loners and \\"music geeks\\" introduced by a friend. Jobs experimented with pot, hash, and LSD and embraced the hippie lifestyle.  The only college that Jobs had any interest in attending was Reed College in Portland, Oregon. It was at Reed that Jobs became interested in Buddhism, attended a Hare Krishna Temple,and became obsessive about dieting and vegetarianism. He was on a personal unending search for enlightenment, which he never quite seemed to find. Jobs dropped out of Reed College to travel around India on a spiritual journey.<br /><br />Job's biography covers his 30+ year career which includes not only the start up operation of Apple Computer out his garage, but also his involvement at Atari, Pixar and NeXT. Just four years after Apple's start up, the company went public and was worth 1.79 billion dollars. By the age of 25 Jobs was worth 256 million dollars and made 300 other people millionaires in the process.  In 2011 Apple is a 40 billion dollar Company. Yet despite his wealth Jobs was a minimalist, believing that in home and in business, \\"simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\\".<br /><br />Job's opinion of himself was that \\"he was special\\". He had the uncanny ability to read people and to know exactly what their weak points were.  He used that to his advantage, and created a fear factor in those who worked for him. He was eager to put people down, often in front of others, and wasn't afraid to tell those who worked for him that their ideas were dumb. His prickly behavior caused a high burnout in staff, and because of his high expectations his goal in hiring was to find creative, super-smart people who had a rebellious spirit.<br /><br />He was a genius in business,  but not so much in his personal life. His biography covers his tumultuous relationship with daughter Lisa who he fathered out of wedlock in 1978, to his marriage in 1991 to Laureen Powell and the birth of his first child that same year, who for the first two weeks of his life was known simply as \\"baby boy Jobs\\".  In 1995 and 1998 two more children, daughters were born to Steve and Laureen.  His was described as aloof to his daughters and often \\"prickly\\" to his wife, thus by no means an easy man to live with.<br /><br />His illness,was first diagnosed in October of 2003, with what was believed to be, a curable form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs decided against surgery despite the urging of his doctors and those closest to him. Instead he chose to try some radical diets and fastings in the hope they would cleanse his body of cancer. His was obsessed with body image and did not want to have a surgery he believed might not be entirely necessary. The nine month wait caused his cancer to spread, and his health and quality of life would deteriorate as well, ending with his death on October 5, 2011.<br /><br />Steve Jobs is a fascinating read about a complicated and extremely fascinating man. As prickly as this man could be at times, there are a few paragraphs that were able to bring me to tears.  Apparently, according to Jobs, much of your thinking is changed in the face of death, and suddenly you no longer worry about \\"having something to lose.\\"<br /><br />A highly recommended read.surgery despite the urging of his doctors and those closest to him.

0452289963|5.0|Does this book *really* need another review? I think 1630 reviews are enough to get the point across, but I'd feel remiss if I didn't add my two cents. This book really is vital to finding your own inner peace. The premise is simple, \\"be present.\\" That's it! That's all it takes, yet it can be one of the hardest things in the world to do. The author describes in detail how being present in every situation will bring you to a state of peace, every time.   The best thing about this book is that it actually works. Think about it, how much time during the day do you spend being angry about the past or worrying about the future? Now imagine using that time instead to appreciate and live in the moment! No more worrying - you would just *deal* with situations as they arise, and then move on. No more replaying in your mind all the times you've been wronged. No more victim mentality. No more fears about the future. All those negative feelings will be replaced with inner peace which will then lead to more peaceful existence all around. Follow this practice and you can't lose!
031250926X|5.0|As a teacher of toddlers and preschoolers, I have been familiar with the Brown Bear book for a long time.  But this version with the sliding doors renders the book much more fun and interactive for the little ones.  I also love the quality of this board book.  I would highly recommend it.
1878424319|5.0|This book is an excellent addition to my self-improvement book collection. All four agreements are helpful, but for me the two most vital are:   1. Don't take anything personally  2. Don't make assumptions.   By following those two agreements I have changed the way I interact with people. I no longer take offense if someone treats me poorly. I don't wallow in self-pity wondering what I did wrong. I simply acknowledge that something else must be going on with them. It helps me have compassion for them instead of anger. It helps me move on instead of staying stuck focused on THEM. I believe this is one of the most important books someone can read.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|My 16 year old son bought this DVD for me for my birthday... one of the things you should know is my son has never ever bought me a birthday present before, but he has been watching me, watching the David Tennant Series since I bought my first one last winter.  And he occasionally turns to look at the TV when I'm watching them.  So here, after watching me watching all of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th seasons, I am rewarded with a Fifth Season DVD that features the new Doctor: Matt Smith.  And I'm wondering, how can he top David Tennant?  The first episode overcame my doubts within the first few minutes as he was getting over his regeneration by eating custard and fish fingers in a little red haired Scottish girl's kitchen.  There are the scary episodes and then there are the classic funny episodes (The Lodger), just like the brilliant writing staff I have come to expect from all previous Doctor Who episodes.  All brilliantly written.  Most people don't seem to get this and I think I know why: I was recently told that I must have ADD... of course I was told this by someone else who has ADD and has two successful sons with ADD - and it is my perception that if you have that many people with a disorder - it is no longer a disorder.  But I will go one better.  I'm actually OCD.  And because I am OCD I am only truly impressed by other people who are also OCD, the rest of the populace is too damn pedestrian.  Hence my appreciation of Robert Downey Jr in his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes - a 19th Century hero with OCD.  And I am here to tell you, no one plays Doctor Who better than people who portray him as OCD.  There's one episode in fact where he pointedly tells other people that he's already moved on to another topic and he left them behind.  Matt Smith is fabulous as the eccentric, non-violent, temporally knowledgeable Last of the Time Lords.  His execution, his appreciation of the simple and the bizarre, his overt care for human kind - All Classic Who.  I just finished the Fifth Season DVD and I am already hoping for the Sixth Season.  I can't wait to see some of the episode elements I have watched on YouTube (Spoilers - Love it!).  Remember: Bow Ties are Cool.
B005JLN9ZI|2.0|Always wondered what the Drake hype was all about. And after listening to Take Care multiple times on a long roadtrip, I am as confused as ever. Maybe this album doesn't serve as the best introduction to his music, maybe he has some killer tracks and clever rhymes on his first record. I don't know, but I can tell you that Take Care is a mundane, slow, lumbering work that drags on with little enthusiasm or energy.   Maybe I'm just sick of modern rappers thinking that people want to listen to them brag about their money, fame, and their 'flow', but I found nothing interesting in terms of lyrical content or song concepts on this album. And some of the choruses are just plain painful to listen to...'Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so proud of you' I mean really?  On top of his slow beats and unispired flow, he also tries to sing which is a terrible mistake in my opinion. The guy has no range and just kind of quietly tries to hit notes that he should just stay away from. There are a couple songs that have an interesting flow and unique song structure, but overall this is a boring album. I guess being born in Canada and acting in a teeny bopper show like Degrassi doesn't leave you with many interesting stories to tell. I'd much rather hear Pac tell stories of suviving the ghetto than listen to Drake whine about some women in his life. My girlfriend seems to like this though.
B005FUTBWS|1.0|Come on, really!  This was really bad even for a low budget movie.  The theme of the movie was to kill sinners in the name of the Bible.  Really!  But beyond the perverted theme, this movie was bad.  This may be the first Blu-ray DVD I ever break.
B0068TJLSY|3.0|Expected alot more plot to it. The children actors were amazing for them to act like kids and not scripting it. Truly wasn't what I expected from the trailers and waiting for it to be released after the theaters. Only good acting, kept me from not ending the movie.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|C'mon people! First and foremost, Lucas is a businessman. You are foolish if you think that he or his people made these content changes and omissions because of incompetence and/or artisic arrogance. Would it be way off to suggest that maybe he wants his hyper-loyal fans to come back to see the un-abused original versions in the theatres until the Iranians finally blow us all to bits? So please, stop complaining about an 'unfair' but simple Lucas marketing strategy. As for the ad nausium detailed list of complaints about this set posted here, you are precisely the people who will pay to see the originals again and again, whether it be in the theatres or by pay-per-view which via most providers is not content that can be copied, even to a DVR. Do the math on this just at the current movie ticket, drink and popcorn prices for a family of 4, and you can see that George does not want the people who truly value the art in the orignals sitting on their butts enjoying his tri-trilogy at home for a mere $89.99. And by the way, technically, just the video cleanup they did on the original 1977 segment is quite commendable. Maybe we should take what we can from this set for now, as we know that we will be lining his pockets again when the originals become available again outside of this media.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a wonderful book! I really loved this story - finally something from the dog's point of view.  I read this book well over a year ago, but I still remember the depth of emotion that this story brought out in me. This family went through so much in the short space of time that this book covers.  Mr. Stein took me from a wonderful, loving place into confusion, pain, anger, loneliness and heartbreak.  I read through tears and I shouted at the characters as I read, getting frustrated that I couldn't change what was happening.  I took it all very personally and was really deeply involved in the story.  That is my hallmark of a good book.  When I finish a book and give it to family members to read so that I have someone to discuss it with, means that it's a very good book in my jargon.  This book involved several of my family members and several discussions.  I really loved that Mr. Stein wrote it from the dog's point of view, it's about time that these wonderful creatures are seen as the very real and loving family members that they are.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Stein!! Really wonderful, and I loved the spirituality of the ending very much, ending it any other way would have damaged my view of \\"the Higher Powers\\".

B005LRWRZ8|2.0|I have been a Megadeth fan for about 20 years and own almost all of their albums.  This one is boring.  Not one good song on it.  I have enjoyed some of the more recent albums, but can't say anything nice about this one.  Only gets 2 stars because of the history.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|loaded fine on my kindle fire. highly recommend doing the &quot;classical mode&quot;tutorial as some of the features are not completely intuitive. however, once I figured how to use the app, it is quite pleasant. looking forward to playing it more! good app for a decent price. much better than some apps on the market!
B0030Y11O2|1.0|If you like Michael Moore, you will like this movie. He follows the same formula as Bowling for Columbine, Fahrenheit 911, etc, etc, etc. His ability to take 25% of a story and turn it into a full-blown 'documentary' is definitely an art. The irony of the film is not lost on some of his viewers; Mr. Moore is a multimillionaire who reaps the rewards of America's semi-capitalist society. What he deems Capitalism in this film is more cronyism and the unintended consequences of government meddling than anything. Capitalism ceases to exist when the government intercedes. If you want to be manipulated and get fired up about something based on a movie from a director who would seem to promote socialism (while at the same time using non-union labor for his film production), then this is the movie for you.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|I agree with everyone else on this horrible service, I've noticed there is at least one other movie out there with the same stupid digital download. I believe it's the new Harry Potter movie. I don't like when I pay for something and then having the need  to create multiple accounts for a service I actually refuse to use. I already have more online accounts than I need and have zero interest in signing up for a random service that might only be around for a short period of time. I really hope  Flixster/Ultraviolet dies a quick death.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Seldom do you come across a script as flawless as this. The Dark Knight has received more praise than this film, and it is totally undeserved. There are only a few films out there that are written and directed as well as Batman Begins.
B004EPYZTE|1.0|Not a fan of unnecessary violence and blood. The acting is mediocre and the special effects are kept to a minimum.  Pretty much sat and waited for the movie to end. Thank god it was a short movie.  I rent movies from Netflix before I buy since 3D Blu-rays can be more expensive.   For some reason Hollywood seems to think that a better image, sound, or 3D make up for bad writing/acting...they don't.  Also, don't buy the first edition of anything, there is always an \\"Extended\\", \\"Super\\", \\"Ultimate\\", \\"Collectors\\" version of whatever movie at some point. I used to do it but I'm sick of the double, triple dipping...hear me Disney and your \\"Ultimate\\", \\"Platinum\\", \\"Gold\\", \\"Silver\\", \\"Special Anniversary\\" 3D, DVD , Blu-ray versions of all of your movies. I will no longer buy anything from any distributor until it's been out for at least a year. Even then I will buy one version of your movie and no more.   Oh, and Flixster.com/UltraViolet  sucks! If you see a movie with a digital UltraViolet copy don't buy it. If you give me a digital version of a movie, don't make visit a new site or make me register for a new service. I already have one and don't care about all of the other services. It's also not a real digital copy as much as streaming service so if you're not on a wifi connection you can't view your movie.
031617615X|1.0|I've never been a big Twilight fan. I did see the first movie and thought it was ok, it wasn't my cup of tea but for a movie aimed at young teenage girls it was ok. Now Breaking Dawn comes out. A friend told me what happens in it and I was dumbfounded and looked up the story more on the internet.   Edward's sperm remains intact for over 100 years and is able to get Bella pregnant?????? What????? What was Stephanie Meyer smoking when she came up with this idea? It's very imaginitive, I'll give her that.   Edward knows that if he got the lovely Bella pregnant that their baby would be a blood sucking, dangerous mutant and yet they have such hot, wild sex on the wedding night that they break the bed and the pillows WITHOUT any birth control and surprise, surprise she ends up pregnant!!?????   I just about threw up when I heard that Edward took his fangs to Bella's belly and performed a C-section?????? Again, what is this garbage???? You didn't have a knife or even another sharp object around the house??? Why didn't they get Jacob to come over, in his werewolf state. He could have used his claw to slice open her belly.   The part that really got me, as if the rest wasn't bad enough? They have the mutant baby, it's a girl and the beautiful love story is born of Jacob and Edward and Bella's daughter and Edward calling him son??? What the hell is this?????? This is very sick and disturbing. Jacob is in love with Bella. He can't have her, he never will so he has the next best thing, her daughter. He can't screw Bella but if he plays his cards right with the mutant child and Edward and Bella, he'll be able to get into the daughter's pants and have her for his own. And the heros of our story, Edward and Bella are happy about this??? You have got to be kidding. Unbelievable. It's a peodophile's wet dream. You can imagine Jacob counting the days until he can have intercourse with this kid. Grooming her for that and all the rest of it. Disgusting. And this is a book for young girls and teenage girls, touted as the Gone With The Wind of this century. I've lived a long time and it takes a lot to shock me but congratulations, MS Meyers, you've done it.   I don't know what Stephanie Meyers was taking while she wrote this piece of disgusting garbage but the lady needs serious mental help. Unbelievable.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|I listened to this cd in a car, and, although I liked it, I wasn't blown away....but as the hours passed and I reached my destination, I got to thinking about it. Some of the songs simply haunted me in their own quiet way. And when the day was done, and I laid in my bed with my headphones on...I took Kate's journey again...<br /><br />And I love it. 50 Words For Snow is in it's own world. The closest of Kate's previous recordings that sound similar might be \\"And dream of Sheep\\" and \\"Under ice\\" from the Hounds Of Love cd.<br /><br />But 50 Words For Snow is in it's own world. This is pure Kate. She has spun a masterful recording, full of thought and intelligence, and just simply beautiful in it's own strange way. Three of the songs are really not to my personal liking, but it does not mean they aren't good, if not great, songs, it's just, at this point, they aren't my favorites. But that may change as time goes on. Kate really put forth her all on this recording, and it shows! Bravo!<br /><br />I am not crazy for the songs \\"Wildman\\", \\"Misty\\",or \\"Lake Tahoe\\". They are great songs, but as I stated, they just aren't to my liking. It's like someone you love, you love that person with all your heart, there just maybe a few things about that person you aren't crazy about. To me \\"Wildman\\" is just not interesting enough for me. \\"Misty\\" and \\"Lake Tahoe\\" just don't have the punch the rest of the cd has and I have a little trouble remembering the tunes. But it doesn't mean I won't grow to love them too as time goes on. That's the magic of Kate...some of her songs take time to root and grow.<br /><br />\\"Snowflake\\" is just quietly amazing. The concept of a snowflake being aware of it's fall to earth is genius. And Kate and her son presenting the song together is perfect. Bertie has a wonderful voice, and fits in perfectly in Kate's quiet, snowy world.<br /><br />\\"Snowed In at Wheeler Street\\" is a haunting spirit love song with Elton John. Another concept piece, that with both Kate and Elton's expert delivery, pull you into the song. It makes you think outside the box. Kate has done it again...taken the listener to a different frame of mind, into a haunting soul mate song.<br /><br />\\"50 Words For Snow\\" has not fared well with some listeners, but this is the song that caught my ear the first listen, and has helped ease me into the rest of the cd. Kate counts as a \\"Joe\\" says 50 different terms for snow. It sounds wonderful, with subtle guitar, the vocals are fitting, and it moves along nicely, like when snow first hits the pavement and is pushed along in swirls by the wind. It doesn't come out and smack you in the face like a blizzard, but the song \\"snows\\" like a the quiet of a gentle snowstorm. Like when you see it snowing, and you go out into your yard, and look up, and the air is silent, and the flakes tumble down.<br /><br />\\"Among Angles\\" closes this amazing cd in quiet, piano and voice. It is just beautiful, like ice on the trees, and the sun shining through.<br /><br />Yes, Kate's world has changed, and the change is even deeper, and more beautiful Kate.e song.

B005QI4TP8|5.0|The sophomore offering by Florence Welch and mates are a testament of the band's maturity over just two years since Lungs. While Lungs was grand and cosmic, Ceremonials is darker, mature and definitely soaring. There are many references to religion, beautifully written and performed hauntingly by Florence. Once she sings, one's emotions fluctuate as she delivers each song wholeheartedly. I especially like Never Let Me Go, a song about dying and how it liberates. Shake It Out is an intense song about leaving your emotional baggages behind and movin' on. Then there's the opener Only If For A Night, Heartlines, Spectrum, All This and Heaven and What The Water Gave Me. Every song on the album speaks for itself. The bonus track, Remain Nameless, sounds almost like across between Bjork and Depeche Mode until Florence adds her stirring touch. A strong contender for the album of the year.
B000022TSY|5.0|A classic movie with a classic story.  I've seen it many time and just decieded to buy so I can watch it when I want.  If you're a youngster, you need to do a little history lesson to understand it.

B0002JJBZE|4.0|My VCR died and I'm replacing the tapes I had recorded off broadcast TV.  It's good to see these old shows again, sharp and clear and uncut.
B005KAJPY2|5.0|I was truly surprised by VNV's latest offering because I had thought that they were burnt out of any new ideas but thankfully I was proven wrong. Personally this is the sound & album that I've been waiting for. Just when I thought I was losing my faith & any real interest in electronic music, \\"Automatic\\" comes along to give me just the right shot in the arm. With \\"Automatic\\" Ronan Harris & Mark Jackson prove once more to be a formidable duo in the realm of heavy hitting & anthemic electronic landscapes. With a much more refined & accomplished album than 2007's lukewarm \\"Judgement\\" & the equally cliche \\"Of Faith, Power, & Glory\\" record in 2009, this is they're best since \\"Matter + Form\\". From start to finish this is an excellent album that brings VNV Nation back into the forefront & that deserves as much commercial success as it can attain. It's good to have them back.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I found this to be well written, enthralling, and very unpredictable!  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  It was fascinating to read about this period in American history with an eye not only to the injustice against black slaves, but also the lesser discussed indentured servitude experienced, particularly by the Irish in America.  Well worth the read!
0307593312|5.0|A lot happens in this book and not everything makes sense, it's not supposed to. This story is designed to make you question what is happening in the story from a variety of angles and think about the nature of reality and our role in it. Sometimes you need a book to challenge you. This book does that and gives you a fantastic, readable story at the same time. Highly recommend.
0515142247|2.0|I figured I'd read the whole series of these books. I started with The Killing Floor, which I found hard to put down at times; engaging, mysterious, violent, fun, etc.  Then I bought Die Trying.  It's almost as if you can sense the author, Lee Child, was trying to meet the quality of the first book and experiencing the sophomore jinx.  Die Trying is still a fun read, but I found myself saying \\"why wouldn't Jack Reacher just do this instead?  or \\"there's no way that would happen...\\" etc. way too often.    And some of the descriptions were just too long.  It's interesting to hear how a bullet travels or how a helicopter has certain features, but it was just too much.  By the end of the book, I was feeling Child could have cut about 150 pages or more and not lost any of the story.  Also, the plot didn't capture my imagination nearly as much as the first novel.  If you want to experience the whole series, go ahead and read this one.  If you are looking for something like the Killing Floor, move on to another Reacher book.  Unfortunately, I can't make any suggestions yet; I'm just ordering #3, Tripwire.
0143112724|5.0|This little book packs a big punch. (The illustrations were unnecessary, but anyway.) We often use flowery and befuddling language without even realising it. How right Strunk and White are in asking you to strip away the veneer of adverbs and expressions like \\"the fact that\\", \\"the story is a strange one\\", and plenty more.
B005QBKXSC|5.0|I was suprised by consistency of this album. Very well thought out and catchy songs. Love it. I agree with the other reviewers, 'Daughtry doing what he does best'. Keep them coming! ***Highly Recommmended***
B005PTQPU0|4.0|After reading some of the reviews for Kate Bush's newest opus, it's interesting to hear how her latest release has caused such a polarization of opinions.  Some think it's her best work since Hounds of Love.  Others think it's the most boring and tedious recording of her music career.  I admit upon first listening, the arrangements came across as repetitive and very meandering.  By the third listen I was hooked.  I haven't listened to music like this since Jane Siberry's releases, The Walking and When I Was A Boy.  But Kate sounds nothing like Jane Siberry and vice versa.  The only comparison between them is that this time Kate is creating long, expansive mood pieces, done very simply in execution.  This is a recording that will not appeal to certain listeners, but that's the way it's been for Kate since the beginning of her music career. People forget the harsh criticism she received for her most experimental albums The Dreaming and yes, even Hounds of Love.  I heard some people say her music gave them nightmares.  Now she is creating softer subdued arrangements that recall her earliest work from The Kick Inside. Listeners are still complaining.  Even her most accessible work The Red Shoes, got flak for being too commercial (if that's possible for Kate). Since the Sensual World in 1989, she has been working in a more laid back atmosphere.  All artists mellow with age at some point,\\"hello Sting\\", but it doesn't make their work any less valid.  Highlights for me from 50 Words for Snow include Lake Tahoe, with the male soprano vocalists creating a haunting and dreamy backdrop to Kate's soft vocals, telling the tale of a dead woman's spirit rising from a lake.  The eerie and mystifying Wild Man, with the almost East Indian sounding keyboard washes, telling the story of the abominable snowman hiding from the rest of the world.  Say what you want about Kate's duet with Sir Elton, I'm glad to finally hear them together on Snowed in at Wheeler St playing lovers who are unable to be together over the passage of centuries.  I heard Elton didn't even know what the song was like when he went in to do his vocal, but trusted Kate.  And for those of you who thought Kate shouldn't have redone her songs, This Woman's Work and Moments of Pleasure from Director's Cut, she brings back the pristineness to her voice on the closing, spine tingling number, Among Angels.  If you don't want to follow Kate on her musical journeys, then don't.  If you want to hear something unique and definitely for listening on the headphones of your best stereo system, then this is the place to be. Kate will always challenge her listeners, and sometimes the best recordings are the ones that take time to absorb to be understood.  I find most commercial, manufactured pop albums end up quickly being disposed of at the thrift stores, while their listeners move on to the latest fad.

B003K025V4|3.0|Ok OK I did not like the cover and how Miley has 'grown up' and started to show a strong 'sexy' side to herself with her raunchy dancing on stage and scandals etc. I used to like Miley before she 'grew up' because I did not like how she 'sexed herself up' so to speak and also seems to have become quite vulgar and full of herself, maybe fame got to her head?<br /><br />But I tried not to be too judgemental on this album without listening. I had a listen through and the tracks aren't too bad at all, just a lot of auto-tuning or whatever electronic effect they added to her voice.<br /><br /> My only concern was the lead track 'Can't be Tamed', which makes Miley sound completely full of herself, bratty and like is she practically queen of the world and gets whatever she wants. The video for it is worse as it's more sexualised. Same with the video to 'Who Owns My Heart' it's worse than the actual song as she lays seductively on a bed..etc. If Miley wants to go this pathway to sell albums, then that's OK, It's just a concern what messages she is sending out in her videos and lyrics to children or just kids who like her. I wouldn't mind so much if she was always like this with her image and music, but she was a Disney star and was on a show that was innocent and gave her the image she had originally as a 'innocent' child star, she can't escape that. I don't think you have to be 'sexy' to appear more mature either. I know her fans won't be kids forever, but I don't think now is the right time for her to have this image as she is still young, she is only 18 right now. She was 17 I think when this came out!<br /><br />Oh well, it's her business, just really disappointed in her!
B006ANJ4BW|4.0|Okay, look, with a heady dose of \\"your mileage may vary\\" allow me to net it out as I see it.  First off, some history and background.  Comparisons to the 1982 Ahnold version are pointless. That movie was terrible on countless levels and only survives for its sheer audacious camp and silliness. It is to the Conan mythos what the Adam West series is to Batman. Before everyone gets their knickers in a bunch, I've watched it many times and enjoyed it for what it is (I like Adam West as Batman too), but holding it up as an example of anything other than Frazzetta-inspired schlock is misguided. It's a \\"classic\\" in that it captures a moment in cinematic history, but then so is \\"Heavy Metal\\" which is also fun in the right frame of mind but terribly flawed by any rational standard.  Next, let's face it, the original works, while they had a flare and flavor, were not exactly classics of literature either. Conan is rough, brutal, reaver who seizes control of a failing kingdom and struggles to become a ruler instead of a robber. That story line would be far more interesting to watch and would actually require some character development, something both movies pretty much ignore. The source material is not King Lear, and for the most part it's not even Spider Man, so reverence for the flawed canon is in my opinion misplaced.  Now, for the movie itself, I thought it captured the character of Conan and the world of Hyborea spot on. Jason Momoa nails the roguish, clever, but brutal Conan much better than Arnold's brooding, unintelligible barbarian. However, I think top honors go to the boy who plays the young Conan in the egg race, a scene which sums up the random brutality of Hyborea and establishes Conan's character. From the egg-spitting scene on in, it's a fun ride but it's standard sword and sorcery farce and a downhill slide. More Ron Perlman, I say.  All in all, by the time you decide to sit down and watch a movie called \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" you've signed up for a flashy piece of pseudo-medieval eye candy with flashing swords and shallow characters. The 2011 version delivers in spades, with far less dead time than the 1982 version (e.g: I get it, the wheel makes him strong, but how long do we need to watch him walk in a circle to make a point...) If you though the version with Arnold was a brilliant adaptation of the source material, you'll hate this one. If you're looking for a modern brilliant interpretation of the relatively shallow canon, this is not it either. For action-packed, testosterone-laden escapism with large amounts of sharpened steel and even larger amounts of well-toned exposed flesh, this version serves up what it promises and should be judged on its own merits.
B0034JKZ86|1.0|Upon seeing this film I thought it was terrible. The 'Prince' has a horrible character, so full of himself and not at all likable. Then he ends up with the girl?! Why are they doing that in Disney films these days? Making full of it guys get with the lead girl. Tianna should have ended up with a really caring guy, not this vain guy. That is not the Disney I know. The voodoo also really disappointed me as well. I thought it was quite frightening for a kids movie, or what is targeted at kids even though adults watch it

B005KELR3A|2.0|I've have purchased 3 Belkin Kindle covers for older model kindles, since I really liked the others, I thought this would be a good choice as well. I was wrong.  Compared to previous versions the neoprene is very thin and it doesn't provide nearly as much protection as before. Buy something else.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|As the owner of the both the clear version and the black version of this case, I'd have to say that the clear one is better due to the complete protection in the back. The black version has a hole where the Apple logo is, presumably to help users show off the brand, but the clear version does the same thing without exposing the logo to scratches. The clear case does have circled patterns in the back, which might not be to everyone's taste, but protection-wise it is one of the better cases I've used.  Also included is a screen protector for the front and a small cloth to wipe the screen.  Obviously, I would not recommend dropping the phone even with the case on from a great height. The case is really made for accidental drops from chest-to-ground or waist-to-ground distance. Please don't experiment.
B002N5N5LG|3.0|Having just watched all of the first season of COMMUNITY, I thought I would jot off a quick review, that I think would have been very helpful to myself before purchasing this series.<br /><br />I was swayed by the reviews which unfortunately had this being the best thing in the universe, with little to no moderating reviews. Having watched the series, I have to say while not horrible, I did have some problems, and in the scheme of things find myself far closer to the 2 star grades than the 5.<br /><br />The show is not horrible. It has its moments, at times it's brilliant, one of the standout episodes being PAINTBALL.<br /><br />And the cast has talented character actors, that could be interesting characters. Unfortunately by the time you get halfway through the season writer/creator Dan Harmon, has fallen into the rut of not developing most of the characters beyond stereotypes.<br /><br />While I think he's trying to do something interesting with some of the characters, most notably the character of Abed played by Danny Pudi, who I think is great (Though I understand how Arabs may not really dig the idea of an Indian playing an Arab. Not an isolated incident in Hollywood). Unfortunately for every Abed it seems you also have to get a Troy.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like Donald Glover, but I think the character of Troy falls back into the happy medium of White writer writing weak or flawed or sexless or emasculated or non-threathening Black Male characters. You see that a lot in television, and hell going back to vaudville, writers working out their issues of fear and race through \\"humor\\"/ridicule. But god we've seen that same tune sung so often, that it is a glaring, and boring, and uninteresting stereotype. I would rather a writer not have Black characters in the show, rather than drag the characters into the show to do his version of Step and fetchit. To bring characters of color in, only to break them down. Be it Buffy, or Smallville or the first season ofthe new Dr. Who, etc.<br /><br />And the craziest thing is these writers think they are being edgy, and cutting edge, and original, and liberal, when what they are being is very predictable, very 1920s, very tired, and very bigoted. Note to Dan Harmon... tokenism... it is just what it sounds like.<br /><br />The dumb over-compensating funny Black jock was just about passable the first half of the year, because at the very least you had the romantic subplot that gave you a hint there could be more there. But by the end of the season you have the dumb-over compensating funny Black Jock eunuch, which is oddly enough also a reoccurring Hollywood staple.<br /><br />Nice one, Dan. Didn't see that coming.<br /><br />It's just tired, tired writing.<br /><br />I mean, and this is not to fault the actors, they do the best in the horrible stereotypes they are given to work in, and it's a testament to their skill that I like them, despite the limitations. But I'm nagged incessantly by the fact that I would like them a lot more if they were more than their foibles. I would like them a lot more if they had contrasting cool Black characters to play off of. It would be great the day Black characters can be represented by their \\"Peirce\\" but also have their \\"Jeff\\". Or have their  \\"Shirley\\" but also have their \\"Britta\\". Have the same diversity of quirky and cool characters that White actors get.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's what tokenism does, it gives only a narrow view, to a broad people. And usually it's the worst, most dismissive, most denigrating view possible. Which listening to Dan Harmon in the commentaries he comes across as more than a bit dismissive and denigrating.<br /><br />All in all, by the end, I felt the show does a disservice to Harmon to write it, and it does a disservice to Glover to perform it. Add to this the character of Shirley (My God, is that a call back to \\"what's happening?\\"!!) the sassy, but matronly, Black woman. My God we haven't seen that a thousand times. Black women seemingly to White writers in Hollywood, can only be perceived as Hors (ala Halle Berry) or as sassy, bossy matrons, but nothing in between.<br /><br />Good, one Dan. Way to be original.<br /><br />Let's try something new. How about something crazy, Black guy gets the girl. The hot Black, smart girl. Or the Hot White, smart girl. Wow, imagine that. Oh, wait... that would mean moving out of the 1920s.<br /><br />So yeah by the end of the season, the blatant stereotyping, took away from what I thought was otherwise an interesting show.<br /><br />I mean at the price it currently is of like $12 for the entire season, it's worth getting if only to see the paintball episode. Then sell the thing when done. You'll make out far cheaper than renting. But just realize, you're going to see something perhaps a little more flawed than Amazon reviews lets on. Grade: C+.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games, the first in the trilogy, is a super engaging novel. I picked it up as part of my ongoing commitment to read and share as many books from the list of frequently challenged books as possible for Banned Books Week. This book is one that not only did I finish quickly and wanted more, but shared with my teenagers. It's a great selection for reluctant readers as well, because it is packed with action from cover to cover, with no dry or dull spells at all. This thought provoking book is exciting and a great read on the surface, but if you care to look deeper there is impressive social commentary that is at once apt and frightning.  You will never look at reality TV (i.e. Survivor) the same way again. As a teacher, reader and parent, I highly recommend this book for anyone 10 and older.

0446563048|1.0|I got a copy of Delivering Happiness from a friend (and former Zappos employee). As another reviewer mentioned, this book is designed to be handed out free to employees to spread the corporate mythology. Many companies have them. With the exception of making the workplace fun, (which is not exactly novel and rather superficial), I don't find the ideas here to be conducive to employee happiness at all, but on the contrary, destructive. Money-driven charismatic leaders such as Tony Hsieh are not the source for delivering happiness.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|Definitely not a sequel in the conventional sense of the term and not quite a prequel either (since not all of the action in this film takes place before the action in \\"Paranormal Activity\\"), \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" is kind of a co-quel to the original. The story here focuses on Kristi and Daniel, a married couple who with a newborn baby, Hunter, and Daniel's daughter from another marriage, Ali. The link between this film and the first does not become apparent until Kristi's sister Katie and her husband Micah (the main characters from the first film) arrive for a visit. When Micah first appears, a graphic on the screen informs us that we are seeing him 60 days before his death--and the puzzle pieces begin coming together. Since there's a small child and a dog involved in this story, the terror potential is a bit higher than it was in the first film, but it seems to take an unbearably long time (and a seemingly infinite number of surveillance camera shots--of the same household scenes) before anything happens. The home video/documentary style narrative still works and affords us just enough information to co-construct the narrative, but this film delivers fewer spine-tingling and genuinely creepy moments than the original. When the action does happen, it is abrupt. And even though this film fills in some of the gaps in the original narrative by providing some additional information about the demonic power that's terrorizing Katie and Kristi and their families, it also ends with a scene that appends some information to the conclusion of the original and ultimately points the way to the third film in the series. Despite some inevitable disappointment, fans of the original will probably enjoy this one as well--but not as much.

B002ZG98FU|4.0|This movie was surprisingly good. Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford have a surprisingly good chemistry on screen. Ford is awesome as the crotchety old reporter. The story of how he finds meaning in his job is heartwarming and funny. The denouement is both natural and one of the better endings I've seen in a romantic comedy in a while. For whatever reason, Diane Keaton's role is overshadowed and she isn't utilized well. That's too bad, but Harrison Ford does a good job carrying the film.

1612680003|1.0|Thank you to all the other people who wrote reviews here, because at least you had the strength to finish this garbage book.  I am stunned and terrified that so many of my fellow readers and Amazon reviewers actually wrote positive things about \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad.\\" Can they be serious?  My biggest problem is that Kiyosaki writes dialog between a fictional \\"rich dad\\" and Kiyosaki himself as a 9-year-old that is clearly made-up. NO nine-year old talks or thinks like the \\"child\\" in these dialogs.  Worse, no child talks as badly about his own father as the imaginary child-Kiyosaki seems to in this book, and that includes kids whose dads beat them up. During the typing of this garbage, I can't believe no one stopped this guy and said, \\"dude, aren't you being kind of harsh to your own father?\\"  However, I also find fault with the constant repetition in this book. It's not actually a full-length book, when you look at the lack of information in it, so either Kiyosaki or his editor basically photocopied a few pages over and over again for so long that I started to wonder if I had picked up a satire or parody without realizing it.  These three faults made \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" so hard and sickening to read that I couldn't continue. Instead, I went online and researched Mr. Kiyosaki a bit. The author seems very nice in interviews on YouTube, but in the book he comes across as a lonely, mean-spirited money-grubber with no friends, no warmth, and no personality.  How this book got a THOUSAND positive reviews is one of the great mysteries in my literary experience.   Fortunately, I bought this book for one Euro at a secondhand bookstore, so the silly author got none of my money. When I bought it, the owner of the book shop rolled his eyes and said, \\"oh, THAT. It's one of those books that I can NEVER seem to sell. Have it for one Euro\\" and looked relieved when I left with the book in my hand.  Again, thank you to all who forced yourselves to get through the whole thing, and for taking the time to write concise reviews here. And whoever wrote the positive reviews, you are either reviewing a totally different \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" from the one I read, or you are being paid by the silly author to pad his review count.  Let me add that being rich is not a good goal. Being happy, successful and having a fun life is what we should all strive for. The only reason there are mega-rich people is because they have taken advantage of others and not shared with those who don't have the ability to amass their own wealth. And think about it: not everyone can be rich! The definition of the term is \\"having more than most people.\\" I am a big fan of the \\"most people.\\" Someone has to drive our trucks, fly our airplanes, haul our garbage, fix our roads and teach our kids. These people would earn a lot better wages if the rich idiots in the world like scam-book authors did not constantly try to hoard all the wealth for themselves without helping society in any way. I respect and cherish the working people who make my city fun to live in. As for rich money- and finance-\\"experts,\\" they do nothing but cause problems, and in the case of this book, waste paper.
B000AP04MO|4.0|This Audrey Hepburn's vehicle from 1967 is not your typical romantic comedy.  It has a lot of dark elements as it explores the relationship of Mark and Joanna Wallace (Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn who was 38 at the time, even though at 38 her eternal youthfulness and beauty were still pristine).  The beauty of France in the late 60s is exquisitely interwoven into this film about first love, courtship, marriage, parenthood and the growing indifferences a couple allow to creep into their relationship. It covers the whole gamut of emotions between Mark and Joanna.  A young couple meets by happenstance and love develops like a 1945 Château Mouton Rothschild wine. When you toss in the beautiful music of Henry Mancini, you have a well-crafted story which at times is very complex as the history of this couple is shown in flashbacks.  This is not a film which you can excuse yourself for several moments and come back to since the past or present may be showing leaving the viewer somewhat bewildered.  Put it on pause.  To miss just one scene is to miss an integral part of this film.  There are many great scenes, especially the road trip with the Manchester Family (William Daniels, Eleanor Bron and Gabrielle Middleton) in their Ford Country Squire.  This is great writing, acting, and pure humor. The ultimate fate of Mark's MG TD is a riot especially when the local townspeople expect remuneration for their help with his car.    There is a very young 23 year-old Jacqueline Bisset who has a few lines as a potential love interest for Mark Wallace.  One can see why she became an international starlet.  The cars and the clothes are priceless.  Audrey Hepburn looked stunning in an array of clothes from plain outfits to bathing suits and evening gowns.  Nominated for an academy award for being written directly for the screen. Won best foreign film in Spain and in Great Britain, best screenplay. Production cost was $4 million.  Worldwide gross was $12 million.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I wanted to give this book 5 stars as I'm a dedicated long time King fan junkie, but alas I could only give it 4 stars. I give kudos to King wanting to bring back the short story form, as a quick read can be quite enjoyable. Many aspects of this story do make it comparable to his novels Christine & Cujo, in that it's another car come to life type story & this car acts rabid! I was a bit disappointed at the abrupt, rather simple & undramatic way he chose to end this story, hence the 4 stars. At $2.99 for the Ebook you get a taste of Stephen King at a bargain price, so try it you might like it!

It would not surprise me that there are better products available for the same money.

1451648537|5.0|I am in awe of Steve Jobs since 1986 when I started using Apple II and specifically Macintosh. I was also a reader of MacUser and Mac World and page by page and day by day I came under the spell of Mac. But beyond Mac I was more in the spell of Steve Jobs. I remember there was a computer show and I was promoting Macintosh, Steve had left the company and stared Next, and a guy came who was more interested in discussing Next and Steve then Macintosh. And I took him aside and almost half an hour we only talked about Steve and his vision. This was the kind of attachment people had with Steve. Reading this book made me understand about Steve, his reasons for making different products, thought process behind these products and the greatness of the person, the Apple team and the products. Even if Windows succeeds or Android succeeds, they will not succeed in the belief Steve and his team put in all the products they eventually made available for people in general. Making an Open product is great, having a belief behind that openness in something else, is there a belief? I don't think so. Where is WHY of these people like Simon Sinek in his book wrote when putting Apple as a case study. A market share of 5% of computer world and still one of the most liked company. Phenomenal success Steve enjoyed. Then Pixar movies, WHAO. What an experience. he and his teams both at Apple and Pixar brought changes in so many ways in so many areas that it is unthinkable that this could be achieved in near future by any mortal.  One of my friends commented on Isaacson's comment that Steve and his wife had no control on the content of the book. He said that Walter made this statement so his credibility remains intact. After finishing the book, I think even if he is lying (which I think he is not) he wrote the book in a way that it doesn't seems he is lying. A very well written. I am extremely happy that he wrote the book in a manner that all mysteries and doubts are cleared. My eyes misted when I read the last meeting between Jobs & Gates. Both were hugely successful and after 30 years I think they both respected each other for the accomplishments they both made in the industry.

B00637UISI|4.0|This is my favorite soundtrack so far. The early ones had some good songs and introduced me to some bands I was unfamiliar with, but many of those songs had originally been written outside of the Twilight universe.  Now that the franchise is so huge, you can tell that artists are writing songs specifically about these stories. Many of the songs on this soundtrack fit so perfectly and have become fast favorites: Turning Page, A Thousand Years, and Eclipse (All Yours)  If you've seen the movie or read the books, I think you will really appreciate this soundtrack lyrically as well as musically.
B000002KB8|5.0|MayBe it's lame to pile on, but I second the notion: you really have been part of the music scenic before Sabbath came along to truly appreciate how different Metal was (for better or worse) from everything else that came before it.

B005HSG3TC|1.0|After being late for 8 working days, I finally received this thing.  Unfortunately, It is not my taste and I have to return this thing. $45 for it is not worth it (for me).
B004RQDQIQ|4.0|Clearly we are not here to provide an opinion/review of the movie Miller's Crossing (although it is one of my favorites and I believe everyone should see it). The blu-ray format for this movie was on par with the rest of the transitions. Unfortunately, movies that weren't filmed for blu-ray always seem to appear fuzzy to me. This one is a classic for me so I may not have noticed the grainy image, but I was very satisfied with my purchase.
B004EPZ084|1.0|This plot--which was kind of cute--could have been told just as well without the truckloads of profanity and extreme excess of raunchy, outright disgusting bits (such as the \\"wetworks\\" man, the insertion of the toothbrush, etc.) After seeing this movie, I felt as though I needed a bath, and ought to have my mind washed out with soap. Our culture has degenerated to the point where obscenity is considered normal. So depressing! If you want to see a similar movie that's a lot cleaner, try \\"Office Space.\\"
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|There are enough reviews here that explain the film and the plot. I just wanted to add what great movie this is for the whole family. At 48, I'm not that interested in kiddie films, but this movie is different. It was as fun for me as it was for my 11 year old. It delivers in the action department, but also has a great story line. Everyone is mentioning ET and Jurassic Park, but the movie it reminds me of most is Stand By Me (one of my all time favorites). Now, as for the Blue Ray quality, all I can say is WOW! I see things in the video that I totally missed in the movie theater. Sharp is not the word. But you'll see for yourself. Well worth it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am a reluctant Adele fan because she is so huge. Artists that become very popular are not always worthy in my humble opinion. Adele is exceptional. She has a strong voice and is a great songwriter. Her songs are sad and about love but she speaks from a place of truth. I don't think they are pity songs. I think it's just self expression. I don't think she feels sorry for herself. The songs made me pay attention and her voice is just so powerful. She's inspirational. It's ok to indulge in feelings. It makes us alive and human. She makes it look easy when I know a lot of work goes into it. She's a true professional. I can't wait to see where else she will take us. I hope this is just the beginning.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|It takes patience to watch it unfold -- you have to surrender to its pace as with Kubrick's \\"2001\\" or Griffith's \\"Intolerance\\" -- but the rewards are great. \\"Tree of Life\\" depicts probably the most painful, and finally moving, father-son relationship I've ever seen on film, and big metaphysical questions have never felt more personal. The ending meandered dangerously close to new age cliche, but ah, the journey there was immense.
B005GVA2L0|4.0|It took me a while to get into this  CD but when it finally clicked I was pleasantly surprised.  The only two songs that should not be on this CD are, \\"Sick of it all\\", and \\"Lost in Paradise.\\"  This is a CD well worth waiting for.
B004BLJQOK|3.0|Watching this was just like reading the book again.  If I had liked the book I would have liked the movie's faithful reenactment of the plot.  The movie looked good, and the acting was fine.  The problem is the story, and the pacing.  Here is my review of the book.<br /><br />\\"Inside the cover of this book is a fantastic vampire story, but either something got lost in the translation or the editors missed a lot of opportunities to ratchet up the tension. I enjoyed the book immensely through the first 200 pages, but after that found myself hoping for more scares and more vampiric mythology. This could've been a great book, and maybe it was in its original language. It left me longing for a really good vampire book, something like Salem's Lot, The Vampire Lestat, or Dracula.\\"
B004LWZW8I|1.0|I didn't know what I was looking at on the screen half the time or why the characters where in the places and positions they were in. Or maybe I just didn't care. It was hard to tell. I can't remember ever being this bored in a movie in my entire life. 2 hours of lackluster story and action where choreographed men were jabbing each other with cheap sticks just to see 15 minutes of stunning visual effects and fighting.  Not worth it. Don't buy this movie.

B00005JGAF|5.0|joey ramone was born in 1951, his music will be timeless, he died in 2001 from lymphoma.  this is rock n roll not punk as ive seen critics say they are.  hard drums with fast paced bass and screaming guitars.  his voice is grumbled with bass intonations critics have said hicupping growls with rasty sounds, i love it.  you dont have to be a beautifully voiced singer to make records all you need is heart and a sound that generates the feelings of the emotions that youve written into your soulful lyrics to be a great singer........willie nelson doesnt have the best voice in the world or waylon jennings, but if youve heard the lonely howls of a wolf then youll understand the singing of waylon.  or any great musician singer.  such as the ramones.  3 of the members are dead now.  life is too short!  rock on, enjoy it while you can 1 2 3 4 ...........

This book is no exception, its right up there with the da Vinci code, angels and demons and deception point. While it focuses on the religious aspect of things again, Brown provides enough intrigue and twists to keep even the most avid reader occupied and longing for more.

030746363X|2.0|I thought this was entertaining and there were some lessons to be learned. I appreciate the unconventional approach and I've incorporated some of the tips into my diet and exercise routine.  But the diet and exercise results are highly geared toward men. It would be interesting to have a female experiment with these tips, tools, and strategies to see what the results would be. Much of his theory and application was based on hormonal response, which of course is very different between men and women.  My summary: 80% of people will benefit from 20% of the content. Save your money and get it at the library.
B005WZZRD8|3.0|The Born this Way CD is incredible.  I purchased this set because I didn't have the remix or the DVD so it made sense.  I was hoping since the CD was stamped with a Parental Advisory Sticker that the Born This Way album would be unedited.  This album is still edited and it is the same CD that came with the Deluxe Edition upon its' first release.  Still an incredible album in the little cardboard sleeve that is now comes in (but does include the original booklet).  The mixes are ok and the DVD is ok.  Played them one time with all the new music and entertainment coming out this month.  Just wanted to write a quick review in case anyone was wondering if this is indeed an unedited Born this Way.  If I could do it all over since, I already had the Deluxe edition, I would have bought the Remix and DVD separately.  Way Sturdier packaging and if I got bored of the DVD I could have sold it on Amazon.
B000002AZ8|1.0|On Ten, Stone and Jeff wrote the music and Eddie wrote the lyrics. The result was one of the greatest albums of all time. Pearl Jam had a great recipe for success and great songs; I still wonder to this day why in the world would they threw all of that away? Vitalogy is the album where Eddie took over all aspects of the band and wrote over-simplistic songs with cheesy riffs that sounded like they came from a 3rd rate garage band. One of my friends said it best back in the day, \\"They need to take the guitar away from Eddie\\". Sadly, they never did...
0446613444|5.0|Black Ice had a fast paced beginning, (as good as it gets), and the middle   held my interest.

B00005R8GU|5.0|Most of the reviewers here talk a lot about the performances from the white bluesmen but I don't think enough attention is paid to Muddy's slide playing on \\"Fathers & Sons.\\" In most of the recordings that I've heard, his slide playing always seems to be in the background and hard to hear. However, on THIS recording, the power and glory of Muddy Waters' slide is captured in a way that will astound both blues novices and the jaundiced collectors.   Perhaps the best example is \\"Standing 'Round Crying\\"--Muddy's riffs are positively frightening and his guitar wails with despair and pain. If your favorite metal/prog players like to slag off Delta bluesmen as \\"unoriginal\\" or \\"boring,\\" a dose of this song will set them straight for the rest of their lives. Five stars, definitely.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|The 2011 Captain America: The First Avenger movie is a brilliant conversion of many years of comic history into a All American masterpiece.  The movie has several scenes lifted shot for shot from the comics I read in the 1960s.  It is a conversion that respects the original material and offers changes that are reasonable where needed.  Chris Evans does a masterful job in bringing Steve Rogers to the movie screen.  His acting makes Captain Americas shield use believable.  Overall one of the best comic conversions, and a required step toward the Avengers, next year.

0764141201|5.0|Whether you use it as a reference book for supplemental exercises or as a regular component of your advanced ESL/EFL classes, English teachers should appreciate this systematic primer on phrasal (two and three word verbs). The short, focused 50 chapters also allow you to introduce the word by theme so students can better remember the verbs in a meaningful, if somewhat artificial context. Less, however, may be more in the classroom deployment of phrasal verbs since ESL materials should be practical.  This book deserves to be included in the professional library of language schools, English teachers, and word mavens.
0345522478|5.0|This has quickly become one of my favorite new series. Kevin Hearne brings a lot of humor and fun to the table in the Iron Druid Chronicles. The story has a lot of great characters, and is fast paced. If you're a fan of urban fantasy(think Dresden Files) then this might be right up your alley.
159420229X|4.0|***No Spoiler*** :)  Its a great book if your interested in memory and really know nothing about the topic historically or scientifically, but it serves more as a novel introduction if nothing else.   His main story is about his encounter with a British world memory contestant who tells him he can make him a US memory champion in a year. On the road to attempting to become a US memory champion which he beefs up with his own research (as an art and its history) and his encounter with modern scientists and memory gurus. In a sense it is inspiring  because it is well written and he touches up on curiosities on different levels, relating them to each other quite well. Perhaps inspiring to let you know anyone can, has, and should attempt to remember more through different methods and attempts not entirely understood yet... so NOT a SELF HELP book. Someone said earlier that if you studied psychology as an undergraduate, there won't be much except the story and some true intriguing gems left mainly on the historical perspective (which I really enjoyed). I agree, and I do think this book may have been falsely advertised to an extent. Its why I call it a NOVEL INTRODUCTION and give it four stars.  An avid reader should be able to finish this in a week or less. In my opinion is that its better written than other books you could relate it to, and doesn't bore you at any point as a result.

0142429414|4.0|Good book, well suited for youth, around 10.  sent to my grandkids.  The book was a little repetitious of Theodore Boone, Kid Lawyer, Grisham's first book with this hero.  I think Grisham is trying to establish the hero for a series, much like the old \\"Encyclopedia Brown\\" books.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It was recommend by a stranger at an airport..he simply said you have to read this book, it was so good I bought a copy for each of my kids..so I bought the book and let it sit on my shelf for over a year.  Then this year I bought the Kindle edition and while on vacation I finally took that stranger's advice and read the book.  It was simply wonderful.  The book is a great read from a dogs point of view but it also give one great insight into how to handle what life dishes out.

B004EPYZQ2|5.0|First off, I have to point out that a lot of other reviews are saying this is a Spielberg film.  It's not.  It's a J.J. Abrams film.  He wrote, directed, and helped produce the movie.  Steven Spielberg is credited as a producer, and that is all.  So judge the film as you will, but don't label it as a Spielberg picture, because although it pays homage to the man, it's not HIS.  All of this being said, I found Super 8 to be a fantastic film.  I enjoyed all of the references, both in style and shooting, to past Spielberg films.  There really hasn't been a film like this since some of Spielberg's greatest (E.T., Close Encounters, etc.).  If you have the ability to listen to dialogue, enjoy a story, and don't have the need for \\"in your face\\" CGI action every 3 seconds, then you might enjoy this.  It's a much more old-school style of filmmaking and storytelling.  The kids, especially Elle Fanning, are amazing.  The adult characters leave a bit to be desired.  All in all, though, it's an enjoyable movie from beginning to end.  If Amazon would allow half-star ratings, I would have given this 4 1/2.  I feel it's one of the best movies of this year, though, so leaned towards the 5.  Enjoy.
B004X80QNG|2.0|The WinMo and BB versions of this app are tops, as they sync directly with Outlook, and are more visually appealing.  The biggest problem with this app is it doesn't sync with Outlook.  I don't want a virtual calendar and have no interest in synching my personal data on something called Toodle Do!

B005W3G2D4|4.0|While \\"Stronger\\" may not differ as much from \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" as some would like, it's still a solid effort on her part. I think that these songs showcase more of Clarkson's personality than we've seen on previous efforts. I personally did not enjoy the way the album was mixed. It just seemed to be such an odd progression to go from slow song to slow song, then to a mid-tempo followed by an up-tempo. But I think that now as I have grown to enjoy more of the songs, the order is not of as much importance as before. She is in full voice throughout the albums and tackles the big notes with an ease many of her competitors lack these days.<br /><br />  Although I do recommend that on the next album, Ms. Clarkson and her label make a conscious effort to surprise the fans and the general public by taking a few more risks. The fans will always stand by your side but they are only able to purchase so many albums.<br /><br />  Standouts: \\"Let Me Down,\\" \\"You Can't Win,\\" \\"Einstein,\\" and \\"The War Is Over\\"

B004JN1D2I|3.0|Brilliant & captivating first book, second holds true, third requires editing down to half its length and fourth was painful and ended poorly with a terrible note from the author at the 'almost end' of the book.   He seems to have become as jaded as his characters with the whole plot.  He admits book 4 was 'a bitch' and it is to read too.  Compare the fourth to the first and the need for a keen editor to cut out the self-indulgent extra bulk and drive to the plot is pretty clear.   Frankly a set of four books when the author clearly and irritatingly states the fifth is part of the fourth book cut in half because it was too long seriously takes the piss out of the readers.

B0065IBZI2|5.0|I have been a big fan of Kate Bush for quite a long time. I was really excited when I saw her new release, but it took me several plays to warm up to it. Her voice is still as amazing as ever. I find myself listening to \\"Wild Man\\" over and over. I really like that song. It reminds me of classic Kate Bush. I adore her storytelling and fascinating lyrics. I also like her duet with Elton John, \\"Snowed In At Wheeler Street.\\" It's quite a compelling arrangement. I like the concept.  This is one album that I know I will appreciate and enjoy the more I listen to it. I find myself going back to the beginning and starting the journey over and over again, discovering more gems to cherish. Her voice is so utterly amazing, even after all these years. It's a joy to be able to listen to a new Kate Bush album.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this movie's storyline and screenplay with strong themes of duty and perserverance.  What separates this movie from most in it's genre is the military aspect of the invading forces and vulnerability of the alien troops, which gives the film more credibility in my opinion.  In agreement with others (but impossible because the original story was weak), this is what War of the Worlds remake should have been.  Americans need the thrill of overcoming the problems thrown at them.  We receive no pleasure if the problem simply removes itself from the equation.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|The Muppet's last movie, \\"Muppet's from Space\\" was released in 1999 and \\"The Muppet Show\\" finished its television run in 1981 and this is the premise of the \\"Muppets 2011\\" revival movie. After years of absence, the Muppet's are back. For many people who grew up in the late 70's and early 80's, this isn't just a children's movie, this is a return to their childhood. Those who remember \\"The Muppet Show\\" will be reminded how a collection of felt characters with all different personalities, would attempt to put on a variety show every week.<br /><br />\\"The Muppets\\" 2011 is an absolute delight for a child who hasn't been exposed to the characters yet, as well as the child at heart who was longing for their return and didn't even realize it. The spirit of the Muppets is quickly established with a lighthearted delivery, song and dance and doing what the Muppets have always done by making puppets made of felt and cloth come to life. We are introduced to a Muppet named Walter who's brother, a human, changed and grew over time, while he stayed his same old Muppet self. Ever since the television show left the air in 1981, Walter had longed to be a part of a television show that was put on by people, or Muppets, like him. Out of place and never having his dream fulfilled, he finally gets his chance.<br /><br />The new movie is a collage of real life and movie. In the movie, we watch as the Muppets who have had a 12-year hiatus and are leading private sector lives, come together to bring back their television show and that is exactly what is happening in real life. The Muppets are back! There are moments in the movie too that made me feel how much I missed them. There are also moments that made me think of how the creators, Jim Hensen and Frank Oz are also gone and can't see how much the Muppets meant to us growing up.<br /><br />\\"The Muppets\\" is quite simply a joy worthy of repeat viewing. There are people who break out into song and dance at the most inappropriate times, like sitting at a diner or chickens clucking to C-Lo Green's \\"Forget You\\". The songs are catchy. The story is fun. The Muppets personalities are just like we remembered them. It was like dusting off an old record and letting yourself go. I had almost forgot how long it had been since a movie had done that to me.<br /><br />The only thing I can say negatively about \\"The Muppets\\" is that it will leave you with a sense of disappointment. It is inevitable, especially for those who remember the show. Although it is disappointment in a good way because you know how much there is to the Muppets and you can't help but want more. Hopefully there will be more and hopefully they will continue to bring the Muppets back into our lives on a regular basis.clucking to C-Lo Green's \\"Forget You\\". The songs are catchy.

B0053JJLLC|1.0|I have been a Crichton fan from his first novel so it pains me to see his name used to promote a truely awful book. Nothing remotely believable in this one.  Had it been his first, it would have been his last.  A last ditch effort by all involved to cash in.  Shameful!
0226264017|5.0|This book, written in the 60's, has correctly predicted what has happened to our economy and freedoms in the last 40 years! What to expect in the future cannot be taken lightly.

B0042EJD8A|5.0|There are way too many reviews here to think that anyone might be affected by mine in particular, but after watching, I was compelled to let anyone and everyone know that this is a very important film for everyone to see.  What is happening in this country is a shame.  So many aspects of industry are destroying our future and quality of life, and it's important to be educated.  We make no difference if we close our eyes.  This move is an absolute must-see if you want to know what so-called \\"natural gas\\" drilling is doing to our country and citizens.  Make it a priority.  It's an important movie right now.

0307454541|1.0|This I share with Salander -- a lack of even a cursory level of emotional involvement -- towards the plot (bloated by an overload of tangential sub-plots) and the characters (a whole host of which are introduced for the most perfunctory of reasons).  The revelations about the big mystery turn out to be largely predictable and uninspiring.  I ended up skimming the latter part of this book.<br /><br />I did enjoy the scenic descriptions of the island and of Blomkvist's daily activities, and the disquieting descriptions of the weather and of Vanger's torment and forlornness.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this book has been classified as Adult Fiction, it read more like YA Fiction.

B002BWP49M|5.0|I, too, initially resisted (and resented) the Twilight material, until I inadvertently saw one of the movies, and my mind was changed due in large part to Kristen Stewart's interpretation of the Bella character.  I then gave the first book a try, and was immediately and irrevocably sucked in. I read the entire series very quickly (some more than once) and saw all the movies repeatedly.  I can't explain it, but I'm hooked.  Breaking Dawn was my favorite of the books and Part I is my favorite of the movies so far, as well. Anyone who has not read the book(s) should read it before you see the movie, as you will then be able to understand the character motivations much better. So glad they split Breaking Dawn into two parts because even Part I had to leave a great deal out in order to fit a roughly two-hour time slot.  Loved where they ended Part I -- exactly where I thought they would in the book. One disappointment: I thought the talking wolf sequence was out of place and would have preferred a much more abstract approach, but that part of the story was essential and what's done is done, so I'll get over it. Highly recommend this movie and this series to those who don't have a chip on their shoulder, who don't have issues with romance and intimacy, who have an open mind, and can appreciate a very creative and magnetic story for what it's worth. Looking forward to adding it to my movie collection. Congratulations to Kristen and Rob for negotiating for a percentage of gross ($$$) ;)
B004529NKC|4.0|I liked this one better than the first two Step Up movies! The story is repetitive basically a bunch of kids need money and they enter a contest and so it goes but the dancing in this is what impressed me, not the story. I was happy to see \\"Moose\\" reprise his role. He's super cute! The main character (the guy on the cover) seemed to disappear whenever the real dancing happened which I thought was funny but the dance numbers were off the chain! The dancer that did the robot in the first part of the film was phenomanal. I've never seen someone move just like a robot like that! They also did a dance in water which was just like the second movie but it was a great dance sequence anyway. The final dance number was also outstanding with the lighted suits they were wearing. It was amazing! I found myself rewinding this movie to see the dance sequences again and again! I highly recommend this if you like dance movies.

B004GCKRWY|3.0|Depending on your taste you had to think about Edgar Allan Poe's ahort stories or George Sluizer's [[ASIN:B00005NFZC The Vanishing (The Criterion Collection)]]) while seeing Buried and if you're claustrophobic, the sole mention of the title for sure prevented you to see it. One actor, one location, that was a challenge and I must say that I was impressed by the director's skill. A very good surprise. Recommended.

B00005JPAO|5.0|Mirren is superb! She looks nothing like Queen Elizabeth normally, but she is absolutely transformed! She moves heavily and stiffly. Her face is unchanging. Her voice... well, she's the queen! Fortunately, the storyline and the rest of the cast is also great. I clearly remember the death of Princess Diana. I remember the turmoil and how the Royal Family had no public presence. I remember the hostility. I can't say what really went on, but I think this film captures that event so well. I LOVED the way it ended. It was subtle, beautiful and touching. Great movie. Great move! Great movie!!

B003EYVXXW|1.0|This film belongs in the Hall of Fame for Worst Movie Ever. It is lovely to look at, but the actors are horrible. The plot idea is good, but the execution fails.

I tend to love period pieces, but I actually hated this and could not finish it. Horrid.

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|In the thirteenth Megadeth's CD entitled \\"TH1RT3EN\\", you get the true spirit of Megadeth and it could well be the band's CV summary. As I heard Chris mention several times, it really does give a sort of a cross-section of the band's path, containing elements, or, to put it better, the feel of all the previos CDs - from raw strength of their first CD Killing is My Business to the more sophisticated Endgame. It is strong, fast, rich, interesting, invigorating, Dave's singing is superb, solos are imaginative, the way that Chris's and Dave's guitars intertwine and replace each other is great, David's bass is just the way I like it - clear and strong, guitar-like, Shawn's drumming perfect and steady... A true work of art.<br />I'd point out Black Swan and Deadly Nightshade (the latter is the school example of a great song, I would say...) as my favourite songs, though others are just as great.[[ASIN:B005WFUZTE Th1rt3en]]<br />In short, the more you listen to it, the more you like it!<br />So, if you have not checked \\"13\\" out yet, be sure you do! I love it!
B005V20JKI|5.0|I love this game and have been telling everyone about it. its fast paced, challenging and original. its got great graphics and plays well. this is the first game since cut the rope that has gotten me sitting for a length of time playing it. DROID X w/ 2.3.3
0441013597|4.0|Dunes is a very interesting read. It has elements of Surprise, mystery and most definitely suspense. Dune well certainly make you think, trying to guess who and what exactly the freemen are and what the spice actually does. How exactly does Paul see the future.   The kindle version is slightly messed up with messed up spelling and weird spaces in-between words. The author makes a very interesting mix of strategy politics religion and ecology. The planet is a mystery in of itself. With it's almost complete water conservation. Dune is set within a universe of strange forces and a iron-fisted government. Planets are bought and sold like plots of land for the Rich. I would defiantly rate this book five stars. However if you want to read the kindle version then I might recommend buying a different version of the book. An interesting read for anyone who like science fiction.
B0034G4OVS|2.0|As I work in the lift operations industry I had to buy this.  Just for kicks.  The acting is fair at best, the plot is weak and the idea that you can't hold onto the haul rope (the lift cable) with gloves on, because it is \\"razor sharp\\" was just too much to accept.  One of my employees sums up the experience. \\"I wish I had those 90 minutes back\\".  The best I can say is it's good for an occasional laugh on stormy days when we can't work.

B004ULEEY8|4.0|Just watched it last night and don't know how anyone could not like it. Other than missing a larger than life sound track like in Independence Day this was an excellent movie. Independence Day was a good movie, but you felt manipulated to cry at just the right times. This movie was more like reality even though they were fighting aliens. I enjoyed the extra featurettes also.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|First time I watched this movie, it made me cry so hard. It was so good, yet... so incredibly sad! This made me remember my first dog and basically just brought back all those feelings. I definitely would recommend.  Shipping by the way was pretty fast!
B006ANJ4BW|4.0|The storyline wasn't super strong.  Certain special effects weren't very good.  Buildings falling looked fake to me.  But entertainment value was there.  Acting overall was decent, though i had to wipe drool off my chin once or twice as i got distracted.  i wish they'd made conan a little deeper as a person.  i can't stand rose mcgowan, but thankfully her acting talents weren't stretched much.  No complaints at all about Jason Momoa.  His acting was pretty good, and he's yummy too (the sex scene could have been steamier!).

0140434089|4.0|Wilkie Collins' &#34;The Moonstone&#34;, first published in 1868 and set in 1848, will be instantly recognizable to fans of &#34;CSI&#34; and other television crime shows, as a fairly modern detective story, complete with a cursed diamond, a closed-house English mystery with many suspects, conspiracies, star-crossed lovers, and one or more dogged detectives.<br /><br />&#34;The Moonstone&#34; begins with the theft of a revered religious object, a large yellow diamond known as the Moonstone, from a temple in India. The diamond ends up, probably by foul means, in the hands of a British officer, who becomes an outcast from his own family for his suspected crime. When the officer leaves the Moonstone to his niece Rachel, through the good offices of his nephew Franklin Blake, a chain of events is triggered that will lead to the disappearence of the Moonstone, an unexpected death, one or more shattered romances, and a seemingly insoluble mystery.<br /><br />Collins cleverly tells the story from the point of view of several partcipants in the mystery. This plot device allows Collins to introduce a host of interesting characters, to engage with the strict social mores of Victorian England, and to manipulate several plot devices that extend the detection process to the very end of the novel. Readers used to the standard 200 page detective novel of the present day will just have to be patient; Collins takes his time getting to his destination.<br /><br />This reviewer advises readers to save Sandra Kemp's excellent introductory essay until after reading the novel itself; it contains a number of spoilers. &#34;The Moonstone&#34; itself is very highly recommended as an entertaining reading experience.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|I first saw this movie on a 7 inch seat-back screen at 30000 feet.  It's a fun movie for the shole family and it a million times better at home in 3-D.

0321704452|4.0|Reynolds's main theme throughout the book is about being naked or natural. In the first chapter he explains, \\"Being naked means stripping away all that is unnecessary and getting to the essence of your message.\\"  The book is well formed and has great clarity. He places emphasis on connecting with the audience during presentations and keynote addresses.   Good easy read, well recommended for anyone starting to improve their presentation skills.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|There is no upgrade or specials. Just candy swiping. making this game lame. It does offer 2 minutes of entertainment though.
3442217784|3.0|We all like money.  This book was a difficult read; I felt it was too drawn out but the message is worth the difficult read. This book was recommended because it is supposed to teach us how to manage finances and the power of money. The more I thought about what was written the more curious I was to see whom it was written for. If you are a goal oriented individual this book will work for you, but we don't live in a world where our goals are same as others. I understand the intentions of this book and its importance toward finance. The book is all about training your brain to think a certain way to make money. Let's face it, most of us didn't grow up rich and everyday our parents and grandparents didn't talk about money at the dinner table. With that said, I did hear talks about money but never when kids were around. That's exactly the opposite of what this book suggests, talk money around the kids so they understand and mold their minds to think a certain way. Who else will teach their kids about money than their own family? This book on the other hand is teaching the adults to rewire their brains to talk about money with their kids and teach them about assets and liabilities. I recommend this book not because it's easy to read but because it is something people need to think about and know about.
B002APU580|5.0|This movie is amazing. It is filled with romance and many surprises. The depth that these characters have is just phenomenal. Keira Knightley is an amazing actress!
0321704452|4.0|Execution process:  I found myself reading the book, not once but twice to understand the process, it's not that I didn't get it the first time; it was a building block on how to execute, most people forget that. The book takes you through a journey of building, just like you would at a construction job. The many hours, days and months it takes to put a plan and project together. You have to start at the very beginning, a methodology which can be used for everything from cleaning house to building a house. Naked presenter focuses on giving a speech and or a presentation without barriers. The important points of the book are to be open and transparent.  Preparation is the key to giving a speech, finishing the speech on time and connecting with your audience is most important.
076115678X|5.0|This book is FANTASTIC!! I've been fighting my curls for YEARS, not in the frying and straightening sense, but in the sense that I didn't know how to properly care for and encourage my curls. Since my mom's hair is fairly straight, I never had anyone to teach me about using something with less nap to dry my hair (not a towel), shampooing less and conditioning more, etc. I thought frizz was just a part of my hair, something I was going to have to live with because that's the hand I was dealt. Nope! I thought because my hair is curly and fine that there was no hope for me - that I'd have to resort to sneaky haircuts and massive amounts of products to make my hair look like it had body. Nope! Massey covers everything from the basics of hair care to the ins and outs of products to the biology of why curly hair is the way it is - VERY interesting, in my opinion.<br /><br />Are there some parts that are a little \\"fluffy\\" (as one reviewer put it) - more entertaining reading than educational? Sure. Does Massey plug her own product line time and time again? Yes, but can you blame her? What she's doing is working for thousands (probably hundreds of thousands!) of women across the globe, and if it's working for her pocketbook as well, then what's wrong with that? To my knowledge, she never says outright, \\"You must use my DevaCurl product and only my product to make this work.\\" She gives you examples for other homemade or organic possibilities alongside her DevaCurl products.<br /><br />The first day that I tried this ridiculously easy method, my hair looked SO much better than it had in the YEARS before. Thank you, Lorraine Massey!!!

B004P98QZ8|5.0|the fire temple is a central piece in the lego ninjago series.  i think that it comes with 1,176 pieces, about.  it comes with 3 assembly books, one for different parts.  as you can imagine, assembling this took a few hours.  the precision and attention to detail was outstanding!  it looks quite real - resembles asian architecture.  this one has a phenomenal moving part - when you pull up on the sword (kind of like the arthurian legend), it pushes down on a lever which snaps open the two sides of the building - thus revealing - the fire breathing dragon!  the dragon here appears larger than the solo dragon.  it has attachments on each \\"feather\\" so that 8 characters can be attached.  of course, there's a gong, plastic flames, lots of characters - good and bad.  this is one of the very best \\"bangs for the buck\\" in the lego world!  this is one that seems designed to really be played with (of course the architectural pieces don't seem to be).  beware, there are so many pieces, some novel, that it falls apart quickly.  thus, if you want to play with it, or for that matter, even move it, i think that it's wise to glue together the main structure of the building and the dragon - so that essentially moving parts aren't glued but stationary parts are glued in order that they don't fall apart.  i give everything that i review a grade, and i believe that the ninjago fire temple deserves an \\"A+\\".  i recommend this for lego builders who have an interest in the ninjago series.  it's price has come down a little bit ($10) in recent weeks and it might come down further, thus enabling you to get an outstanding set at a more affordable price.  if price isn't an issue for you, then i recommend it whole heartedly.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I read this book in two sittings and it was the most fun book I've read this year.  It had several pop culture references that will take you back.

The story was well laid out and the characters were well developed that I wanted to be a part of the virtual world that Cline created.

B001G8WXH8|1.0|Got half way through and couldn't take it anymore. Like a bad version of one of Ludlum's lame entries when he started mailing them in.    Hokey, high-schoolish. Read like a comic book and the characters were laughably one-dimensional and unbelieveable. Good characters sounded like they just got off a Dr. Phil episode and the bad ones were Dr. Evil.     Can't hold a candle to Sandford who clearly is the best with the Lucas Davenport or Virgil Flowers series. Even James Lee Burke who got a little formulaic after 7 or 8 of the Robichaeux series, makes this clown look like a grade schooler.    It was Stone Dull.
B0041KKYGA|5.0|The plot of the movie \\"Anonymous\\" is intriguing, and certainly it merits viewing, for the question of authorship is an important one for reasons that most people do not yet fully grasp.  Though it may hint at the truth, it seems to me that it does not quite go far enough.  I know of several sources that lend credence to the view that not the Earl of Oxford, Edward de Verre, but Sir Francis Bacon, secret heir to England's throne, and founder of the Rosicrucian secret literary society, was the real author of the plays as well as numerous other literary works penned and published during that era under various pseudonyms.  It begs the question why would a member of the nobility write secretly and hire a semi-illiterate and relatively uneducated man from Stratford to take credit for the most brilliant works ever written in English literature?      The most compelling testimony for me lies in three diverse sources of information that together point to the true authorship of the plays.  One of these sources is Alfred Dodd's book \\"Francis Bacon's Personal Life-Story\\".  Though written several centuries after the time of Shakespeare it lays out meticulously researched letters and documents that allude to Francis Bacon's true identity as the illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth and Robert Dudley, and the author of the plays.  Dodd's thesis is that though Elizabeth never openly acknowledged him as her son and heir to England's throne she apparently secretly supported and funded his efforts to create a literary naissance in England.  Herself a well-educated woman with a passion for higher learning, she sponsored his efforts to galvanize the language with a grammatical syntax, as well as importing and \\"anglesizing\\" words from other languages capable of conveying abstract, higher thought.  Prior to that time all scholarly work and literature had to be written in Latin, Greek, French or Italian and was thus available only to a minority;  the wealthy, educated of England.  Many ideas we take for granted and openly discuss today were considered politically treacherous and certain to cause a political backlash among those who wished to maintain the pre-renaissance status quo.  The necessity for secrecy in such an endeavor was paramount.  In order to move England (and Europe) out of the dark ages in which it had been so long immersed Elizabeth I and Francis Bacon needed to secretly forge the means at the same time that they were publicly feigning ignorance, all the while holding a delicate political balance between various factions and historical forces that existed during that era.    Before Elizabeth's reign an English language that could be used to create literary works as we know it today was non-existent.  According to Dodd's premise, though she did not openly sponsor these publications, the Queen tacitly supported Bacon and funded his writing because of her very personal connection with him.  She also valued the higher purpose of his efforts, namely to raise the intellect and the moral sensibility of the common man who did not have the education to read and write, but who could engage in learning through viewing the performance of theatrical plays.  Elizabeth I was known to be a woman of exceptional determination who, despite her personal character flaws, did wish to promote the welfare of all her loyal subjects, regardless of low or high birth.  Thus, her secret support of Francis Bacon's endeavors is not a far-fetched premise.    Alfred Dodd also makes reference to encrypted information within the writings (plays and poems) that identify Bacon as the author.  Cryptography was the norm during those politically dangerous times as a form of conveying information secretly.  Ciphers with Francis Bacon's name, as well as numerological references to Pallas Athena (a.k.a. Ascended Master Pallas Athena) appear in many of the works.  Athena was said to be his sponsor and inspiration, in a divine sense, and the name Shake-spear is an allusion to her.  She was a divine being known to the ancient Greeks, and the patroness of Athens, and is often portrayed holding a spear.  As the spear-shaker she was the one who stamps out ignorance (the serpent who often appears in statues depicting her) and upholds truth, wisdom, and divine intelligence in the hearts and minds of men and women who ask for her assistance.  The synchronicity of the name Shakespeare with Sir Francis's muse, Pallas Athena, inspired Bacon's choice of William Shakespeare from Stratford as the nom de plume for his plays.  Shakespeare of Stradford also had a connection with the theater and that made him the perfect choice for one who wished to remain anonymous, as it lent more credence to the ruse.    A connection between Francis Bacon, the Shakespeare writings, and the Ascended Masters is reinforced by two additional sources of information, namely, the books of Gary Renard, as well as the collected transcripts of discourses and dictations known as the Teachings of the Ascended Masters.  \\"The Disappearance of the Universe\\" and \\"Your Immortal Reality\\" by Gary Renard both allude to a nobleman in the Queen's court who authored the plays.  The reason given:  the Queen would not permit nobility to openly engage in activities related to the theatre, as her public persona considered it undignified and vulgar for the members of her court to be involved in such.  Both of these books make reference to the author of the plays as a court noble who is now an  \\"Ascended Master\\", though they do not reveal his identity.    Though Gary Renard does not identify the author of the plays, it is well known by those who are familiar with the teachings of the Ascended Masters that Francis Bacon was the final lifetime of the Ascended Master known as St. Germain.  Also, it is commonly accepted among contemporary students of the Ascended Masters that Francis Bacon was the true author of the plays.  It is taken for granted by those engaged in the Ascended Master teachings thatFrancis Bacon was a noble in the Queen's court and that he had both the education, as well as the brilliance of mind to have created these works.  That he took such care to divert attention from himself as the real author and was so successful in that accomplishment that the authorship is still a matter of intense debate, demonstrates in itself the maneuvering of a brilliant, as well as humble man.  The success of Bacon's anonymous writings and the need of the hour  to raise humanity up out of the \\"dark ages\\"  was more important to him than the personal sacrifice of recognition and public accolades, and he even set aside his own ambitions for the succession to the throne in order to pursue these ends.  He knew that the source of the writings was divine in origin, and that personal credit was not of significant  importance to him.  That he hid his identity behind pseudonyms so well that centuries of scholarly inquiry have still not unearthed the entire truth, makes this film \\"Anonymous\\" all the more fascinating to watch.      It seems the truth is that no matter who you believe wrote the plays and poetry the name and identity of the author is of no import.  The paradox of \\"Anonymous\\" in itself reveals a brilliance that reaches beyond the scope of mundane human understanding, since in the divine oneness of God personas are irrelevant, and whether we ever agree on which persona created the plays does not really matter.  For isn't it the brilliance of the mind connected with creative divine Source that is important rather than the personal life story of the human who holds the pen?  When we surrender the ego to the point that the mind becomes illumined and brilliant, the personal truth becomes  \\"I am but a pencil in the hand of God\\" (Mother Theresa).  I believe the author of the Shakespeare plays set up a riddle for us to solve that points to a divine mystery, whereby to get to the truth within the mystery we will have to set aside the barriers imposed by the limited human intellect and stretch credibility beyond our current beliefs and perceptions.  Perhaps that was the ultimate divine purpose of the mystery created by anonymity.  Was the human or the divine mind the true author of the plays?  Now that, to me, is the most significant and intriguing question raised by this movie, and one worthy the effort of full and determined investigation.

The message is clear, the information is excellent, and the artwork makes it a pleasure to turn the page.  If you go into the book knowing it's not geared for people with advanced degrees it makes it that much more entertaining.
B005ORVMT2|5.0|Well, Just recently got my copy of Sector 1-3. They are awesome looking, you get quite a bit for your money.  So I've read about all these glitches w/ Sector 1. My cds/copy do not have any glitches what so ever so I musta gotten lucky! ;) All cds worked well and I had these cranked to about 13 last nite and they are louder then the 97 remasters but will probly listen to the 97 remasters anyway since I don't wanna keep taking these newer cds out of the little plastic sleeve. But all in all, an excellent box set for Sector 1 w/o glitches on the cds!! Very pleased!! A must buy!

B001HNE3NO|1.0|This book weaves between two stories: that of Sarah, a young Jewish girl in Nazi-occupied Paris, and Julia, an American journalist living in Paris in present day.  The latter story is just plain horrible.  Reads like a soap opera.  She's a pathetic, spineless woman who can't decide whether to keep her baby or abort it (which her husband prefers).  I won't spoil her final choice (but really, it's not that riveting anyway).  Frankly, the author should have skipped the entire Julia story.  Sarah's story is much more interesting, but only for the first 50 or so pages. Thereafter, it drags as well.  I skimmed the majority of the book just to get to the point.    My biggest issue with this book is the writing.  The author does not have the ability to develop characters and places.  She writes in cliches and overused adjectives (Julia is described over and over again as a tall American with a \\"wholesome\\" smile).  As a result, the reader can't connect to any of the places or visualize the places.  And the story is unwoven as if the reader were 10-years-old; everything is literally spelled out ever so repetitively.  Just painful.  I want my money back!

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved Hunger Games and I loved Catching Fire as well. Yes it's the middle book and yes it reflects on what happened in the first book but it's a necessary evil if we are to get to the conclusion.  Young and not so young readers will enjoy this book in my opinion.
0439023521|2.0|I arrived on amazon.com to see how others reacted to reading this book. I must say I am completely floored by all the 5-star ratings. I expected 3-4 stars.<br /><br />>>No spoilers. Some plot revealing.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />My reasons for my rating are few and simple. The targeted audience and level of writing seems to be written for pre-teens. Yet there's a clear love story and love triangle that sounds very much like adult books, which dominates the second portion of the book. Also, do you really want kids to be reading about a battle royal where kids are killing kids? You can't write a book with such juxtapositions and expect adults and parents to be too excited about having their kid read this book. I'm never going to let my little girl even think about reading this. It would give her nightmares.<br /><br />Another reason I rated this with two stars is because the story is utterly predictable, which I hate. The story also stops in its tracks at the end. When I got to the last page I felt like shouting: \\"really? REALLY?\\" IT may as well say: \\"haha! Now if you want the story to continue you have to buy the next book!\\" This is a Hollywood book. Need I say more?<br /><br />This first book of the hunger games is also, in my opinion, a more flamboyant form of the famous short story: \\"The Most Dangerous Game.\\"<br /><br />I will say this: I can see a gaggle of girls ( kindla like the ones who love twilight saga so much) totally flippin' out over this book. It's got a girl who is a hardcore tomboy (yet still likes boys) totally dominate a fight-to-the-death arena. A love story as well? This can be bliss for some readers; however, get an older well versed reader like me and I have to try my hardest just to finish reading the book.
0385344325|4.0|If you are a fan of Jack Reacher, then you will want to read this latest installment by Lee Child. It has all of the classic elements of his other books. It is, in fact, a prequel to all the other works. It provides some insight into Reacher's odd habits, and the history behind what makes him tick. An enjoyable read. Thumbs up!
0385732554|5.0|Growing up, I always loved literature. I began reading by the age of almost 4 and I haven't stopped since. In the eighth grade, my middle school homeroom began to read a novel called \\"The Giver\\", however, just as we began to read the novel, I moved across the country here to small-town Montana. To my surprise when I got to Montana, my english class was reading the novel too, but they were just finishing it. It surprises me that I remember these events to this day in my senior year, but back then, I never really got interested in the book. This was not because the book was not good, because it is a wonderful novel, but because at the time, I could not grasp the social concepts behind it. I have now returned to the novel and read it twice for my semester project. Lois Lowry truly wrote a spectacular novel.  The Giver is a story about Jonas and his recieving of the role infamously known as \\"The Reciever.\\" As Reciever, Jonas begins to know of the things that float in existence without the knowledge of the community. Things like pain, hurt, sadness, and loneliness are emotions that the community is simply not aware of. Jonas recieves these feelings through memories of the past, given to him by \\"The Giver\\", hence the novel's name.  The Giver has too many concepts hidden behind it to simply discuss them, and I believe that is what led to its multiple bannings, but things like social oppression, abortion, and individuality, are all alluded to within the novel. Jonas struggles to accept such evils and decides to rebel, but I'll leave the rest to the reader.   Simply put, \\"The Giver\\" is a must-read. I think that is the reason that it was being read in my Florida class, and also being read across the country in Montana. I absolutely recommend you to click the add to cart button above and prepare yourself for an absolutely fantastic read.
B000093BDX|1.0|This review is on the sound quality of \\"Sounds of Summer: Very Best of The Beach Boys\\" . The music speaks for itself. I found playback on my computer (tried multiple drives) was terrible on tracks 2,3,5,7,10,11,12,21,22,26,27,28, and 30. I played them on my car stereo and home DVD player and they sounded much better. This is still a Major disappointment. The rest of the CD was fine on what ever I played them on.  Cannot listen to the troubled tracks on my mp3 player. I agree with another reviewer who said \\"Endless Summer\\" is a much better collection of Beach Boys music(sounding). My opinion is, if its for the car or home CD player only, go ahead and buy it. If your gonna go digital with it..run away fast, it shouldn't be able to catch you.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|It's been nearly a year since this documentary was released.  I just watched it for the first time and now  the current world economic woes make sense.  As does the Occupy Wall Street movement, which should use this movie as its signature explanation.  I've been wondering why the U.S. economy hasn't gotten better (this is the economy I live in, don't feel qualified to comment on the rest of the world).  The answer seems simple and tragic:  the wolves are guarding the hen house.  Additionally, these are very smart wolves infused with greed and hubris.    The moment in the flim that sent my  dejection over the top and my hope into annihilation was the clip of Obama touting deregulation during his campaign, followed by his appointment of multiple \\"wolves\\" who had actively toppled our economy - i.e. the Wall Street insiders for whom this film is named.  This film has armed me with a new perspective and information which will be invaluable in my personal economic planning.

B003CN4R74|5.0|In the past I have only been a casual Evanescence fan.  I liked the stuff played on the radio, but never felt the urge to buy one of their albums.  A friend of mine highly recommended their self-titled release, so I downloaded it from Itunes and proceeded to be blown away.  I had no idea this band rocked so awesomely.  You can hear true passion in their music, something which is sorely lacking in most bands today.  There are no low spots, no fillers.  I never got bored.  It's like the album carries you on a wave from beginning to end, gently rocking you and kicking your butt at the same time.  This album proves without a doubt that Amy is the best rock vocalist alive today.  Not only does she have an amazing voice, she is also a perfectionist.  She's not lazy with pitch and pronunciation.  She hits every note and every word is clear as a bell, while at the same time being delivered through that maelstrom of passion or creative energy that obviously thrives in her.    The songwriting is good, so good that it became very evident to me why the album is self-titled.  It's not only a new start but also a restatement of what Evanescence is, what they can do, what they're all about.  Their sound isn't reinvented, but rather invigorated with new energy. Refocused, if you will.    The only criticism I would offer is that Amy's voice is so strong that it can seem like the rest of the band is just backup for her performance.  It would help if the guitarist recognized that there are other notes on the guitar besides low E.  Instead of just sticking to rhythm guitar, it would be nice if he did a solo once in a while.  Let the bass pop through occasionally.  The other musicans in the band need to bring out their own \\"voices\\" more.  Anyway, I very highly recommend this album, to metalheads and pop rockers alike.

1402217722|5.0|This is not actually a review, but a historical commentary.  I apologize to any who find it inappropriate here.   /The Convenient Marriage/ has always been one of my favorite Heyers, but it was only very recently that I found that the characters were inspired by real life counterparts.  Elizabeth, Charlotte and Anna Horatia were the Waldegrave sisters, the subject of a painting by Sir Joshua Reynolds.  Even a rough outline of their lives and times is a romance in itself.   [do an online search for \\"Ladies Waldegrave\\".  I recommend the commentary at 'The Duchess of Devonshire's Gossip Guide to the 18th Century'.]  While Charlotte Winwood states that \\"marriage is repugnant\\", Charlotte Waldegrave married George Fitzroy, Earl of Euston (later 4th Duke of Grafton), the inspiration for the Earl of Rule.  Their descendant, the current (12th) Duke of Grafton succeeded to the title in 2011, and is now managing the extensive estates and properties, but he previously had employment as a radio host in Nashville, Tennessee, and merchandising coordinator for the \\"A Bigger Bang Tour\\" of the Rolling Stones.  Times do change, don't they!  [search for \\"4th Duke of Grafton\\". The picture in Wikipedia is not very good, but I cannot find another.]  Anne Horatia Waldegrave married Captain (later Vice-Admiral) Lord Hugh Seymour.  She had seven children and is a direct ancestor of Princess Diana.  Yes, the eyebrows were notable.  [search for \\"Anne Horatia Seymour\\".  I favor Wikipedia's copy of the miniature, but my sister prefers a portrait of her by Gainsborough, painted before her marriage.]  I hope this information will increase the enjoyment of readers both old and new.

I was one of the few who did not like \\"Shakespeare in Love.\\"  I thought the idea of making Shakespeare look like an idiot was offensive to the man who created the most inspired works of English literature - of unmitigated genius.  Then this film comes along and introduces a Shakespeare even more ridiculous - even illiterate - can't even write letters.   I understand that there are some scholars who dispute Shakespeare's authorship.  Although I side with the view that these scholars are wrong - there are at least some serious arguments.  This film ignores all of it.  [Even Queen Elizabeth seems unable to make decisions without the guidance of her counselors].  Please miss this one.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|This second season becomes tricky since it starts with the father's death and ends with his temporary resurrection in order to be redeemed. At the same time Dean is dying and his father exchanges his own life for Dean's but yet gives Dean the mission to look after Sam and save him, or kill him if he can't protect and save him. It ends with Dean doing the same bargaining as his father for the life of Sam who was killed in the dead western city of Cold Oak. Dean manages to get one year of living before he is reclaimed.<br /><br />This second season tells us too a little more about the demons. Apart from the everyday black-eyed demons who are tortured souls that stopped being human and became demons, there is a particular and more powerful one, the yellow-eyed demon, and though we are not told what or who he really is, he is what we can call a higher class demon. He is the one who accepted to take John's life in the place of Dean's. He is the one who has chosen Sam for a special mission that will be uncovered during this second season. What is that mission?<br /><br />Strangely enough all the hunting is for that yellow-eyed demon nothing but training for Sam and the training is not only directed at Sam. This second season is focusing on the hunting by the two brothers of the yellow-eyed demon. But, this seems to be part of a plan elaborated by him to train Sam and make him understand his importance and his uniqueness. With others like him, that are called \\"psychic\\" in the series, they have been selected by this special demon to accomplish a task, that is to say lead the demonic army that is to break loose from Hell. Of these \\"psychic\\", Sam will meet four of them, but there are more, all born on the same year 1983, and whose mothers all died in a nursery fire. We come across them now and then but they do not seem to be very resilient. In a final attempt at selecting the right \\"general\\" to bring in the armies of Hell out of the deep,he brings together four psychic and a black veteran from Afghanistan (who also has special abilities in a dead western city, Cold Oak in South Dakota, for the sole survivor to accomplish the mission.<br /><br />The Black chap, Jake, will manage, under blackmail from the yellow-eyed monster and menaces against his mother and sister, to kill Sam by cutting his spine through. He is an obviously well trained GI. But Dean will manage to revive Sam by a trip to Crossroads Inn, Mississippi to meet with a crossroad demon, that grants wishes that was tracked down in a previous episode, and to bargain his life against Sam's. He will get a one year survival time for himself. But that enables the two brothers to go to Bobby who had noticed that evil and demonic elements were concentrating around a special zone in Wyoming.<br /><br />Sam will actually find out that in this sector there is a cemetery and a crypt in the center, built by Samuel Colt surrounded by churches connected by railroads building up a pentacle or pentagram, which is called in the series a \\"devil's trap\\", that can imprison demons if they enter it. The crypt in the cemetery is supposed to be the gate to hell, the gateway through which the armies of Hell will invade the earth. This is an important specification in the series. Several episodes are openly dedicated to Catholic beliefs: angels for one, but also a Catholic priest in a Catholic church who is shot dead on the steps to his church and cannot receive the last rites. He becomes a haunting ghost and is redeemed by the priest of the church.<br /><br />This leads to a discussion that emerges several times on the existence of angels. Dean does not believe. Sam does believe. This definitely gives the series a Christian if not Catholic ring, especially with the number of times the Catholic exorcizing rite or ritual chant is used, though it is never uttered by a priest in the series, which makes it surprisingly iconoclastic. Never people believing in exorcism would consider a lay man could performthe rite. It is the same thing with the use of holy water. For example when Ellen, the inn-keeping lady of the roadside diner that is a meeting place for spirit hunters, comes at the end of the season for help after her diner and everyone in it were burnt to ashes, she is asked to drink a glass of holy water to make sure she is not possessed. This is definitely Catholic, but at the same time always performed by non-believers or even atheists. This is a reference to a religion from the point of view of people who are totally unconcerned by it as if you may not believe in God but God believes in you. Does he?<br /><br />The special gun John Winchester had saved and kept for its final task and that he had traded with the yellow-eyed demon for Dean's life and that still had one special bullet, was in fact the key to the door of the crypt that enables the armies of hell to come into this world. But the weapon only and not the bullet. The gun was recuperated, too late, by the Winchesters and the bullet killed the yellow-eyed demon, or can we be sure it did?<br /><br />That's when the tale turned ironical and sour. The poor Jake who had accepted, willy nilly and more nilly than willy, to be the servant of the demon did manage to open the gate and thus to enable the yellow-eyed demon to enter the final pentacle, but he was shot on the spot by the Winchesters. He probably died smiling since he thus saved his mother and his sister. But he got nothing out of the deal at all. That's the irony of those devilish missions: the possessed do what they are supposed to do, and at times it takes a lot of energy from the demon to convince them. Like in this special case, where Jack has a mission that a demon or a possessed human could not accomplish since they could not enter the pentacle, but otherwise demons only take possession of human bodies and use them as \\"meat suits\\"<br /><br />But this second season has a touch of itself first of all in the constant debate about the worthiness of the fight, the worthiness of one brother being ready to die for the other and vice versa (if it were true they might even die together one on top of the one on top of himself.) This debate is constant, deep in many ways and perfectly well acted for us to believe that what is mostly a verbal claim no one ever makes true is probably true for these two brothers. That the father accepts to die in the place of his sons is normal since his sons are his heirs, his continuation into eternal human life. But for two brothers it is surprising especially since in our common vision of two brothers, even twins, and these are no twins, there is always some amount of hostility when it is not hatred and jealousy, which is indeed present in these two brothers. That can be explained by the fact they grew up apart from the world, taking care of each other while their father was hunting this yellow-eyed demon that killed his wife/their mother. Also, the animosity would rather be localized between Sam and John, Dean being the lever, the path between these two characters that have antagonistic trajectories.<br /><br />Those two brothers are so much in love with one another that they are ready to sacrifice their whole life for an adventure together. This is not inhuman. This is superhuman. This is an idealistic vision and the actors make us believe it is true, possible. That level of intimacy between two brothers is admirable and beautiful, even if, deep behind my mind's eye I kind of doubt it a little bit.<br /><br />There is a last remark I want to make on this season. The South was finally represented this year with Mississippi, but in a rather unfavorable light as a place of demons, curses and other devilish traffics. Yet Mississippi is the place where the resurrection of Sam is purchased. We are no longer dealing with anything Christian here but with something like voodoo, the originally African religion of the Blacks in the South that has survived in spite of all the Christianizing performed by the whites over the centuries.<br /><br />But this leads to the plain fact that all black characters are evil in a way or another, either because they are easily manipulated by some demon or evil mind, or because they are sort of genetically evil, even Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is shown as unable to see beyond his book of rules, and who is turned upside down and made a fool of by the two Winchester brothers and their female and not so much experienced lawyer. And fooled is a euphemism: he turns out to be a plain dummie. But the FBI agent will remain on the tracks of course because he is a Fox Beyond and you may choose, Insanity, Intelligence, Intuition or Impotence.<br /><br />We could say that they are doing wrong while hoping to do good : naïve would be a better word to describe them. Jack is hoping to save the ones he loves, but doesn't understand that the whole planet will die, while the Winchesters brothers are willing to die for the sake of humanity. The FBI agent is not trying to understand what is going on but wants to catch two fugitives that are threats to his un-supernatural world, where a ghost belongs in a book. He is too rational to understand, maybe to good at what he does to think outside his pragmatic, Cartesian referential mind. And he lacks the creativity or the beliefs that what is really and what he sees are two different things.<br /><br />The season ends well since it has finally redeemed the father and created a tremendous suspense as for the future since in twelve months Dean will die. That's not much time with all the evil spirits that have been released from hell.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVEnd vice versa (if it were true they might even die together one on top of the one on top of himself.)

0321687299|5.0|Even if we introduced HTML5 in our projects more than a year ago in our company, we are still surprised about the information that this book provides us with. There are plenty of tutorials on HTML5 on the Internet but few seem to be complete and well structured. This is exactly what this book does for us, it provides a complete and well structured reference on HTML5 with a great professional approach and real life examples.  I used it as a reference when dealing with our mobile applications for which we've built a heavy frontend interface with HTML5. The HTML5 Audio/Video, Geolocation, Canvas and Data Storage sections were very helpful.  You can find robust information on Web Sockets in the the Real Time chapter. If you haven't started using them in production yet, then you should.  I've been always confused about the new goodies that HTML5 introduced for Web Forms. Well, this book made them very clear for me now. Using the new HTML5 Form tricks saves you a lot of Javascript scripting and hacking time.  But wait, how about the old browsers? Is HTML5 worth using in production while old browsers don't support it? Should we do double work for providing a complete HTML structure for other browsers that don't support HTML5? Apparently not. This is what the last chapter of the book teaches us about - polyfilling and patching old browsers so that you can be sure your Web interface works well on all browsers. Polyfilling saves you a lot of time.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|As one of the top five films of 2011, and with its fantastic soundtrack and strong visuals, Drive should be eagerly anticipated on blu-ray. If you are blind-buying this, you should know two things: First, Drive is no Fast/Furious spin-off. That much was obvious when its Danish director won Best Director at Cannes. Car chases and stunts take a back seat to great acting by Ryan Gosling (Blue Valentine, Crazy Stupid Love), Carey Mulligan (An Education, Pride & Prejudice) and Al Brooks (Broadcast News, The Simpsons). Second, the film is at times dark, moody and bloody. The violence is not overly gratuitous, compared to many R-rated films, but may shock some viewers who are watching this because they liked The Notebook. I strongly suggest avoiding the trailers (which reveal too much plot) and instead get a feel for the film by listening to its soundtrack on YouTube.
B003L77GG0|2.0|First let me start by saying I loved Smallville. I watched my first episode in 2007 and quickly caught up with the previous episodes and currently own seasons 1-9. I loved that the writers tried to be as balanced and fair as possible. I also loved the energy of the show!  I missed the first two episodes, but made sure to catch Homecoming. I couldn't believe the direction the show was talking with its not-so subtle jabs at \\"embracing illegal immigrants\\"  I was surprised, because the same sort of comment had been made in the previous episode too. Wasn't it Lois who said in season six, \\"does breaking and entering not mean anything to rich people?\\" But the message seemed to be that it's okay to enter another country as long as it's done by a someone living in poverty- then you don't need to follow the rules. I didn't like the overall disrespect that the military was given in this season. They were portrayed as villains' and I expected more balance.  I also expected a stronger story. I think the thing writers and producers of comics need to remember is that in fantasy/sci-fi a hero is only as credible as the villain. Replacing strong villains' like Doomsday, Zod, and Lex with a boorish, contrived and ghost-like character that preys on people like some evil little devil sitting on their shoulder is childish and insulting to the viewer.  There were also a few sloppy episodes that made me cringe. A bachelor party themed episode where they wake up and don't know what happened? It was so hard to watch them act drunk, and what was worse was the lines seemed like they were being made up as the actors went along.   Again, I would just urge people to think twice before purchasing this season. I'm glad I saw the epiodes I did, because I will not be buying this propaganda soap box season and the political bru ha ha that took away from the really genuine and beautiful relationship that Lois and Clark were finally able to have.   I would also love to see how that relationship ended,but the constant insinuation that only a corrupt individual would ask people to enter a country legally was just too much. My Grandmother came to this country legally at time when her country was at war and everyone was starving, yet she still managed to enter the US by abiding all laws. To suggest that its' okay to just enter a country, because \\"they only want the opportunities that you and your family have\\" (As Oliver's lines stated) is a slap in the face to all those who respected the laws of their future country.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it, which was on Amazon Instant Video, of course. I loved the acting, I thought the actors were cast well and they did a fabulous job of carrying their parts. I loved the story. It was remarkable. It kept me guessing the whole time, and it wasn't predictable. The worst thing about movies are predictabilities. If it's predictable, it isn't worth watching, in my opinion.
1451627289|5.0|It's been a bit now since Stephen King clawed his way out of the low rent neighborhood of \\"horror writer.\\" His ability to generate bestsellers has never been questioned, but nowadays he's being touted as a national treasure, one of America's great writers. And that's very cool. Thanks to his rabid \\"constant readers\\" and his sheer asskickery as a storyteller, Stephen King's brand has become mainstream. His latest, 11/22/63, is about time travel and alternate histories, two favorite sci-fi tropes. It is stupefyingly good. It blisters by at more than 800 pages long, even though the unabridged edition of THE STAND and even King's more recent UNDER THE DOME tend to sneer at the \\"more than 800 pages long\\" remark.<br /><br />\\"The past does not want to be changed. The past is obdurate.\\" And Jake Epping of Lisbon Falls, Maine, a divorced 35-year-old high school teacher, is about to learn this truth. This truth, in fact, will do its very best to kill him, to stump him. At the behest of a dying friend, Jake Epping wanders thru a local vintage diner in 2011 and steps into the past, specifically into a warm early afternoon in 1958. One of the novel's conceits is that repeated trips to the past will always yield the same warm early afternoon in 1958. And that whatever the traveler has tweaked during his time in the past will reset with the next trip back. There are primal forces at work which punish any attempt to alter continuity. The more significant the tweak, the more horrific the consequence. But Jake Epping, your quintessential good samaritan, figures to save lives. He means to keep a young girl from a destined paralysis. He intends to avert the bloody murder (via sledgehammer) of a battered family. He aims to prevent JFK's assassination. But, yeah, there are forces at work. You've heard of the butterfly effect?<br /><br />The usual trappings of time travel are touched on. For example, the man from the future, aware of events yet to come, is able to afford himself a source of income. But since the book's premise also calls for a whiff of GROUNDHOG DAY, we see that element also come into play. King put a lot of thought into this, and I appreciate the thoroughness and the payoffs of the many callbacks.<br /><br />First of all, you must commend Stephen King for having the huevos grandes to tackle this. He offers up his own conspiracy theory, weaves his narrative around it. Humongous, painstaking research obviously went into the writing and the result is one of King's most personal works. Not that I lived in the 1958-1963 era but, man, the minutiae of detail, the breadth of pop culture color, that King weaves in is remarkable. It lends believability and depth and a sense of immediacy. It sinks you into the era. Particularly gripping is his passage describing the Cuban missile crisis. One forgets how apocalyptic that stand off of super powers must have seemed to the inhabitants of 1962. King brings that all back.<br /><br />King applies the storytelling mechanics he's honed down the decades. He's arrived at a point now when he can dispense with simple shock horror. As ever, he's effortless in conjuring that sense of escalating suspense. He does use some old trickeration. He drops in moments of foreboding, ominous imagery which then return time and again to haunt our schoolteacher. King espouses the harmonizing aspect of time travel, theorizing that echoes of past events and characters have a habit of resurfacing. And this temporal quirk actually works in Jake's favor. He begins to recognize certain patterns. If you're a fan of IT, you are in for an awesome treat as, in 1958, Jake spends time in the nasty town of Derry - which had just endured a spate of brutal child killings - and runs into two characters from that novel. Derry, dangerous and malevolent, prepares Jake for the unwholesomeness of Dallas.<br /><br />In the past, Jake Epping divides his time between living a personal life and tracking the whereabouts of one Lee Harvey Oswald.In essense we read about Jake keeping vigil and preparing for five years, waiting for that one tragic date to finally come along. And since I'm not a conspiracy fool I cared more about Jake's doings in his personal life than the time he spends stalking Oswald. In Jodie, Texas, Jake finds himself at home, finds himself at ease with the tiny town and its friendly population. In the past, Jake meets the love of his life, and it's one of the best, most fleshed out love stories Stephen King has ever written. His time in Jodie rewards the reader with many indelible moments, with Jake's little triumphs and how he's made a difference in that town. I hated his having to move on to complete his mission in Dallas.<br /><br />11/22/63 surges (and plods here and there) and surges. Stephen King is at the peak of his storytelling badassery, and we should revel in that. This is compulsive reading. It is epic and immersive and it also gives us one more catchy euphemism for having sex. And if you think that the perpetuation of this modern Camelot rewards us with unending love, peace, and cheesecake... well, this Grandmaster of Fear may have an unexpected fallout in mind. Temporal causality is a mother.In essense we read about Jake keeping vigil and preparing for five years, waiting for that one tragic date to finally come along.

B005YGCSRI|5.0|This is just a quick review about what you can expect from this Steelbook set.I was one of the Die-hard Jurassic park fans that arrived at Best Buy before it opened to make sure I got my \\"Raptor Claws\\" on this! Although the price has gotten a little out of hand, I feel it is essential to fans of this series... The Steelbook case IS DVD sized, which is the only bummer. The Jurassic Park logo on the front is slightly embossed, and the collection ends up being a 6 disc set(3 blurays & 3 Dvds). The Digital copies are simply downloaded from universal using the paper insert that contains all 3 codes. Overall I am glad I went with steelbook. If you can live with the fact that this set will be taller than all your other bluray cases, you won't be disappointed...
0385534639|5.0|Magical, lyrical, this book did exactly what I wanted it to - took me away to a fantastic place with memorable characters. All of the buzz is justified. Just make sure you have your agenda cleared when you begin...it's definitely a book you'll want to read in one sitting!
B0064Y5U24|5.0|Half the songs are worth downloading, the other half are nothing special. Its hard to live up to Dark Horse, but this album is still pretty good.
0316134082|5.0|I love this series!! These collector books are high quality and our perfect for yourself and also to give as a gift.
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|Great work by the Criterion Collection by adding all those extra features to the DVD package. The quality of the picture and sound are great. If you really want to see art on the screen, watch Chaplin's work. You will be surprised!!!!
0525423656|2.0|My biggest issue with Matched were the characters. As a reader, I felt as if I had no idea who these characters were. They weren't fully developed. While I'd hoped they might be more three-dimensional with the release of the sequel to Matched, unfortunately, that's not the case. I think the author did a real disservice to herself here by having two narrators with nearly indistinguishable voices. Cassia's chapters could have just as easily been Ky's.   However, that doesn't matter as much as the fact that NOTHING OF SIGNIFICANCE HAPPENS in 300+ pages. Readers don't discover anything earth-shattering, there's no sense of real conflict, there are no cliff-hangers, etc...  And Emmy seems to have disappeared completely in the sequel.
B005YDLJ76|3.0|This DVD is nothing special, and this is coming from a Beyonce fan. It's nice to hear the 4 tracks, but it just starts off too slow. This might as well be the I Am... Yours DVD with the same \\"story telling\\" part. It's like she thinks nobody has seen her concert DVD's. A plus, there's brand new footage from Bey's personal home videos, but they come in small clips. If this is your first time buying a Beyonce concert DVD, check out the other ones. This one won't impress you.
0142410705|5.0|John Green is an absolutely terrific writer. He has this utterly unique style, one that you cant reproduce even if trying extremely hard. He writes this incredible stories, with strange plots; plots that you dont see a lot in the market. They are not about witches, or wolves, or vampires (that is totally not his target) or even regular stories with regular kids to whom happen strange things. Its about special people with special situations in our present: situations that are so weird, and are presented in such a way that you find you have never read something like this before.<br />I dont know how this guy does it, but he comes up with stories that can blow your mind and change your perspectives about life.<br />\\"An abundance of Katherines\\" is a book that narrates the story of Colin Singleton, a child prodigy and probably-not-ever-going-to-be genius. Him being a (lets face it) total nerd for his whole life (doesnt have friends, reads 400 pages of a book per day since he was little, remembers totally random facts because he finds them interesting and basically, knows about everything that could come to mind, like why the shower curtain behaves the way it does when you turn on the shower),he still has achieved to be in romantic relationships with 19 girls, that, coincidentally (?), were all named Katherine (as he said: Not Cathy, Katie, Katy, or, god forbid, Catherine. Just Katherine. K-a-t-h-e-r-i-n-e). Also, coincidentally, they have all dumped him for the same reasons. He considers himself a Dumpee, and, after breaking up (aka being dumped) with Katherine the Nineteenth, he decides to go on a roadtrip with his only friend, the Arab Hassan, to determine why he has this fixation with Katherines, and why the story always repeats itself. But mostly, he just wants to mend his heart.<br />And so, the adventure begins.<br />Full of random facts, laugh-out-loud conversations, super wierd situations, math equations, graphics, and questions, this story will make its way to your heart. I didnt really know how John Green could make a character and a story like this work, but he absolutely did, and brilliantly so, I might add. Colin is, believe it or not, a likeable character, and the people he meets on the journey are hands-down great. Hassan, although annoying, is really funny and entertaining.<br />I cant say this book struck me as \\"Looking for Alaska\\" did, because that would be a huge lie. \\"Alaska\\" touched my heart in a way only a few books can, and made me understand the paradigms through which I saw and see the world and my own life. This book didnt go as deep, at least not for me, but it did have important lessons, ones to really pay attention to, specially regarding the future and human predictability.<br />To summarize, John Green did it again. He wrote a fantastic book, one with his signature all over it; \\"An abundance of Katherines\\" is one of those books that by now all of us know only he can write.<br />Although it, indeed, has a lot of math and stuff, its certainly entertaining and adds to the books quality and innovation. You should definitely read it, and it will surely make you have a really great time: you will laugh a lot and learn from it too.
0486478998|4.0|This book explains how the subconscious mind works and how you can have it work for you.  I enjoyed it and recommend it to those who have an interest in using their subconscious to better their lives.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|One of my favorite movies of the year, and of the last decade. Great excitement and twist at the end that I didn't see coming.
0525951652|5.0|What a wonderfully creative primer on the events, pivotal decisions, and key players involved in the outbreak of WWI, the war itself, the Russian Revolution, and the post war stage-setting for the rise of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Empire.  Once again, Follett amasses a fantastic array of intriguing characters you care about and cleverly interweaves their fast-paced tales of personal drama with well-researched history.  Follett brings history alive with this page-turner.  I eagerly anticipate the second and third books in his trilogy.
B000LPLTX6|1.0|One of the worst movies I've seen, and it looked really cool from the preview. The first 45 min - boring, boring, boring, repetitive, boring. I can't believe a movie like this gets higher stars than Tombstone or 300.
B004UXUUDA|3.0|As far as the movie's writing and directing both were well conceived but offered little new to our list of Holocaust stories other than preserve and remind us of what humans can do to each other. It seemed very \\"Diary of ...\\" like. Acting was superb. My main criticism is that the story seemed too scattered amongst all the parties presented and didn't spend much time on Sarah's family and most importantly on Sarah herself as she grew older. We are given little if no insight into her experiences and thoughts. She suddenly kills herself in a bizarre fashion. Sarah's story as an adult seemed too little and too disjointed.   On a separate thought I was struck by the parallel between what it was like to live as a Jew in those times and what it is like to live as a Palestinian in these times. Hopefully the conservative Israeli Jewish community can see that parallel also.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|I was expecting more, given the super cast and Sly's recent string of awesome hits in which he directed, including Rambo and Rocky Balboa. The dialogue, especially in the beginning, seemed really forced. It starts to work itself out towards the middle, but still nothing compared to what it could have been. The awesome action saves the movie. This cast, this director, in this era of filmmaking could have been one of the coolest ever.
B005V20JKI|5.0|This game is like mario brothers original platform. You can easily connect with a friend and play head to head or help each other unlock supet fast. Game does freeze on occassion if you let the game sit too long. Maybe my phone is just slow. Vibrant 2.2 not root
B000V39KDO|5.0|This is one of the top best movies of all time. Action, bad ass lines, action, more bad ass lines, action. Too bad there are so many idiots that mistake the RATING of the movie for the FEEDBACK. Two different things. Average IQ of 100 at work.
B000FBFN1U|1.0|I read the reviews of this book and wonder \\"did they read the same book I did?\\"  I struggled through half, and started skipping over.  Then I read the sequel, and am depressed all over again.  It's even SLOWER?  And more depressing?  I'm so vested in this series that I feel like I have to continue, but man o man... its a drudge.    I understand realism.  I understand the realities of war.  But, come on... the skipping around is making me dizzy, the digression and the \\"building\\" has now made me insensitive, and any sort of climax is just somone dying.  Horriffically.  And you start to not give a **** about any of the characters because you don't DARE to.  He's gonna kill them off.  Mercilessly. He seems to hate his characters, and sadistically toy with them (and us). And apathey in readers is never a good thing.  What keeps me reading the series (beyond being so vested in it after ALL THESE PAGES) is the \\"feel\\" of the historical aspect, the warfare, the fantasy/ritual aspect is fantastic... I feel like it COULD be so deep and wonderful, and it is depressing and sadistic.  A review is an opinion, and I couldn't let all those 5 star ratings go without my 1 star opinion. Slow, tedious, boring, depressing and dull.  Sorry. Read the reviews on the next book and more agree.  Gods I hope it gets better.
B004A8ZX2I|4.0|4.5 stars, only because I guess when you compare it to Liam's \\"Taken\\" from a few years earlier, it was a slight let down, but on its own it is a very good action-mystery.
B001HN6922|2.0|The sequel to such a loved movie was definitely a letdown when compared to the original and other Pixar titles.  My son (age 5) loves it however I thought it was just ok.  There isn't any discussion as to where Doc went or why, that is left up to the viewer to notice and figure out.  I thought the amount of car on car violence was a bit high for Pixar movie as well.  The plot was too complicated for kids to really understand and the usual nod to the adults Pixar is famous for was missing.  I found it to be disappointing which is a rarity for a Pixar movie in our house.
B003YLM780|5.0|Great movie. It was preserved beautifully. The added features, including a biography on Bing and Fred,were superb.I has made a wonderful gift for my parents.   Love it!
1439102732|4.0|Sing You Home deals with a number of difficult issues.  My disclaimer, I love Jodi Picoult's books and have all of them.  This is not my favorite (Handle with Care is), it is a good read though.    Issues dealt with:  Homosexuality and same sex marriages  Right to life  Religious fanaticism  The book is told from the perspective of the two main characters.  Neither are necessarily \\"bad\\" people, one is simply very misguided and influenced.  He allows religious beliefs that he isn't fully convicted in to determine is his course of action all the while being driven by the hidden agendas of religious leaders.  The book is worth reading, if nothing else to make you think about where you stand on these issues.  As with all of Picoult's books, there is a hint of \\"this could happen\\" that makes you think about where you truly stand.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I purchased this ebook randomly and loved every minute of it. I thought the story was believable and unbelievable at the same time. The twists and turns were unpredictable at times. It was a quick read but a great read. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes mystery, suspense, drama, and misdirection.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is great on the Kindle Fire. Actually formatted in a more easy way. I really like it.  I am addicted to Evernote.  The Kindle Fire app uses a great grid box format.
0385738773|4.0|This book kept me reading none stop. I am talking about waking up early to read and staying up late reading. This trilogy, next to the hunger games, is one of my all time favorite reads. For me, the first two books in this trilogy were better then the last one. But, the last one did still hook me in. I recommend this to people who love adventure, mystery, and drama. If you like this trilogy, check out The Hunger Games!!!!!!!!!! :)
B0053TMP24|5.0|As always Rick Riordan has done it again.This was a perfect addition to the Heros of Olympus saga.I`m not gonna give away any major spoilers in this review but I will mention one thing.The two new characters,Hazel and Frank, were a great addition to the list of characters.I was glued to this book right after I got it.If you want to read this series,START WITH THE FIRST SERIES PERCY JACKSON AND THE OLYMPIANS,PLEASE!!!!!!!!You will be asking a lot of questions if you don`t but I recommend The Son of Neptune.I can`t wait for The Mark of Athena!Long live Percy  Jackson!!!!!!<br />P.S. If you gave this book a rating of less than five stars or will, SHUT UP!!!!!!!!
B005LJJ3IU|1.0|Im hesitant to even give this movie a 1 star review. If you remove the curse words, this movie would only be 10 minutes long.
B00354Y9ZU|2.0|The book has interesting stories which are disseminated all over. Some parts are a bit boring which i skimmed through rather than read. It all looks like a series of independent blogs compiled in a book.
B000JQUQZO|5.0|Marcus Aurelius was the last of a group of \\"good\\" Roman Emperors.  His profile was raised most recently in the \\"Gladiator\\" film, where appears as a benevolent leader of an increasingly corrupt empire.  If his thoughts as outlined in this document are any indication, then the movie portrayal Marcus Aurelius is not far from the truth.  These thoughts appear piecemeal as epiphanies written by the Emperor between 170-180 AD.  Aurelius considered himself a philosopher, which was the equivalent of a dedicated scientist in his day.  He believed in a life of humble service and dedication to improving the world around him.  His view of world included the need to better understand and forgive others for their shortcomings.  It is a window into the Romans view of how to ideally conduct themselves in public and private life that is incredibly fascinating.<br /><br />The content and tone of these writings belies the fact that Marcus Aurelius governed an area that reached from Britain to Egypt (most of modern Europe and the Middle East).  \\"Alone of the emperors,\\" wrote the historian Herodian, \\"he gave proof of his learning not by mere words or knowledge of philosophical doctrines but by his blameless character and temperate way of life.\\" (From Wikipedia).  There is a tone and tenor to his writings that aligns well the Christian doctrines that will soon transform Europe.  \\"If any man has done wrong, then the harm is his own\\" (location 1403-7, Kindle Edition).<br /><br />So much of the modern western world owes its foundation to the Roman Republic and Empire.  If you wish to better understand the decline and fall of modern republics (and empires), then all roads still lead to Rome as the model for the demise of democratic governments.  The distance of nearly 2000 years melts away and you might find yourself wishing for an opportunity to meet the man who many consider the greatest Roman Emperor.
0618871713|5.0|Great book! I purchase it for a college course and absolutely loved it! The graphic novel style of the book makes it an easy read.
B005HSL626|5.0|the app is so addicting.  screw the complaints on adds there aren't that many. this is a great game. when I first got it I thought it might not be as good as the one you have to buy but there's no difference.
B0051CSIKQ|2.0|I see quite a few positive reviews of this movie and I simply do NOT get it.  There was no depth to the characters, nondescript acting and way too much blood and gore.  Oh, and the plot was what????????????    I love horror and I love vampire movies, but these  creatures looked like a cross between zombies and vampires.  I like movies with vampires that look like vampires, not ones that look like half-eaten undead.  And that touching music along with all that spewing blood and gore simply did not go together.    All this movie did that was positive was what it did for the producers, which was set up everything for a sequel.  Wish I could get back the time I wasted on this piece of trash.....
B004WO774M|1.0|Unfortunately I was on deployment when this DVD was on sale at Walmart and only recently discovered (a few minutes ago) that they were the sole distributors of this product.  I was hoping to find a used copy but with the going price of well over $100.00 for something that originally sold for about $20.00 there's no chance of that happening!  I also found out today that Walmart has the Part 2 2-Disc for sale and I will be picking up a copy tomorrow because I'm quite sure the same thing will happen as before with it being sold out within a few days and having to deal with the blood-sucking scalpers wanting their insane markup!

B005DZMODI|5.0|I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this!  From the opening number every musician on that stage is into this and swinging madly, and you know they are having a blast!  Does that audience know which guitarist is sitting up there?  You bet they do, and Eric doesn't disappoint, right from his dirty guitar in the opening number, Ice Cream.  Yes, his voice just keeps getting better and better! Wynton set this up with a Dixieland feel, but it isn't Dixieland, and never can you forget that it is the blues.  My brother, Chet, a professional guitarist, standing on his feet with me at the end, said, \\"You know Louis is on his feet up there with us, this is Wynton, keeping it alive in the digital age!\\"  This CD has Grammy Award written all over it!  Run, don't walk, to pick up this CD, you won't be disappointed!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|beat game ever I am happy with the graphics some levels are pretty hard but if they aren't then what's the point. the idea with birds killing pigs is genus gt it you will love it
1400069181|5.0|In the book, Mycoskie tells a lot of stories. He tells the story of how TOMS shoes got started and of how other businesses similar to TOMS have been started. He tells stories about mistakes he's made in business and about ways of gaining trust from employees. The stories he tells makes the book more relatable. When just reading the story of TOMS, one might think \\"Well, sure, this happened for him but could it go that well for me?\\" But with the myriad of stories that Mycoskie tells, the reader can gain confidence in their ability to, well, start something that matters.  The book is written in such a way that it feels like Mycoskie is sitting right next to the reader, just talking about things. It's a light read; within a few hours I'd read almost all of the chapters. He offers many exercises and questions that can help the reader figure out their passions and the direction they want to take when they start something that matters. He gives a lot of advice and ends the book with something that almost reads like a motivational speech, encouraging the reader the go out and start something that matters.  I really enjoyed the book overall and it really left me inspired. I've always believed that one person can make a difference but sometimes this world makes that a hard belief to standby. I suggest that everyone read this book by Blake Mycoskie because one person can make a huge difference just by starting something that matters.  Overall, I really enjoyed reading it!
1419702238|5.0|One of my grand daughters always asks for these books when a new one comes out.  She read this one the same day it was delivered.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I am a long time Kelly fan.  The songs on the album are more similar to each other than in the past overall (fewer slow ballads, more upbeat songs) but all are very catchy and have their own feel.  I think this CD will have more singles than most of her past CDs.  Overall, a great purchase.
1451627289|1.0|There was a time when I could sit and read a Stephen king book and become totally absorbed in the story , but reading this book was like sitting in a dentist chair with a drill going full power. it was painfully and agonizingly slow only to finish with a complete worthless end to what read like a bad Scify channel movie.  Save your money and skip this
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I saw the french edition in Chapters.  the paperback interested me, but when I logged onto Amazon,all I could find  was the english and other languages.  I am currently studying French, so I would be interested in downloading this novel  onto my Kindle.  I am hoping they get this one in french,
B003Y74AXO|2.0|This product disappointed me even though I have found previous Amazon Basics products to be reasonably priced, generic alternatives to competitive name brands. In this case, the screen protector is simply not worth the price Amazon charges. First, placing it on an iPad screen is a chore that doesn't allow much room for error. Even when I thought I was complete, air bubbles would show up later as I was using my tablet. Second, the protector only reduces glare and doesn't eliminate it altogether. If the price point was lower or if they offered several sheets, then I would have been more satisfied. As it is, a cleaning cloth comes with the protector, and that is the only part of the package I continue to use.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|First off, this movie entertained me far more than I expected it to - well worth the rental fee, particularly in HD as the effects were stunning. Very good acting, and the plot kept us guessing right up until the end. LOVED IT! I have to wonder who this movie is for though? The cast of mostly children gives it a Goonies/ET feel (which is why I wasn't very interested at first) but it seemed to be WAY too scary for actual children that age. These are not cute charming aliens, folks! Very entertaining & enjoyable for me but make sure kids are old enough to handle it before letting them see it.  We had a recurring problem with the streaming video. Every time we got close to the 43-min mark, the video stopped and went black & silent. Then it went back to the home screen for the film, where we could click \\"Watch\\" and it would go all the way back to the beginning. Our internet connection is not immune to dropping a signal, but the fact that it happened multiple times in the exact same spot in the movie makes me believe there was something wrong with the Amazon server. Finally we just forwarded the video all the way past that part (to around the 45 min mark) and it continued until the end without dropping. We missed only about 2 min of the film but having to start it over again three times was pretty irritating. Really takes you out of the story!
B005TQACLC|5.0|I didn't see this concert live so I am very happy that they released it on DVD and Blu Ray. I am a huge Britney fan and I've loved her since Baby One More Time. The only things I did not like is how they dubbed over her live vocals. Yes she is singing live, there is proof all over youtube from live recordings of the concert. I was also a little upset they didn't include Britney's performance of \\"He About To Lose Me\\" on the DVD. I think that is one of the best on the album. Overall though, this is a must have for all fans of Britney!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle Fire after hearing good things about it.  My girlfriend and I both love it and play it a lot(maybe too much).  Also has achievements of some kind.  It's a must buy for casual gaming!
B00006L9ZT|5.0|Bernard Shaw may have stated that. Having just reviewed it in 2 sittings he may be correct. Thinking of it's magnitude, scope and complexity I can only think of a few artistic achievements that come close : Sistine Chapel, Lord of the Rings ( book and movie), Durant's 11,000 page story of civilization, Peterof fountain in St. Petersburg. And oh yes the music is sublime....the equivalent of about 10 symphonies. The only thing missing here in this traditional staging ( thank God) are the flying horses. A truly amazing and mesmerizing experience.

B000URDE2Y|5.0|Most artists have that perfect release where every song is great and this one was trowers, and his next one too imo.<br />But this one named for the 'bridge of sighs' in venice is a masterpiece of guitar playing, singing and songwriting.  It's one of the highlights of seventies metal for sure. The bridge of sighs is the bridge that seperates the doges palace from the prison. YOu were tried in the court and passed over the covered bridge to the toombs a prison that few ever came out of alive. hence the name 'bridge of sighs' , casanova the great lover did escape from there though. He'd probably dig this release if he were around today. it's a artist whos time has come and he can do no wrong here. It's hendrix influenced but it's trowers own style in reality.

B000002GH1|4.0|Bands should rule the airwaves (not fake electronic music like todays slop)  , they make good music of all types including this. This was a new wavish band that became even better when they crafted fine songs like these. \\"sanctify, and 'things she said\\" are the best tracks on here. I miss the diversity of the pasts airwaves, it was so varied, now it's crapola time, but this is crisp and well written music. It's new wavey to pop rock to art rock. This group may have even been a bit prog rock before, I barely heard that stuff but I do love prog rock like yes etc. Still When this came out it was a hit cd in the U.S. AND it still sounds great to me today.

B00009L1OB|5.0|Rio was a five star masterpiece of a pop rock cd, this was not as great but it was still a band making great songs. It had three solid hits on it, the reflex, new moon on monday and union of the snake\\"  and that's impressive by any standards. And remember this is a BAND doing this not some dj lamo sampling music. Some people expecgt every cd to be the same but here you got a fantastic release that has the power of a band that was willing to try some new ground.  It's not \\"rio' but's it still a excellent release to have in your pop rock cd collection or download files.

0307593495|2.0|I read an interview with Hennig Mankell about his attitude toward Kurt Wallender.  I could have just read the last book and realized he didn't like him very much.  I read all of the   Wallander series and enjoyed them. This was a sad and disappointing ending to a gentle and caring character. Save your money and your impression of Wallender.  This is a slow decline into a boring and depressing ending of a great series.
0374275637|4.0|I was privileged to have Daniel Kahneman for many years as a member of my research group \\"MacArthur Network on the Origin and Nature of Norms and Preferences,\\" where I came to appreciate his dedication, intelligence, and friendship. At last Kahneman has written a book for the public, and is already a widely discussed best seller. I am convinced that the contributions of Kahneman and his coauthor Amos Tversky are fundamental and lasting, but I am concerned that his work not be seen as conveying the general message that \\"people are irrational.\\"<br /><br />I was motivated to write these hasty comments by the review of the book by Jim  Holt in the New York Times Book Review (11/27/2011), p. 16ff. Holt writes \\"Although Kahneman draws only modest policy implications... others... go much further. [David Brooks, NY Times editorial writer], for example, has argued that Kahneman and Tversky's work illustrates `the limits of social policy'; in particular, the folly of government action to fight joblessness and turn the economy around.\\" Of course, nothing of the sort follows from Kahneman and Tversky's work.<br /><br />I know Kahneman and Tversky's work (hereafter KT) very well, but I am going through this book slowly, so I will add to my comments as they accumulate.<br /><br />Psychologists have known for many years that humans make systematic visual mistakes, called \\"optical illusions.\\" This does not elicit the general pronouncement that humans systematically error in their visual judgments. The same should apply to KW's results: the results are correct, but they should not be sloppily interpreted as saying that people are general illogical and error-prone decision-makers.<br /><br />First main point: I believe KW's work does not at all suggest that people are poor at making logical inferences. The experiments which might suggest this are generally misinterpreted. A particularly pointed example of this heuristic is the famous Linda the Bank Teller problem, first analyzed in Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, \\"Extensional versus Intuitive Reasoning: The Conjunction Fallacy in Probability Judgment\\", Psychological Review 90 (1983):293-315. Subjects are given the following description of a hypothetical person named Linda: \\"Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations.\\" The subjects were then asked to rank-order eight statements about Linda according to their probabilities. The statements included the following two: \\"Linda is a bank teller\\" and Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.\\"<br /><br />More than 80\% of the subjects---graduate and medical school students with statistical training and doctoral students in the decision science program at Stanford University's business school---ranked the second statement as more probable than the first. This seems like a simple logical error because every bank teller feminist is also a bank teller. However, there is another interpretation according to which the subjects are correct in their judgments. Let p and q be properties that every member of a population either has or does not have. The standard definition of \\"the probability that member x is p\\" is the fraction of the population for which p is true. But an equally reasonable definition is the probability that x is a member of a random sample of the subset of the population for which p is true.' According to the standard definition, the probability of p and q cannot be greater than the probability of p. But, according to the second, the opposite inequality can hold: x might be more likely to appear in a random sample of individuals who are both p and q than in a random sample of the same size of individuals who are p.<br />In other words, the probability that a randomly chosen bank teller is Linda is probably much lower than the probability thata randomly chosen feminist bank teller is Linda. Another way of expressing this point is that the probability that a randomly chosen member of the set \\"is a feminist bank teller\\" may be Linda is greater than the probability that a randomly chosen member of the set \\"is a bank teller,\\" is Linda.<br /><br />I believe my interpretation is by far the more natural. Moreover, why would the experimenters have included information about Linda's college behavior unless it were relevant? This behavior is completely irrelevant given KW's interpretation of probability, but wholly pertinent given a \\"conditional probability\\" interpretation. The latter can be colloquially restated as \\"the conditional probability that an individual is Linda given that she is a feminist bank teller is higher than the conditional probability that an individual is Linda given that she is a bank teller.\\"<br /><br />Second Main Point: Many of the examples of irrationality given by KW are not in any way irrational. Consider for example the chief investment officer described by Kahneman (p. 12). This man invested tens of millions of dollars in Ford Motor Company stock after having visited and automobile show and having been impressed with the quality of the current offering of Ford vehicles. Kahneman says \\"I found it remarkable that he had apparently not considered the one question that an economist would call relevant: I Ford stock currently underpriced?\\" In fact, there is no objective measure of a stock being \\"underpriced,\\" and no known correlation between a measure of \\"being underpriced\\" and subsequent performance on the stock market. Moreover, the executive may not have revealed all of the reasoning involved in his decision, but rather only a \\"deciding factor\\" after other considerations had been factored in.<br /><br />Third Main Point: We have long known that people do not generally act in their own best interest. We have weakness of will, we procrastinate, we punish ourselves for things that are not our fault, we act thoughtlessly and regret our actions, yet repeat them, we become addicted to cigarettes and drugs, we become obese even though we would like to be thin, we pay billions of dollars for self-help books that almost never work. KW have not added much, if anything, to our understanding of this array of bizarre behaviors. Of course, they do not claim otherwise. However, commentators regularly claim that this behavior somehow contradicts the `rational actor model' of economic theory, which it does not in any way. Economic theory explores the implications of human choice behavior without claiming that the choices people make are in some sense prudent or even desirable to the decision-maker (we cannot choose our preferences).<br /><br />Economic theory is in general supportive of the notion that people should get what they want, but has included the notion of \\"merit goods\\" that society values or disvalues for moral or practical reasons that counterindicate consumer sovereignty. For instance, we regulate pharmaceuticals, we prohibit racial discrimination in public places, and we outlaw markets in body parts.<br /><br />Fourth Main Point: KW are right on target in asserting that people make massive errors in interpreting statistical arguments (e.g., the base rate fallacy, or the interpretation of conditional probabilities). This has nothing to do with \\"illogicality\\" or \\"irrationality,\\" but rather the complexity of the mathematics itself. For instance, KW have shown that physicians routinely fail to understand what the statistical accuracy of lab tests mean---the fact that at test is 95% accurate is compatible with the fact that it is wrong 95% (or any other, depending on the incidence of the condition that is test for) of the time.<br /><br />The psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer has shown that if conditional probabilities are reinterpreted as frequencies, people have no problem in interpreting their meaning (see the discussion \\"Risk School\\" in Nature 461,29, October 2009). Gigerenzer has be promoting the idea that trigonometry be dropped from the high school math sequence (no one uses it except surveyors, physicists, and engineers) and probability theory be added. This sounds like a great idea to me.<br /><br />Of course, if people do not do well a formal statistical analysis, how are to we defend the rational actor model, which is thoroughly Bayesian and implicitly assumes people are infinitely capable statistical decision-makers? The answer is not to abandon the rational actor model, which in general has had exceptional explanatory power---see my book, The Bounds of Reason (Princeton 2009) and my review of Ken Binmore's Rational Decisions (Economic Journal, February 2010). Rather, I believe the answer lies in replacing the subjective prior assumption of the rational actor model with a broader assumption that individuals make decision within networks of minds that are characterized by distributed cognition, much as social insects, except of course on a much higher level, using language instead of pheromones, with the cultural construction of iconic rather than pheromonic signals. But, that is the subject to be explored in the future. One of the payoffs of KT research is to make it clear how insufficient the standard economic model of decision-making under (radical) uncertainty really is.our fault, we act thoughtlessly and regret our actions, yet repeat them, we become addicted to cigarettes and drugs, we become obese even though we would like to be thin, we pay billions of dollars for self-help books that almost never work.

0679746048|5.0|This book is pretty amazing. The movie is completely different though. Anyway, It's a pretty strong story and for some reason It has a meaning. To other people who gave this a lousy rating you don't understand what it is.<br /><br />When I said it's completely different from the movie(The book came first!). The author was at the filming and didn't like it because it didn't follow the book. I can name a few scenes that weren't in there. Anyway, I love the book and the movie. I really recommend this book! - Brittany
B0068TJLSY|4.0|J.J. Abrams and the immortal Spielberg have undoubtedly produced an instant classic.  Super 8 is the kind of film moviegoers have been waiting to see for years.  The lowered standards for films of the 21st century will likely help this one to stand out from the crowd. A great CG performance, effects, and score encourage the stellar acting.  The film showcases Elle Fanning and Kyle Chandler's talent, as well as a solid performance from Joel Courtney.  The tale of the monster and the army men who failed to understand his journey is poignant and powerful, even if somewhat formulaic.  Super 8 is a perfect film for the whole family, provided no one is too squeamish.  Some scenes may be fairly intense for young audiences.  Overall, Super 8 is a well-made film with something for everyone.
B0052U59F4|1.0|I was looking for a good read and by all of the reviews this seemed to be an excellent read. The first three chapters misled me in choosing to buy this book. The story line went downhill from there. I skipped through most of the middle chapters and went to the last just so I knew how it was ending.   Redundant sex along with kinky non-arousing sex does not make a great story.
0143037757|5.0|Tony Judt believed that the role of an historian is to set the record straight. Thus he undertakes the debunking and de-mythologizing of modern European history. He tears the clothes off the historical king, as it were: showing the blatant lies that comprise the myth of French resistance, the &quot;neutral&quot; Swiss, the open-minded anti-Nazi Dutch. Laid bare is an ugly legacy of anti-Semitism and hatred that for me, at least, was both painful and personal.<br /><br />The problems of the book and it's strengths are the same. Although he does follow a more or less chronological path from World War II to the present, he does not do so in the usual strict &quot;timeline&quot; way but rather follows threads of thought, traveling from events to political development, thence to parallel cultural developments in cinema, theater, television and the arts.<br /><br />If the book has a serious flaw, it is that there is so MUCH of it. I felt at times that I was back at school and maybe I should be prepping for finals.<br /><br />If you are of Jewish origins, as I am, and you lost a lot of family in the Holocaust, this will likely stir up a lot of stuff that hurts. The depth and breadth of European anti-Semitism and indifference to the shockingly successful destruction of European Jewry is stomach churning stuff. I knew, but I didn't really grasp the full extent ... the breadth and depth of it. It hurts and reminded me that with all its flaws, there are some things about the USA that make us better as a nation than our European cousins. They probably wouldn't agree, but I frankly don't care. There is plenty of hatred here too, but the hundreds of years of hatred as a tradition doesn't live here. Hatred is not built into our heritage; it stands outside it.<br /><br />This is not straight history: it is analysis and criticism. Tony Judt had a lot of strong opinions. You may not like them, but whether you like them or not, this is a book that is worth reading. It isn't an easy read and it is sometimes hard, but it is never dull. And when you are done, you will have learned a lot and have a lot to think about.ad and it is sometimes hard, but it is never dull.

1451648537|5.0|I have alway been a huge fan of Apple products. Even in the dark days I bought a clone Power PC. It was Steve's return to Apple that made him a legend. If he had. Ever returned and both Apple and NeXT had failed, he'd be nothing more than a trivia question. It was his amazing turn around of a company in the brink of disaster that makes his story Internation folk lore. This book walks you through the ups and downs and vividly shows Steve's stupidity and brilliance. A very good read.

B005HPA2XI|5.0|Some might say that Crack The Skye was the pinnacle of what the mighty Mastodon have to offer. To this, I say, 'nay.' The best is yet to come.  After the phenomenal undertaking that was Crack The Skye, Mastodon deserve, I think, to take a bit of a rest... to dial back the 'heavy-handed-conceptual-narrative' album that they may be known for. And so, what we have here is a band whose only mission was to set forth and rock, and rock they do, in spades.  Mastodon, I feel, are the most appropriately named band in recent memory. When I listen to their tunes, I envision a hulking, massive, musky, lumbering beast that crushes all that are in their way. As this album is not a conceptual narrative, there is an air of light-heartedness, but that does not detract from the growling guitars and snarling bass, soaring vocals and warrior percussion that are present. Make no mistake. This. Album. Is. Heavy.  I would point out the real standout tracks, but I love digesting this album as a whole (I am a creature of habit, and an audiophile to boot). Mastodon is as badass as ever, and this album is triumphant.  Long live Mastodon.

I have loved Pink Floyd for almost as long as have been listening to music, and these tidbits of Floyd bring back those story albums and the great times I had back then. Not many bands can still sell out arenas, Floyd is one of those bands!
B000GGSMB2|5.0|Criminals enjoy the money and power but ultimately pay in the end. This film is a good example of a life that spins out of control and leads to madness and violent death. The acting and story kept you totally involved in this movie and it is one of the classics.

0307593312|1.0|This is my first Murakami book, and I was highly disappointed. There were no especially deep reflections on existence, no moving relationships (though the author seemed to think there were), and no meaningful plot developments past the first couple of chapters (in a 900+ page book). Regarding the last point, I am not a reader who normally likes plot-driven books. I like character-driven books, or idea-driven books. In 1Q84, there's nothing driving the book at all.  The chapters alternate between the two protagonists for the first two thirds of 1Q84. At a certain point in the story, one of these protagonists goes into hiding in a safehouse, stays there until nearly the end of the book, and doesn't do anything but yearn for the other protagonist in a very repetitive, trite way. Yet half of the chapters continue to be devoted to her.   Having a character repeat a person's name over and over and occasionally say it aloud during 600 pages doesn't amount to much of a love story, if that's what this is supposed to be. It's not a science fiction story,  either, as nothing about the alternate reality is ever explained (and because nothing much is very 'alternate' anyway); any hints of magical realism are useless for driving the plot, given that the Little People do absolutely nothing but say \\"Ho ho\\" on occasions. There is a very weak thread of social commentary on a few topics, but this never fully blossoms.  I simply do not get why the author wrote this book, and I would not recommend it. I finished it only out of respect for the author, who seems to have the admiration of many readers for his imagination and style. I'll look for some of his older work and see what happens, but this is not a book I will return to.

0240815807|5.0|I know that people always say that \\"this book\\" or \\"that book\\" is a must have but this is one time when that statement is 100% true, this is an excellent book. I have purchased several books about mixing and one thing that they all have in common is that I felt just as confused after reading the books as I was before reading them, they always gave generic terms that never gave you a clear understanding of the hows and whys of mixing. This is the first mixing book that actually delivers on its promises, after reading this book you will definitely have confidence when it comes to mixing. It's also great that Mike makes available several audio examples as well as several full multitrack  mixes to use for the purpose of practicing.   I took an online 12 week mixing course (costing several hundreds of dollars) a couple of years back and to be honest Mike's book includes a lot more information than what I've learned from the online course. If you are serious about learning how to mix then do yourself a favour and gets this book.  -Paul-
B005TZFZJC|4.0|I did think this album was a lil over sexed which is why I gave it 3.5 stars. She is already sexxy so I thought it was very unnecessary to talk about sex the way she did. Then again I am not suprised that she went there. I really enjoyed You da One, Where Have u Been, Birthday Cake, and Watch n Learn. But the other songs arent as memorable. A step down from LOUD but still good enough to jam every other day. Not bad. Coulda been better.
B0064ORVCQ|3.0|This was a really good movie. I wanted to post a review becasue the 3d conversion was clearly rushed and lazyily done. My LG tv could do just as good at converting it, if not better. I bought it because my TV's 2d to 3d conversion is good but not as good as a real 3d Blu-ray. It seems that this was just a rush conversion by the producers to make money, rather than a strong effort to have a good quality conversion. Part 2 is great, but it was converted and had to face criticism in theaters so faced a greater need for higher quality.  So is it worth it? For the average consumer, I would say no. However, as such a major fan I feel the need to own a copy of the 3d bluray package, so I dont realyl regret buying it. Still, I'm disippointed.

If you practice what you read in The Secret: The Power you have to have a much better life.  Every day I wake up thanking my creator for so many things and my blessings just keep multiplying!  This is a 180 degree turn from what was going on before I began reading The Secret: The Power.  I loved the book so much that I bought two more as gifts for family members.  Thank you Rhonda for being so simplistic in your writing that even I could understand what to do!

B002ZG9774|2.0|I tried to like this movie, but couldn't.  I like movies like dance movies like: Chicago, Nine, Cabaret... movies that have some interesting characters and great dance numbers.  This movie attempted to take something from movies like those, but come across more like Showgirls.  At least, Showgirls was funny, but this was just boring and filled with characters you don't care about.  Hot bodies abound and there's sex, but the bodies have heads that can't act and dance moves that seem like they've all come out of MTV Videos from the 80's.  The characters and plot are all contrived and feel like we've seen it all before.  Unfortunately, Cher is wasted in this role.  Her role could have been great and fun to play, but she comes across like a grumpy has-been with a big chip on her shoulder.  Stanley Tucci, who I think is a great actor, is wasted in this movie.  Everyone seems as though they were thrown in to boost interest in the film, but this film needs more than a few good names to make it interesting.  Christine Aguleria is sexy and attractive, but her acting and her singing fall flat and seem totally uninspired.  Eric Dane seems like he wondered into the film by accident.  Everyone in the movie acts like they have a cloud hanging over their heads or a dark secret in their closet.  It's the writing -- the writing drags this movie down because it does not have any truth to it.  The writing of this movie makes you wonder why anyone would sign on to be in it.  All this movie does is rip off other better movies and old dance videos.  Cher's comeback movie?  Cher has done a lot of good work over the years.  She shouldn't have come back for this.  If you watch this movie and you're familiar with older, better dance musicals, you'll see this movie is nothing, but a rip off of everything that has come before.

B000RH0C8G|5.0|This was an absolutely great read.  I had a hard time putting the book down.  This was a great story about Billy Beane, and his running of the Oakland A's.  It's great to read about guys like Billy who can dominate an industry because they put some thought and intelligence into their job, rather than just by gut feeling.  As a reader, I found myself rooting for Billy while reading the book, because he had a thought process behind what he did.  This was my first Amazon Prime Lending Library read, and I hope my next one will be just as good!
1451627289|4.0|The greatest popular author of our time takes on the one of the most tragic mysteries of our recent past, sending a time traveler to stop the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and creates a backstory around that which, in its best moments, is more involving than the question of whether or not Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.<br /><br />Jake Epping is an emotionally blocked English teacher dealing with the residue of a failed marriage when Al, the proprietor of a local diner, asks him for help. The diner, it turns out, has a time portal in its basement which one can walk through to the year 1958. Al wanted to use it to rescue Kennedy only to contract cancer in his final jump through time. A dying Al convinces Jake to take on the mission, which will require him to live the life of one George Amberson for some five years while trying to determine 1) whether, as Al believes, Oswald acted alone and 2) if Oswald did act alone, how to stop him before he murders Kennedy.<br /><br />King fans can rest assured that their man is in high form here, his legendary storytelling abilities working overtime to craft not one but three riveting storylines. One is the story of Jake/George, who lands himself in a Texas town where he finds a life with purpose, romance, and danger beyond his dreams. Second is the challenge of time travel itself, of doing battle with a past that \\"doesn't want to be changed.\\" Third is the Oswald part of the story, of shadowing a man who is himself a shadow, and whom Jake can't bring himself to kill until he knows Oswald was truly the man behind the crime.<br /><br />\\"Who was I to say that ten thousand conspiracy theorists were wrong, especially based on the few scraps of information all my haunting and stalking had gleaned,\\" Jake asks himself.<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" is a long book, but it needs to be. Complaining about King using too many pages is like complaining about Mozart using too many notes. Even when he's indulging himself with narrative side trips to bookies and school plays, he keeps you reading with his propulsive energy and his clear empathy for the strange confused time when America shifted out of the 1950s and into the 1960s. Oswald's part of the story slips into the background many times; King's greatest trick is your not minding that given what's on offer in Jake/George's world.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is a long opening of some 90 pages, a kind of novella in itself where Al corners Jake and gets him to take his first journey, a short jaunt where Jake deals with the initial culture shock and the concept of an \\"obdurate past.\\" Best of all is this section's conclusion, a very cool, very cruel twist ending that sets in motion Jake's quest that makes up the rest of the book. It has nothing to do with Oswald, and by the time it's over even the most rabid assassination buff won't care.<br /><br />There are a lot of twists in this book, most of the brutal kind, though King still offers moments of grace and charm. My favorite involves a cribbage contest early in the book. Jake has to wrestle with a major identity crisis, of being an \\"angel\\" to some but a serious letdown to a woman who expects, and deserves, a truth he can not provide. All this is developed well, if heavily in parts. Just as it begins to get too dire, Oswald and company take center stage, and Jake must race against time, literally and figuratively, to do what he came for.<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" is not a perfect book even when it's very good, but it only sags for real at the end, when it gets caught up in the metaphysics of time travel, alternate realities, and why things do what they did. King pushes too hard here, and loses the thread that kept us reading. I was satisfied with his handling of Oswald; it was his handling of Jake that comes up short.<br /><br />Still, reading \\"11/22/63\\" is a fine way to spend a few sleepless nights, a worthwhile examination of time, man and the complexity of individual identity as well as a launching pad for several storylines that engage and shock even if they don't quite twine together in the end. It's a good ride, from someone who has given us plenty before but few that had this much energy and ambition.te twine together in the end.

0062011847|5.0|As a hardcore Terry Pratchett fan, I read each book multiple times before forming personal opinions on the material.  In Discworld, I love the Watch books first and foremost, ergo, they receive the sharpest of my scrutiny.  While this book primarily takes place outside of Pseudopolis Yard, it still satisfies even the most rabid AMCW aficionado for a new story to roll around on their brains.  My only concern is Vetinari, for the last few books, is beginning to appear....softer?  More human? We begin to see an indecisive side to him, something this reader isn't quite sure about...but it's still Pratchett through-and-through.  And who knew that a young child's fascination with poo could be so....er.....well, you'll just have to read it.  I never thought I'd see Sam Vimes keeping an eye out for elephant excreta, but he IS from The Shades, where playing with dead things in the gutter is the primary source of entertainment for a growing boy.<br /><br />Overall, an entertaining read - and listen.  The audio book, read by Stephen Briggs, always brings a new dimension to Discworld enjoyment.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|Jeff Beck/ Truth (bonus tracks):  The songs produced by Jeff Beck and Rod Stewart in this album and it's follow up (Beck-Ola) are simply wonderful.  These are very special albums.  The fact that Jeff decided to kick off this album with a song from his old Yardbirds days is a very nice touch, and a nice tribute to that band.  Rod sings his heart out in these cuts and it, no doubt, had a huge influence on his output after leaving Beck's band.  Highly Recommended.

B000RHKARO|5.0|John Mayall/ Blues from Laurel Canyon (bonus tracks edition):  This is a great Blues/Rock album.  It was also a very influential album as most musicians were listening to it and discussing it upon its release.  The general public took a little longer to discover it, mainly because it didn't get played on the radio.  Invariably the reviews of Mayall's work turns to his famous (or about to be famous) bandmates.  It is true that many well known musicians have been in his band at one point or another.  This is because great musicians have always recognized the artistry of John Mayall.  John Mayall was one of the most important figures in Rock n Roll, and Blues, history.  Even though most people sill haven't heard about him, that does not change the fact that the course of modern music history was shaped (in a very important way) by John Mayall through his artistry, his mentoring, his albums, and his faithfulness to the Blues.  John Mayall would go on to make even better albums than this one, but this one is very special.
B000002WMH|3.0|The King of Rock 'n' Roll: The Complete 50's masters is not worth the price of $70.00 for the devoted Elvis fan. The devoted Elvis fan will have already owned most, if not nearly all, of this music on individual Elvis Presley cds. The nice thing about individual Elvis Presley cds is that they tend to compile a certain style of Elvis' music; for instance, rock 'n' roll, Christmas songs, gospel music, or show tunes. However, the Complete 50's masters mixes all four of these styles of music, plus includes a 12 minute interview with Elvis that adds nothing to our knowledge of him and adds the fifth cd which is completely filled with alternate takes, onto five cds. Forget about cd number five; it includes lesser quality alternate takes of master takes which are also found in this box set. I quickly disposed of cd number five because it added nothing of value to my cd collection. That leaves me, a devoted Elvis fan, with four cds with four styles of music, most of which I already own on other individual Elvis cds. This is not a worthy investment for the devoted Elvis fan. One must not forget that many of the people writing reviews of this boxed set neither grew up with Elvis, nor have visited Graceland and read extensively about him, nor have such an extensive collection (87 cds) of Elvis Presley music as I do. For these less knowledgeable and devoted fans of Elvis' music, the Complete 50's masters may indeed be a worthy investment.  John

B005ELZKWS|4.0|The first album was good, but this one is better.  Chickenfoot got some attention with their debut, but now they're establishing themselves as a musical force to be reckoned with.  If you didn't \\"get it\\" the first time, the guys will make sure you do so now.  A strong songwriter in his own right, Sammy Hagar's collaboration with Joe Satriani is very much hitting the mark.  It's clear that these two musicians have a great songwriting chemistry; this album is better than the debut, with the partnership between Hagar and Satriani clearly bearing fruit.  \\"Three and a Half Letters\\" is worth the price of admission alone (and it's far from being the only good tune on the album).  Hagar knows who he is as a lyricist; his lyrical style is plenty tough enough for the hard rock musical style, but there's a generous dollop of heartfelt soulfulness here too.  Sammy both writes from the heart and calls 'em like he sees 'em.  Lyrically, he doesn't try to be Dylan; he just tells it from his own perspective.  It's working just fine, if you ask me.  Michael Anthony is putting in some great background vocals here, and playing a mean bass guitar.  What's refreshing is that he's no show-off; it's obvious the man can play, but he clearly doesn't feel the need to try to impress anyone with his considerable chops.  Rather, he lays down the bassline most beneficial to the song; if a note is unnecessary, he won't play it.  In my book, that's the mark of a fine musician:  He plays according to what's best for the song.  Joe Satriani puts in some amazing work here; his riffs are infectious, and his solos are oftentimes pieces of music in and of themselves.  That's the mark of a great solo; you could listen to it apart from the song in which it appears, and it would still strike you as an impressive piece of music.  If you are a Satriani fan, buy this album right now.  Chad Smith is a great drummer, and he lays down a tremendous groove with Michael Anthony.  What's interesting here is that mostof the time, you'll hear a band where the drummer rocks out whilst the bassist just holds down the groove (think Van Halen) or, you'll hear music where it's clear the bassist wants to solo all night, while the drummer just puts \\"four on the floor\\".  Neither is happening here.  Smith and Anthony are clearly focused on complimenting one another's playing on every song.  It's obvious that they both spent time working out their arrangements before recording, such that their grooves, riffs and fills would both accentuate one another's playing while adding a great deal of dimension and depth to the music.  Bravo, says I.  All in all, a very impressive effort.  This album is an improvement over their debut; these guys have found their footing.  They know who they are as a band, and if the improvement continues, their third studio effort should be nothing short of amazing.
B004EPYZT4|2.0|I thought (..or perhaps optimistically hoped) Hollywood was beyond the likes of craptastic fantasy action films like The Scorpion King & Kull the Conqueror. Conan proves otherwise, as a thin storied action driven film laced with bad dialogue and 'pretty' half-actors wedged into poorly written roles. Its sad that Hollywood can continue to so badly drop the ball with this genre (...and in general) while CABLE TV NETWORKS like HBO churn out a quality product like Game of Thrones. What's even worse, is that this movie did so poorly that we'll be lucky to see another shot taken at such a great property (Conan).   <edit>Allow me to retract my initial statement about Hollywood being beyond such films, as I recall seeing the tragedy that was a bundle of wasted $ : Prince of Persia. I can still hold out hope that some portion of Hollywood has quality fantasy films to offer us, after all Peter Jackson is working on The Hobbit.
B005LAIGFA|4.0|\\"J. Edgar\\" was a well acted historical piece attempting to cover a complicated subject that, when all was said and done, left me feeling it was less than the sum of its parts.  To put it more simply, it was everything I thought it would be...but I wish it would have been just a little bit less.<br /><br />Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the titular figurehead, \\"J. Edgar\\" intrigued me from the start.  Certainly the film would discuss the birth of the FBI, and J. Edgar Hoover's fanatical protection and promotion of that institution, of his pioneering a national fingerprint system, and his hatred of communism.  Would it also tackle his secret files full of blackmail material on political enemies, and his supposed homosexuality and cross-dressing?<br /><br />And the answer is YES to all those things...and that's almost a shame.  There is SO much information here that the film tends to be exhaustive AND exhausting at the same time.  Eastwood has always been a meticulous director, nurturing his characters and his subjects, and perhaps he might have been wise to be a little less so, to have cut a bit more here and there.  The film is almost two hours and twenty minutes, and I was actually pleased to see the feller die...I was that tired.<br /><br />Eastwood's screenplay was written by Dustin Lance Black (\\"Milk\\"), and their decision to tell their tale in a dual present/past fashion through cuts and flashbacks will probably draw some criticism, and may have been partly responsible for my feeling that the story went on a little too long.  Cutting between the two tales was a bit jarring at times, and often frustrated me more than drew me in.<br /><br />Whether DiCaprio will be honored by any acting nominations will remain to be seen.  I felt he was good, though a little uncharacteristically wooden.  While he covered the man from 1919 to 1972, and did a decent job showing the man aging, I think as much credit should go to the makeup department as it should to him.  For instance, I did not feel his voice aged anywhere near as much as his body did, and it bothered me.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are three supporting characters who I thought were remarkable.  The first and second were Armie Hammer as Clyde Tolson, Hoover's confidante and (apparently) all-but-sexual partner; and Naomi Watts as Helen Gandy, his extremely loyal and supportive secretary.  I found them to be credible and well played, especially Hammer as his meticulous, caring, loving friend.  Whether their relationship was indeed one of only implied sexuality I am not sure, but both Eastwood's coy directing and Hammer's capable acting give few specifics as to how far their relationship indeed went.<br /><br />And I have saved the best for last: Judy Dench is pure magic as Hoover's domineering mother, a thoroughly unlikable woman who created a stunted man maniacally driven to please her, though he almost never can.  I would be extremely surprised if the Dame does not win an acting award for this role.<br /><br />There is a telling scene near the start where J. Edgar, who is using his full first name (John) at the time, is buying his very first tailored suit as the newly established head of the FBI, and he is told that another John Hoover is a credit risk...would there be some way he could distinguish himself?  Whether this scene is fully factual or not it works, and the notion of entitling the film as such serves to establish just who Hoover was, the man who invented himself AND the FBI.near as much as his body did, and it bothered me.

B00138CRFY|4.0|This is not a review on Infidels but a warning about Amazon's daft way of pricing things. The record has 8 tracks, which are $0.99 if bought separately. That would make the whole Infidels worth $7.92. Inexplicably, Amazon prices it at $9.99. Did they misunderstand \\"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts\\"? Somebody should be fired in Amazon.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|When I first saw the trailers for the new Muppet movie simply titled THE MUPPETS, I was worried. Let's just say the Muppets haven't had the best track record since switching over to Walt Disney Studios ownership. Or for that matter, since the beloved Jim Henson passed away. And while THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL and MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND were decent pictures, they really could never match the magic of the 1979 THE MUPPET MOVIE or THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER even. And as the years passed from the abysmal MUPPETS FROM SPACE, I wrote off any future Muppet releases ever being good again.<br /><br />Until I finally caved and went to see THE MUPPETS with a friend. And I am so glad I did. Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller have really delivered an amazing script that takes viewers back to what Jim Henson had always hoped the Muppets would bring: that wonderful happiness melded with a childhood nostalgia that really doesn't fade away after the credits roll.<br /><br />The story begins with bright eyed Gary and his Muppet brother Walter who are planning a trip with Gary's girlfriend Mary (played by Amy Adams) to Los Angeles. While there, Muppet fan Walter plans on visiting the Muppet Studios. But when the threesome arrives, they discover the entire place is completely abandoned and rundown. But that's also when they discover that an evil oil baron, Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) plans on destroying the Muppet Studios and drilling for oil. What ensues is a wild romp to regather the Muppet family and put on one last show to raise ten million dollars and save the Studios.<br /><br />The best part of this entire venture is how the Muppets can get away with poking fun at themselves while remaining completely innocent in doing so. The best jokes come from moments where we find out what has happened to all the Muppets -- and the constant poking at not being in popular culture any longer. It's absolutely perfect. I found myself laughing harder than any kids in the audience as small moments popped through referencing previous films and THE MUPPET SHOW itself. From the wonderful 1980's Robot using its modem to the offbeat \\"Moopets\\" -- replacements for the original Muppets -- the humor is spot on.<br /><br />The music is spectacular. It really harkens back to what Paul Williams used to do not only on THE MUPPET SHOW, but also in THE MUPPET MOVIE. The dancing and singing is well executed and I kept feeling amazed at the song lyrics. Not only are they great musically, but the writing was smart and never clich&eacute;. And as the opening number, \\"Life's A Happy Song\\" begins, I could not stop smiling. I knew it from those first moments: the Muppets I knew and loved were back. And hopefully this time for good.<br /><br />Acting is top notch -- as Amy Adams and Jason Segel play bright and cheery adults who never come across as being cornball. It definitely has a hair of camp factor, but Adams and Segel pull it off brilliantly. The cameo performances are perfect -- never overwhelming, and always at the right moments. Some are definitely highly laugh-worthy, such as while Walter sings through his conflicts, a human version of himself appears in the mirror played by THE BIG BANG THEORY's Jim Parsons.<br /><br />Be warned: there are not only numerous moments of laughter, but also some tear-inducing moments. Such as when Kermit walks around his empty mansion and reminisces on the past. THE MUPPET MOVIE inspired me as a kid in so many ways, and THE MUPPETS has the power to do that for a whole new generation of kids. And I know that this is exactly the sort of film Jim Henson would be extremely proud of. I know I am.

1439183392|3.0|Winslow is a terrific writer, whose characters are interesting and quirky. His plots build tension, involve complex interweaving of seemingly distinct story lines, and provide insightful commentary on different subcultures of America. His hero here, Boone Daniels (get it?) is the rare honest man, a kind of modern philosopher encased in a jock's body. Like Neal Carey in \\"A Cool Breeze on the Underground,\\" he is far more intelligent and well-read than his lifestyle would suggest. He has the ability to get inside people's heads and figure out what drives them, leading to analyses and insights that others miss, especially the police. Yet he acts totally irrationally at times and, were he not Superman, would have been killed long ago. This clashes with his oft-referenced sophisticated experience as a surfer, both in his interactions with other surfers and his respect for the ocean with its fickle waves and currents. Such a person isn't likely to survive as a P.I. Like \\"Cool Breeze,\\" this story has an unbelievable final. It is as if Wyatt Earp went to the O.K. Corral without first arranging for his two brothers and Doc Halliday to accompany him. Fortunately, it is more like an epilogue than the climax.  I listened to the audio--the narrator did a good job.

Here is the answer:<br /><br />1. Download Google Docs app onto Android device<br />2. Open OfficeSuite5<br />3. Go to \\"My documents\\"<br />4. Select/Check mark the document you want<br />5. Look at the menu on the bottom row<br />6. Scroll menu to the left and you'll see \\"Share\\"<br />7. Click on \\"Share\\"<br />8. Select \\"Send Files\\"<br />9. Select \\"Docs\\"<br />10.

B005LZW8FO|5.0|I saw this at the cinema several months ago and still think about it. It is unlike anything I've seen in a long time:  deeply philosophical, moving, thought-provoking, with some beautiful imagery and an eerie, haunting feel throughout. A stunner ending that promotes some great conversation afterwards. It is a movie you feel and ponder rather than just sit back and watch.  Brit Marling's performance is worthy of an Oscar nomination. I see why this got a standing ovation and won 2 awards at Sundance and look forward to Marling's upcoming mainstream and indie films. Just wanted to add Another Earth has been recently nominated by the Spirit Independent Film Awards in 2 categories: Best First Feature Film and Best First Screenplay.
0385535139|5.0|Great book.  Funny and sometimes truthfully frightening.  I wrote 7 words, but amazon wants me to write 20.  You can disregard these last two sentences, but seriously, good book!
B004K4AVAG|1.0|ah lady gaga  the singer that makes you wonder is she from another planet or from our drunken nightmares ?    her second album, is a gem of OVERUSED  recycled beats..theres nothing original here folks.. its a wonder why people would go nuts over tripe like this..shes nothing more than a madonna wannebee..
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Got the app for my kindle fire and the first thing it did was tell me there was a new version and that I needed to buy the new version.  Amazon needs to look at this closer.  Had it at 3 stars but then discovered that it runs constantly.  Attempts to get some satisfaction/response from developer or from Amazon has been unsuccessful.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a great film with a twist.  It is as entertaining for adults as it is for children.  There is much humour that goes over the heads of the little ones that will keep them asking you why you are laughing.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|The movie was captivating and the music is just the same. After watching the flick this was a must have item. When you play the CD you can visualize the movie scene it goes to.
B005G4TJUC|3.0|I loved the movie, but the quality of the DVD is bad, bad, bad. When it starts I always have to turn off the subtitles. Why? The picture is fuzzy, but generally ok. That's what I get for looking for a discount.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|Use to have this concert on DVD but when i uprgraded to a blu ray player i purchased the concert again to see if the Blu Ray version was that much better. And it was. By a long shot. The sound is amazing especially if u have a 5.1 surround sound system or even a soundbar. But the picture, that was where i was blown away.  I cannot believe how much more amazing the picture is. This Blu Ray is just crystal clear beatiful rockin' greatness.
B005NF2UE6|4.0|Everyone likes or hates NB it seems.  I am not going to analyze the album but it is what it is, just good radio friendly rock music.  If you like the 80's type rock you will enjoy this.  That being said, it's better than most other rock that comes out now days.
1609611543|5.0|For anyone out there wondering why you're doing everything properly and still can't drop the pounds, this best seller is a must. Believe it or not, losing the weight is just an added bonus! You will feel more energetic,with much less joint pain. At least that's been my experience. I have already recommended it to several friends and family members. I realize yu can't believe everything you read. But I am living proof. So much thanks goes out to Dr. William Davis, for taking the time and care to do his research, as well as putting it to the test. Bravo!!
B00004UEDQ|5.0|This was a somewhat accurate protrail of an experience in a treatment facility. While many things were dramatacizerd, it was fairly true to life. It is great when people actually get help for their addictions.
0060873027|3.0|Looking for a light read that is years behind current technologies, e.g. drones and a cast of characters barely defined? Buy this book then. If you want a thought provoking storyline with fully developed characters and motivations you won't get it from this book and I don't think Crichton wrote much, maybe did a little background research but the storyline was lame, characters are killed off faster than a Game of Thrones novel and I just didn't give a crap what happened to anyone. Unknown character motivations, limited back stories, unbelievable flights of fancy, save your money and check it out from the library. I feel ripped off and whoever greenlighted the project should be ashamed of their greedy little selves.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this as a computer game so I had to get it for my phone! Very fun and appropriate for all ages!
B005HPY8LU|5.0|I loved this CD, it is one of Kelly Clarkson's best. I think it is even better than her first CD.  I hope she does more music like this in the future.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome program. I love the different reading plans. This app will benefit everyone. I love how it has the different versions of the bible.
B005Y1SVKQ|5.0|I do construction bids and this program is perfect....I can look back to review the job site with the measurements on it....perfect...no more crude drawings...
0451452739|5.0|this is much better then movie. loved the detail. leaves no doubt in your mind of what is going on, you will not be left trying to figuer things out. love the fact that this version goes all the way to saturn and not just jupiter. even though the 2010 book makes no mention of saturn. if your confused as to what happened in the movie read this you will not be confused!
0307943194|5.0|A great book negotiating the legal/class action legal field.  A slow, but very appropriate ending.  I hope Grisham never quits writing.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|If I can rate with a negative Star I would..Metallica just needs to disband already and stop the bleeding..WTF were they thinking.(Llars).Nothing CRAP albums since the black album..I am a fan of Metallica, but the Metallica of the 80's..As soon as I heard they had Bob Rock producing their next album (The Black Album) I knew that was the beginning of the end for them, What does a piece of crap from Air Supply know about thrash metal...Enough said...
0446571415|4.0|Seller shipped book as advertised on a timely basis. Probably the poorest of the Camel Series but that isn't the sellers fault. Glad that Baldacci is going in a different direction as the Camel Club has run its course.
0790701251|5.0|Again, thank God for Amazon. Perfect condition. As a War time movie buff, aside from Tarrantino's Inglorious & Lee Marvin's Dirty Dozen, Stanley Kubrick's it's an even tied.
0385535139|5.0|Grisham at its best. A very likeable cast of protagonists. Hoping to see more of his main characters in future  novels.
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|Mamma Mia in Blu-ray is breath-taking, scenery is great, sound is second to none. ABBA music is timeless. Pierce Brosnan is a great actor, but should not consider a career in singing. All-in-All this is a wonderful musical
0140544518|5.0|My grand-daughter really enjoyed listening to the reading of this story. This was not the first time I ordered from this company.  I am always satisified with them.
1451648537|5.0|If you are into technologies, you'll love this book, if you're not, you'll like it. It tells you how he changed the world and encourages you to do it too, everyone can be a genious...
B003KGBIS4|2.0|I intentionally delayed viewing this film for awhile as Wes Anderson's previous films failed to impress or satisfy me, more notably with The Royal Tenebaums and The Life Aquatic. Unfortunately, this film also fails miserably to redeem Wes Anderon's filmography; moreover, it only reinforces how out of touch Wes Anderson's writing has been with regard to his innate ability for crafting likable characters.   Personally, my two favorite Wes Anderson films (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore) which I am sure are also popular beloved favorites among Wes Anderson fans like myself excelled in bringing fictional characters to life; characters that were incredibly distinct, unique and special; characters that were so flawed but nonetheless had many qualities that was so likable; characters that you could easily relate to but not entirely understand. Wes Anderson was truly an artist in bringing these types of characters to life because he knew exactly how to render them likable and so interesting. Personally, I felt that any writer who can craft someone purely fictional but leave an audience with an intense desire to follow that character through more interactions is a highly talented one. Wes Anderson fully succeeded with this task in his first two installments. I mean is it really necessary to express how much replay value Bottle Rocket or Rushmore possess within each viewing ?      In this little mishap, Wes Anderson takes us to India where the Whitman Brothers rendezvous on a train, \\"The darjeeling Limited\\" , to embark on a spiritual journey since it has been a year seeing each other after their father's funeral. This journey was planned by Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) and even goes as far as to the trouble of creating an organized itinerary. The two other brothers, Peter Whitman (Adrian Brody) and Jack Whitman, (Jason Schrwatzman) do not seem as enthusiastic but comply with Francis's wishes nonetheless. Francis, who appears in the entire film covered with overwhelming but comicallyplaced bandages is recovering from a serious motorcycle accident, meanwhile, Peter has left his 7 1/2 month pregnant wife back at home without telling her where he has gone. Finally, Jack, a novelist, who incessantly attempts to reconnect with an ex-girlfriend (Natalie Portman) but cannot seem to tone down his propensities for non-attached flings seems to struggle with many emotional dilemmas. Along this spiritual journey, Francis reveals to his two brothers another motive for this journey to which they express utter disappointment at first when Francis discloses to them that he wants to reunite with their estranged mother (Angelica Houston) in the Himalayas. She is apparently running a convent there.   This film came across as a lazy, watered down, imposter Wes Anderson without all the bells and whistles. Nothing seemed genuine at all in the film. All of the positive and stand out qualities that were so prevalent in previous Wes Anderson films were just downright diluted in this one or carelessly non-existent. The Indian setting that may seem appropriate for the mournful spiritual journey was not at all interesting nor inviting. The characters were incredibly dull, wooden and just plain boring, nor did any of the characters have any particular uniqueness that was worth noting either. The chemistry among the characters was essentially non-existent and that is probably because all of them were exactly the same. Like another reviewer on here who also expressed his discontent with the film in its entirety by asking the same question I asked too at the end of the film, \\"Who Cares\\" ? I found myself caring less and less about the characters as the film dragged on it's slow, empty and very unfulfilling journey. Quite frankly, there was not one ounce of spirit in this film except maybe in the soundtrack/score which was also not one of Wes Anderson's finest choice. Looking back at this film in particular as well as Wes Anderson's other previous disappointments, I can't helpbut to feel a sort of arrogance spawning out of the once rejuvenating director of indie films. According to Wes Anderson, an unusual setting, dull characters with zero depth but a dash of quirkiness is just enough to attract new fans and retain the old ones. Wrong.  It appears Bottle Rocket and Rushmore will remain at the pinnacle of Mr. Anderson catalog until he finds his true self again or finds a new career.
B005KQVDH8|4.0|This movie is quite old, but the way the remastered it on blu-ray seems like the movie just came out on the big screen.  Great movie to watch with the kids as I have with my parents.  Amazing PQ
B001VLXNLU|1.0|I honestly don't know how this got published. It's so awful I couldn't finish it. Do not waste your money or your time even bothering with this garbage. I'd give it no stars if I could.
1451648537|5.0|This is a great book and I recomend you to read about one this business man. A visionary that changed the way the world used to see personal computers, gadgets and the way we all used to interact with technology. We will miss him.
B004N6369Y|1.0|I have read most of Danielle Steele's books but this one was very disappointing.  Definately not one of her best books.  Would not recommend this, I feel I wasted my purchase price.
B0055SWM08|5.0|&#34;Quell&#34; was one of the first games that I installed on my original Kindle Fire in 2011. It's a unique game that doesn't involve dodging swarms of enemies and trying to destroy them. Instead, the goal is to guide a raindrop around a maze-like playing field while collecting pearls and avoiding traps that can shatter your raindrop. Levels get steadily more difficult, but each new feature is described, so the game is in effect a long, continuing tutorial. There's no time limit, but you do get credit for winning each level in the fewest possible moves. The music soundtrack is very pleasant and calming, although after a while, I usually turn it off.<br /><br />&#34;Quell&#34; is a remarkable original game, and I haven't seen anything else that's close to it in the app store. When I get tired of fast-paced shoot-em-ups, Quell is what I turn to for some relaxing, but very challenging logic puzzles.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I like a good thriller, but sometimes I find there is a bit too much gratuitous violence for my taste or that the plot is thin.  Thankfully for me and this film, neither is true.  I found there was just enough violence to make a point and to further the story, but not so much that it got in the way of the movie.  I also found the plot very compelling.  The romantic subplot to me, balanced things out and added complexity to the relationships and allowed us to see depth in Ben Affleck's character.  It makes him come across as real, as a guy whose life has been to many degrees, highly influenced by his rough home life and lack of positive influences.  He comes across as a guy who knows that what he is doing is wrong and who very much seemed to want to get out and have something more noble to show for himself, but who keeps getting dragged back in.  As a former Charlestown resident, I also really enjoyed the shots of Boston, Charlestown, and Cambridge in the movie.  A lot of times when I see movies set in Boston it's been clear that they do a few money shots in the city to give a sense of place, but that the bulk of shooting is done elsewhere.  This isn't the case of this movie, they show a lot of shots of the city, and to me, it really helped to give the movie a sense of place and authenticity.  I really appreciated seeing the shots of Charlestown.  Overall, whether I lived there or not, I found this a fantastic movie.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Wifi Analyzer is the best app of this type that I've seen. The first time I ran it on my Kindle Fire, it \\"saw\\" more wifi networks around my house than my laptop PC sees, which is probably a testament to both the app and the Kindle Fire's wifi receiver. I made a test drive down a nearby street that has many hotels, restaurants, and other businesses that have wireless networks, and Wifi Analyzer picked up dozens of signals.<br /><br />The five different views that you can select from are all useful to some degree, but my favorite views are \\"AP list\\" and \\"Channel rating.\\" AP list shows all the wireless networks around me and their relative signal strengths, and Channel rating shows the different channels of the network that I'm connected to. I learned that there are stronger channels than the default channel that I was using.<br /><br />It doesn't take a tech geek to figure it out. The graphical interfaces are easy to read and understand.<br /><br />I plan to take my Kindle Fire with me when I travel, and Wifi Analyzer will be extremely helpful in finding and connecting to a strong, stable wifi network. I think this is a \\"must have\\" app if your Kindle Fire (or other wifi tablet) leaves your home.
0307595579|5.0|For those of you still reading paper style books, this set is just as advertised.  A 3 volume set with an extra book about the author.  Very satisfied with purchase.  Received ina timely manner.  Qualified for free shipping.
B004R6JG7G|4.0|This is a 2011 version.  Amazon includes the reviews from ALL versions of this movie here.  The reviews listed under this version should be for THIS version ONLY!  Don't go by any reviews for the earlier versions!  Amazon, shape up!
0446585025|2.0|Despite its relative lack of words (see: coloring-book chapter complete with toaster drawing), it was agonizing work to get to the bottom of this pile of synthetic fluff.   Ellen, I love the show. I DVR it daily, and the positive vibe really works as an afternoon pick-me-up on TV (in print, with intermittent moral lessons thrown in, it comes off a notch more self-satisfied). And all that filming must keep you busy, right? Too busy to have put much effort into \\"Seriously...I'm Kidding,\\" thinks this reader who downloaded and then impatiently skimmed the result in two days, hoping with every page flip that things were finally about to get, well, serious.    I know your motto is something along the lines of, \\"If you don't have anything nice to say...,\\" and I wish I could go that route here. But I also wish I'd paid more attention to the non-gushy reviews before I forked over that $12.99.    Seriously, Ellen, I'm not kidding when I respectfully submit this new motto: If you don't have anything NEW to say, wait a few more years to \\"write\\" the next \\"book.\\"
B004CD7OCI|5.0|This TV show is awesome! It's exciting, terrifying, and funny. I'm addicted and eaglerly wait for each new episode. It's better than any blockbuster movie. I watch on my couch at night with all the lights off gripping my blanket with my heart pounding. I highly recommend it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan's voice is amazing. I actually got goose bumps the first time I played this album.  What can I say that other fans have not? She is an inspiration to many, many, people.  Bravo Susan. I hope you gift us with your voice for many years to come.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|It just keeps getting better! This show continues to shock, make me laugh, surprise and terrify me. Keep it up AMC.
B0058VW36U|5.0|What I love most about this game is the balanced level of complexity... it doesn't frustrate to the point of discouragement, yet can prove challenging and perplexing.  Excellent buy for the price!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I devoured the book and devoured the DVD as well. I have watched the DVD at least three times since I purchased it. The only thing I feel I can add to the numerous reviews here is that I find the characterizations of the company commanders- \\"Captain America\\" and \\"Encino Man\\" as rather specious. In one scene  one of the Captains doesn't know what \\"danger close\\" means. I find this almost impossible to believe. First of all, all Marines go through infantry training (even fighter  pilots) and \\"danger close\\" is about as basic a concept as there is. Second, these particular officers were Recon Marines. Recon Marines are the Marine Corps equivalent of Special Forces.  Everyone- from the lowest enlisted to the most senior officers- who are Recon Marines endure several months of brutal, physically, intellectually and emotionally demanding  training- just to become a Recon Marine. There is no way a Captain does not know the meaning of \\"Danger Close\\".
B004YCKK6Y|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. I have seen it multiple times and it never gets old or fails to leave me laughing. Tim Roth is FANTASTIC and the cast of characters keep this movie going in mutiple directions.
0439023521|3.0|It was just so boring and predictable, every step of the way.  Absolutely no surprises, absolutely nothing interesting, nothing to make you think.  It's a quick read and an interesting concept, I guess, but the main character is a vapid idiot (I mean, really, she STILL doesn't get the Peeta is in love with her 4/5th of the way through the book?  REALLY????) and kind of annoying.  Granted, my favorite series is the Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) so I'm used to layers, complexity, twists and turns, etc.  This book was child's play and is really suited more for young adults with little reading experience.  A disappointment.
0345509617|5.0|This is simply a must have book if you are a Star Wars fan or interested in the process of movie making. It is filled with amazing behind-the-scenes photos of all the cast and crew and never-before-seen concept art from Ralph MacQuarrie, Joe Johnston, Mike Pangrazio and all the other amazing artists who helped create the movie. The book also focuses heavily on the ILM team, headed by Phil Tippet and Dennis Muren and is filled with their beautiful models and creatures plus insights into their ground-breaking visual effects. There are wonderful anecdotes from Irvin Kershner, Larry Kasdan, Ben Burtt, Mark Hammill and the master himself, George Lucas. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. The Author J.W. Rinzler has done an incredible job gathering all this archived material 30 years after the film's release. You will not be dissapointed. Add to cart!
B004EPYZQC|4.0|Loved the first one (The Fast and the Furious), skipped 2 and 3 because, well Vin Diesel wasn't in them........... got #4 (Fast and Furious) so I couldn't pass this one up!! The gangs all here, well most of them anyway (with a little teaser at the end) and Dwayne Johnson is added to the mix. This is just a fun, action adventure move. Don't expect anything to much but it's the same caliber as the first and 4th title. Crazy ridiculous, impossible car stunts, chases, fights, hot guys, hot girls and cool cars!! Enjoy!! Oh, and I don't recommend getting behind the wheel of a car for at least an hour after watching this movie, for some reason, people tend to drive faster after watching. ;)
B004U52VPS|3.0|simple game. i just dont like setting up after knocking it over.my son, 3yrs old, loves it. bringing his favorite phone app to life. :)
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I originally purchased a more expensive app that was not meeting my needs and was very frustrating to use. This app is perfect! It locks the screen so.it doesn't sleep.when you're using it. Its amazingly easy to.highlight a.single object/letter/number and the menus have exactly what you.need Thank you for such a great app!
B001QXCYZY|5.0|This is one of the best mics I have worked with in a long time.  It is a ruggedly constructed unit.  The USB cable (included) is long so it may be used a bit away from your computer fan noise.  And the best part, it makes you sound great.  Behringer makes this and it is as good as any of their products.  Would and will buy another of these.  I was hesitant to buy a USB mic but it works great.  Plus the price is very affordable.
B003L77GH4|5.0|This is my one weakness in life! I am in love with this show and I was so happy when I got this season! There was nothing wrong with it and it came very promptly. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone!
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|The begginning was not very great, but the action comes in when they loose their job. The ending is very fuuny when they try to steal a car made of gold from a 5 story building.
B001ER4CSO|5.0|This was exactly what I wanted, I had absolutely no problems with it. There was no tears or scratches anywhere and the dvd showed up faster than I thought! It was perfect!
B0053YGYO4|3.0|Solid CD.  What could fans expect after that last two efforts, which were off the charts?  But there is enough good material, and a few excellent songs, to make this worth the purchase.
B000B8QG4A|4.0|It arrived very fast,but I haven't watched it.It is a Christmas gift for my 3 year old granddaughter.I think it will be fine.
0194230899|1.0|I was totally shocked when I realized this book was not the actual b ook, but a condensed version.  The original is my favorite book, and I was trying to replace my copy.  Unfortunately, the cost of the return wasn't worth the effort.
1594484805|5.0|A must read for teachers--it really gives you a great perspective on what really motivates students.  It explains why students are not interested in the traditional ways.  Makes me rethink how I structure my classroom.
140053271X|5.0|I thought I would hate reading books on anything that wasn't a book before I looked at the Nook. It isn't backlit like computers, so it doesn't cause headaches as it does for many to read on computers; it's more like reading a book. It's more convenient, however, because the pages don't turn of their own accord when it is set down, and it is lighter than a book. In addition, though many ebooks are sold at the same list price as the book itself, the Barnes & Noble site allows users to download many free ebooks in addition to buying. This is a space-efficient way for those who read many books to own books; it is not necessary to have walls of bookshelves, because the Nook holds many digital versions of the same books which one could buy in a physical form. There are, of course, issues with it, as there are with any form of technology. The fact that it runs on battery leaves one in danger of running out of power in a place without a charger. In addition, the screen occasionally freezes, requiring the manual shutdown of the device to return it to normal. These, however, are not major detriments when compared to the massive gains. The Nook is definitely worth the money, even though it costs considerably more than a book would.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This classic-to-be, by director J. J. Abrams and Producer Steven Spielberg, captures everything about the dreams of my youth.  I remember writing creative stories for my grade school class and illustrating them with crayon drawings.  I was hooked on Science Fiction like many young men of that era.  \\"Super 8\\" is a masterpiece...not only because it ventures where my thoughts and creative dreams wandered, but because it was perfectly cast, scripted and visualized by Spielberg and Abrams.  Without giving away one cent of the plot and outcome, this is a film that unfolds to new heights and you find yourself taking tiny doses of what ends up to be a mighty prescription for thrills, chills and heart-tugging (a trademark of Spielberg) emotions.  When it comes to an end, you'll want to watch it again.  When it begins, you never really want it to end.  Don't miss this gem.
B0000894RZ|3.0|Her voice is gourgeous, and the music nice to listen to, and relax, but somehow it's like listening to the same three songs, not much variety, that's a shame. But still, a nice cd, but don't expect rocket science.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|This one is not only \\"sharp\\", it is also a true \\"cut-up\\" (no puns intended).  Take a simple plot such as \\"closing the borders\\" and turn it into a thriller...with comedic undertones and lots of GORE (but not overdone).  Robert Rodriguez is at his best.  If you recall, he also directed \\"Terror Planet\\"...the first of a double feature on the \\"Grindhouse\\" DVD...and \\"Sin City\\".  \\"Machete\\" is much better...a great cast...lots of beautiful women...shoot-em-up scenes...revenge...twists...and special effects.  How can you miss with Danny Trejo as \\"Michete\\" and a supporting cast of Jessica Alba, Robert De Niro, Jeff Fahey, Steven Seagal, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson and (yes) Lindsay Lohan.  All 5 stars...but don't let the kids watch this one...too much violence, realistic revenge, and adult themes.  Put the popcorn in the microwave...have a bottle of beer or glass of wine...and enjoy the ride.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|these are the best pacifiers out there--and worth the $$$--they don't fall apart, easy for my baby to find and pick up--can be doubled as a toy---great for car rides--and they look adorable to boot!
B002OFWG7E|5.0|if your a foo fighter fan, you should love this cd. Its a must buy for a foo fighters fan. I bought this along with their new cd Wasting light
0553801473|4.0|This book (book 4 in the series) was slower than the other three, but still excellently written.  Many of the main characters spend the majority of the book moping (Dany & Jon Snow), or drifting fairly aimlessly (Tyrion & Mormont).  Stannis and his \\"queens men\\" finally leave the wall, but barely.  They encounter no Lannisters to advance that plot.<br /><br />I'm still re-reading it (read it as it came out, then reread the other 3, and then it again), and enjoying it, but I wish it had progressed the story a lot farther.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I bought this along with the Foo Fighters \\" Best of \\" CD. An awesome buy. Love both cd's. If your a trus Foo Fighters fan, you will ove these two cd's
1419702238|5.0|I bought one for my son and another for my nephew...they both opened the package and didn't stop reading until they finished, even my teenager niece read it in one day!!  It was funny to hear my son laughing while he read it.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|Love any LEGO sets, but this brings in the holiday season and inspires a lot of creative and play acting.
B0068TJLSY|2.0|I had heard that the reviews for this movie were good and so I decided to give this one a try.  The cast were excellent at the start of this movie.  The action scenes were the best I have watched in a very long time.  It kept my interest until near the end of the movie and it simply fell flat very quickly - the ending made me angry and felt the J J Abrams has finally lost it - not his best at all.
B001BPQT8A|5.0|I already own an edition of this great bluray book so I ordered another but due to the lousy packaging it arrived in a bad condition. Amazon why not send this out in a rigid type of packaging so that it cannot arrive damaged? But the film itself is excellent!
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I have to admit I am do not read comics or enjoy sci fi movies for the most part and so when I go watch a movie I try to leave my brain at home since often it is not required for movies like this.  I was captivated from the very beginning to the great end of the movie.  I love the cast etc and thought it was a great addition to the XMen movies.  I look forward to more in the future and I can't wait to see how it will continue.
159514188X|5.0|I think everyone who has ever been bullied or harassed should read this book. I think everyone who thinks its okay to pick on someone else or who knows they are a bully should read this book. This book sent chills up my bones and into my heart. This book made me cry. THIS IS THE THIRD BOOK, THAT HAS GRABBED ME AND WOULDN'T LET ME GO!!!!!!!! I couldn't stop reading this book. It made me cry and ask why? Why didn't Clay speak up for his classmate, where was his tolerance and his morals. This book should be a mandatory read for everyone who is highschool. This book was beyond moving. I recommend this book to anyone is struggling in and of themselves. This book sends out the clear message that bullying can have fatal consequences and can leave the people responsible with something worse than an actual sentence. This book has one of the most powerful lessons I have ever read. I loved this book and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good read, or a good lesson. I wish this book was on the highschool reading list. I really do.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|i watched this movie expecting a big pile of crap and boy did I get what I thought it would be.  As I mentioned in the title I feel asleep twice and then woke up and watched from where I left off and still I dozed off again.  The movie is all special effects and despite the hotness of Ryan Reynolds - even his hot body couldn't keep me wanting to see this pile of crap!
0385535139|2.0|I found The Litigators disappointing because I had recently finished Grisham's previous novel, The Confession, which was quite excellent in every way.    By contrast, this plot seemed trivial; plus, I couldn't keep track of the many characters introduced early in the story.  Finally I gave up and returned the book after just a couple of chapters.  Too bad! Better luck next time - And Mr. Grisham, please provide a \\"cast of characters\\", OK?
B001AGXEA6|4.0|I think blu-ray movies are great.  Although there are some of the older movies that have been done in blu-ray that haven't really come up to the blu-ray quality that the newer movies have.  But I guess that's life.  This one is pretty good quality.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I liked the diversity of the songs.  All around good album.  I am a fan of Kelly Clarkson and have never been disappointed with any of her music.  I did have the impression that this was a Christmas album.  I was wrong.
B006ANJ4BW|4.0|This was a lot better than I expected it to be given some of the reviews I'd read.  The action was good, the sets worked to give it a real feel for the Hyboria, and (shock horror) the acting wasn't too bad. Is it epic brilliance? No, not really. It is however an entertaining sword and sorcery flick, and well above average quality for the genre. Comparing against the wonderful kitsch of the Arnie movies from the 80s isn't going to work, they're just different and there are elements of both movies that are excellent.  To pick negatives, the 2011 version felt like the plot was a little rushed; i.e. the characters went from action sequence to action sequence without enough time in between for the audience to catch it's breath, or give the characters the oppertunity to explain and deepen the plot a little. The end result being that it was hard to really empathise with the characters, or in some cases really understand the plot if one wasn't an afficionado of the books. The orignal Conan was strengthened by an amazing musical score; this movie lacked that.  Overall? Worth renting on an evening with nothing much else to do, it will enjoyably pass the time. I'd only buy it if you're a die hard fan.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I Highly recommend these.<br />Clean and unclouded, with good representation within the bass spectrum.<br />Good isolation from outside sounds, VERY comfortable.<br /><br />Only negatives: They feel a bit delicate, and I don't think the ear pads will last forever.<br /><br />There are probably better headphone monitors out there somewhere, but these are close to the very top and for the $160 I paid for these they are excellent for this price point.<br />I would pay $300 to $500 for this audio quality.
B005K17RU0|3.0|App is really nice, has good accurate info. However, it locks up on occasion, loses connection, and is very slow to detect new locations...
0316069353|5.0|Connelly, the gift that keeps on giving.  I couldn't stop reading and finished at 2AM.  That alone should be a reason to buy this one.  But if you're a follower, you've already read it...and if you haven't, you need to read this Mickey Haller roller coaster ride, NOW!  Absolutely vintage Connelly.
B004G600A4|5.0|Tangles is awesome!  If you have a son he will like it just as much as your daughter! Disney hit a home run!  My son wont be caught dead in the same room as a cinderella or snow white movie but he askes to watch tangled!  A truely great movie you wont be disappointed in it!
B003UYUR0G|2.0|Big budget, big stars, big action. Big snore. Not really invested in characters or plot. Rented through Netflix so not mad 'bout wasting my money. But would not recommend to anybody.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This Seiko watch is incredibly good value for the price. I cannot believe how well built this watch is. The finish is very very good. Even the canvas strap looks good and hardy. Other people have commented that the size may be on the small side - but to me the watch looks like a standard watch size. Amazon delivery was very reliable as usual.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The hottest book this fall is Walter Isaacon's biography of Steve Jobs, entitled Steve Jobs.  It has been at the top of the best seller list since Jobs' untimely death in October 2011.  For anyone interested in technology, product development, business, the seismic changes in the music or movie industries or entrepreneurship generally, this is a must read.<br /><br />The basic contours of Jobs' story are well known.  Steve Jobs, the college-dropout, hippie, Zen-oriented, whiz kid, created the personal computer with his friend in his parent's garage.  The computer, the Apple, becomes a runaway hit, evolved into the Macintosh (and the mouse and user interface that most of us currently use), and created an entire industry.  On the heels of his success, Jobs was fired by the company he created.  He created a new computer company, Next, which flopped.  After finding some humility, Jobs found his way back into Apple, reinvigorated the company, learned from his mistakes and then revolutionized the PC industry, the animation/movie industry (by creating Pixar, which made megahits such as Cars, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Toy Story etc.), the mobile phone industry (the iPhone) and mass-marketed touch computing.  He then created the tablet category of computers with the runaway hit, the iPad.  Jobs did not market test his ideas; he believed that consumers did not always know what they wanted.  He designed a closed ecosystem of computing that allowed him to create and control an optimal and complete computing experience.  For years, his approach was derided as Microsoft grew and grew.  Finally, with the iPod, the iPhone and iPad, the rationale for the closed eco-system took off, making Apple one of the most valuable companies in the world.  As a marketing genius, entrepreneur and visionary, Jobs was incredible.  Jobs demanded perfection from himself and those who worked for him.  As a business leader, there is a lot to learn from him.<br /><br />As a person, Jobs was a flawed (i.e., normal) human being.  He made mistakes and often learned from them.  Jobs was adopted as a baby and well cared for by his adopted-parents.  Yet, as a young man, Jobs fathered a child and essentially abandoned her.  Later in life, he brought her back into his life.  This is surprising behavior from a man who presumably should be most sensitive to the damage caused by abandonment.  As a boss, he could be demeaning  and unnurturing.  His ability to warp reality (what those around him called the \\"reality distortion field\\") was not only a powerful business tool, it also carried into his personal life with negative consequences.  When Jobs was first diagnosed with cancer, the man who was at the forefront of technology and possessed contacts and money chose to ignore his cancer, essentially trying to will it away and ignore it.  About nine months later, he finally began to come to terms with it and started treating it by more traditional means.<br /><br />Several years before his death but after Jobs knew about his cancer, Jobs asked Isaacson to write his biography.  Jobs believed that his legacy was worth chronicling (as it was).  Isaacson had published successful biographies about inventors/geniuses (Benjamin Franklin: An American Life and Einstein: His Life and Universe; both are excellent reads).  Jobs saw himself as the continuation of these stories.  He was probably right.<br /><br />Isaacson had full access and complete editorial control over the book.  Jobs seemed to have shared everything.  The only criticism of the biography is that Isaacson became to close to his subject.  Occasionally, it shows. Yet, who wouldn't be in awe of the man who created and/or reshaped the technology, movie, music and mobile phone industries.<br /><br />Two interesting notes for the literary oriented reader.  Jobs dated Jennifer Egan, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of A Visit from the Goon Squad and personally installed a Mac for her.  Jobs' natural sister, Mona Simpson, isa writer, who incorporated her brother and his life into her bestselling books.  The biography is filled with interesting tidbits and should be at the top of everyone's reading list.<br /><br />[Full disclosure -- this review was written on a Dell.  Soon enough, I'll be on a Mac.]fe into her bestselling books.  The biography is filled with interesting tidbits and should be at the top of everyone's reading list.

B005L38QK2|5.0|I went to BlizzCon 2011 and this mouse was located a their Diablo 3 Demo stations -- from the first 30 minutes or so of using the mouse I fell in love with it.  Normally I am very particular with my mice, after all I have been using a Microsoft Intellimouse 1.1a for about 8 years because it was just such a good fit and great, reliable performance. Gaming mice, to me, are often overburdened with a bunch of unnecessary features that just end up hiking up the price. The Diablo 3 Mouse is very similar to the well-reviewed Steelseries Xai with a few, positive exceptions:  -- The mouse buttons have less of a stiffness to them than normal mice it seems. After about a half-day's use the clicks are very responsive and take little pressure to actuate. Spam clicking in any game is effortless and with the extended warranty on the buttons themselves I am not worried about them wearing out like so many other mice I have tried in the past have done.  -- The Steelseries Engine software allows customization and macros, which are useful for all games and applications, but it is not overbearing with settings that I honestly shouldn't have to think about (the Sensei, I consider, to be TOO configurable).  -- The branded style of the mouse I would usually find as a turnoff, as I did with previous Steelseries products. However, The Diablo 3 design is incredibly well done and the mouse does not look \\"tacky\\" at all, it is very appealing.  As far as general use and features, I have been very pleased and have some key comments on this as well:  -- The side buttons are well placed and easy to press. Some have complained that the right side buttons are hit accidentally but I have never had that problem.  -- The mouse is not large, which allows for a variety of grips and for a comfortable fit even for people with smaller hands, such as myself.  -- The DPI toggle on the top of the button is placed so that it is never mis-pressed. I usually use a lower sensitivity for most games and applications,but if I need some extra speed I can easily toggle it.  -- The braided cord is great and very durable. These cords are standard with many gaming mice. If you have a problem with it hitching on your desk, I would suggest to get one of the variety of inexpensive mouse wire holders.  Overall I have been very pleased. I've found the mouse great for casual use as well as perfect for my Diablo 3 beta, Starcraft 2 (Master's league player), and Quake Like play. While it is too early to say, \\"this mouse is great I've had it for 5 years with no problems!\\" I am confident I will be using it for a long time.  Hope this helps!
B0052GACNM|4.0|Loved the various collaberations.  Was especially surprised with Lady Gaga and Amy Winehouse, both of whom I was not really a fan.  Showed their versatility and range.
B0064Y5U24|5.0|I love Nickelback and have all their cds.They just get better and better. Please listen to trying not to love you; so good.
B004KA9MQO|2.0|I really like Jennifer Hudson as a singer and actress. However when I first listen to this album, I was very disappointed. Jennifer has a wonderful voice, but the songs on this album did not suited her. Her debut album was good, but I Remember Me is not her best album. I don't think R&B music will never be the same as it was in the past.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|All I have to say is that I love this new cd and I love Rihanna. She is a very talented person that do not need a break. The new cd is very catching, fun and makes me feel like dancing all the time. Its better than half the things I hear nowadays.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Arrived promptly.  Have been trying to find everywhere in Australia to no avail.  Serched on Amazon and found it.  Arrived a lot earlier than promised.    Very happy customer
B003XCVQ3C|2.0|Worked really well for the first 5 months, no problems with picture or audio when connecting my MBP 2010 to my HDTV  Then the blackouts started... Picture will blank out randomly... Sometimes every half hour, sometimes every five minutes  This is due to shabby build quality, I expect something a little better for thirty bucks  I won't be buying this brand again
B003YK42LQ|5.0|Absolutely love this record and listen to it constantly.  Wonderful southern rock feel. You won't be disappointed. Best music I've heard in a long time.

B00008RH1H|4.0|Arika Kurosawa's Throne of Blood is a Japanese Macbeth, a film from the late 1950s. I found that this production was excellent as it sets a dominating bleak and empty atmosphere. It gives the film an underlying depressive feeling and a sense of foreboding. This black and white production, with barren landscapes and foggy clouds still conveys this to a new audience, over 50 years later.  Much of the acting was stylised; a thing which I didn't mind in this context. As the Japanese language is completely inaccessible, this acting technique helps to get the message across. The stylised mannerisms, speech tone, timbre and colour all manage to convey the basic emotions, postures and characterisation. My main grouch with the film is that the subtitles are woefully inadequate and miss the mark by a mile. So I would love to get a modern English speaking Shakespearian  to revamp all of the subtitles. I think it would add more to this otherwise fine film. However, I am not convinced that dubbing would be better, even if the eye then would not keep shifting down to the bottom of the screen, continually removing focus from the action.  Empty rooms were symbolic of its shallow and spiritless people. However, one of the best scenes was in the courtyard where the `ladies in waiting' were kneeling down, wailing for their deceased queen. All of them had their backs to the camera, heads lowered with pony tails on view, and wept as one unit. It was quite remarkable.  I would advise people to see this, although some must beware of the usual barriers of foreign language films. But there is still a lot there, and I for one, could easily watch it again.
1932100385|5.0|Wow! What a informative book about \\"healthy eating\\". Hard to put down once you start reading it. I followed the book, watched what I ate, and feel much better for it. My blood pressure lowered in 4 weeks just from healthier eating alone. I have much more energy, and sleep much better. This book is a must read!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I wasn't disappointed at all with Adele's newest CD. I hadn't heard most of the songs before I bought it, but she did a great job. New favorite song from buying the CD is \\"Rumour Has It\\".
B00005M989|3.0|The product arrived in a reasonable time, however, the seller did not send it packaged as advertised.  It came in a flimsy white paper cover, not even plastic. The quality of the cd is ok. Will not be using this seller in the future. False advertising may be the American Way, but it is the wrong way.  Not thanx.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like every song on the CD when I decided to buy it (I loved the song \\"If I Die Young\\"), but I listened to it and found new favorite songs. The songs \\"You Lie\\" and \\"Double Heart\\" are great! I listen to this just about every day and am really glad I decided to buy it. Absolutely worth buying.
B000000OPZ|5.0|The cd came in a timely manner and was exactly as advertised. Quality sound and will be using the same people in the future when the need arises.  Thanx
B0045HCIYA|5.0|I replaced a VHS tape with this DVD. I have watched this film a number of times and still enjoy it. Demi Moore does a good job with her part as a strugling mom trying to get custody of her daughter, and she looks GREAT. The best part of the film, I believe, is the performance by Burt Reynolds who plays the part of a problem older Senator who is spell bound with Demi's character. He does a great job with this role! A number of other actors in this film are good in there roles. If you like Demi Moore or Burt Reynolds you can't go wrong with this entertaining film! [[ASIN:B0045HCIYA Striptease]]
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Delivery was fast, and i have been using for about a month now, i have not come across any problems and sound quality is very good.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|This review is dedicated to my dearest friend E who's birthday is 11/27.<br /><br />This film is a real 5 star masterpiece. This is a historical film that does take some artistic liberties. King Henry VIII has recently died, and his evil daughter 'Bloody Mary' is on the throne. King Henry VIII had some issues and faults. But despite that, he was actually a really great king. (He built up the navy well, authorized the Bible's translation into English, freed England from Rome's corruption, kept the control his father Henry VII had established after the War of the Roses, and even held England together during the uncertainties of the Reformation.<br /><br />Mary I seems to have inherited her father's issues without any of his redeeming qualities. She seems to be desperate to hang onto a crown and control that she will inevitably lose. (She even considers killing her own sister Elizabeth.)<br /><br />Elizabeth seems to be a sympathetic character throughout most of this film. First she is virtually Mary's prisoner. When Mary dies, Elizabeth of course becomes queen. But she is already being manipulated by certain parties that seek to dethrone her. (Even to the point of giving her advice that will damage England.) She has enemies both foreign and domestic. We also see that the Bishops are against her.<br /><br />Add to that that she gradually finds out that while she loves Robert Dudley, he is in fact a married man. (Needless to say, she doesn't take to this well.)<br /><br />Cate Blanchett really embodies the daughter of King Henry VIII. In her trials, she is cautious. Sometimes she shows an untapped power. Yet she can also be sympathetic and vulnerable.<br /><br />At times, Geoffrey Rush steals the film as Elizabeth's advisor and protector. (Kind of a medieval FBI agent.) He is very loyal and very good at his job. At times he does seem almost evil. But we could easily argue that he needs to 'fight fire with fire' as he takes on the many enemies of Elizabeth. Geoffrey Rush will probably always be remembered by most as Captaim Hector Barbossa. But in my opinion, Walsingham is really his best performance.<br /><br />Elizabeth has many political enemies. But perhaps the most disturbing thing about this film is all the people who want to kill Elizabeth in the name of God. (Including the Pope. Performed by the 96 year old legendary John Gielgud.)<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush comes through and flips the tables. But to the director's credit, we are somewhat disturbed as Geoffrey Rush takes down Elizabeth's opposition. (Violence is disturbing even if the good side is winning.)<br /><br />Perhaps the most satisfying part is that at the start of the film, Geoffrey Rush survives and flips the tables on an assassination attempt. He knows who did it, and even has fun by greeting the man behind the failed attempt in a friendly civil manner. And in the end, he has the pleasure of arresting him for plotting against Elizabeth.<br /><br />The scenery is phenomenal. We also have drama, comedy, mystery, and suspense.<br /><br />This movie was a phenomenal masterpiece. I was happy to give this as a gift to someone on the happiest day of my life.<br /><br />Joyeux anniversaire ma chere Elizabeth.m Hector Barbossa.

B000O8OTNC|1.0|I bought this based on the good reviews form here and from you tube. But through personal experience; this sucks.  the carbide blades just remove the material from the edge and the ceramic doesn't do much for it either; in fact it actually takes away the just sharpened edge and makes it dull. The \\"diamond\\" rod also doesn't do much for serrated blades as it just roughs up the area and doesn't create a usable edge.  Basically  it sucks....  it hard to hold in place, it doesn't live up to it name except the \\"pocket\\" part, the carbide removes too much and the ceramic doesnt refine it enough and the diamond rod is useless and its has a very cheap; made in china look and feel.
B005D646RE|5.0|I've seen every episode of Breaking Bad and season 4 is without a doubt some of the best TV ever.  It's riveting in every way.  The show has always had great acting and interesting characters, but season 4 has much tighter plots and dialogue than in previous seasons.<br /><br />In season 4 Gus Fring proves to be a most memorable character; Mike is perfectly menacing yet understated; the cartel rears its ugly head; Skyler gets with the program; Hank keeps sniffing around the edges; Jesse goes off the deep end; Sol gets worried; Tio Hector Salamanca comes up big; and Walter becomes a man we never expected.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it before watch the earlier episodes before jumping into season 4.
0385342039|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I am read most all of Sophie's books but this was one of my favorites.  It was a great story and very interesting characters that came to life on the page, I didn't want it to end.
B005KELQEU|1.0|I received my Kindle Touch a week ago, but have yet to be able to use it. I ordered it through Amazon, so therefore it is already suppose to be registered, but mine is not. It says My Kindle in the top lef hand coner. I cannot seem to get my kindle registered or connected to WI-fI. I need help resolving this matter. So far, I am very disappointed in my purcase, becaue I have alot of friends who have Kindles and have not experienced these problems. They were able to start using their Kindle immeditly.
0440241901|5.0|I thought this book was hilarious, I bought it in the airport and laughed out loud a few times on the plane.  It was very creative and fun, it really could happen to anyone.
1451648537|5.0|It is a great book to read.  I am pleased to have ordered it.  It gives me a bigger perspective as to what was involved in the development of apple co.

B001NHNG64|1.0|Words fail me, but they failed Mr. Child as well. Totally sophomoric, or should I say moronic. Quit reading it 20 pages from the end, it is that bad. Do yourself a favor and skip this author.
0385535139|5.0|Another well written book. Grisham held my attention throughout and it was a different story than previous novels. I enjoy getting his books when they come out and this was a one day read. Very captivating.
0439813786|5.0|I simply have never had this experience before. No book I've read has ever combined graphics as part of the actual movement of the story - not as supportive to the dialog, not to clarify the words, but as vehicles themselves to carry the story forward. They are pencil drawings, beautifully shaded. It is a more like the merging of a book and a silent black and white movie.<br /><br />Good stories are layered. The tale hangs mainly on our protagonist, the orphan Hugo, living within the walls and spaces of a Parisian train station. He has taken on the function of time keeper/clock winder that his now missing uncle once performed.  A mysterious mechanical man in disrepair, left to Hugo by his beloved father, becomes the vehicle to join the child to another station character - the crotchety toy merchant who maintains a small shop in the main concourse. Hugo uses pieces from the mechanical toys - which he has stolen from the merchant - to tinker with the mechanical man. Once he is caught, we have the opportunity to learn more about the old man through Hugo's interaction with him and his young niece, Hugo's new friend.<br /><br />The pivotal character of the station's toy merchant pulls us further into this world when Hugo discovers his past as a magician and as a pioneer with film. By placing the story within a train station, Brian Selznick can tip his hat to some of the groundbreaking first attempts at film which used the same type of venue, as well as the genius of imagination that was set free with this new medium. The great clocks of the station's tower help us remember Harold Loyd, and the trains were the subjects of some of the first films. It is at this point that the use of the black and white illustrations takes on another function, speaking to us about the dramatic way images, without sound and color, can still speak to us so eloquently.<br /><br />This is one of those special books that has a compelling story that can be read by a young reader, and at the same time can be a bridge to historical events when read by an adult. I chose to explore Hugo Cabret after seeing a trailer for the movie \\"Hugo.\\" My intention was to pre-screen the book to see if it was appropriate for a great niece's Christmas present. To my surprise, as an adult I was enthralled. And as so often happens, the book's story became a doorway - it led me to trace more information about the earliest experiments with film. The relationship between early film and magicians was a surprise to me. And perhaps as a person living approximately a century after film began, let alone having no memory of a life without it, it is understandable that I had no perspective about the effects of the first films on their viewers - a world of imagination, nightmares and dreams. How strange, magical and wonderful it all must have seemed.<br /><br />Knowing Scorsese's love of film history, I am now anxious to see how he has brought this book to film to tell both a child's story and to help all of us appreciate the evolution of what we are watching.rical events when read by an adult.

1451648537|5.0|Being kind of an old guy who's never owned a Mac (although I've eaten a few big ones) or an iAnything, and knowing nothing about Mr. Jobs except that he was a successful and somewhat idiosyncratic businessman, I really got an update.  I plan to head out to the Apple store at the mall soon and see what this stuff is all about.  I expect that much more will now be written by others about Jobs.  For whatever reason, Jobs was unsocialized in the usual sense.  One thing I missed was some sort of attempt by the author to zero in on Jobs' personality-type, which worked for him in the business world, but would rarely work for others. Clearly, we don't have the entire picture here, but Isaacson has made a great start.
B0068TJLSY|3.0|If I was 8 or ten maybe this would be better. I feel a movie filmed mostly in the dark is done so they save money. Much of the time one does not know what is going on and can barely see the alien in any of the shots. How this is so highly rated is beyond me. Do American audiences expect so little? At least it did not have the usual bathroom humor or scenes of urination. I think this movie was weak if one compares it to other Spielberg films. He has rather insulted his abilities with this film. Compare it to E.T. or Stand By Me. I heard so much hype about this movie I really looked forward to watching. Now I am just disappointed. Glad I didn't spend a ticket price at the theatre. Definitely not a the producers best. I rented it from Amazon for only $1.99 which is all it is worth. Sorry folks. They should try again. Mr. Spielberg, you are worthy of so much more. Even the special effects are just copies of other recent movies that rely on cars and trucks flying through the air and/or blowing up. Really dumb...suspence....only about when was it going to end.
B006ANJ4BW|2.0|As a kid, I liked to read the Conan stories. I would rate this story probably as good as many other Conan stories but not among the better ones.   I enjoyed the Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. This one is a Disney version of the story. While watching it, I was thinking this is not Conan. Conan is not really a nice guy but to his friends. He does not rescue strangers out of the goodness of his heart, often he is to them amoral.    The acting was not particularly good. I did not think anyone was good. Part of the problem is although Jason Momoa is a good actor, I do not think he was allowed to develop the role as it should be done and Rachel Nichols was nothing in the role. Knock out the two main roles and what is left of the movie?  On the plus side, the filming was very good. They did spend some money, and they spent it wisely. I particularly liked the sandmen scene.   Overall, I suggest giving it a miss.
B005JZBP8W|4.0|Received 'My Fair Lady' and 'Mutiny on the Bounty' from Amazon US 2day....10 days after ordering...(all the way to Sydney, Australia)-much better service than Amazon UK....I must say.....3 wks for \\"Zhivago\\" BD.  Forget all the disheartening reviews you may have read re the MFL BD.....it is absolutely stunning.  If you think the dvd (even with upscaling) is good-forget it-the BD is what this movie has been waiting for.   Sure-it's not an 8K scan restoration from a 65mm original....possibly a 4K scan from a beautiful 35mm orig. but I can't be sure about this.   But despite-it is superb....picture and audio are first class.  I am a true devotee of this movie - I know every scene-almost every frame.....and this BD is without doubt the best version ever of this classic and beautifully produced film.   When you watch it-don't despair at the opening credits....these have always (since the 70mm release) been awful grainy freeze frames of flowers...can't imagine why Jack L.W. ever let this happen...we'll never know I guess.   MFL was released in 1964...so 2014 will be the 50th Anniversary...maybe then we'll get the 8K scan this movie deserves. But for the time being, and for all these years we've had to endure the albeit superb dvd version-  this is the one to buy now.   Why a movie which won so many Oscars has not been given the treatment given to such benchmark BD's as   \\"How the West Was Won\\" - \\"Patton\\" - \\"Ben-Hur\\".....I will never know....all about $$$ I guess.   BUT-the great hope for all of us out there who truly appreciate these (almost always) superb 1080 transfers on our 50inch Plasmas.....is the forthcoming 8K transfer of the supreme masterpiece of all time....  \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".  In the meantime-all you lovers of \\"MFL\\"....do not hesitate to buy this BD.  Ps: the US edition is 'Zone Free'.....plays in Australia---no probs.   dw-Australia
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Great movie about a situation that could change people forever in negative or positive I see it as moving forward with the best results to look forward after something bad happens.
B005BDZN62|5.0|Don't know where to begin with this BD.  Forget the dvd....this is a whole new movie.   Did you ever see the 70mm release way back in the '60's ????  Well, you're about to experience it all over again.   And if you ever thought \\"WSS\\" was a bit slow here and there and maybe needed a bit of judicial editing here and there....watch it again and wonder at the sheer brilliance of this movie AND of the BD transfer,  So many times we (the BD buyers/suckers) buy crap and feel ripped off at less than average transfers.  But this is a winner.   I put it up there with some of the best....BUT....NOT....up there with the benchmark BD's....  How the West Was Won\\"-\\"Patton\\" -\\"Ben-Hur\\".  It's almost as good but not quite. But in saying that...how many BD's are as great as those.   I mean---\\"Ben-Hur\\"....what can I say about this BD.  But WSS falls only very slightly short. The pic & audio are superb.   From the moment the opening Overture/Titles begin you are consumed by this masterful piece of film-making.  If you're not affected immediately by Bernstein's score thumping thru the surround system...you really should check for a pulse.   And if you don't have a sub-woofer hooked up to your sound system....get one.   Yeah I know...but you'd be amazed at how many people Don't.   Stunning BD-  dw-Australia.
B0002HYHSW|5.0|We bought this toy for our 3 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas this year and are very pleased with the sturdiness of the pieces (it's all wood) and the basic design of the game.  It is simple and yet very effective for our little one to enjoy and learn from.  Some games for 3-4 year olds are just not sturdy and/or too complex.  This one is great.  Two thumbs up!
B005GP7F8Y|5.0|I can't buy this BD because it's US zoned and I live in Australia and that really pisses me off because it's a great movie and I would love to see this (hopefully) restored version.   Oh well, maybe it'll get released in Australia in the next 100 years.  What's with this \\"zoning\\" crap anyway?????  Just put the bloody things onto BD and let the citizens of the world decide what they want to buy.  It's all about $$$ or some such crap.   For all you lucky people in the US-buy this BD. This is one great movie.Karl Malden(superb performance as always)is one mean SOB.   Beautifully shot and stunning music score by Hugo Friedhofer.

B004P9FAK2|5.0|The reason the first two harry potter ultimate editions are the extended versions is because on the VHS copies they have extra scenes, I don't know why, they just do. They didn't shoot any additional footage for any of the other films except in the deleted scenes. They took the 35mm negatives that they put on VHS onto blu ray (not in VHS quality) in blu ray quality. They used the 35mm negatives to transfer to blu ray, NOT the VHS copy.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|The best movie in the Avenger Series, so far!I especially liked the preview for next year's Avenger movie, and look forward to owning that BlueRay.

B002ZCY7SW|3.0|Unfortunately, there came a part in the series where not only would at least one disc not be read by my computer, but when I transferred it into the dvd player, it skipped constantly and froze, with the picture becoming pixelated. Definitely a manufacturer's error that should have been mentioned in the item description.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Plantronics GameCom 367 Closed-Ear Gaming Headset - got this for my son, who likes to play minecraft.  He uses it to talk with others playing the game.  I wanted him to have a headset that worked but didn't break the bank, this one works just fine for him.  I have worn them once just to be able to hear things on the computer without bothering others in the same room.  I am a fan of earbuds but these are adjustable and on a comfort scale of 1-10 (10 being the best) I would rate them an 8.  sound quality is good - I think some of the bass is lost compaired to the speakers I have but all in all a good product.
B000005J56|5.0|This is a classic album that deserves a spot on the shelf of all LAtin music devotees. Great selection of songs and sounds.  One of my favorite CDs.
145551389X|5.0|People expect everything to have an artistic meaning behind it.. why cant the bitch just release a book of pictures.. This is what it is. Stop expecting so much!!! This is a fun book. These aren't planned photographs. people who are rating one star must be expecting a book containing 400 photo shoot pictures. This picture book is more of a diary than an art statement. Chill.
B005ORVN1Y|1.0|I purchased all three sets just for the single DVD-A that comes in each one.  Signals was the album I was most looking forward to in that format.  However, it is a serious let down.  When I took it out of the box, I put it in, cranked the volume and immediately skipped to Digital Man hoping to be blow away with that bass line more up front and in your face than ever.  Didn't happen.  Any good rock mix starts with bass guitar and the bass (kick) drum and is built from there.  That obviously didn't happen here.  Although this album has some of Geddy's best bass work ever, it is way underemphasized in this mix.  The kick drum is hardly there at all, so the critical interplay between the two is totally lacking.  Instead, the guitars are more up front than ever.  Signals was often criticized (very often by Alex) as having placed too much emphasis on keyboards and relegating the guitar to some sort of \\"back seat\\" status.  I never really understood that because Signals has some of Alex's best guitar work ever.  In my view, the additional emphasis on keyboards obviously motivated him to fill the guitar slot differently and that resulted in some fantastic stuff we had never heard from him before.  With this DVD-A mix, it's as if someone was trying to \\"undo\\" that perceived lack of emphasis on the guitars and put them more up front.  However, the songs were simply not crafted that way and it doesn't work.  The over emphasis on the mid and upper mid range frequencies where the guitar sits makes for a sonically unpleasant mix as well.  You'll be reaching for your EQ at high volumes to pull some of those frequencies back.  However, no amount of EQ manipulation will bring the bass and kick drum to the forefront where they belong on this record and that is just sad.  Aside from the total neglect of the bass and bass drum, the vocals are actually too upfront for the entire record and, perhaps most annoying, the effects return on the vocals is way, way too up front--so up front, as amatter of fact, as to sound ridiculous.    With respect to the alternative tracks, it's true that several of them are utilized in this mix.  While that is very interesting to me as a hard-core fan, I think it is out of place here.  The tracks on the original two track mixes were chosen (obviously) because they were thought to be the best performances.  This mix makes that point obvious.  An alternative take here and there might have been fine, but there is so much of it here that it could have been reserved for a special edition CD or DVD-A marketed as including those alternative takes/mixes.  Finally, it was extremely disappointing to lose the prominent long delay sound on the violin solo in Losing It.  That long delay was absolutely critical to the feeling of that solo and, in my opinion, that solo was one of the best moments of the entire record.  While it's cool to hear the dry version of that solo, it just doesn't serve the song as well.  Overall, this DVD-A is a badly missed opportunity.  It is highly unlikely that we'll ever get another version, so this is it.  Oddly, the Farewell to Kings DVD-A doesn't suffer from any of the things that make this Signals mix so bad and it was actually done by the same person. It's hard to believe when you listen to both of them.  It would have been great to hear what a real 5.1 DVD-A pro like Elliot Scheiner could have done with this record.  Unfortunately, we'll never know.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The package was well wrapped and delivery was prompt.  I was quite pleased with the quality of the product - it was a good addition to my military-oriented library.
B0050PYNN0|1.0|This DVD forces you to watch commercials and previews including \\"Bring it on the Musical\\"!   ARRGGGGG  There are so many adds. Adds for the concept of bluray technology, horrible movies, digital services, they just don't stop.   Six minutes and 30 seconds of my life wasted on drivel.   The following DVD controls are disabled during the preview:  Fastforward  Chapter Forward  Top Menu  Advance  Curiously rewind is supported.  Just not worth the hassle for this B movie.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|As a life-long Kate Bush fan, I have bought and listened to every album, almost religiously, though the 90s albums were somewhat disappointing.  All I can about this album is that she has created possibly her most beautiful and haunting work EVER.  Restrained, polished, self-confident.  Her use of guest vocalists is stunning!  Elton John has rarely, if ever, sounded better.  This is definitely a triumphal return, her best album in at least 25 years.  It gets my vote (along with Adele's \\"21\\") for album of the year.
B000002KHB|5.0|One of the rare \\"perfect albums\\" for the most part. No need to fast forward on this album. Great combination of blues, rock and some heavier sounds. By itself, many would consider Machine Head the equivalent of a greatest hits album given the popularity of so many cuts. If you enjoy rock music including some driving rock, this is a must have in your collection.
0316069353|3.0|Big fan of Connelly for years and have read almost every one of his books.  Though the story line had merit, I felt the book was full of never ending details that added nothing to the story except to  s l o w  it down.
1594744769|2.0|Jacob Portman's grandfather has always entertained him with eerie and fanciful stories from his past.  As a child, Jacob eagerly believed in the fantastic world underlying his grandfather's tales.  Now a teen, however, Jacob realizes the stories are more likely the ravings of a senile old man.  Jacob's own mental health suffers a horrible blow when he finds his grandfather wounded and dying in the woods behind his home.  Is a wild animal behind the attack or could it be something more sinister?  Did Jacob really see what he thought he saw at the scene?  And were his grandfather's final words the nonsensical ramblings of a crazy old man or the key to unraveling a dark mystery?  The author uses as the foundation of his tale a few old photographs.  The apparently levitating and dour-faced young girl pictured on the cover could well have inspired the story he writes.  Unfortunately, many of the photographs used in the story aren't nearly so organically connected.  Instead, most of the photos feel like blatant contrivances and they add little to the story when they aren't actually detracting from it.  The reader is repeatedly forced to try to associate a random picture with an event that bears little obvious resemblance.  Several anecdotes are clearly included solely to justify the insertion of an irrelevant picture.  The discontinuity in the pictures is jarring especially when they are intended to represent the same character.  While an over-reliance on the pictures is a serious flaw, it's not the worst.  What begins as a relatively intriguing and marginally spooky otherworldly story devolves into something having far too much in common with Marvel's X-Men where peculiars are thinly-veiled mutants.  The central conflict metamorphoses into the power struggle between the oppressed \\"special\\" folk and the mundane.  Worse still, at the novel's conclusion, the reader suddenly realizes this book was written only to establish the context for a different caper yet to be told.  While it would be untrue to say there's no resolution, it's minimal and this book ultimately has no reason to exist apart from a future volume(s).  As an aside, the allusion to actual serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was in extremely poor taste.  While the author clearly felt this was a creative way to ground his story in reality, it undermines the horrific events that actually took place instead.  Overall, a rather unique and interesting premise is utterly wasted on a very run-of-the mill and incomplete story.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|LOVE this movie. When I received it the cover said something about it being a rental, it was weird. I was expecting the cover to say \\"Rio the movie\\" like it shows on the pictures of display ...

B002VPE1XE|5.0|The INSIDE dimensions of this AmazonBasics Universal Camera Case are<br /><br />5.25 (Height) X 3.5 (Width) X 2 (Depth)<br /><br />It is intended for larger Compact digital cameras like the Canon G12 or Nkion P7100.<br /><br />The flap is secured with Velcro patches which I deem very good. It cannot be accidentally opened, and if someone attempts to open it while you wear this case on your belt, you will notice it because it will make noise while the Velcro patches are torn apart.<br /><br />And the Velcro fastener allows quick access when you need it.<br /><br />There is a zippered side pocket which is also protected by the flap.<br /><br />There is a belt loop as well as a hand strap provided.
0062011847|4.0|The title \\"Snuff\\" comes from the tobacco product, which is sold in Ankh-Morpork and presumably all over Discworld, however considering how little said tobacco product had to do with the actual story, I'm surprised that \\"Snuff\\" was chosen to be the book's title.<br /><br />Without giving the plot away, I will point out that the more significant plot points involved Sam Vimes being framed for murder, the plight of the goblins, the slave trade and the difference between doing the right thing and doing what you're told.<br /><br />The snuff tobacco product probably played a role of equal importance with those bacon sandwiches that Sam Vimes loves so much.<br /><br />Actually Sam's bacon sandwiches provoked far more interest in my mind than the snuff product that the tobacconists sell.<br /><br />I found this book very notable book for a variety of reasons.  I suppose the first is the introduction of Miss Pickings.  She's a minor character in the book, however to the best of my knowledge she's the first gay or lesbian character to appear in any of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books.  This all by itself makes \\"Snuff\\" a rather historic publication.<br /><br />The next rather notable thing I found was Miss Beedle, who had some very profound things to say about religion, including, \\"I tell you, commander, it's true that some of the most terrible things in the world are done by people who think, genuinely think they're doing it for the best, especially if there is some god involved.\\"<br /><br />And on the very next page she also said, \\"Goodness is about what you do.  Not what you pray to.\\"<br /><br />And then there's A.E. Pessimal.  He was first introduced back in \\"Thud!\\" however I think he's a character worth mentioning.  See what Terry Pratchett says about him on page 189:<br /><br />\\"He was the Watch's secret weapon.  There wasn't a bookkeeper in the city who would like to see a visit from A.E. Pessimal unless, of course, he was perfectly innocent-although generally that could be ruled out, because Mr. and Mrs. Pessimal's little boy could track down an error all the way through the ledger and down into the basement where the real books were hidden.\\"<br /><br />I suppose it's because I'm a bureaucrat and bureaucrats need their heroes too, but I really love it when they talk about A.E. Pessimal like that!error all the way through the ledger and down into the basement where the real books were hidden.\\"  I suppose it's because I'm a bureaucrat and bureaucrats need their heroes too, but I really love it when they talk about A.E. Pessimal like that!
1410445224|2.0|Decent book about facts, but not about Steve Jobs, one of the greatest geniuses in the history of the human kind.  Walter Isaacson and his publisher were rushing too much to have book to coincide with Steve's death, since in August, it was obvious that Steve had only few more months or less to live.  I just hope someone else can write a really great book on Steve Jobs, someone who is much better writer than Mr. Isaacson, and who is able to write more about Steve's genius and personality rather than only about facts.
B00337KM2S|5.0|This is a great film. It's a comedy with a lot of good laughs but also a lot of thought provoking moments. It has a bit of a twist at the end that is, well, somewhat predictable when you think about it.  Lots of trends in American society are touched on : downsizing, outsourcing, the provision of services through the internet, the drop in marriage rates, the polarization of society into groups of \\"elite insiders\\" who are treated like royalty (notably when travelling) and the have-nots.  Altogether a very worthwhile film : the three main actors (Clooney, Kendrick, Farmiga) all play their roles perfectly (see below for one exception). The script is also very good. Something I don't often notice that much : the opening credits and music were a lot of fun.   One issue with the acting : the scene where Kendrick is supposed to cry is either over-acted or was done that way following specific directions (in which case it's the directors fault!). I agree with another reviewer that it doesn't seem to quite capture the introverted miss perfect totally losing her cool(Reese Witherspoon did a much better job at this in Election). That said, that was the only scene where the acting annoyed me.
B005GK6QSO|5.0|\\"The Magnificent\\" is the melodic hard rock project of guitarist Torsti Spoof (\\"Leverage\\") and singer Michael Eriksen (\\"Circus Maximus\\") and this self titled album is their debut issued by \\"Frontiers\\" records. Most would agree that \\"Leverage\\" released one of the greatest melodic albums of 2009 with \\"Circus Colossus\\" and seem to have gotten fans of the genre fired up for a follow up album. Though \\"The Magnificent\\" is not that, it is more than a reason for fans of the genre to be happy. Despite \\"The Magnificent\\" being promoted as `Modern AOR' it is in fact a melodic hard rock album, and a very infectious collection of songs at that. You get ever-present guitars delivering riffs, melodies and solos, intense rhythm section (with occasional double bass drumming) plus outstanding vocal melodies by Eriksen who shines throughout \\"The Magnificent\\" debut.<br /><br />Having played the album a good number of times, I am still surprised by the quality of the compositions as every riff, every melody and every chorus counts, amounting to a memorable album baring a musical identity of its own. For that matter, a great deal of effort has been put in the songwriting with Torsti being the core songwriter, occaisonally aided by \\"Leverage\\" members Pekka Heino and Tuomas Heikkinen.<br /><br />It is hard to pick favorites out of the \\"Magnificent\\" yet \\"Cheated by Love\\", \\"Bullets\\", \\"Holding on to your Love\\" and the unforgettable \\"Satin & Lace\\" are best examples of the quality of this great album. \\"The Magnificent\\" is indeed a band/project that totally deserves and does justice to its name. If you are a fan of \\"Leverage\\" or the melodic genres in general, you have got to get this!
B004ZNB12O|3.0|A disappointing collection featuring songs that appear together on previous releases. Sadly nothing from 'Ummagumma','More', 'Obscured', 'Meddle', 'Animals', & 1 song from 'Final Cut'. A better selection would've included: 'Careful With That Axe Eugene', 'Grantchester Meadows', then: 'Up The Kyber', 'Green Is The Colour', 'Quicksilver', then: 'Mudmen', 'Childhood's End', Absolutely Curtains', then: 'Fearless', 'A Pillow Of Winds' then: 'Dogs', then: 'The Hero's Return', 'The Gunner's Dream'.
B001PJ1QF8|5.0|I bought this album (VINYL) in 1975 in London, and it is one of my treasured gems. There is not even a mediocre song here, every one is a classic..my favorite song is Mud Slide Slim. JT is a national treasure and an under rated musical genius. Ride on sweet baby James and thank you.
B004UBM4TA|5.0|Lots of fun watching this on 3D Blu Ray... BUT I paid 17 bucks for it. Don't pay ANY MORE than that. It's only a 40 minute film, and it was originally priced at something insane like 35 or 40 bucks. For 17 bucks and the fact I bought it as a gift for a NASA lover I am pleased!
B0017HMF6W|5.0|Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was great.  I didn't notice any grain.  I give it a 9.2 on a 10.0 scale.  The Dolbe TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack was good.  There wasn't a whole lot of surround sound, but the airplane scene did have good surround, with sub-woofer bass during the crash.<br /><br />The aspect ratio was a disappointing 1.85:1, which filled my LCD screen.  I wish it was 2.4:1.<br /><br />The movie started immedidately, instead of a menu displaying.  And, there were no credits at the end, which also disappointed me.  But, overall, I am pleased with this Blu-Ray purchase.

It was fun to recognize the things that became Reacher's trademarks as he developed - the toothbrush in his pocket and the clothes bought new every few days. I got a little impatient waiting for Reacher to take justice into his own hands, and I was disappointed that the McKinney cousins didn't come back for one more brawl, but otherwise it was satisfying.

1451648537|5.0|Just an amazingly well written book which actually put into language I could understand the very technical world of Steve Jobs.  The details of how John Sculley came to Apple made me laugh till I cried. And of course I cried too the tears everyone will cry who reads the letter he wrote to his wife on their 20th anniversay. The subject was a very human being who so many of us seem to feel we knew and of course we never did.  But after reading this book I feel again that yes, I did know him.  He showed himself publicly. I fully expect that my copy will be lent out again and again and I have had to admonish everyone to not soil the beautiful white with grey book cover which looks just like the box my iPhone arrived in....nice touch and I feel pretty sure that it was Steve's idea. Anyone who ever lived in the Bay area, especially Cupertino as I did will feel that he was our own, our own hippie CEO.

B005WY8YZW|2.0|Some how, I was not aware that this was a BURNED copy, not the original CD. WHY anyone would sell a CD-RW on Amazon is beyond me. I was very disappointed when I received the cd. Then a mere 2 days later (after NOT leaving my CD player once), the disk starts to skip midway through the track listing. I take it out to see a GASH in my CD. My player has NEVER done this to another CD. I blame POOR, CHEAP quality 100%. Now I cannot listen to this CD past track 5. Very disappointed indeed. I was so excited to see this album available here, as it was not sold anywhere local. I will never buy another CD from Amazon  As for the songs, what I got to hear of them, I was not blown away like the others. The cd is all mellow. I would rather have heard a few upbeat or even SILLY songs... seeing as how the title is Conditions of my Parole...
B005SV9W4Q|4.0|A very dark & creepy Remix set. There are loads of club remixes from GaGa but the ones that are selected here are quite unique (& good actually). Not the usual dance remixes. The remixes are redefined by some of the new & up-coming Artists & DJs. Take 'Marry The Night' (GaGa's latest official single) is remixed by a group of very talented & powerful producers. Slip this Remix Set into your stereo & I'm sure you will enjoy it.  Please do not forget the Collector Box Set which include the original (expanded) CD, Remix CD & DVD ! A well-crafted Album Art with 3 Digipaks in a Box. Definately worth your money spend. Don't waste your time reading my review any further & just buy these 2 items immediately - the Collection (2 CDs & DVD) & The Remix. A Must have item(s) !
0385535139|1.0|I had read a previous review of The Litigators and the reviewer used the phrase \\"his best yet\\".  It is not.  I have read every Grisham novel and I found this one derivative of his others, slow-moving, and poorly written.  The characters lacked orginality and were almost flat, except for the little old lady in the bar.  I wonder why she was not developed further.  Although perhaps she was because I stopped reading about half-way through and skimmed another bunch of pages.  Sorry to be so harsh, John, but are you by any chance writing by \\"committee\\" these days?
B005IZLPME|5.0|Great movie, a little slow to develop. Wished the actions scenes would have lasted a little longer. Several key points you really had to \\"watch\\" for but plays well into the other Avenger movies. Did a good job setting it up for the future movies as well.

I wasn't an artist before I got this app.. and I am not an artist AFTER getting this app. And upgrading to the paid version didn't help me with that.  But I have a few more tools available and the number of layers increased.  And I am probably using Layers the wrong way - but it keeps me from hurting myself too much when I am tring to make changes :)  I was looking for an application that I could take into a meeting and \\"draw\\" with... like a whiteboard.

B005IGVYUG|5.0|I've been listening to Tom Waits from the beginning -- \\"Step Right Up\\" from [[ASIN:B000002GY9 SMALL CHANGE]] (1976), which used to get lots of airplay on WXRT in Chicago, is one of my all-time favorites, and I remember seeing him play \\"The Heart of Saturday Night\\" on the PBS Soundstage concert show in 1974.  I respected his Brecht/Weill-influenced \\"middle period\\" more than I listened to it, but the Island trilogy centered on [[ASIN:B000001FFJ RAIN DOGS]] (1985) is classic.  Now I find myself listening to this new Waits album more than I've ever listened to his music before.  Something about it just captures the zeitgeist...<br /><br />BAD AS ME sounds great!  It's a concentration, a distillation, of his most recent period, documented by Anti records, similar to MULE VARIATIONS (1999) or REAL GONE (2002) but with a higher energy level.  Marc Ribot is on guitar again, one of the reasons Waits's records sound so good.  Keith Richards appears on several tracks too (Chicago, Satisfied, Last Leaf, and Hell Broke Luce), and guitarist David Hidalgo from Los Lobos, percussionist Gino Robair, harmonica-player Charlie Musselwhite, organist Augie Meyers and bassists Flea and Les Claypool all put in appearances.<br /><br />There are several rollicking numbers, some signature melancholy tunes, a strong anti-war piece, and more -- a typically diverse Waits set that is all stamped with his unique vision, along with his partner, co-writer and co-producer, Kathleen Brennan.  He channels Screaming Jay Hawkins, among others, with his incredible voice.<br /><br />The deluxe edition comes in a hardback book, a real piece of art with stunning full-color photos for each song and all the lyrics in large easy-to-read print to peruse while you listen.  The three bonus tracks are on a separate disc, which is mildly annoying.<br /><br />BAD AS ME is a great album, one of the best of the year!

B004TI5N38|4.0|It is a bit difficult to keep away from commenting on the similarity in the surnames of David Baldacci's new character in Zero Day and the relatively old and familiar character of Lee Child's novels. H-m-m-m...how much of a reach was it for Baldacci to come up with John Puller? Jack Reacher...John Puller...get it? Jack, after all, is even the sobriquet of John. Both prefer to be called by their surnames. Both are (or were) military cops, Puller is an investigator for Army CID and Reacher is (usually) ex-Army MP. Both men are large, powerful, highly capable fighting men. Both like disabling their foes with head butts. Both of them like the ladies, and their creators provide them with ladies to like as principal female characters. Both operate in rural settings, although Reacher shows up in cities occasionally. Both have fathers with military pasts. Both have one sibling, a brother. These similarities, however, result from conventions of the genre, so are expected. Thus, I wonder what I would have thought of Zero Day had I not read already every one of Lee Child's novels. Would I be looking forward to Puller's follow-up appearance? I think the answer is that I will be anticipating Baldacci's next book...period. However, I think that I would prefer it be another in the Camel Club series (last entry is Hell's Corner) or in the Sean King-Michelle Maxwell one (The Sixth Man). Nonetheless, Zero Day is a compelling enough story that I can give it a rather high rating. Let's see, however, how this character fares when Baldacci next pulls him out.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm sure I am not the only one who enjoys this game, so I will just say, \\"What fun!\\" Enjoy!
B0068TJLSY|4.0|I agree that the film is not a spectacular vehicle. However, I did actually enjoy it quite a bit. It is a great kids/teenagers program, but I still enjoyed watching the kids and remembering 'back in the day'. The child actors were excellent. Nothing new and exciting, per se, but still quite an enjoyable way to spend a cold Sunday afternoon with a quilt and a cup of tea. Not an 'owner' but worth the 'sale' rental through Amazon.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I thought this would be a good app to have on my new Amazon Fire, but it never would open.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|This film is beautiful, heartbreaking,and very real. It also carries the disturbing fact of racism, as well, and makes it so evidently horrible in the light of the circumstances. It is a beautiful film and a classis film with remarkable acting.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|Different twist to an age old story. Really liked this one better than some of the other remakes. Brenden fraser really breathes a new life into this one. Recommended forall ages.
B004EI2NM2|5.0|This film is beautiful, deep, moving, erotic and sensual. The acting is pitch perfect. It is about a real case of love at first sight and the power of true love and the revelation it becomes to these two women. It will take you on an emotional journey of great beauty and power.
B00117U1FK|5.0|So truthfully I'm giving it five stars mostly because this episode takes place in Minnesota and I'm front Minnesota. I love the state and people rarely mention it so it makes me all giddy inside when people do. Also, for the nice quality of the video. :) I <3 Minnesota~!
0756686970|5.0|Got this for my nephew's 5th birthday (he's pretty advanced for his age and he can read well). He loved it because he loves Lego and Star Wars. I read a few pages with him, and the random facts are interesting, and the details were a lot more than expected.  Great buy.
B006D9EJ3Q|5.0|This episode pulled the carpet out from under my feet. I've been a fan of this show since day one, perhaps even before day one, when FX announced that the Pilot was being greenlit. If you've watched the other episodes (and you must, in order, there's no question) you will find that unlike most of the hyped shows we've been seeing this Fall 2011 season, AHS continues to up the bar.  When the writers answer a question that's been lingering for four episodes or so, you'd think that it would be a let down because once that mystery is solved, what is left for us to ponder?  You'd be wrong in thinking that about this show.  When one question is answered it seems two more even more compelling questions are asked.   I will say that watching this show on my Kindle Fire is fantastic.  The image quality is very good, and re-watching the episodes as things get more and more complicated is definitely paying off.  The episodes are convenient and make a great pass-time when I'm on a lunch break or killing time (befitting the title Murder House, eh?).  Highly recommended show, it's already been picked up for a second season, so there's no worry in becoming addicted (as you will be) and then having the show end abruptly.  Maybe not sure to keep you up at night, but definitely a show to give you a new perspective on the oft-cliche horror genre.  Ghosts are people too, after all!

B005K01VZS|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book. Albom really gets to the heart of the differences and similarities between religions. The brilliant part is that he shares his own self discovery on the topic. This is not a book he wrote in which he is trying to show how much he knows, rather, he takes an open mind and even dicusses his own prejudices along the way.  I finished the book last night and it is still very much on my mind today. It's a book that will make you contemplate what you always thought you knew about your own and others' beliefs but it does it in very not-too-heavy way.  This would be a great book for a Bible Study read as well.

0670022411|4.0|I'm not normally a fan of fantasy, but this skillfully written novel is a lot of fun. It's not only brim-filled with imagination (what would modern witches, vampires, and daemons REALLY be like), but it's also filled with accurate and intriguing historical references that get the brain going. Just how does Darwin's theory apply? Is it possible that witches and vampires are just evolutionary cousins to humans? Now that race is considered genetically marginal in human DNA, is being a witch or a daemon just another \\"racial\\" stereotype? The main characters are highly intelligent professors and researchers whose able minds take the reader on leaps of speculative fancy. The protagonist is a genetic witch from a powerful Salem family who has long denied her DNA. She is stubbornly human-like in all the ways we as readers can identify, but also intriguingly witchy; and we can laugh at her bungling and share in her self-discovery as she begins to explore her own powers. The vampire is, of course, alluring, dark, handsome, and mysterious; but he is all mega-brilliant, an evolved creature if there ever was one. There are villains, of course, and a wonderful subplot about the prejudices among the \\"creatures\\" who have agreed not to mingle with each other which keeps us guessing as to how the budding intellectual (and more) relationship between Diana and Matthew the vampire will fare. I'm quite looking forward to the sequel in summer 2012.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|I assume many people, after watching the movie Moneyball, are wondering whether the book is as good as the movie.  Both are great in my opinion, but for different reasons.  The movie, in order to be enjoyable for people who don't love baseball, concentrates on the human aspects of the book and glosses over the nitty gritty statistical parts of this book.  Some people will find the statistical parts just as interesting as the human parts, but I'm not sure that the average reader will (they can skip over those parts though).  Another difference between he book and the movie is the dialog.  The dialog of the movie is clever, witty, and very Aaron Sorkin, but the book has a different non-Sorkin feel.  It's not bad, it's just different.  This book taught me a lot about an aspect of professional baseball that I knew nothing about, and I highly recommend it to baseball geeks.  Being a baseball geek, though, I have one issue with the book.  Oakland's top three starting pitchers, which were not drafted or acquired during Billy Beane's watch, were one of the greatest collection of starting pitchers ever.  Barry Zito (23-5, 2.75 ERA) in 2002 was arguably better than Justin Verlander was in 2011 (24-5, 2.40 ERA), and both won Cy Young Awards.  The numbers for Mark Mulder (19-7, 3.47 ERA) were nearly Cy Young worthy as well...compare them with C.C. Sabathia in 2007 (19-7, 3.21 ERA).  And Tim Hudson was a very solid pitcher as well (15-9, 2.98 ERA).  Billy Beane made a lot of great decisions at GM, but these three players had nothing to do with him.  This was a great book, and I highly recommend it...to baseball geeks.
B006FE17Q6|4.0|Episodes 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Season 2 have grounded this show to darn near a halt.  Finally, we've got motion again!  Albeit, in the last 10 minutes.  But great ending!  I hope it keeps up.  I can't believe Hershel turned out to be such a nut job.  \\"Umm, they're zombies.  Duh!\\"  Either take over the farm (Shane's idea) or leave these nuts for Ft. Benning (also Shane's idea)...  Hershel has some serious issues and, IMHO, the further away the group is, the better off they will be.  If it weren't for killing Otis (hey, I'm a fat guy, too!), Shane would have turned out to be the hero of Season 2 and not Rick.  I agree that Rick is still stuck in the \\"world that was\\" and needs to grow a pair.<br /><br />Now, I'm all for heading to Ft. Benning.  Seems like the reasonable thing to do, no?  But WE ALL KNOW that it'll likely be Zombie-central and lead us into Season 3 with more whining about why go on with life and all that.  Hopefully the writers have come up with something interesting and original.<br /><br />Reality Check: Shouldn't the spent fuel rods in unprotected water pools of nuclear power plants erupted by now?  Why is there no radiation on the prairies of Georgia?  My advise: head west of the Mississippi, folks!

B002ECJZ76|5.0|This is a different story about Christmas and has a slightly dark side to it.Its not in english but has english voices dubbed in but a good job was done in the story itself. I hate it when someone rates a movie by telling the entire story frame by frame so I will just say that I thought the film was done with exceptional experience and leave it to the viewers to decide.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a gem. I admit I got a little fed up with the main character's interpretation of events a couple of times, but that displeasure only served to heighten the intensity of the book, and was doubtless a deliberate device on the part of the author. Although the first chapter of this book reads like any standard post-apocalyptic novel, by chapter two the action heightens to a point where you become completely hooked. I nearly cried at one point in the book (and let me just say that I can count on one hand the books that have made me cry, and I've read thousands) and suffered strain of emotions at various points. All the way to the end of the book you are on tenterhooks for the character(s), and the book leaves you craving for the sequel.

B00466HN86|5.0|When I heard that the Kendrick brothers had another film in the works, I couldn't wait to see their latest movie. Courageous is a fantastic movie that touches the heart of all families. Yes, it's written with fathers in mind and how they can step up to the plate and be \\"men of courage\\" in leading their families, but it's also so much more.<br /><br />Courageous takes us into the lives of several families - normal families that we might encounter on any given day. In one family, we see a workaholic father who no longer seems to be able to find common ground with his teenage son. In another family, we see the struggles of a newly-divorced father. In yet another family, we see a dad who worries about the choices his teenage daughter might make when an older troubled boy seeks to date her. In still another family, we see a single dad who has never made any type of connection with his little daughter, not even in the form of helping to support her, financially or otherwise. In the final family, we see a dad who has just lost his job and wonders how he will support his wife and young children. These families could be like families we know and that is one of the many strong points of this movie - it's so identifiable.<br /><br />There are some sad parts in this movie, and yes, I cried (make that bawled!). Yet, there were also humorous parts. Most of all, there is a message in this film that reaches out to the lives of all parents. Life is short. Step up and be the parent God has called you to be. And for dads, the message is especially clear - lead your families as is outlined in Scripture. To do so makes all the difference, not only for the current generation, but for generations to come.<br /><br />If you only see one movie this year, I would highly recommend this one be the one. It's a wonderful movie for teens and above and one that will keep you thinking (and praying) about how you can be courageous.<br /><br />Reviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of \\"77 ways Your Family Can Make a Difference.\\"

B00664BWI8|5.0|This episode was the best of the best I've ever seen in my life especially when Klaus cried because his so-called father was taunting him about his faults. Also Damon now has changed personally and emotionally throughout season 3 from the way I see it. Stefan's the new bad boy trying to make everyone's lives a living hell such as ticking Klaus off. Elena's the changing perspective type of girl who is now falling deeper in love with Damon and is slipping away from what she and Stefan had it seems. Since the ghosts are now gone, maybe, everyone is having a somewhat more simpler life including Jeremy, Bonnie, and Damon. Katherine is the interesting topic for me as she starts talking about how she's deciding to turn on the emotions since vampires in this TV show can turn it off but it seems to bite them in the butt if they do it long enough. Hell will break loose when Stefan does something wrong and Klaus wins, what will be of The Vampire Diaries next after everyone that Stefan has ever met dies or disappears from the season?
B005CM9DX6|4.0|Upon first listen I thought \\"gosh this sounds familiar\\"! And after the 4-5th listen (I think I was on Folklore) it suddenly dawned on me...This isn't Opeth, it's Jethro Tull!!<br /><br />Just listen to Akerfeldt's voice, the \\"early 70s sounding\\" guitars, the John Evan style \\"old school\\" Hammond organ sound, the Barriemore Barlow style tom runs, there's even a flute for gosh sakes!! I don't think even 21st century Ian Anderson could make a Tull album this \\"authentic\\"!!<br /><br />Akerfeldt said he was going to make a 70s style prog album and he did. And, growing up listening to Tull/Yes/King Crimson as much as Sabbath/Led Zep/Deep Purple.... that's just fine with me!!<br /><br />No it's not up there with Damnation or Blackwater Park (my 2 faves), but I can't help but like it.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|Too much emphasis on buying books: no quick help on how to use a MOBI file in the app.  Google comes through again...
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|App user interface is ok nothing special. I like being able to organize notes by category and subcategory. Biggest downfall is monthly subscription to have offline access to your notes. I don't have an issue paying for app's that make life better or easier to mange developers got to make a living and if I depend on their app I want them to continue to support it; however paying for the app once should be sufficient passing for the same app every month is bit excessive in my opinion. Anyway, I recommended this Evernote to an it friend with a WiFi only tablet. He was using it for IT proposes and when the WiFi went down so did his notes which makes resolving issues rather difficult. So I switched to an app that keeps my notes on my tab. It's called Free Note. It's functionality is superior aswell, I can type notes, or free hand notes, I can even doodle on my notes if need to illustrate something or just get bored of the conversation. It is still in its infancy and organizing your notes is a little tricky right now but is bringing worked on acording to their future plan plans. If the developer continues to male the test of the app as functional As the note taking, I predict that it will become the number 1 note app.  Asfar as Evernote... I don't need it enough to buy it repeatedly month after month. so bye bye Evernote.
B0000DJYO1|5.0|Bought this vinyl as I've been in a mood for 70's rock music pressed on vinyls lately. Have been playing it on my resurrected Thorens TD150 turntable, NAD 3240PE amp and Bose speakers and I must declare that this album rocks due not only to the great tunes but also the excellent recording. Every sound of the musical instruments could be heard clearly and the bass levels add just the right amount of oomph to the sound quality. If you love Deep Purple and vinyls, I recommend that you add this to your LP collection. The vinyl version sounds so much better than the CD on my music system. Will be getting In Rock next and hope the recording's just as good :)
1451648537|5.0|Good book, but it made me never want to buy an apple product ever again because Jobs seems like such a jerk.
0321687299|4.0|This isn't your standard HTML5 primer- there are lots about. What's different about this one is the unique personality that Remy and Bruce inject into what is quite a dry subject associated with tiresome split hairs and colossal misperceptions. In this book, as in life, they are both masterful, and slightly hysterical about their subject. They keep up the pace and never underestimate the reader's ability to understand. I was as entertained by this book as I was educated.
B000050FEN|5.0|Great movie, nice twist, and gory enough for horror fans and suspense drama fans alike. The cast was awesome and it moved along nicely.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|The subject matter itself was interesting, and the book could have been compelling if the author was less annoying.  By about halfway through this book I was so exasperated by how arrogant and self-congratulatory the author was I almost put the book down, something I never, ever do.  Piper Kerman goes out of her way to point out time and time again that she's Miss Congeniality of minimum-security federal prison.  She gets along with everyone, she has street smarts, and she's the best worker in the whole prison. She uses her time wisely to help others and run and yoga herself into a tight new body.  Everyone loves Piper, apparently.  The entire book seems to revolve around Piper's perception of herself as she functioned in the prison rather than the actual running of the prison itself.    Further, the hardships of prison life felt really glossed over and only minimally addressed.  It read more like an account of living in a college dorm than being in prison.  Though Piper Kerman paid lip service to various social issues and the like, she really did them no justice and instead chose to focus on how great Team Piper, Larry, and all her friends in prison were.  Honestly, if that's how prison is, sign me up for a little while.  I could use the break.  In the end, the book suffers because the author is a rich white woman for whom a short sentence in a minimum-security prison really didn't demand all that much in terms of self-reflection.  She got to go home to a brand-new house, a fiance, a family who loved her, friends, and a brand new job.  Like others have said, she didn't really ever feel bad for her criminal activity, but instead spent more time berating the woman she thought turned her in.  I also noticed that she didn't acknowledge her friends from prison in the acknowledgements, and, like a college girl who goes slumming, has probably done nothing since to help her prison \\"friends.\\"
B003O86FMW|4.0|I think that the second book is probably shorter than the first, but it is what you would expect if they have any type of reality show that brings together the winners to compete with each other. It is pretty good and I was able to read the book within two days. However, because it is sort of written in that reality show way and you only really get a partial picture of what is going on in this Big Brother arena.  It also does not take to long to figure that the adults are making plans, but the story is about teenagers, so we are not going to get the down and dirty conspiracy details, just the details that have a personal affect on the main character.  She is a little more self-serving and paranoid in this book, however, after reading the previous book, it would not be realistic to think that she would be exactly the same type of person she was before the Hunger Games.<br />I am hoping that the third book will provide some more back story on some of the characters that we meet in the previous two books (Katniss's designer, the guy from the fishing district, maybe something more on her mother and father).  These characters are older and since these books are more aimed at the teenage reader, the back story maybe lost to the actual reality of what is going on in the book.  However, I do like the fact that the book stays realistic for the situation and it is intended to be written from a point of view of a 17 year old who is about to expierence a revolution.  I am also happy that more characters stay alive in the second segment, even though we can assume that the is more death everywhere else. Also, this book does not seem to be as gruesome (PG-13) as the first and a little more Gilligan Islandish to me.

B004EPYZUI|5.0|if you pay attention to the movie, and what is going on, its actually really good. The story itself is really depressing all on its own, you just have to look past the special effects. A movie is more than just special effects guys, pay attention to the story and the deep meanings behind everything!
0375842209|5.0|Remarkable! This book achieved so much, about a subject that has been covered so many times, by using a unique perspective to underline the humanity of individuals on all sides of the horrific circumstances of WWII. Markus Zusak tells the story from the perspective of an orphaned German girl and her friends and family living in Munich during the war. Through his characters, Zusak illuminates the duality of human nature. Although through the eyes of the outside world these characters would have been considered the enemy, Zusak bares their vulnerability and compassion. His brilliance as a writer is in the fact that he can so strongly evoke sympathy for the German characters while not diminishing at all the heinous acts perpetrated by members of the Nazi party. He exposes the sufferings of the Germans through the long and cruel war without diminishing the incomparable suffering of the Jews as the victims of the Nazi ethnic cleansing.   Zusak portrays nearly every single character in his novel as a sympathetic individual, possessing the capacity for good, love and compassion on one hand and cruelty and immorality on the other. The central character, the orphan Liesel, is as good of a person as you can imagine - an innocent child who shows tremendous courage in her love of her foster parents, her friends and Max, the sheltered Jew hidden in her basement - but she is also a thief. The Nazi party members and German soldiers who are named in the story are part of the machine responsible for millions of deaths, but each, when given a name, is also portrayed as an imperfect, conflicted, sympathetic person caught up in the power of the words of Hitler and his movement. The individuals in whom hate and evil overcome their better natures exist in the novel, but the hate is amorphous in these nameless individuals and groups.   The goodness and hope in all the stories' characters is balanced by the looming, omnipresent voice of Death, the narrator, who touches Jews, Germans and the Allies. Death's presence is the gravitational pull at the center of the characters' world; a force that shapes their actions and lives even when its presence is not consciously felt. The use of Death as the narrator, serves to continuously and regularly pull the reader back to the terrible reality in which the characters are clinging to their humanity. Zusak even portrays Death as a sympathetic character who wonders at the cruelty and ultimate futility of war; and in a twist of conventional wisdom, Death shares that it is haunted by humans.   The only character directly involved in the story that Zusak describes as evil is the second leader of Liesel and Rudy's band of thieves, Viktor Chemmel. The first leader of the gang, Arthur Berg \\"did not have a tyrannical bone in his body, whereas the new leader [Viktor Chemmel] had hundreds of them. The reader is allowed to hate Viktor, who exemplifies the power of a leader, like Hitler, to lead more passive followers to engage in acts of cruelty not otherwise likely. Hitler, der Fuhrer, is the only other named unsympathetic, evil character. Like the narrator, Death, he is omnipresent throughout the story, casting a pall over all goodness and hope.  The balance of good and evil in humans can be seen through the novel to be swayed by the incredible power of words. It is Hitler's expert use of words that makes possible the evil of the war and the Holocaust; but it is also the power of words that provide the strength and courage for people to survive, maintain their dignity and humanity and conquer evil: Liesel reading her books aloud to the neighbors gathered in the basement during air raids or to Frau Holtzapfel who is tormented by the loss of her sons; Max's story writing for Liesel; Ilsa Hermann allowing Liesel to steal her books and providing her the impetus to write her own story.   Zusak achieves remarkable depth of emotion in simple language, exposing evil and suffering through the hope and goodness of his characters.Unlike many works that only describe the suffering, \\"The Book Thief\\" provides a glimpse of how to prevent such atrocities in the future, by paying attention to the power of words. I am sure that the fictional Liesel and her friends and family, and the powerful messages they teach, will remain with me forever as vivid as the real-life Anne Frank.
B003062NG0|4.0|This is an album that has rarities and b-sides. I know this doesnt sounds good but believe me is like a new album. The songs are all great - a mix of ballads and psychedelic music. I personally like very very much : Buying new soul - Disappear - Albulance chasing - Even less. I believe it is a must album for Porcupine Tree fans. Really great work. Keep it up.

B000001FYZ|5.0|I want to start off by saying that this is my favorite Scorpions album, so this review may be a little biased.  \\"Crazy World\\" was released in 1990, and followed many great Scorps' classics, such as \\"Lovedrive,\\" \\"Virgin Killer,\\" \\"Blackout,\\" and \\"Love at First Sting.\\"  It also followed what many fans consider their 'sell-out' album, \\"Savage Amusement,\\" and a greatest hits package, \\"Rockers & Ballads (Best of).\\"  This album marked a return to what we expect when we purchase a Scorpions disc...heavy riffs, sexual innuendo-ed lyrics, and of course excessive rock / metal cheese.  Klaus Meine and Rudolf Schenker are akin to Angus and Malcolm Young of AC/DC in terms of finding a successful formula and making it work repeatedly.  I give it four stars out of five when compared to other hard rock discs of the era.  It has it all in terms of what the boys are capable of.  There are slow burning rockers like \\"Money and Fame,\\" power ballads \\"Wind of Change\\" and \\"Send Me an Angel,\\" and then the blitzkrieg wailers like \\"Tease Me, Please Me\\" and \\"Kicks After Six.\\"  I like this disc a lot, and highly recommend it to both novice Scorpions fans and the hard-core ones that are on their second or third copy of \\"Blackout.\\"  Enjoy!

B003008RWA|1.0|For starters, Cuba is a communist country with which we have \\"strained\\" relations, to say the least. The last thing Cuba's government wants their people exposed to are the freedoms we enjoy in a America, lest they get any ideas. I find it incredibly naive to think  you could bring an American film crew into Cuba, be lead around by their government and expect to see a true picture of the Cuban health care system. You will see exactly what they want you to see and nothing more. The oppressed Cuban people don't dare speak out (for examples see Cuban political prisoners). To get the real story, talk to people who have fled this and other communist regimes and lived to tell about it.<br /><br />As far as the other countries, England, Canada etc., there are just as many horror stories about their system of socialized medicine (rationing, long waiting times, outdated equipment, denial of procedures). This is why when they need major surgery--and can afford it--they come to the United States. Again, talk to people who have left countries with socialized medicine to get the real story.<br /><br />For people seeking the truth, health care should not be used to push a political agenda.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Original and definitively RUSH.<br /><br />The best work yet by this extraordinary band.<br /><br />This band has arisen from the ashes of tragedy stronger and more courageous than ever. No melodrama, just pure Phoenix fire.<br /><br />Peart's percussion has developed far more dimension. The lyrics unblinkingly face down the darkness of our civilization and let in light.<br /><br />Lifeson's guitar has grown the wings his past work has promised and yearned for. This is Lifeson's CD.<br /><br />Lee's ability to pull it all together has only grown stronger.  This man is a Rock.<br /><br />I have been a rabid fan since Caress of Steel and this work has revived the joy seemingly lost in art and music today.<br /><br />Support this band!
B004UXUUDA|4.0|Kristin Scott Thomas one of today's most underrated actresses. This talented actress always brings a strong prescence to any movie. This time the British actress is Julia Jarmond,  an American journalist,  living in Paris raising a teenager daughter with her French husband.  She and her husband move into an apartment that has been owned by his family since 1942. Julia soon learns that the apartment has a very tragic history.   In 1942, a lively Jewish population lived in the Marais area of Paris. Without warning the French authorities rounded up the Jewish population to be shipped to concentration camps. We step back in time to those fateful days in 1942. Lively   10-year-old Sarah Starzynski played by the remarkable Mélusine Mayance lives with her parents and 4 year old brother in a flat in Marais. We soon learn the tragic meaning of \\"Sarah's key\\" and how lives were changed in an instant. Julia becomes obsessed with finding the fate of Sarah and the truth behind how the Jarmond family came to own the apartment.   One can only imagine the millions of stories that were lived out and lost during WWII. Here is one fictionalized story that gets us to think, \\"could it happen again?\\" The French authorities willingly deported their Jewish population to certain death. The French citizens are shown taunting their former neighbors as the Jews are being herded away. I did appreciate a scene of humanity as French peasants threw apples over the fences to hungry children. It was a sign of decency and humanity by some good people who could do nothing more than offer some food to the doomed.  Julia's life is changed forever and she is confronted with the past. Kristin Scott Thomas shines in her role as Julia. The tragedy of the meaning of Sarah's key is devastating to watch. The movie is a good study of people trying to survive in horrific times and trying to understand why some people were willing participants in the tragedy.  The movie touches on a general theme that we have seen over and over again. The tragic past is being confronted. The significance of Sarah's key adds a twist to the story. I felt Sarah's struggle and story was enough for a while film without the present day story. Of course, the present say story would have had more power if we knew more about the Jarmond family during the war.

B0042RJWTC|1.0|I bought one of these beautiful sets for my mother's birthday. There was no sound on the last half of one of the DVDs.  Amazon graciously refunded my money upon return of the defective set and I purchased a replacement set. The first DVD of the final season just stopped about 20 minutes in and would not go past that point, in repeated tries and several players.  We since found out my brother in law bought one of the same sets at a box store in Miami and also had a bad DVD in the set.  As great as the Tudors mini-series is, don't waste your time with a company who can't use proper quality DVDs or equipment. I don't know which is faulty, and franky, don't care.
0307352145|4.0|The first time I was discriminated against because I was an introvert was when I was in high school and was not inducted into the National Honor Society, in spite of good grades, I was not in enough extracurricular activities.  (I participated in some... but not enough!)  Later in life I ended up loosing a job because I could not concentrate in an overly stimulating workplace.  I was able to do all of my work but I had a hard time concentrating in a world where the boss thought it was fun to have all of the lab technicians have a desk in a central lab where there was constant coming and going by everyone.  There was always a radio playing in every lab where I had to work.  I hated every job I ever had and now say I hate working.<br /><br />Here is what I learned about myself from reading Quiet (The power of introvert in a world that can't stop talking).  The modern workplace is designed for maximum chaos and noise.  Two thirds of the people around me are extroverts who thrive in the chaotic environments of work and shopping.<br /><br />Cain also discusses in detail what it means to be a very sensitive person.  She quotes the research of Grazyna Kochanska who noted that babies who were more sensitive to all experiences, both positive and negative seemed to feel greater sensitivity as infants. Apparently these same children are less likely than their peers to cheat or break rules even when they think they can't be caught.  By age 6 or 7 these children are more likely to be described by their parents as having high levels of moral traits such as empathy.  Functional moderate guilt Kochanska wrote may promote altruism, personal responsibility, and adaptive behavio.<br /><br />A study of University of Michigan students shows that today's students are 40 less sympathetic than they were 30 years ago with much of the drop having occurred since 2000.  Whatever the reason it is interesting to note that empathy is declining just as rates of extroversion are rising among college students.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book for both introverts and the extroverts who love or work with them.  It is quite well researched and documented.  My only quibble is that she refers to introverts as quiet, while I am not a particularly quiet person.  I speak my mind in public and private, participate in group discussions and don't mind public speaking.  Also she goes on and on about one subject for far too long.  She could have said everything in this book in about three fourths of the words and made the book far more readable.onderful book for both introverts and the extroverts who love or work with them.

B001EN71HC|5.0|Big fan of Austin Powers series so of course I had to spend more money on buying the Blu-Ray edition after having it on other formats already. If you haven't seen the movies, you may want to watch one first before buying the collection as it's not for everyone I'm told. I think it's great from beginning to end and have spent a day watching the whole collection already!<br /><br />Definitely worth picking up just to have all the movies in one spot instead of 3 bulky cases, they come in 3 slim ones inside a box set.
0756404738|5.0|Been waiting for this book since I read \\"The Name of the Wind\\" almost a year back. The wait was worth it! I thought the first book in this series was interesting enough to pick up the second book but never did I expect it to become one of the best fantasy books I've read this year. After being disappointed by the latest books by Terry Brooks, George R R Martin and Terry Goodkind, I was expecting this to be a similarly disappointing. Boy, was I wrong. After finishing \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" today, the only fault I could find with it was that Rothfuss had said this would be a trilogy. I can't imagine how he can bring Kvothe's epic tale to a satisfying conclusion with only one more book to go. Hope he proves me wrong.
0446585025|1.0|Don't get me wrong I am a huge Ellen fan and have gone to see her show.  But there is nothing new in this book worth buying it.  How many books can Ellen write about her life before she has run out of interesting things to say.  I think that happened at least one book back.
0385534639|1.0|This book *may* have an interesting plot if, as others have written before me, it was a movie. Unfortunately for all of us, it isn't. It's a book, and is made up of some of the most poorly constructed sentences I've ever been forced to read.<br /><br />To make this short and sweet:<br />Characters - flat<br />Plot - barely there (not to mention implausible...even in the genre of fantasy you need a compelling conflict that gives you a reason to read)<br />Writing - atrocious<br /><br />Of particular note - the use of the present tense for an entire novel is a difficult undertaking. Morgenstern can't pull it off, though she obviously tries very hard. Her struggle only makes it more annoying and distracting.<br /><br />I'm not a perfect writer either, but I don't make a living claiming to write well. How writing this bad got past not only Morgenstern herself but the sundry proofreaders, copy editors, editors, etc et al is beyond me.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|A great blu-ray transfer for an already eye popping movie. The sound is phenomenal which makes the epic soundtrack even more of a treat. Special features are lacking like on the DVD, but still a must for any QT fan. Sound good?

B00514HDNW|4.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is a horror story written in 1954.  It is a founding book in what we now classify as \\"post apocalyptic\\" genre.  The story revolves around Robert Neville who is a one-man army against a land filled with Vampires.  In his quest to survive, we follow Robert over a three year period where he struggles with survival, depression, alcoholism, and the ever present hope that he is not the last \\"normal\\" human in the world.<br /><br />The book was short, but it was an engaging read that really drew me into Robert's battle for life.  I felt for the guy as I learned about what happened to the world, and specifically his wife and daughter.  I also felt the highs and lows Robert encountered throughout the story.<br /><br />The ending had one of the best closing lines I've ever read in a book.  I won't spoil it for you, but I will encourage you to read the book if for nothing other than the ending!
068485743X|1.0|From book blogger Margaret Yang writingslices.wordpress.com<br /><br />I can tell you what's wrong with the first five pages of Noah Lukeman's THE FIRST FIVE PAGES. Actually, it goes wrong at the first sentence. \\"Most people are against books on writing on principle.\\" If that were true, my blog would not exist. But it's not just me. One has only to walk into any bookstore and gaze at the vast shelves of writer's how-to books to see that Lukeman is incorrect.<br /><br />But getting things right isn't the point of Lukeman's book. He's more interested in complaining. He's been a successful literary agent for years, but any writer can query any agent, so Lukeman has seen it all. The premise of THE FIRST FIVE PAGES is that he can judge the quality of an entire book by reading just the opening pages. I've no doubt this is true. I also admire his goal. He wants writers everywhere to stop making mistakes so obvious that they can be spotted in such a small sample. However, if this book is his remedy, I doubt he will achieve his goal any time soon.<br /><br />It must be frustrating to watch writers make the same bonehead mistakes over and over. The problem is, those boneheads aren't the audience for this book. Writers who buy how-to books are serious about the craft. We are investing time and money trying to improve. We don't deserve to be slapped for daring to write an awkward sentence, and we certainly don't deserve to be talked down to.<br /><br />In the end, even if I could find useful material in this book, I couldn't get past the tone. The entire book is a 200 page rant. Advice, when he gives it, is so basic as to be useless (cut adverbs, don't use clich&eacute;s, format your manuscript correctly, etc.). The examples and writing exercises are downright insulting. Nobody who buys this book writes this badly. I understand that he is exaggerating to make a point, but the result is--again--one learns what not to do without ever learning the correct way to do it.<br /><br />\\"How not to get rejected\\" is a far cry from \\"how to write a good novel\\" and Lukeman never attempts to move from one to the other. If you want people to stop writing badly, complaining will not work. If you want people to stop writing badly, you must teach them to write well. Lukeman never does. I suspect he can't.<br /><br />With so many other books on my shelf that actually show me what to do, I am sorry I wasted my time on one that does not.e a good novel\\" and Lukeman never attempts to move from one to the other.

0380789019|2.0|I picked up Neverwhere because it seemed like kind of an interesting concept: in the book, there's a completely different, slightly blurry version of London (aka London Below or LB) that exists underneath the real city of London (aka London Above or LA). The people in London Above have no idea London Below even exists, but everyone in LB is acutely aware of LA. William Mayhew is from LA but accidentally gets pulled into LB when he literally stumbles over a LB girl involved in a LA murder/kidnapping/revenge plot.  London Below is similar to London Above, in that it has humans who speak English, tube stations, bridges, food, water, etc., but LB also throws in angels, earls, knights, friars, rat-speakers, rat kings, blood-thirsty beasts, labyrinths... As William gets pulled further into the murder/kidnapping/revenge plot mentioned above, he begins to realize that not only are the denizens of LB different from LA, but the rules in LB are also a little different from those in LA.  So, like I said, an interesting concept, but as I worked my way through the book, the execution of the story didn't live up to the concept. In the end, Neverwhere was fine - not really that good, but not terrible either (I finished it). Some parts were more interesting than others, but overall, it was just okay. On top of that, the book was randomly gory and gross. I'm not a huge fan of excessive violence, but if it fits the story, I can roll with it (see: The Godfather or The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). But with Neverwhere, a character would come out of nowhere and torture or murder another character and it would completely catch me off guard because it felt like it didn't really fit with the story. Didn't really enjoy that.  Overall, Neverwhere was just alright, but it is not one that I would strongly recommend.  In a nutshell: Meh. Two stars.
B000JCETC4|5.0|One of Gilmour's best sleeper album. When I say sleeper I meant &quot;no one knows about it&quot; but it is a very slow moving album. Great tunes, fantastic guitar licks and just a real winner. If you are looking for &quot;The Wall&quot; type rock tunes this is not it.
1451627289|5.0|Jake Epping has been given a chance to go back and change something big. His sites are on the Kennedy assassination and all the things that could have been had the president survived.<br /><br />King's latest is an 849 page time travel tome that moves along at an amazingly quick pace. There's a return to Derry and IT references, murders, heroics, and even a little bit of a love story involved, all with the late 1950s and early 1960s as a backdrop. HIghly recommended! I loved everything about it!
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I love sports movies which is why I review them harder than any other type.  This is better than The Fighter, and Million Dollar Baby, and would put it in the ranks of Rocky I and II.  Yes, it's that good.  You DO NOT have to be a \\"DUDE\\" or a MMA fan to love this movie.  My Mother is neither and she was screaming, and crying by movies end.  I was so disappointed in the box office take of this film, and hope the Academy will look closely at this for Best Picture and Nolte should walk out with Best Supporting Actor Statue no questions asked.  Can't wait till DVD Release, wish it was sooner!
B002GYS1FO|1.0|Purchased this and another CD November 14, 2011. Upon opening the package and inspecting the disk, I noticed a smudge like cement on it. Tried washing it but it would not come off. Played the disk and all went fine until tracks 8-10. The rest would not play. I am in the process of returning it to Amazon. The only song I liked on this CD was the popular: \\"How you like me now?\\" The rest?.....Eh.....Nothing exciting.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|There is television that is just entertaining without engaging the viewer to think.  Then there is television that challenges the viewer, drags them into the story and gives them a flawed hero to relate to.  This series is the latter.  Everything about the Walter character makes us want to dislike him - he is not just a drug dealer but a drug manufacturer.  His ability to rationalize moral questions in order to justify what he does makes us uneasy.  But what makes us uneasy is the very fact that we begin to relate to Walter and we realize that the seed of Walter is in all of us and we have to say, \\"but for the grace of God, there go I.\\"  Spoiler alert: if you are one concerned about ultimate justice and making sure Walter pays for his crimes, you will not like the end.  Other \\"evil-doers\\" in the story pay the price but not Walter.  And we are left wondering why he should be different from the others.  The series raises questions and makes us think - it is a rare sort of television show that can do that.
B003L77G6A|4.0|I've liked The Big Bang Theory for about a year now, and love this season like I loved the last three.  There seem to be fewer science jokes, which I don't like, but in general the characters are still fun and make you want to keep watching them.
0743429907|5.0|The book was in the condition indicated, and was shipped quickly.  It's going to be a great gift for a young teen who is planning to join the military!
B004EPZ08E|1.0|yeah bad plot, bad acting , bad directing, funny jokes you can count on your hand  not worth buying and Jennif Aniston role is just too be semi naked, probably the best part of the movie...............?
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Really useful and easy to use. Nice features, especially the ease of use of the checklist function. I'd definitely recommend this to Kindle Fire users.
1580084621|2.0|Beautiful and detailed classic Thai cookbook....most recipes impossible for me to make, as always at least one ingredient unavailable in my area
0694524441|5.0|The Alchemist is truly a great read. It inspires one to look within themselves.... where their true powers and answers to life reside. Really Inspirational!
B005OCFHHK|4.0|This is as most of the low rated reviews have said, a no frills, nothing added as a bonus set. I am fine with this. I can understand the hardcore followers not happy with it because of it's lack of bonus features etc. All I know is that for me (and many other viewers also) it is the best option! It allows me to see all of the movies in great blu-ray quality while STILL saving some money for other movies too. A trade-off I am happy to make.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Her music is her canvas, her words, her paintbrush and her voice a masterpiece! Florence combines her haunting vocals and powerful range with a medley of British folk, pop, indie, rock, soul and of course....spirit. Her music is so refreshing when too often it seems it has all been done before in today's music scene. I personally think this album is her finest yet and demonstrates her continued evolution in self discovery in music.   Brentos.
1933308087|5.0|I love this book. Jinny Beyer really did a lot of research on the quilt blocks in this book. If you are interested in names of quilt blocks and where they originated this is a great book. She also gives instruction on how to draft your own blocks.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|There is a large variety of board. There are fun extra tiles that make it more addictive.  Its really worth getting the paid version.
B000I9WWAY|1.0|This is a movie that is not intended to be understood at all as is -or- not intended to be understood with just one viewing -or- was beautifully and artfully crafted to allow only intelligent (aka intellectually gifted) people to understand.  It can't be enjoyed by the unwashed masses. If you don't like this -or- don't 'get it' -or- prefer movies to have an actual plot that can be followed = You're just too stupid and this movie wasn't made for you.   (For the sarcastically impaired -or- rabid Lynch fans the above was intended as sarcasm/satire.)  If you enjoy the type of TV/movies Lynch is associated with you'll probably love this and want to add it to your collection. For the rest of you, please view it before purchase. You could view it via Amazon at the time I write this.   This movie is currently rated as 8.0 on IMDB. There's a pretty lively discussion on the message boards between those who are wondering why anyone would bother to make such a lousy movie vs. those who feel people not recognizing this movie for the masterpiece it is to be idiots.  Enjoy this movie -or- not. If not, be prepared to be informed you lack intelligence.
0446547654|1.0|Oh my gosh, Mr. Sparks, you owe me! I wasted so many hours on this drivel. I knew when the book came automatically from my stupid book club that I had made a mistake in not cancelling the selection, however, I decided to give it a go anyway. BIG mistake! This book defies logic- seeing ghosts, friendships between people with no reason to be friends, secrets between spouses and parents, reunions with people from long ago with no explanations, and I could go on and on. It is contrived at best, but really just a hot mess. I stopped reading at about page 250 because I just didn't even care what happened to the main characters. I skimmed through the rest and discovered the most appalling turn of events ever written. What an insult to my intelligence. The ending is not possible in even the most extraordinary cases. Never again will I purchase a book from this author.
B000IDE2FI|2.0|Well it was ripped on some of the pages one was even ripped out but the page was in there and a lot of stains
1451648537|3.0|I read the first 3 chapters and the last one. They are all good and fascinating. I like the way the author narrates Steve's life and events happened to his life. I also like the writing style. However, the middle chapters are not so good and boring.
0345529057|5.0|its a very nice saga, great for those who do not want to wait until next season of hbo series.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I own a mobile DJ service in Pensacola FL and we use laptops for all of our set ups.  This is a sleek, light aluminum somewhat adjustable stand.  Great price.
B004EPZ07U|2.0|green latern was the passion of my soul, until that one seen when he saved man kind! the movie stunk like my dad's socks after he's done the yard work! the person who ever thought of green latern was a complete kook. I FEEL LIKE HE HAD NO TALENT WHAT SO EVER
0385343175|4.0|I really enjoyed the interaction between father and daughter.  The hotels in France and the dialog were spot on (been there - George V). What's not to like? I'm a sucker for a good love story to boot...and I would rather laugh than cry so this pretty much did the trick (only an occasional tear).
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Order process was easy and quick for this item! I have been waiting for this movie to come out since I saw it in the theaters.  It came earlier that the delivery date they stated.  Have watched it several time- great movie!!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Perfect for what I needed. I synced with my google calendar and it is great. I'm on the road a lot and so nice to get the reminders.
1933492953|5.0|This book is essential to any artist interested in studying the principles of design as related to 2D compositions. It is an easy and entertaining read also. The concepts will inspire you to push every frame of a story to its greatest story-telling potential. I wish it was a bit longer, but that's just because I want to hear more of what he has to say.
B005V20JKI|2.0|Doesnt download on lg. Takes 5 tries to download, but wont finish installation. Bummer too... it looks really fun and from the other reviews, it is.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|What a journey for such a band! After a greater-than thirty year career making sublimely good music, R.E.M. doesn't burn out or fade away. They leave us with a super nova explosion! \\"Collapse Into Now\\" is a love letter and thank you note to their fans. It's as if they held back one great song from each and every album, collecting them into this final masterpiece.<br /><br />Their music has always defied the charts and neat categorizations, yet the songs have mass appeal and have burned themselves into our hearts. They are a part of our culture. If humanity had a sound, it would sound like this.<br /><br />It's not the end of the world... just the close of one of the greatest chapters in the book of music history. An entire life of a band and its fans collapse into now. And I feel fine.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|No long review, just an opinion about a memorable tour de farce.  Once I began reading I couldn't put it down.  I'm not a fast reader but I finished this book in about ten hours.  I was completely engrossed.  It's an adventure that explores the foibles and nonsensical rationales of men in harm's way that are assigned to do the business of war and are looking for a way out or a reasoning for their participation in convoluted circumstances.  It is eccentric hyperbole.  Now, I lent the book to a friend of high intellect and steadfast scholastic pursuit who thought it ok but nothing to tell his children about.  When we discussed the book, it became obvious to me that one of the differences in our enthusiasms was his lack of military experience.  While I had seemingly experienced all the characters in stressful venues, he had not.  Still, my affection for the book, well, I wear it my sleeve.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is a totally predictable, albeit totally delightful, romantic comedy that succeeds thanks to a witty script, spry direction and a very likable cast.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are \\"best friends\\" who each have had difficulty with past romantic relationships and want to avoid emotional pain in the future.  Both, however, have their sexual needs, so they agree to become \\"friends with benefits\\"; sex partners without any emotional commitment.  How this relationship is going to end up is obvious from the start, but the fun is in getting there.<br /><br />The supporting players in this film certainly contribute to make it special.  Patricia Clarkson plays Mila's wandering mother, a fugitive from the 1970s who has not changed her ways and is unsure as to which of her myriad lovers fathered her daughter.  Richard Jenkins is Justin's father, suffering from Alzheimer's, and Woody Harrelson is Timbelake's openly gay co-worker.  Also in the cast is Emma Stone, Andy Samberg and Jenna Elfman.<br /><br />Director Will Gluck co-wrote the screenplay with Keith Merryman and David A. Newman, who along with Harley Peyton, developed the story.<br /><br />Extras on the DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment  audio commentary with Gluck, Timberland and Kunis, deleted  scenes and outtakes.<br /><br />FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is a terrific date movie.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|The movie was awesome.  The price was great.  I really like dealing with Amazon.  It makes it really easy to shop.
0452289963|4.0|this is a fairly dense work on spirituality & moving locus of control inward. the concepts are presented thoroughly by Eckhart.
B005SZNZAY|4.0|Chris Cornell has been meandering through the music world since the mid-80's. From Soundgarden and Temple Of The Dog, to Audioslave and numerous solo recordings. He was due to release this collection.<br /><br />It draws fairly evenly from all his eras, though I feel like we were shorted another Soundgarden track or two. Could we get nothing from Down On The Upside or Louder Than Love on here? Just those two from Superunknown? There's two covers on here also. I think Zep's Thank You was a good choice, fits him well. I feel like Imagine was too obvious a choice, though I like the song. Good picks from the Audioslave years. I feel As Hope And Promise Fade and Ground Zero are rather weak. I'd happily swap those for Seasons and Sweet Euphoria. It all ends with the new song The Keeper from the film Machine Gun Preacher. I like it alot.<br /><br />I can't wait to see him live in 40 hours.
B005FUTBWS|5.0|Waited a LONG time to see this film and it didn't disappoint.  Very different from Kevin Smith's other films.  Michael Parks' performance is amazing.
B000LJAEFG|3.0|There are certainly some exciting moments, and enlivening concepts here.  Overall the movie's storyline seems to wander loosely.  I suspect the writers were doing their share of LSD at the time.
B002N44XSG|5.0|This book is AMAZING! I loved the Percy Jackson series and liked having an inside look at the series. My cousins and I like to read the stories outloud to eachother (The Stolen Chariot, The Bronze Dragon, and my favorite, The Sword Of Hades.) He map was fun to look at and see how everything is arranged at camp half-blood.   The Stolen Chariot: Great story! Interesting to read and doesn't take a lot of time.   The Bronze Dragon: This one is my least favorite but was still entertaining and fun to read.  He Sword Of Hades:This story is my favorite! I liked how it described the river lethe. I also like how they have to use the flower to track the enemy.  I would recomend this book to anyone who wants an inside look at the Percy Jackson series. Don't read this book before you read The Battle Of The Labyrinth!
B004A8EI9M|1.0|This show fizzles out far too quickly.  And then season 2 is a huge let down. The zombies are almost an after-thought.  The characters try to fill the story, but they're just not interesting.  Post apocalyptic zombie infected Earth would be far more interesting than this show.  Don't start on this, go watch something else.
B0053TMP24|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! I read it SIX times in the first five days it was out, although the typos made it harder to read. I love books that have to do with mythology, so it was no suprise when I loved the Percy Jackson series. I waited for this book for six months with it on pre-order and will probably do the same for the next book. I can't wait for the next book and would say thisbook is definately worth your time and money!
B005WGBQ9G|1.0|If you thought season 1 was ok, season 2 is trash.  It has quickly become a soap opera loosely set in a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested world.  The characters and their drab relationship dramas take center-stage, with occasional zombie attacks.  Who the hell would have time for silly relationship issues in a world full of zombies trying to eat your flesh?  It's also full of plain stupid writing.  The zombies are attracted to sound, this was established in season 1, yet the survivors drive around with a Harley Davidson, and waste bullets shooting cans for some sport target practice.
B004FOA84A|3.0|A very slight lag issue made for a little frustration. Also one very slightly out of sight doorway caused the longest delay in the game as far as progression goes. Worth a buck.
B000HZJ0CW|5.0|I'm not a big fan of the original Star Trek, the original movies are pretty good.  And I detest the following Star Trek series Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise are all failures.  TNG is where it's at.  All of the TNG movies, and series are fantastic.  This movie fits right in with the best of TNG.
1451648537|5.0|Totally enjoyed this book! I come from the corporate world and have a passion for design so Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs really struck a chord. It inspires you to fight for what you believe in!
B000SP1SEO|5.0|This movie, along with Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, are tremendous.  The characters are fun, and solid, the story is fun, it really was the peak of these types of films.  This is a must see classic.
034552554X|5.0|The Language of Flowers to be a refreshing change from the typical boys meets girl romance. The prose was enchanting and the storyline kept me reading late into the night (I read the whole book in 3 days) The book consists of the current story of Victoria trying to survive after leaving the foster care system accompanied by flashbacks to her young life in the foster care system. The richness of the story came from the obstacles that held Victoria back from love due to her experience in the foster care system. The incoporation of the meaning of flowers gave the story a bit more depth.  A bonus is the Language of Flowers dictionary in the back that tells you the meaning of flowers. I found myself wandering through my yard looking up the mearning of all the flowers in my garden.
B001QVFDA4|1.0|This movie tries and fails to capture the spirit & awesomeness of Snatch, and Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.  I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone, it was hard to finish watching.  If you're about to watch this, don't, instead rent Snatch, or Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|There are some parts of this book, & some characters & I absolutely adored (Bailey & the twins for example).  Others I merely tolerated in hopes that I could get to the parts I liked better.  I really enjoyed the idea of the circus & generally, when the story focused on that, I was eager to continue- however, when the story moved away I found myself putting the book down & caring less & less about what was going on.  I was also annoyed by Morgenstern's jumping around from time period to time period.  Overall a very interesting read, & sometimes a very entertaining one, but when the story lost focus, so did I.
B005ILYWN2|5.0|This film feels great.  The acting is splendid, the special effects are better than I anticipated, and the story is exciting.  The camera jerkiness isn't as bad as other films in this style.  It's a fun & interesting film!
0783110871|5.0|This movie is so freakin cool, i had no idea I would love it this much.  The entire premise was great.  A convicted killer being hauled back by plane to stand trial.  Everything that follows is so action packed and unpredictable, you will love it. I had it on VHS (taped it from cable tv) but I loved it so much i just had to order the DVD.  Ray Liotta is such a phonomenal actor, he can play anything.  The Christmas setting, the decorations on the plane and in the flight attendant's house was just so beautiful, this movie was excellent.  So well put together, the acting, the scenery, the plane - 100% on point.  Loved it!!  I highly recommend purchasing this film. Get yourself a cup of egg nogg and watch it in front of a crackling fire and enjoy!!
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I recently bought a 42\\" LCD Panisonic TV that only has optical digital output. I found that I needed a converter to let me hook up my older stereo that has the red and white RCA audio plugs and I like playing the TV sound through my stero speakers, So I spent around $30 for the FiiO D3 converter and an optical Toslink cable (6 ft.) as it doesn't come with one, and I would recommend the 6 ft. as 3 ft. doesn't reach very far. Very easy hook up. The optical cable comes with protective plastic caps that have to be removed from both ends which is not mentioned, I thought it was the wrong cable or junk but once I pulled the caps off, it plugged right in and worked great, no noise or sound issues as some have talked about, maybe they have other electronics causing interference, don't know, but mine works great! I would highly recommend this unit.
B0024R1RAY|5.0|Excellent movie.  Bought it after seeing it on network TV and wasn't disappointed.  What the network omitted due to time or rating constraints changed the movie enough that it is a must to see the original version.  Movie arrived within the specified time stated.
B00158K0S8|5.0|Love this movie. One of my favorite WWII Movies. A must for a bit of history we should never forget.
B004QNVQK0|5.0|This 30th anniversary reissue of Ozzy's debut solo album marked the significance and influence of metal genre at his time and ours. This album has been reissued with higher quality technology which unleashed the ultimate true quality of a vinyl.
B006B31B80|5.0|My review is short and simple. To all the people rating the show bad ratings, read the comic. This show follows the comics 90% of the time, I can recall many times in the comics when people didn't die at all and when you least expect it the walkers attack. If you are true to the show then read the comic, you will see why Kirkwood stays true to his roots. I would definitely stop watching the show if it was all about guts and gore. If you want guts and gore then watch any of the \\"Dead\\" Series or just simply read the Walking Dead Comics (highly recommended).
B000RHFTGG|5.0|Tommy is inarguably one of the best recorded rock albums in the history of rock and roll music. I love the production and the sound quality of the entire album. Definitely a great collector's item to keep for a lifetime.
0743216385|4.0|Package arrived well ahead of time to Victoria Australia but I was disappointed with the book as the pages are all jagged. The printer who put the book together did a poor job of slicing the pages off square. It looks odd but I can live with it. The book is a hard cover luckily and hides the jagged blocks of pages.
B00274ETKY|5.0|This heavy metal album marks the debut and massive success among the early heavy metal bands in the world. The an amazing collector's item as well.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|If you are a fan then grab these, I got them to toss in my kids Box set that didn't come with last 3 films. Will be ordering the BluRay version also, just waiting on a complete box set of them.
B0043URV5U|4.0|Wonderful complilation...other than adding a Christmas track and 3 other not so good songs to complete this 2 cd set. Where is the awesome \\"Sunspot Baby\\" or \\"Understanding\\" or \\"Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight\\" ?? They still haven't gotten Seger's greatest hits package right...perhaps next time. Great cd cover however!
B001FB55I0|5.0|What a great film! Blu ray is awesome! Not only great film and sound but tons of extra's that give a great couple hours enjoyment.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|We received the item promptly.  It contained two extremely entertaining CD's that we listen to in our automobile.  We love these CD's.
B001B1UO6W|1.0|Ok, we all know dvd is quickly going he way of VHS and if you are like me you kick yourself every time you waste your money buying a \\"has been\\" format, I buy this one thinking \\"no way they will blu this one\\" then a couple weeks later the blu comes out...oh well. Fun Movie though.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I got this movie really cheap on Amazon, they were selling them in stores for at least 10 bucks more than what I paid for it!!
B002NPY7FE|4.0|Although the digital transfer to BluRay is far from perfect and you can tell it's release was more to grab a fast dollar then to give the customer a quality transfer I still picked this one up. Price was low and as DVD is quickly going the way of VHS it was a good time to ensure I could enjoy one of my favorite Stephen King flicks for years to come...
0790731479|5.0|Was in great shape and we got it very fast! I love shopping @ Amazon because I can get some very good deals and I love to save money!

B004PEJ1H0|1.0|Did not realize it was only two tracts, one vocal and one instrumental. I will be sure to look more closely next time.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Absoultely perfect. Movie was exactly as I remembered it. Widescreen format is great for HDTVs. Good special features. I would definitely recommend this prduct.
0060899190|5.0|I really wanted to get a unique/interesting book as a friend's birthday gift and this definitely was PERFECT. It's not for those looking for an in depth, long read...it's more for those who love to have interesting books around the house for the occasional rainy day. I flipped through the first few pages and found myself totally intrigued--enough so that I decided to buy my own copy.
B0013FYTAI|5.0|excellent service and product, i would buy from them again. glad it was the clean version so i can listen while kids in car.
6305428042|5.0|I loved watching this every year around Halloween as a kid and I really looked forward to watching it now as an adult...it was just as funny and it was definitely worth buying. For those that haven't watched it, but are thinking about buying it, I seriously recommend it! It's funny enough for adults and colorful and fun enough for kids.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I purchased the Mobee inductive charger because the Magic Mouse was using up the batteries too quickly. It installed very easily, and came with a partial charge, so I was able to use it out of the box. I have been using it for abou 2 months now, and it works perfectly. The mouse is always charged. It is beautifully designed and looks like it came with the iMac. I am surprised Apple hasn't bought the company to include it with the computers. My wife has a tendency to not put the mouse on the charging pad, but the batteries maintain their charge very well. Highly recommended.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|As far as action based hitman movies go \\"Hanna\\" is certainly a step above most recent movies of this genre. It stars Saroise Ronan (The Lovely Bones) as a young girl who was trained to be the perfect killer by her father (Eric Bana, \\"The Hulk\\", \\"Munich\\") who sets her out on a mission that takes her across Europe and into the path of an evil agent (Cate Blanchett, \\"Robin Hood\\"). Of course like most movies of this kind there's always more going on than meets the eye.<br /><br />The early scenes with Hanna and her father in the Finland wilderness are very good and soon after her father leaves she is captured. The best sequence may have been when she escaped  and took out a whole bunch of guards using the skills that were bred into her. The whole movie while edited quite quickly is overall very well done, Ronan has a unique look and has a certain presence that will fit quite well in Hollywood.<br /><br />The problem that prevents \\"Hanna\\" from being a 4 star film is after the initial scenes with her dad and the escape it feels like the movie kinda ran out of juice near the end and that the director felt he had to rush to a finish. Mind you whats here is very good, but it leaves the viewer wanting more.<br /><br />As a whole \\"Hanna\\" is a good solid movie that certainly has plenty of originality and lots of good thrills.

B006AX6ONI|5.0|Strongly recommend this book.  Especially for the younger crowd that just graduated college and feels like they are missing the \\"it factor\\"
B005ETA5K2|4.0|This thing is a signal monster!  I have two of these units I bought just to experiment with long range.  I upgraded both antennas to 9 and 10 Dbi omni directionals.  The results were astounding!  I got 2000 feet with 80% signal quality with massive interference in a tightly packed suburban setting!  I have a couple 12 Dbi directional antennas on order which should get me even further hopefully.  In station mode, in my living room, I see 85 access points with 20+ being link worthy!  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the software.  It works great on windows 7 but gives me major driver issues with vista.   my advice... BUY IT!!!!

B004EPYZQC|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying that if you are a fan of the Fast and Furious movies strictly for the cars and the racing, you may not share my pure love for this movie. There is very little racing, and one scene of drifting. Fast Five is my favorite of the movies because it had plot beyond racing. It had the best characters from the four previous movies (even Tokyo Drift) and it incorporated a heist. I love a good heist. The chase scene at the end of the movie is awesome, in my opinion. A lot of stunts were unbelievable, but it's a movie, so there should be shock value. Watch the scene after the credits because there will be a Fast Six. This movie is one of the best action movies of 2011.
1400052181|1.0|The science of HeLa is incredible, the rest of the story - annoying, agenda-driven verbiage.  The book erratically seems to rehash over and over how (ostensibly) Henrietta Lacks was exploited when during (free/charity) surgical treatment of her cancer, the physician took a sample of the tumor tissue (Did she want to keep the tumor tissue for herself? Did she want more of the tumor tissue left on her cervix?). Over and over her children complain that they should be financially compensated because she was \\"raped of her cells\\" and accusing everyone of making money from their mother's cells while they were still poor. Mrs. Lacks' medical care was standard procedure at the time - using some of the tumor tissue for research did not in any way change her unfortunate prognosis. The physician and researcher did not use HeLa cells to get rich - indeed, while professionally notable, they never profited from HeLa research, and their conduct was standard protocol for the time.   It is sad that her children led terrible lives (incest, abuse, poverty), but none of the blame is put on the children's father, David Lacks, who gave his wife syphilis, gonorrhea, and the HPV that caused her cancer... and then failed to parent the children adequately, exposing them to incest and abuse. It is HIS fault the children had neurosyphilis, were uneducated and poor - not the researchers. I feel sorry for her family, and wish they could have grown up with a mother, but whether or not cells were taken would not have changed that, or their poverty. Instead the author wants to blame scientists for the Lacks family still being impoverished and abused and making it seem as though the \\"mistreatment\\" of Henrietta Lacks was racially motivated when there is zero evidence to support that assertion. There were mistakes along the way (releasing medical info to the public), but Ms. Skloot's book is even more damaging- the family comes across as ignorant,criminal, and money-hungry, not sympathetic.

B004S3MB2U|4.0|I have only had it for an hour, but it beats all of the others I have tried. I have a feature request for the computer programmer mode that would upgrade my review to 5 stars. Please give us 64 bit operations! My processors all have 64 bit pointers, and my calculator needs them, too!
B003Y5H574|5.0|Great cast, great performances, great movie. I wanted to catch this at the movies, but saw it on DVD. It's a funny, heart warming film. For the genre, it's a 5 star film. Steve is great as always, flawless performance! Witty and clever, it slows down a little at the end but I really enjoyed it and it's unusual for me to watch a film like this twice, but I have already.
0823015017|2.0|It is a good book about color theory, and how to apply it to polymer clay. The examples are good to show you the color ideas the author is trying to teach, but the polymer clay techniques are very basic and the results are very far from what the front cover shows. For me, the examples and techniques described are not that inspirational, but allow understanding how the color works on polymer clay. There are excellent photos of other artist's jewelry. I am kind of disappointed for the lacking of interesting techniques and even the palettes used were not so appealing to me.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This trilogy is really great, I had to read one book after the other because they were that good. Though I admit I like book 1 and 2 better because this third was a bit disappointing. First of all, I really started disliking the heroine (Katniss)... I do not know what happen to the strong girl from the first two books but she was no leader!   POSSIBLE SPOILERS...And seriously she did not deserve Peeta's love (and her fickle feelings between Gale and Peeta lasted too long which wasnt fair to either of them). I didnt think Katniss, even with all she went through, would be so weak and end up like her mother (depressed, suicidal... )she was different than that. And like other reviewers, I agree the whole not being able to reach Snow was not a good choice for the author to make though I did like that she killed Coin but I think it was more made on a move to force her to pick Peeta by default which sucks because I wanted her to make a choice on the one she really couldnt survive with. The ending though left much to be desired... everything was rushed that in the end I didnt think her love for Peeta was real... and why in the epilogue are we not told of the kids names? I dont know but I was left with more questions than answers... overall though I love this series and book 1 and 2 really were great and it is worth reading, especially since Peeta is such a great character.
1612680003|1.0|This book is something Written by a salesman, not an investor: Robert kiyosaki has little knowledge about how investing actually works, and so his advice is EXTREMELY misleading and dangerous: he ignores important factors such as risk, and basically tells you that it's good to be broke so you can learn from it?!? This was the first book I ever read on investing, at about 16 years of age, and I have to tell you, go read something else. This man has a bad economic background, and the only way he ever made money was by selling people books about making money. It's just a big scam. His other books are the same. Please go look for real advising from the pros.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This trilogy is really great, I had to read one book after the other because they were that good. Though I admit I like book 1 and 2 better because the third was a bit disappointing. But this book was a great start and I thought it was original and I wanted to know more about Katniss, Peeta and the rest of the characters. I highly recommend this series.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This trilogy is really great, I had to read one book after the other because they were that good. Though I admit I like book 1 and 2 better because the third was a bit disappointing. But book two was a great continuation to book 1. In book one i was rooting for Peeta but this book really made me love him. There are other secondary characters here that the author does a great job at making us care about. I highly recommend this series.
1904994679|5.0|Great book, great binding. It's the same thing that you've come to expect from GWB of Records. I usually get a new one every few years. A lot of this info is available on the internet but when I have people over at my house, they almost always pick it up and take a look at it. It really is a great conversational book/coffee table book and you won't be disappointed.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|If you're looking for a traditional sounding Christmas Album this is it! Most of the songs have a classic feel, just updated. Michael's duet with Shania Twain on White Christmas is very similar to the version heard in Home Alone and other songs sound reminescent of Bing Crosby. This is the best Christmas album I've heard in a long time!!!
1567184855|5.0|Wow, what can I say?  This is a thorough and well written explanation of how souls grow and develop through reincarnation.  The case studies are engaging and I finished this book at one sitting, yes it's THAT good.    What's brilliant is the chapter on signs and this really resonates with me because I've had those unexplained feelings about certain future friends and significant people.  Also, it explains how believe it or not, some people chose to live unpleasant lives for the sake of their own growth;  you cannot appreciate love unless you experience hate and likewise you cannot appreciate beauty until you've experience ugly.  Highly recommended!

0316056863|4.0|Tina Fey in Tina Fey's own voice is fantastic. No one else could read this, I'm convinced, with Fey's nuance that helped make this book such a delight. Fey realizes that she was playing in a male-dominated field and wants the rules to be the same for her as they are for any male. She's done a great job so far.

0525423656|2.0|I had a hard time getting into the first book \\"Matched\\" but when I finally did I couldn't put it down, and really looked forward to the second book coming out. I bought it the day it was released and that night tried to read it, and again a very slow and boring start. I liked getting Ky's point of view as well, but the jumping around left me confused some of the time, and made me actually lose interested. I think it was a very boring and slow second story and because of it I may not purchase the third. I wish there was more to this book, because I think it COULD have been great!
B001OW5NX2|5.0|This is my first exposure to Ernest Hemingway and, after reading it, I wonder how I could go through eight years of high school and college and not read one Hemingway book.  I loved this book!  I have never taken so quickly to a piece of classic literature.  Hemingway's style is powerful, evocative, and dramatic.  And yet none of the prose is overly verbose or bombastic.  This tale, set over four days in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War, follows Robert Jordan, an American fighting in the International Brigade, and his preparations for a bridge demolition.  During that time, he falls in love with the beautiful and tragic Maria as well as befriends the group of guerrillas he is working with.  During those four days, Jordan loves, idealizes, and submits to his dutiful fate more passionately than most men ever will.  If you have never read Hemingway before, I suggest you do so right away.  This book is a great one to start with and I know that I will be looking to read more of his works soon.

B003PBB4ME|5.0|I have now used the X-Grip for a year filming snowboarding and skiing. The X-grip beats out the traditional helmet mount by allowing you to keep the camera on the subject no matter what your going thru. A traditional helmet mount is hard since you have to stair at the subject and not on your own boarding/skiing. With the X-Grip you just keep it pointed at your subject, from a wide range of angles, and not kill yourself in the process. I've beat this thing to death! Amazing level of abuse, and  still looks almost new! I cannot recommend one of these enough for the average go-pro, helmet cam, type of video capture... Also I have the orange which makes it easier to find when everything does go wrong and your collecting your garage sale from the snow!
B0007PAMR4|4.0|Though it has it's flaws by any measure (even Lynch's odd standards) this is a powerful Sci-Fi epic of the highest caliber.  Moody and hulking, the story paints images that will not soon be forgot.  The sets are huge, the cast a powerful ensemble and the world it creates is unforgettable.  You cannot leave this film without taking something.
B005JU5JTI|2.0|it was just not a great movie, but obviously entertaining if I watched it till the end :(  Still, I have seen other silly movies that were not so bad.  Perhaps because at least something in the movies was believable;  IN this one - perhaps there are plenty of teachers who smoke pot, but not the kind where a teacher comes to work dressed in mini skirt and crazy hills.
B005VQE2LQ|4.0|I am a life-long comics fan, and I have been following the Green Lantern comics since Geoff Johns and Ethan Van Sciver blew me away with \\"Green Lantern: Rebirth\\".  For those who are unaware, Hal Jordan is actually the 2nd character published by DC Comics to bear the name \\"Green Lantern\\". Since the late '50s to the early '60s, the Green Lantern has actually had four human heroes. Arguably the most well loved and well known is Hal Jordan. As you can imagine, 50-60 years worth of comics provides for a very, very complicated history.   As a result of that, think of it this way: imagine someone came to you and asked you to write a story that:  1.) Summarizes and explains the history of a Police Force that has been patrolling the cosmos for several thousand years.  2.) Makes you care about and begin to understand the type of person that becomes a Green Lamtern.  3.) Shows WHY the Green Lamterns exist.  4.) Has a love story.  5.) And all of that has to be covered in less than 2 hours, and it has to be entertaining.  Look at it that way... The movie did a pretty good job. Superman, Batman, Spider-man, The X-Men... They're all fairly straightforward. Green Lamtern is many things... But it's not simple, and it's not easy to explain. The movie does an excellent job of bringing attention to a character that the average movie-goer has never heard of.  Ryan Reynolds was, surprisingly, quite good at Hal Jordan. (Hal is kind of like a more reckless, irresponsible version of Tom Cruise's character in Top Gun... And he's a much, much better pilot.)  All in all? The movie did a great job of showcasing a lesser known character in the DC comics universe.  If I had one complaint, it's that they had several opportunities to start making the DC Movie franchises more continuity friendly. A reporter from the daily planet could have shown up. Technology made by either STAR labs, LexCorp., or Wayne Tech.  I guess we'll have to wait and see.
B005B0QYMM|4.0|I know alot of ppl didnt care for this movie but i liked it and i think it shud have went further than it did it was a change of pace with sum of the ghostly movies lately it was alot like the show ghost adventures which i am not that crazy about but this movie was good though

B000EWBC42|5.0|First, this is probably the greatest live album to come out of Rock music. There is nothing I could say to add to the performance recorded herein except to say that I'm glad they finally made it available to Westerners.  The sound quality for every release of this album has always been astonishingly good, but I suspect this is as good as it gets on a standard CD. The package is a meticulously faithful replica of the original album (for the longest time available only as a Japanese import).  Now the CD package finally gets the treatment that the album itself deserves. It's almost embarrassing to see an album of such astronomical quality being tossed together into a double-thick jewel case. (Well, at least I haven't seen it stuffed into one of those masterpieces of planned obsolescence, the digi-pack!)  This three-CD format is better than the two-CD package in one very important respect. When I transfer my albums to my portable player, I like to keep uninterrupted live segments as a single file. With three CDs, this becomes easier to manage than with two CDs, although with both packages the engineers left several gaps in the middle of the sides, allowing us to divide the Japanese package into more than three files, whereas the two-CD package has blended many of these together in an attempt to simulate an uninterrupted concert experience.

B005JLN9ZI|5.0|These days, Drake has turned into a man that is either loved or hated. First of all, people dislike him for his ability to balance singing and rapping in his songs. Lets be honest - some flat out hate it and wish he would choose one. But his real fans know no choice has to nor should be made. Drake is talented in both worlds, and he best says \\"F you\\" to his haters in \\"Lord Knows\\" ft. Rick Ross. Those of you who have listened to this song know EXACTLY to what I am referencing.   \\"Take Care\\" has been a project carefully crafted over the past year by Drake. It's about his life, who he is, what he experiences and he allows the listener to take a glimpse into his world. Its a refreshing break from those rap artists who are constantly spitting lines about drug dealing, threatening to kill other dudes or steal their girls. Drake is a genre of his own. There are not many other artists who can be compared to him - which is one thing I appreciate about his artistry. He gives music that is completely relatable and he is endlessly quotable.  I recommend this album to anyone with a brain, and anyone who is able to appreciate good music. There are a lot of great songs on this album. My favorites are most certainly:  Under Ground Kings  Buried Alive Interlude  Over My Dead Body  Crew Love  Take Care  The Love  Doing It Wrong  I do have a couple of issues with this album. I do have to say my least favorite is \\"Practice.\\" I think its an awkward way to end an album (if you didn't purchase the deluxe edition). \\"The Ride\\" (bonus track) would have been more suitable and \\"Practice\\" should have been offered as a bonus. Also, Birdman's contribution to \\"We'll Be Fine\\" is well... not fine.
B0064J6P8W|2.0|When viewing the preview of this film, you'll see the very few moments of comedy that have been injected into a bloated, lifeless plot.  In sum -- two guys piss into a fountain and, magically, they swap bodies.  Family man / lawyer is now a single party guy.   This plot COULD HAVE been very funny.  But, instead, the writers rely on very extreme scenes (i.e. a naked pregnant woman trying to have sex with Ryan Reynolds) that just aren't amusing -- they're disgusting.  Finding the line between gross and funny is an art because anyone can be extreme and vulgar.  It takes little talent to shout out bad language and think up extreme situations.    To be funny, these guys should have followed some of the thoughtless, yet funny, comedies ---Wedding Crashers or American Pie.  In fact, even Beavis and Butthead has better writers!

1594202842|4.0|Book Description<br /><br />This memoir is Chua's explanation, defense and personal account of the Chinese mother style of parenting, which emphasizes academic achievement, pursuit of perfection, a strong work ethic and respect for your elders (i.e.,the Chinese mother). To Chua, this style of parenting is not limited solely to Chinese mothers, but she does think that the Chinese approach to parenting and the Western approach are at different ends of the spectrum. Where Westerners value self-esteem and nurturing, the Chinese style emphasizes strength and preparing children for the future. As Chua interprets it, there is no room for fun activities like sleepovers, school plays or play dates because they don't prepare children for the future. Under her regime, her two daughters were required be the top student in every subject area (except gym or drama) and to play either the piano or violin (practicing up to 4 hours a day).<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />Chua is unapologetic about her parenting approach and doesn't sugarcoat her actions as she struggles to impose her will on her daughters, husband and even the family dog. She admits that her approach is extreme, but it is difficult to argue with the results. Both of her daughters are academic superstars and gifted musicians. However, the road to these results was often littered with tears, anger and rebellion, particularly by Chua's youngest daughter Lulu.<br /><br />Although Chua often comes across as extreme and almost unfeeling, it is obvious that she did all of this out of love for her daughters and her belief that they could handle the intense pressure she placed on them. In fact, she is confident that they will one day appreciate all that she did for them. (In fact, she demands this kind of recognition and respect now. In one chapter, she talks about ripping up the homemade birthday cards her daughters made because the girls didn't expend enough effort making them.) In addition, Chua repeatedly mentions that this style of parenting isn't easy on anyone--not the children or the parents. After working at her job at Yale, Chua would spend hours supervising her children's musical practice, taking detailed notes and demanding they replay sections again and again.<br /><br />Although it is easy to dismiss Chua's approach as cruel and extreme, I think she makes some good points. I do think that I, as a parent, can push my son a bit more. He has a tendency to be a bit lazy--expending the minimum amount of effort for his homework and in soccer. After reading this book, I realized that pushing him a bit wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Although I wouldn't take things to the level that Chua did, I found myself asking my son to do homework beyond what he was assigned and asking him to practice soccer at home between games. (And what do you know? The week after practicing at home a few times, he managed to score his first goal!)<br /><br />This was an interesting memoir, and it deserves the controversy that surrounded it upon its publication.Yet before criticizing Chua, I think people owe it to her to read this book and gain a full understanding of what she is about and trying to do.<br /><br />Recommended for: Readers interested in learning more about Chua's controversial parenting style and parents who wonder if there is a benefit in pushing their children more than they are used to.yone--not the children or the parents.

0316066524|1.0|I got to page 500 or so and realized I had no desire to continue reading this book. Of what I read, I'd say maybe 25% of it was character-driven and the rest was setting description and fictional history review, which is really boring. I kept expecting it to get through the drawl and into the so-called \\"good stuff\\" (like in 1984, that horribly boring explanation of world and country history halfway through the book,) but after 500 pages that was looking like it wasn't coming. From reading other peoples' 1-star reviews it doesn't look like it ever picks up. So I give up. I wasted $17.

B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|Bought the first BTR CD for my daughter last Christmas- which she loves! She listens to it all the time and enjoys watching their TV show as well. She is so excited to get this CD for Christmas this year. I don't mind her playing the music a little loud because it's very enjoyable pop music with clean happy lyrics. Not having any swear words or talk about sex is a big PLUS!!! So hard to find appropriate music for young adolescents these days.

1423389387|2.0|Even though I was listening to it on cd, it took me a long time to get through The Wise Man's Fear. And it wasn't until I was halfway through that I finally admitted to myself why I kept pulling discs out to listen to something else on my drives to and from work. Simply put - I don't like Kvothe anymore. The kid that I was rather intrigued by in The Name of the Wind no longer appeals to me. His amazingness irks me, I find him whiney and unrealistic and I'm incredibly annoyed by his pithy teenage pronouncements on sex and on the meaning of love. I don't care what happens to him. At all. And that pretty much kills any interest I have in the story.<br /><br />Aside: Because I listened to the audio version, I will say that Nick Podehl does a great job. If you liked the story and are considering shelling out the money for the (really long!) audio version, I'm confident you'll be pleased with the quality and with his performance.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|I have loved Elvis since he came on the scene way back when.  This cd is wonderful it contains all the songs I know and listen to all the time.  I have Sierus Radio and I play the Elvis station all the time, now I have Elvis to play while in the house.  All I can say is keep these good cds coming!!!
1451648537|5.0|This book got me develop interest in meditation, minimalist principles. It also taught me a lot on entrepreneurship.  We have a lot to learn from the great person Steve, and this book not only describes life of steve, it is more on how to go about running a company  , thoughts inspiration and hard work that goes into each one of his products and much more. !  A must read for everyone who wants to become 'someone' and achieve 'something'.
1451648537|5.0|Fascinating reading. The best book I've read in a long time. It gives an insight into Steve Jobs life that really helps to get to know him as a person, for those who is interested, of course. I think it really teaches you something. Great book about a great man.

B005G4TJUC|5.0|I now have all three Transformers movies and each one gets even better! The story and graphics are great. The movie kept me off my seat. I don't always assume sequels for movies will be consistent and better.  However, each sequel for Transformers have exceeded the previous sequel.  I can't stop watching all of these movies.  I love them.
B001IF252M|5.0|This adapter goes with me everywhere I take my MacBook Pro. I have used it to connect to external displays, and I have used it to help me setup projectors for clients. This is a great addition to any laptop bag.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|This CD has some amazing vocals.  Ms. Houston's voice shows depth and richness, and her vocal technique demonstrates control, power, subtlety, emotion and her wonderful tone.  \\"O Come O Come Emanuel\\" is \\"stop your heart\\" breathtaking, and \\"Cantique de Noel/ O Holy Night\\" just makes you want to stop everything and play the song over an over again.  \\"The Christmas Song\\" is also a stand out, and then, there is Ms. Houston's rendition of \\"Joy to the World,\\" with the Georgia Mass Choir, which, like her Super Bowl performance of the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\", sets the standard for this song.  After hearing Houston's Joy to the world, every other version pales.  Why this CD is so little known is a mystery, because some of these performances are among the best ever by this once in a lifetime artist. I would recommend ordering the CD instead of downloading because the CD provides a much better sound (mp3s lose so much in translation).  What Houston does with her \\"instrument\\" on some of these songs is simply breathtaking, so, after hearing her versions of these songs, like so many of her performances, you will be spoiled and may never want to hear someone else sing this song.  I highly recommend this CD.
B003ASKR2A|5.0|For the most part, I liked the book. At times it was a little depressing so I struggled to read on. It had a lot of philosophical references and was quite the eye opener as to decisions made towards moral dilemmas. Overall, I enjoyed it because of its plot and it's double meaning. You know when a book is good when it prompts the reader evaluate his or her own ethical standpoints.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Great sound and excellent video quality. I like very much the movie because it presents scenes that were not in the regular format. The THX logo in Liquid metal looks awesome.

1451627289|5.0|Well, maybe I am, because there are quite a few moments in this book that brought tears to my eyes, Some of sadness, many of joy. I have read many Stephen King books. Almost all of his early stuff and occasionally his later offerings. I thought he had lost his mojo for a while and he was almost always too verbose. \\"Badly in need of an editor\\" it was often said. Well, not here. Every word is necessary and an integral part of this fascinating story. This book, simply put, is the best thing he has ever written. The words \\"couldn't put it down\\" are often thrown about, but in this case it was true. In my opinion, a truly great read. A couple of nit-picks. At one point when Jake/George is making one of his longshot bets(that of course he knows will come in) the bookie says \\"Why don't you just bet on the Bears to win the NFC in 1963!\\" There was no NFC in 1963. Just the NFL and the AFL. At another point in the book he makes a reference to the Dallas Spurs as a basketball team in the early 60's. I'm not sure who he was referring to. There was an ABA team called the Dallas Chapparals that started in 1967 and later became the San Antonio Spurs,but I could'nt find a team called the Dallas Spurs anywhere. Small little nits in what is surely King's magnum opus.
B005R4255C|5.0|WOW!!! Kevin Antunes did a beautiful job - added a lot of new sounds, but Michael's voice and soul always stand out. I can't imagine how tremendous the Cirque de Soleil production will be, but hope it follows Michael's \\"always first, bigger, better\\" in whatever he did. I'll find out when I see it in Kansas City in February - can't wait!!! Thanks to all involved with the production of this CD; definitely a must for all MJ fans!
B0053VKP8S|4.0|When I first tested this DAC I thought it was great and promptly ordered a second one. However I have had serious problems with both units subsequently. I used them on the coaxial output from an ASUS motherboard, 48 kbps, stereo SPDIF. Both units would periodically lose sync, and instead of muting as they should do, they output full scale digital random noise. If you have a powerful amplifier this could easily blow your Loud Speaker. Another decoder, a Sony digital preamp, plays perfectly on the same SPDIF sream even when the D3 is outputting noise. I reported the problem to the manufactures support. So far I have had no satisfactory explanation or replacement.<br /><br />UPDATE: 3/5/12<br /><br />I was able to get the second unit exchanged by the vendor and it did turn out then to be reliable. I eventually got an admission from FiiO that some units did have the problem I described. They said \\"In theory,some times,maybe the input digital can not been knowed by D3\\". They have now replaced my first faulty unit quite graciously. It is an excellent little audio DAC. Now strongly reccommended.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/13/12<br /><br />The replacement unit from FiiO has started to fail after about a week. It now \\"spitch's\\" full scale noise when coming into sync. I amend my rating to say it is an excellent unit if, like one of the two I have, you get one that works correctly.
1439153663|5.0|I've read it twice, it's that good!  I enjoy novels with historical content and this one was well researched.  Both Belle and Lavinia captured me in their story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is King's best book since The Stand- a real page turner!  The butterfly effect exists, and it provides some very interesting twists and turns to the plot.  The only fault I can find with this book is that I couldn't put it down and, consequently, finished reading it too fast.  It would be nice to be able to go back in time about 96 hours and read it all over again.  If you are a Stephen King fan, this is one you've got to read!
1451648537|4.0|One third of the book covers the personal aspect of Steve Jobs.  The rest is more about the work of Steve Jobs in which it is Apple Computers.  I would recommend the book to people who are interested in the field of technology.

0307887960|5.0|I have struggled to lose weight for the last 20 years and nothing seemed to work.  I would lose a few pounds and then no more.  I tried everything. After age 60 I felt this was going to be the way I would be.  I still continued to try but my heart wasn't in it anymore.  I can't remember what induced me to try this, but, WOW. I have been losing steady.  I have lost 16lbs.  We are retired and eat out alot socially, where I don't always have control over what I eat. but I just get right back in the swing the next day. We also went on two vacations during this time.  I know I would have lost more if my lifestle was different but I am happy with this way of doing the Dukan.

0465011047|4.0|Amazing story and well delivered.  The last vestige of Communisim on the planet and it should not last if the truth is told.  The Dear Leader and his Son (and hopefully it ENDS right THERE) have destroyed a culture and a people.  They should just fade away and 'let their people go'. What is so surprising is the constant flow of 'believers' who return from progress and prosperity from overseas (namely Japan) only to be inprisoned by the Culture of Corruption. Otherwise known as the Norks.  A cleptrocracy if there ever was one.  The Koreans in the north deserve better.  Much better.  Good book, quick delivery.
B005HS00XW|2.0|This is slow and sad, almost dirge like.  It does not show the mischievous qualities of the Secret Garden performance of the 1990s.  The female vocalist in Don't Give Up is not in the same league as Kate Bush or Paula Cole and it feels awkward and lacking in chemistry.  Big disappointment

B005HSG3TC|5.0|I bought this case sight-unseen when I ordered my [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi]] a few months ago. After 10 days of extensive use, the case is holding up great. It looks good and meets my needs perfectly. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The Kindle Fire snaps into the case with a nice, tight fit. There are no visible straps holding the Kindle Fire in place. The fit is really clean. The speakers, earphone jack and charging jack are accessible through openings in the case.<br />- The case feels good in your hand. It has a rubberized finish, so there is enough friction that you're not likely to drop it. The case is not heavy at all.<br />- The cover is very light. Here I'm not talking about the entire case, just the cover that comes in contact with the Kindle Fire screen. Some reviewers have criticized this feature on the grounds that it is \\"flimsy\\". Personally, I think this is a matter of personal preference. The cover is lightweight and therefore a little flexible. If you're looking for a very stiff cover, then this case isn't right for you. I find that the cover provides ample protection while not adding bulk.<br />- The cover opens completely. When the cover is completely open, it's actually in the back and out of sight. This means you're looking only at the Kindle Fire with just a small bit of the case showing around it. For me, this is great because I don't want it to be too bulky.<br />- The cover converts into a stand. I have not had any of the problems some of the other reviewers have had with this feature. In fact, it seems like a pretty simple and easy way to watch videos without holding the Kindle Fire.<br />- The band stays out of the way. When the cover is open, the band snaps around the back of the cover, completely out of the way.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The cover picks up a little bit of dust. The inside of the cover (the side that comes in contact with the Kindle Fire screen) is a felt-like surface. This picks up a minor amount of dust. I've been able to brush it away, though, so this has only been a minor problem.<br />- Limited colors and designs. At the time of this review, there are only four colors available. I have the graphite version, which is fine. I would have liked a few more color options, though.been able to brush it away, though, so this has only been a minor problem.  - Limited colors and designs.

B005IUB4RU|2.0|5 stars for including the live CD 2.  The mastering of the 1st CD isn't bad (I have the earlier Japanese CD to compare to).  But like at least one other reviewer mentioned: THE LAST SONG ON CD 1 IS CHOPPED IN HALF !!  Unforgivable, but I only bought this for the live CD anyway.  And why did they change the cover?  Nothing wrong with the original IMO, which is better than this one.  There are also \\"bits\\" of something at the end of tracks 5 and 7 that shouldn't be there.  As for disc 2, kind of bright actually.  They could have brought up the low end a little more.  Also, there are these annoying gaps present between each track that shouldn't exist.  (Like what most MP3 players do: insert a gap in between each track.)  I guess no one bothered to listen to the finished product.

B004LWZW8I|2.0|One thing is certain about \\"Immortals\\"; it doesn't relate the traditional Greek myth about the noble-born hero Theseus, future ruler of Athens.  Instead, it's about an illegitimately born (as a result from rape!) Greek hero Theseus (Henry Cavill) who is destined to battle the utterly ruthless King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) for the ultimate weapon of mass destruction, the Epirus Bow, and to protect Greece from his bloodthirsty conquest.  Therefore, the main plot is painfully simple, but the movie's execution of it is murky, illogical, and brainlessly savage.<br /><br />Personally, I would have preferred the straightforward telling of the conventional Theseus myth, which certainly has enough drama, adventure, fantasy, tension, and passion to satisfy almost any cinema enthusiast.  I don't understand why any action director wouldn't follow this route.  Instead, we once again witness \\"300\\"-style graphic mutilations, outrageous headgear and armour, and portentous prophecies that ultimately seem pretentious and ridiculous.  Cavill's Theseus is appropriately courageous, resolute, and self-sacrificing.  However, he is eventually overwhelmed by the filthy tide of dismemberings, stabbings, lacerations, and other tortures the supporting cast and he himself dishes out and endures.  Furthermore, Rourke's Hyperion overshadows Theseus and the whole movie with his unquenchable savagery, especially when his henchmen fail him, which they inevitably do.  It really doesn't make sense to be lethally P.O.'d enough at a henchman who is unsuccessful, especially when the henchman's failure is not really his fault and you may need that henchman in the future.<br /><br />To some degree, the panoramic cinematography and the constant parade of sculpted, athletic bodies (both men and women) compensates for \\"Immortals\\"'s \\"warrior porn\\".  That especially goes for the luscious oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto), who aids Theseus with her prophecies and obligingly (through a stunt double, I just learned) displays her stunning back nudity by disrobing to share an intimate moment with our cursed/blessed hero.  But pretty pictures can only take you so far.  A movie, even a mythological fantasy, must have narrative coherence and integrity.  However, even people familiar with Greek mythology (as I am) will be lost at sea trying to figure out who's who and whether they're a mortal or a god.  Well, I at least figured out that the charaters wearing the golden armor were the Olympian gods, but with the exception of Zeus (Luke Evans) and Athena (Isabel Lucas), I couldn't tell them apart.  Likewise, Theseus's and King Hyperion's respective warriors were interchangeable, shield-banging, testosterone-fueled beefcake, except for maybe that brute in the Minotaur armor who battles Theseus for the bow.  In fact, the only \\"normal\\" person in the movie was the old man (John Hurt), who tutored Theseus as a youth in the arts of combat and, as I found out afterwords on Wikipedia and not from the movie, was Zeus in mortal disguise.<br /><br />\\"Immortals\\" is illogical and inconsistent in other ways.  For example, Zeus proclaims and vows that the gods will not directly interfere in mortal affairs, but they do just that when Theseus and his army confront not just Hyperion, but also the \\"Titans\\" (snicker) whom he frees from Tartarus with the bow.  Also, when Hyperion wrests the bow (which fires its own nuclear-strength energy arrows) from Theseus, why doesn't he use it to destroy Theseus's fortress and spare his army from entering the bottleneck where Theseus's army lies in wait?  With the bow, why does Hyperion need an army at all?  Furthermore, Phaedra owes her precognitive skills to her virginity; if she loses her virginity, she loses her power to view the future.  However, even after her night of passion with Theseus, Phaedra still seems capable of predicting danger for Theseus.  Returning back to the \\"Titans\\", they seemed like normal-sized men.  For Zeus's sake, Titans are giants, as largeas the four colossal statues in the movie.  I thought THEY would come to life as the Titans.<br /><br />Sigh!  Oh well, \\"Immortals\\" will play well to frat boys, jocks, and other macho types, as well as to sadomasochistic iron bondage fetishists.  But serious mythological scholars and other sensible, logical people will shake their heads in disbelief at \\"Immortals\\"'s blood-drenched, bloated spectacle.in the movie.

B005NF2UE6|2.0|I had such high hopes for this album. Considering all of their previous efforts were flawless, 5-star albums, I for sure thought this one would follow suit. Wrong. Nickelback carved their success with up-tempo hits like \\"How You Remind Me\\", \\"Never Again\\", \\"Too Bad\\", and \\"Someday.\\"  Then they released their single \\"Photograph\\" from their stellar effort \\"All The Right Reasons\\".  It was a mellow, mid-tempo tune which was a radio-friendly success. It wasn't a bad tune; just new ground for Nickelback. Fast forward to the \\"Dark Horse\\" debut. Now, instead of only one contemporary song, we had about 4-5 (i.e. \\"Gotta Be Somebody\\", \\"I'd Come For You\\", \\"Never Gonna Be Alone\\", \\"If Today Was Your Last Day\\" and the country driven \\"This Afternoon\\"). This is where Nickelback switched gears and decided they were going to try this different route and maybe gain more fans. It worked, but what about the loyal fans? What happened to the hard core, gripping rock tunes that we fell in love with?  \\"State\\", \\"Silver Side Up\\", \\"The Long Road\\" were the epitomes of rock. That is what Nickelback is so good at. Now we have \\"Here and Now\\". It might as well be considered soft-rock contemporary with a few rock fillers. I fear we lost the real Nickelback. They have become a band that just wants to please radio, regardless the lack of creativity and passion for the songs. Even the \\"hard rock\\" songs on \\"Here and Now\\" are predictable and it's nothing we haven't heard before. I will always be a NB fan and will jam to all of their albums; except this one.

B002IFT1ZA|3.0|As I don't have cable TV anymore, I watch TV/movies on my computer, rent DVDs, or borrow them - many from the library. For this show, I borrowed it from a friend, as I couldn't afford to buy it, and even if I could, I certainly wouldn't watch it more than once. Read on to learn why.  If I still had Netflix, I would have gotten it from them, but they p.o.'d me for the last time over not having movies I wanted, bad quality DVDs, splitting their services up, then reuniting them, and then the price increases. However, that's not what this review is about.  So... I watched the complete first season of The Game of Thrones over a weekend that I had a lot of ironing to do. This was a good thing. I could go from one episode to the next without waiting and forgetting what had happened. However, as an HBO produced show, I was sooooooooo disappointed!   George R.R. Martin must be steaming mad about the script writing on this HBO series! They really botched it up. The acting is only marginal for many of the characters and character development is sorely lacking. It's overtly sexual in nature (as is so much HBO content), which isn't necessary to tell a good story, and way too much gratuitous violence as well, which also is not necessary to get one's point across. IMO, I think they had to add in all the sex and violence just to sell it, considering how badly written the program is. It seems a lot of information is just plain missing, as far as background goes. I really hate badly written and badly acted shows, whether they be live or filmed.  I'm going to read the books instead of bothering to watch the rest of series. Hopefully, I'll get more into this fantasy fiction series through the printed word.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Because this bio was actually solicited by Jobs, the author had unlimited access to internal company documents and the key to interviewing pretty much anyone he wanted to. He's able to relate fascinating, intimate one-on-one conversations between Jobs and Woz, Jobs and Gates, Jobs and Ellison, Jobs and his wife etc. and to reveal the process behind the Apple II, the Mac, the iMac and all the other iDevices, as well as the board room negotiations behind company policies and decisions. My favorite intimate detail is when Jobs is recovering from a liver transplant and refuses to put on an oxygen mask because he doesn't like the design.<br /><br />Isaacson doesn't shy away from Jobs' faults, including his rudeness, his obsession with control, and his weird take on being a rebel, which I thought was best exemplified by his refusal to have a personal parking spot in front of Apple HQ, but always parking the the handicapped spot (which one assumes was right where his spot would have been).<br /><br />In the end, though, Isaacson goes along with Jobs' own self image - that he was a guy who changed the world by creating some really cool stuff and ways to market the stuff. I think this is accurate.<br /><br />Finally, Mr. Isaacson (if you are the type to read these and have the patience to go through them all) \\"Both Sides Now\\" is NOT Joni Mitchell's best song!

The bottom line is that it does not function as a stand only as a cover protector.

B005IZLPME|5.0|This is a great movie.  I saw it in the theater in 2D and recently bought it in 3D from Amazon. It is great in 3D!  If you like the Marvel Comic theater presentations, you will love this movie.

1563894696|4.0|First I want to address the low reviews.  EVERYONE is entitled to their own opinions.  If someone doesn't like it, that's their business.  But there are MANY different versions of Batman...from the campy 60's to the dark modern feel.  Not everyone will like all the versions.  This version isn't completely campy and isn't completely dark.  It's kind of a mixture (but a mixture done well).  The art isn't as high quality as Year One but it sets out to do a job and does it well.  Art is like versions of Batman...Not everyone will like all kinds.  Some people like this art some don't.  I find the art to be just what the story needed; a somewhat cartoonish yet not corny style.    The dialog wasn't very in depth but that added to the mystery.  The art and dialog gave you just enough to keep up with the storyline and keep you guessing.  BTW, I'm someone who complains about people being too dumb to not understand complicated storylines such as The Matrix movies.  So I'm not someone who only likes simple spoon fed storylines but I still say this was a very well done storyline.  It's not extremely complicated but it's not as simple as other Batman stories.  Jeph Loeb swung at this and hit a home run.  Bottom line: There are so many Batman stories out there and most of them are different from each other so the key to enjoying most of them is to take them for what they are and not to compare them to your favorite ones.
B001FB4W16|5.0|I started watching True Blood on HBO after reading the books. I have to admit I loved it! I had to remember that the books and the HBO series will not be the same, but overall I was hooked and never stopped watching. All these other vampire shows have nothing on True Blood. Who can't love Sookie Stackhouse! Bill! Eric! Tara! I could go on and on, but the bottom line is True Blood is the best show out there of all the vampire shows. The cast chemistry is great and cannot wait until the new season to start... Again, it is my opinion that I love this show. This show has and continues to get me through my depression and loneliness... I call it my escape just like reading...
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Our little ones have been SLOW to get into this storyline! Its a little slow & scary in the beginning (for our busy busy 2-3yrs olds) & they kind of lose interest in it. However, it is a CLASSIC Disney movie & us oldies have always really enjoyed it!!!
B0034G4P7Q|1.0|As a computer scientist, this movie was boring.  The whole idea of how Facebook was born is interesting, but nothing special about it.  If you would like to waste your time or have nothing better to do, then I suggest you watch it.  I wasn't even able to finish the movie because I was bored out of my mind. It's almost pointless and not worth watching.  However, I did enjoy when Mark had the students race to see who would make it to Facebook (the drinking shots part).  Nonetheless, a waste of time, once again.   Plot-wise...it lost me.  Yeah, it was a legal battle, friendships were broken and whatnot, but Housewives of Beverly Hills on Bravo are much more entertaining.   If you have time on your hands and have nothing to do...or you want to learn where FB came from then watch it! But be warned!  :)  PS.  I unsubscribed from Mark after watching this movie.
0321543726|2.0|The author seems to have originally begun writing a book akin to it's title \\"Principles and Practice USING c++\\", and then at some point decided it would be more marketable if it were also accessible to complete beginners of c++ programming and so tacked on a couple chapters in the beginning even though they teach only the most basic features of c++. For the remainder of the book, a thorough treatment (fully developed explanation and useful exercises along the way) of the more advanced features of c++ seems to be an obstacle to the author in pursuit of his main interest which is more theoretical. His manner of dealing with this obstacle is to provide brief and randomly interspersed explanations so that hopefully a new programmer may also follow along the development strategies and usages of the advanced features that are being utilized but have not been systematically described in their own right. Perhaps this is good enough for a beginner who is studying under a good instructor who ultimately will be the real teacher of the c++ features. But such instructor would probably be even more successful without using any textbook at all. This book simply should not have been pitched as a \\"solid introduction to the C++ programming language\\".

B004UG7RQ0|1.0|Really wanted this to work as a versatile solution vs buying a specialized AMI 3.5mm adapter from Audi. Unfortunately the MMI system doesn't detect a device plugged in with this cable on my 2012 Audi A5 3G MMI w/nav. The description on Amazon states the cable is not compatible with VW cars, but doesn't mention anything about Audis (which utilizes a Multi Media Interface not found on the VW line of cars). After checking the CableJive website, it stated \\"The dockBoss is not compatible with VW or Audi's stock iPod/iPhone systems up to and including 2011 models.\\" I have a 2012 car, but had this been more explicit I think I would've erred on the side of caution and not purchased it. But hopefully people can learn from my mistake!

B003MC5N28|5.0|This book sort of sneaks up on you.  The well written story draws you in, and does a good job of establishing a fascinating world where pain and suffering has been removed from society.  The author does a good job of supporting the premise with solid back story, and plot development.  The main character is especially well done and plausible.  I wasn't sure what to expect as the end of the fast moving book neared.  I worried that the author may not be able to pull it all together for a satisfying ending.  Without giving too much away I will say that the ending leaves some interpretation up to the reader, making this book something unique and special, if not easy to classify.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|I wish I could sit here and give Unknown a solid review based on the fact it sounded *extremely* appealing to me based on the description, but sadly -due to the predictable and underwhelming nature of the storyline- the movie slowly sinks to a level of mediocrity as it rolls forward.  I mean, really!  It starts off on a REALLY positive note.  While riding a car down a busy city street in Germany, a man (Liam Neeson's character) sinks to the bottom of a lake, hits his head on the car window, and loses his memory.    From here, he eventually finds what he believes is his wife at a dinner party, and walks up to her and explains what's going on... unfortunately the woman doesn't recognize him... nor does the man standing next to his wife at the party who mysteriously happens to share the same name as Lian Neeson's character.  Talk about an intriguing way to begin a film!  However, it's soon discovered that the plotline doesn't move forward in a suspenseful or interesting kind of way at *all*.  Instead, we're introduced to mediocre car chase segments that we've seen in thousands of other movies, a car falling and crashing from a building after sitting through several more minutes of unsatisfying storytelling, and eventually a bomb explosion that seems more appropriate for a James Bond film.  Certainly not the plot direction *I* was anticipating based on Liam Neeson's memory loss portions of the movie (which many of us eagerly believed would entice us like never before- at least *I* did).  I dunno... some people might find Unknown appealing, but the disappointingly flawed storyline totally wastes a golden opportunity for an interesting shot at something original and enticing if you ask me.  I sure hope Liam Neeson isn't losing his touch as a fantastic main character in suspense films either- this is the second less than spectacular film I've seen him star in this year (can't remember the other one, but I *did* write a review for it back over the summer).
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie.  It's a true masterpiece in modern times.  I highly recommend it.  It is like poetry in motion.Amazing story,acting,music,  graphics and thought.

I like the snow ,golden sunlight in opening sequence (just to not give away too much to those who haven't seen it).  my favourite spirit is the candle,very cool how they did it.  Myself,fiance and family love it.  And we shall cherish this film version forever,year after year every christmas,and even just during the normal part of the year.

0393064476|4.0|Lucretius and his surprisingly modern poem On The Nature of Things have a great champion in Stephen Greenblatt, author of this mostly fascinating book about how the poem was rescued from almost certain oblivion and the ways in which its sudden availability after 1000 years may have influenced Renaissance era artists and scholars. Greenblatt makes what may be a too strong case for the importance of the poem, but the book is captivating nonetheless, especially the sections on the ancient world when polytheists, Christians and Jews were living together in ever decreasing harmony.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I am probably the single worst person on this Earth to write an unbiased Toy Story review.  I was really the perfect age for the Toy Story films, they were in a lot of ways my big cultural touchstones growing up.  To see Toy Story again after so many years is in a lot of ways a nostalgia trip and a remembrance to my childhood.  The film is a landmark in the animation field, the first feature-length digital animation ever made.  It is a technical masterpiece, and a guiding light to the modern era.  In a lot of ways, its also very deep.  Toy Story has always been a series about MORTALITY, and coming to grips with, well, death.  Most children's films skirt this subject entirely, but Toy Story really tackles it head on.  Buzz Lightyear has to come to grips with the fact that he is a toy, showing all of us children that we must find a place in the world.  In addition, it teaches us friendship, to respect people who are different (the misfit toys), and the pitfalls of jealousy.  I cannot describe what this film means to me, in so many ways it defined the person I am today and the morals I have.  Watching it now some of the animation is bizarre (especially the dog), but that can easily be overlooked by the shear quality of the performances and depth of the story.  It is probably one of Pixar's greatest films and continues to be a favorite of children today.  But to talk about just the first Toy Story is to undermine its cultural importance, because as a trilogy it is designed to turn my generation, the kids who grew up with Toy Story, into jelly.  The last 15 minutes of Toy Story 3 made me cry like a baby, and I am not ashamed to admit that.  As cultural icons, the characters of Toy Story live on, and Pixar's work will be forever judged to the Toy Story series.  They are remarkable films and tremendously moving.  Thank you, Pixar.

1250004349|5.0|There are so many stories of tragedy and triumph from World War II. Sarah's Key sheds light on one of France's biggest shames from that period of time - the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup which occurred in July 1942. Over several days in 1942, the French police, by order of the Germans, rounded up over 13,000 Parisian Jews and held them in the Velodrome without food, water, or sufficient washrooms for several days before shipping them off to a concentration camp in France and ultimately to their deaths in Auschwitz. I have studied the Holocaust in school and have familial ties to the monstrosities that occurred in Eastern Europe during that time, but I had never heard of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup and how French soldiers, NOT Germans, were responsible for what happened there. This book was an eye opener. Along with the factual information regarding dates and logistics of the roundup, Sarah's Key is a work of fiction that ties two families together. That of Sarah Starzyksky, a 10yr old girl affected by the roundup, and Julia Jarmond, an American journalist working in Paris in 2002 who is assigned to write an article for a magazine commemorating the 60th anniversary of the roundup. This book is haunting and compelling with twists and turns along the way. It's hard to put down and impossible to forget. I think that is the author's primary intention, to shed light on the past so we remember and so we are not doomed to repeat it.
B001HN6922|5.0|This is a good movie even if a bit long for toddlers & too violent for some of our sensitive little ones who dont understand the SPY vs HERO theory yet!

Parents should DEFINITELY sit with their young kids when they view it & explain the more serious & scary parts! Our children grow up too fast these days anyway, lets dont push them more!
B005I64U5C|4.0|I know I'm in the minority, but I actually liked this movie!<br /><br />I've been a huge fan of the Green Lantern comics since I was a kid (I'm 50) and was thrilled to see it come to life on the big screen.  I felt it lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />Many of these reviews are comparing Green Lantern to other comic-based movies.  Is that fair?  It's a movie, in it's own right.  We watch THIS movie, and not four others side-by-side.  Was this as good as Iron Man?  No.  Better than Daredevil?  Yes.  How does it compare to the X-Men movies?  Better than some, worse than others.  Does it really matter?!  If we're going to rate it based on comparisons, let's really compare it to all the movies out there.<br /><br />If you didn't know who Green Lantern was before going to the movie, you definitely got some back story, some adventure, some action, some very good digital effects.  What more do you want?  Could it have been better?  Yes.  Could it have been worse?  Yes.<br /><br />I had fun, I enjoyed it, and the telling point of this, I think, is that I enjoyed it enough to want to own a copy for my home to watch it again.<br /><br />This particular version of the movie is the Blu-ray 3D version.  I happen to be a tremendous fan of 3D and was delighted with the effects in this film.<br /><br />As to the digital/streaming/ultra-violet crap...others have written much about this.  WB should probably be fined for false advertising.  Fortunately, my purchase was not made for this particular venture.  In fact, I'd rather they left it off altogether and saved me $5 on my purchase.

It is very light and doesn't have that heavy magnet feel to the flap cover.  I think  this is a good thing because I'd rather not add any weight.  It's a simple shell with a nice grippy feel to it.  Good quality for the price (I got mine when they were $29.99).  The only problem with it is that on even slightly uneven surfaces, it has trouble setting up right to work as a stand.

B005VGWT2K|5.0|\\"Here comes the sun....the smile's returning to their faces.\\" -- George Harrison, 1969<br /><br />\\"I want to tell you, my head is filled with things to say.\\" -- George Harrison, 1966<br /><br />This is the documentary Beatle fans and George Harrison fans have prayed for and long awaited! As others have noted, I, too could have happily watched both installments at one time. Seeing it broken into 2 separate parts had an advantage in that it gave me something to look forward to wataching. This is a brilliant work covering the life and artwork of George Harrison, artist extraordinaire in his multi-faceted glory.<br /><br />I've said all along that George was all about love. From the time George made his presence known and felt; from the time he was placed in the loving arms of Louise French Harrison and she saw her own intensity looking back at her; from the time Harold Sr. first set eyes on George and his only sister and two older brothers welcomed this \\"new little Harrison,\\" as Louise French Harrison would later describe George and other new arrivals (nieces, nephews and grandchildren) with much love. Harold Sr. and Louise French were from all accounts a very loving couple who were nuturing to their 4 children. George, surrounded by love from the beginning would live full circle by making a final request that people \\"love one another.\\"<br /><br />This documentary portrays the REAL George Harrison and does not degenerate into idolatry. George is shown in many moods, some less than cheery and shown warts, wrinkles, atrocious perm days and all.<br /><br />George's fellow Wilburys and former Beatle bandmate Paul McCartney and wife Olivia provide the best interviews. I just wish more Harrison family members had been a part of this stellar documentary. George's sister, also named Louise has banged on the drum for her brother for many years. In fact, George was the first Beatle to cross the Atlantic, coming to America in 1963 to visit his only sister.<br /><br />Most, if not all Harrison fans find George's view of religions very interesting. It has been documented that Louise French Harrison, herself Catholic had George baptized in March of 1943 when he was 1 month old. In 1965 George and Ravi Shankar met and during that time, George introduced the world at large to Eastern music and was exploring his philosophies and religious expression. His Catholic roots never left him; a lovely statue of Mother Mary graced his property at Friar Park.<br /><br />Louise, George's only sister would say in an early April 2011 interview that it was a shock to her to discover that the \\"real world\\" wasn't as honest as Harold Sr. and Louise French were and not everybody lived up to their high standard of honesty. George too lived by that credo and he took things to heart deeply and passionately.<br /><br />George was also fun. He liked cool cars and was an avid Formula One Fan. His sister had a serious Dodge Dart when he first came to visit her in 1963 when she was living in Benton, Illinois. He had a brilliant, dry, droll wit. He loved nature and demonstrated a very nurturing side, which was a Louise French trait. His passion for gardening was a gift from Harold Sr. and Louise French. George was an intensely curious and interested person, seeking information and trying to make sense out of the world in which he lived.<br /><br />George had beautiful wavy hair, courtesy of Harold Sr.; the deep-set Harold Sr. eyes, but he had the burning Louise intensity that never once left his eyes. Pictures of George as an infant and as a very young child show his ubiquitous intensity, which never left him at any time. It could be a tad unnerving to see such intensity radiating from one so young. It was a trait that never left him. George resembled Harold Sr. from the eyes up. From the nose down, he was Louise French Harrison all over again and his brother Peter was almost a double of Harold Sr.! Harold Jr. looked more French than Harrison; he and George inherited theirmaternal grandfather's tall, lean frame. Lou was a Franco-Harrison creation as was George. You get to appreciate these things all the more in the book AND in the documentary. Paul McCartney even says in the book that George had a lot of Louise French's character and personality in him. Louise definitely left her stamp on George! Louise even said in the newsletter that she always thought George looked like her dad, John French Sr.)<br /><br />Louise French Harrison lent her voice to the George Harrison Official Fan Club Newsletter from 1965-1969. It is plain that Louise loved George and his siblings and in her column, each Harrison child is included and given his or her place under Here Comes the Sun.<br /><br />Olivia is a beautiful gracious lady and she discusses her life with George and some of the road bumps they hit along the way. She does so with grace, tact and aplomb. At no time does she resort to tawdry tale-bearing and finger pointing. Despite all they had been through together, they raised a good son and Olivia loved George, warts, problems, atrocious perms, infidelity and all. Dhani, their son resembles George and his maternal grandmother who unfortunately died 8 years before he was born. Clearly George and Olivia loved and cared about each other and again, to Olivia's credit, she is tactful and discreet when certain questions crop up. That reflects well on her and speaks to good.<br /><br />Readers walk the Long & Winding Road with George from his early days until his untimely death in 2001. I love the way George could see humor in himself AND his fellow Beatles, as evidenced in his laughing at a Beatle video. The interviews make a good thing even better and I thank the kind person who made it possible for me to watch this until I am able to buy this dvd.<br /><br />George Harrison has given the gift of his beautiful voice to many. I knew a child with Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of autism. She was a MAJOR Beatles fan and George was her favorite. This child, like so many children with autism spectrum issues was a late talker. Once she acquired speech and an awareness of music, she found her voice in the Beatles. She would let George \\"talk\\" for her in that she would quote Harrison lyrics and lyrics from Beatle songs to get a point/message across. This later segued into richer, developed speech. As I said about the book, George Harrison's music and his natural, yet childlike grace of sorts reached countless many. He has a large following of fans with autism, as do the Beatles as a group. Beatle fans with autism is a demographic that is not at all rare or unusual.<br /><br />George's humor comes through time and again. His sardonic wit after that crackpot broke into his home at the tail end of 1999 was evidenced when he said in re the crackpot: \\"well, he sure wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys.\\" He had made peace with his life; he was surrounded by love every step of the way. George during his post-1999 brush with death had a very peaceful and serene look about him; his eyes, always intense like those of Louise French Harrison included an inner peace, like his 1968 song \\"The Inner Light.\\" He disclosed his peace and the fact that he was ready to let go to Olivia, who bore this with dignity and grace.<br /><br />A beautiful tribute to George and how meaningful his life has been in the eyes of those who knew him and others who love his art/music. George has brought more people closer to God. In fact, my church, which is a Catholic church uses George songs, some of which like \\"Dear One\\" are beautiful prayers set to music for our prayer meetings, Bible studies and discussion groups. George is, as we say \\"a parishioner by proxy\\" because his beautiful music and his open heart and mind have set a good example to countless people.<br /><br />Bless George, George's family and all who have traveled down the Long & Winding Road with George.<br /><br />You will also want to read [[ASIN:1889899054 Before He WasFab : George Harrison's First American Visit]], which was co-authored by George's sister, Louise.ss of music, she found her voice in the Beatles.

B004EPZ08E|5.0|Interesting formula: Take Hitchcock's [[ASIN:B0002HOERG Strangers on a Train]] from way back in the 50s, add in equal amounts of Danny DeVito's 1987 spoof of that movie called [[ASIN:B005AIRCBW Throw Momma From a Train]], then mix 'em both with a whopping helping of [[ASIN:B001UV4XEW Hangover]] humor and that sets the stage for the dark comedy Horrible Bosses. But it wouldn't be the complete movie that it is without the absolutely perfect cast who act their own parts out with perfection, but also exhibit a chemistry together that is unparalleled in any movie that I've recently seen.<br /><br />And hats off to the writer/producer/director team for putting together a familiar story line that is ultimately pulled off with originality, and most importantly, hilarity from start to finish. The humor is often rude, crude and probably a bit more than the average Jennifer Aniston movie fan bargained for. However I give Aniston a ton of credit for for adding to the success of this film by effortlessly making her character believable, funny and shocking. After all the goody two-shoes roles that I'm used to seeing Aniston in, watching her in a \\"bad girl\\" role only made the movie more refreshing and entertaining.<br /><br />Colin Farrell was another great cast as one of the Horrible Bosses. He's transformed into a pot-bellied, balding drug addict and almost unrecognizable a la Tom Cruise in [[ASIN:B001H5X7KC Tropic Thunder]]. Farrell is Jason Sudeikis' boss. Kevin Spacey is Jason Bateman's boss, and Spacey is a natural crass meanie. Then Anistion is a the boss of a comical Charlie Day. The individual bosses deal out their own styles of harassment on the job and it's all darkly hysterical. So the three guys are given the notion that they could take each other's bosses out to make their lives easier. The events following this brainstorm of an idea are equally dark and laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />If you're looking for laughs you'll find them o'plenty in Horrible Bosses. Perhaps over the top at times (but that's what the movie is going for), Horrible Bosses is one of the best movies that I've seen in 2011.hat's what the movie is going for), Horrible Bosses is one of the best movies that I've seen in 2011.

1451648537|4.0|Wow! very interesting! I've worked in the valley for many years and had heard about Steve's mercurial personality. That said, I knew many, many people who wanted to work at Apple. Well written and seemed to pull no punches. Hard to believe Steve didn't want to review/edit prior to publication!   The book presented a very full picture of one of 20th century America's truly innovative entrepeneurs.  [[ASIN:1451648537 Steve Jobs]]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There isn't much I can say about the Hunger Games that hasn't already been said, it was just a great book and I couldn't put it down. Katniss is more complicated as a main character than she first appears, but it is her love for her sister and the fight she has inside of her that make her someone worth rooting for, despite some of the questionable choices she makes. Can't wait to see the movie!
0545123275|4.0|Wolf meets girl. Girl falls in love with wolf. Sounds like a pretty typical paranormal teen romance story. Well, it didn't turn out how I had expected. I'd read some snarky comments about this book, and I was expecting something along the lines of the much-maligned Twilight. I mean, come on: ANOTHER teenage werewolf story / adolescent romance? Yuck. Maybe because my expectations were so low, I was very pleasantly surprised. Yes, I actually really liked Shiver. I liked the fact that the main female character, Grace, had a backbone and didn't wilt away like some pale-hearted wallflower when she wasn't with `her man' (or wolf or whatever). I liked Sam's gentle spirit and his tendency to describe things through musical prose. There were phrases and vivid imagery that I'd describe as `poetic', and the dialogue was well written. Yup, I enjoyed this story. So there.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|10Bucks is a really good price for this movie. I recommend purchasing now, unless you can find it cheaper elsewhere online (google it). I wish I wouldve known it was $10 on Amazon, then I wouldnt have wasted $19.95 on it at Columbiahouse(dot)com.
0060936223|1.0|I found this book to be EXTREMELY boring. I would've stopped reading it about 20 pages in, but I kept hoping it would get better; and alas, it did not. This book might be better for someone who is in their 40's and up, but if you are in your 20's-30's or younger--forget about it. I knew a lot of the historical characters that Patti talked about in her book, but it didn't really matter to me. The writing seemed very scattered and discombobulated... So in short... Save your money.
141694737X|5.0|A great little interactive book (lift the flaps) for the young reader -listener- that can't yet follow a full story with many words. My kids loved it and we had to read it over and over again.
B000TGJ8CQ|1.0|Clear proof that not all Philip K. Dick short stories have enough substance for a feature film. Desperately short on creativity, Next takes a clever original concept (precognitive masquerades as a low-level Vegas magician) and promptly spins it into a pulpy blob of action goop. Along the way it mixes in a roomful of to-the-letter FBI stereotypes, a painfully shoehorned love story and a weirdly under-explained cell of nuke wielding French terrorists. Even the mindless action scenes are toothless, as Nic Cage's future-weary prophet sees every bullet coming before the gun's even drawn, basically playing the part of Neo without the presence of an Agent Smith to counter his moves. Nic Cage is his usual anti-charismatic self, old and burnt-out at a glance, but the real surprise isn't how low Cage sinks - it's how far Julianne Moore is willing to follow. Both players imbue their roles with such a wooden lack of emotion that I wouldn't be surprised to learn the entire film was comprised of first takes. Dull, passionless and predictable, it's a futile waste of ninety minutes.
0824835921|5.0|I initially read the free first chapter of this book after reading some raving reviews and after just reading this first chapter I had the first few Kanji's embedding permanently in my brain, saying I was impressed was an understatement so I bought the book!  I have not been disappointed! You have to really understand the method involved in learning Kanji this way though so it's important you study the text before you jump straight to the Kanji as its about building up your knowledge of reading Kanji slowly, understanding the components of how each Kanji is made up so some characters are Kanji in their own right but some will be parts of other Kanji which come later in the book. The stories around the Kanji's make remembering them so much easier.   My only gripe is that this book is written by someone who knows alot about baseball, coming from the UK, a country that doesn't have baseball as a national sport, a couple of the stories I have read have been baseball related and have left me pretty much none the wiser lol but as you progress in the book you need to start making your own stories anyway so it was a good chance to practice this method.  Along with the fan website based on this book by Kanji Koohii which has a flashcard tool as part of its free membership to help you practice what you have learnt, this book has been invaluable in my learning of Kanji.  What this book does not teach you though is the pronunciation, just the meaning; as if you were Chinese who will then go on to learn the pronunciation, an important factor to know before purchasing this book.
1451627289|4.0|Mr. King has not lost his touch.  This book - 11/22/63 - really stood out as a great story with a gaggle of great characters.  The story line loses a bitof its momentum in the middle - around page 220-280 and then, picks up steam and charges forward.<br /><br />By the end, the story line contains folks whom the reader may be unhappy to let go of.  The main character - Jake/George is a heroic  type, and very likable gent. His girlfriend - Sadie is salt of the earth whom you know you have met in this life.<br /><br />This is a very good read. My only complaint was that the hard copy book is too heavy. (845 pages!)  It was hard to hold when I was reading in bed -  lying sideways. However, that is my only complaint.  My all time favorites of Mr. King's books are the Talisman and Duma Key.  This book is a good second to those, but perhaps not a five star!<br /><br />King conveyed at the end of the book, that he started writing this book in 1972, when he was teaching. He set it down because he felt he did not have enough time to do the research.  There does seem to be two separate books here. The energy of the first does not seem to match the energy of the ending book.<br /><br />But, that does not detract from the story nor the characters therein.
0399230033|5.0|Such a cute little book, with a cheeky little gorilla who helps his friends snuggle into the cozy zoo keepers bed. Lots of fun animals, cute ending, my kids love it and I don't tire of reading it again and again.

0393061310|3.0|I'm not a historian to debate the veracity of the events covered in this book.  The subject is interesting and provides a wealth of information to people interested in the ascent of civilization.    What surprises me, however, is that nobody seems to mind the below par writing style of the author.  Mississippi long sentences, poor punctuation, poor structure, repetition and so on, leave you often dazed and confused.    Any English writing teachers out there ?!

HE NEEDS A BETTER SONG WRITER OR SHOULD TRY WRITING HIS OWN MUSIC.  I TRIED HARD TO LISTEN TO THE ALBUM A SECOND TIME, HOPING IT WOULD GROW ON ME BUT IT DIDNT...CANT LISTEN ANY MORE...LOOKING FOWARD TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS FROM HIM...THE ONLY PLACE FOR HIM TO GO IS UP!! SORRY SCOTTY BUT LAURA A'S FIRST ALBUM BLOWS YOURS AWAY AND I VOTED FOR YOU ALL THE WAY THROUGH AI.  BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.

The whole family shuts the tv off now to listen to mom read, and beg for more then one chapter.  We have moved on to The Twits and other books written by Ronald Dahl.
B004EPYZTE|1.0|Warning:<br />Don't ever buy this blu-ray, because if you watch this in 3D, you'll realize that this movie has nothing coming out of the screen, so the 3D for this film makes it entirely pointless. The film has a horrendous script for it's genre, so it's nothing like the original, However the visual effects are great for this film, but this film is really insulting to all successful remakes, this film also has poorly edited action, and also it has horrendous acting, so I'm warning you don't buy this movie, if you do, it's a total waste of money.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|very good story throughout the entire movie. no slow downs or breaks, consistent all the way thru. not a boring second at all. 2 thumbs up
0553382152|5.0|This book is wonderful!  It gives hope and peace and fills the reader with heavenly joy.  I recommend it to everyone who wants a spiritual lift and peace of heart!  :)  I especially recommend it to anyone who is afraid of death or struggling with the death of a loved one.  I would also recommend it to anyone struggling with the meaning or purpose of their life.
0307891372|5.0|I don't buy game guides but decided to get this one based on other reviews. All I can say is, I'm glad that I did! Of course, you can find a wealth of free information online to help you through this HUGE game, but the guide makes an excellent supplemental resource (especially with character building, perks and leveling up). Highly recommended.
B006470HZ6|5.0|Face it. It's like anything else in life.  Watch it for yourself and see if you like it.  Quite frankly, I was stunned to see one star reviews because I absolutely love this show. However, it's not for everyone.  It gives a realistic perspective on human problems and dealing with those problems in the zombie apocalypse.  NOT for children or for those people desiring full blown action.  Go watch Resident Evil if that's the case.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|Very disipointed for the price. The groove on the back isn't deep enough to hold the stand up. However the hard shell is nice.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|I had high hopes after Endgame, which was the best album Megadeth had put out in a long, long time.  My hopes were that much higher given that Ellefson had rejoined and I learned that many of the tunes were written back in the Clash of the Titans day.  However, as soon as I put this CD in, I was immediately disappointed.  The writing and music are very derivative, monotonous, and just plain boring.  Megadeth has never been known for its killer choruses (with a few notable exceptions), but where are the trademark Mustaine riffs?  There are NO killer riffs on this album.  NONE.  Buy this album ONLY if you are a die-hard Megadeth fan, which I am, but I still have to call it like I see it.  For the moment, Megadeth has lost its edge.

B000M4RG42|5.0|Being a former Marine I am aware what those Marines went through.  I don't know if I could have handled it myself.  I had tears in my eyes at some points in the movie.  Every American, male or female, should see this movie and read the book by James Bradley.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|\\"Friends with Benefits\\", not only was funny, but the two leads, Justin and Mila, actually had chemistry on screen. They made it believable the connection and more. It was kind of like a modern version of \\"When Harry Met Sally\\", in how the characters first met and interacted the first 24hrs together. Another movie with a similar name, staring Ashton and Natalie, felt forced in their acting. Natalie was so monotone in her voice, that I thought she could take Ben Steins role from \\"Ferris Bueller\\" with how well she didn't change the tone in her voice throughout the movie. I mean she acted BETTER in the movie \\"Thor\\" than in \\"No Strings Attached\\".<br /><br />Anyway, my point is that \\"Friends with Benefits\\", was a very mature RomCom that really kept true to some realistic situations that most 20-somethings encounter. Where as \\"No Strings Attached\\" was like a low budget porn flick with really horrible \\"funny\\" verbal conversing between ALL the characters (they added all the funny scenes in the trailers/tv, so there was nothing funny to laugh at because everyone had seen the scenes over twenty times from the promotions they kept doing for months).<br /><br />I loved the scenes of Mila's character and her mother interacting, especially when she walks in on them banging and then is all \\"It's like the 70's, heeyyyy... it's all good\\", lol stuff like that is funny. But there were moments with some of the other characters that made this movie watchable. Also both Justin and Mila were very animated with their scenes, especially their faces, which made it even more funny to watch them together. Something that can't be found from the two leads in \\"No Strings Attached\\"; wish the director told them to use their faces more to express what their characters were feeling, even if it was horny feelings, it would have sold the idea of liking the movie better.<br /><br />I had to turn off \\"No Strings Attached\\", 40 minutes into the movie as well, which says a lot about the movie's storyline. I kept waiting for the tone of the actors voices to change and for the storyline to have something other than naked butts and grunts floating around on screen. At least in \\"Friends with Benefits\\", when there was naked'ness going on, they made it FUNNY! Even Justin had a scene on the toilet, naked and make it hilarious! (His role in \\"Bad Teacher\\" was way worse than any role he has ever had in acting, I feel so bad for that guy!).<br /><br />Anywoo, money is well spent when renting this movie. Don't buy it unless you LOVED this movie.the actors voices to change and for the storyline to have something other than naked butts and grunts floating around on screen.

B004RC8NUQ|1.0|I watched the movie 40 mins; in, hoping for SOMETHING to actually happen, but nothing. I've had more fun staring out a window watching snowflakes fall than seeing this movie.<br /><br />Also, whomever directed this movie needs to understand, no matter how bad a script is, if the actor can add depth to the voice and animate the face, it's more believe for the audience to ENJOY a the feature film. With that being said... this movie could have been better, it felt like the editing was rushed from how the scenes were cut as well. And there was so much naked'ness going on that it became a low budget porn (should of gotten the dreaded 'N-17' rating instead!). Natalie and Ashton didn't really hit the nail on the head with the sex scenes in making them lively. It fell too flat and was like watching two married people in their 80's having sex instead.<br /><br />No matter how good looking an actor is, if they can't act for the role, it won't matter in the end.<br /><br />These two actors can act, but this movie should of had two DIFFERENT leading actors who could be more vivid in their acting, like Justin and Mila in \\"Friends with Benefits\\". At least their faces were animated, they had chemistry, and they made the sex scenes VERY funny and easily watchable.<br /><br />I mean Natalie was better in \\"Thor\\" than this movie and Ashton is more suited for physical comedy roles. So it's not their fault entirely that this movie was horrible, it was the casting directors and such who gave them the job for this movie.<br /><br />(Also my theory is that Natalie probably did this movie as a last ditch effort before she had a kid, to feel free and sexy, instead of doing a good job on her acting...)
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I just love the Transformer movies.  There is great imagination and fun in all of them.  This latest one takes the story just a bit farther than the last ones.
1451627289|5.0|I read this book over my Thanksgiving break, to the chagrine of my semi-neglected family. Other reviewers have gone into a lot of depth about the plot and ideas presented in this book, so I won't waste your time here recounting the subtle nuances of King's alternate history ideas. I literally could not put this book down. Some of the passages are the sweetest, most tenderly written desciptions of love and attraction available anywhere; and some of the passages bring the reader to near tears for the physical and mental suffering these characters endure. It is a great escape and a wonderful literary voyage. Congrats, Mr. King, I can't wait for the movie!
B001DF68MA|5.0|I purchased this for my 18 month old daughter.  She loves riding in it and seems comfortable.  We go on 20-40 min rides.  I feel she is safe and secure in it and I have full motion of my bike.  I put this on a beach cruiser, but my neigbor has it on a regular mountain bike.  It fits greats on both.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  The graphics are good and the gameplay is intriguing.  each level brings something new.   keep the levels coming.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|To my surprise, this film has a great plot, and all the characters have believable motivations.  The action in this movie is well animated.  I have no gripes with anything movie-production related, except that Joker's voice is too normal sounding.<br /><br />I had no familiarity with the red hood prior to watching the film, other than knowing his identity because I looked it up on wikipedia at some point.  I have not read the comic book equivalent of this movie, but after comparing the book synopsis online with how things went down in this film, I have to say the film seems to be the best way to experience the storyline;  It has much fewer stupid gimmicks than the comic books.<br /><br />Buy this.  It's $5.00 for the single-disc currently, a lot cheaper than the $20 Under the Red Hood TPB, and the story is superior in the film.<br /><br />EDIT: After reading the graphic novel of this, I can stand by my initial conjecture that this movie is more enjoyable than the book.  I still believe this DVD to be the definitive way to experience this storyline.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Tough 1095 steel, 1/4\\" thick full tang blade construction. The handle fit and finish  is ok but could be better. The handle material is grippy enough but overall is a little wide. I applied thread lock to the screws and some scilicon under the scales to keep out water and debris. The snap on the retention strap is weak so I will be replacing it. With all of that said the knife alone is WELL worth the price. Chops great, works well with a ferrocerium rod and if the coating were removed 1095 will spark with flint, chert or quartz. I will feel well equiped on wilderness outings with this knife.
B000FC13E0|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I grabbed a copy of Prey. But once I started I could hardly put it down. Crichton built suspense throughout the novel used things that were more obvious to the reader than the characters to help build that suspense. A well crafted voyage on what nanotechnology out of control could look like, and an ending that is very well played.
B00007E7K0|5.0|I picked up two of these because I had lost my original cover while shooting.  Of course right after they showed up the original re-appeared.  :-)  These are original Canon and are exactly like the ones that came with the camera.  Not much else you can say about them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Truly a page turner!  I read all three books and enjoyed them all, not wanting to see the last page come up.
1451648537|3.0|For a biography it was okay. The endless stories concerning his personel hygiene went over the top.  I got bored reading the first three chapters. Not what I expected about a guy I admired. Would be better to leave everything out up to his college days.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|Received product in excellent shape and in a very timely manner. Thanks so much for the great service. Would definitely do business again.
1451627289|2.0|This would have made a great short story but fails as a full length novel. Just rip out three hundred of the middle pages and you are good to go.
