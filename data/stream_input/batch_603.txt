B000001FKY|2.0|Hysteria.    **    I see great polarities in the reviews of this record. I fall in the camp that sees this as a overproduced microtargeted superficial pop record designed for radio and MTV. I consider that shrewd writing & marketing. Brilliance is a term I'll reserve for Led Zeppelin.    I tend to like my rock harder, with two arms and less cheesy. Sadly, this record doesn't fit the bill. For that, Pete Willis era Def Leppard suits me much better.    I don't need to give you a song breakdown by breakdown. The important factor here is what you enjoy. If you enjoy superficial 1980s MTV pop or mindblowing heavy rock - that distinction will determine your opinion here. This album is definetly the former.    I'll beg to differ with the Amazon reviewer - it *DOES* sound dated. Its a record thats signifigant for its hype. When listened for its depth. It is symbolic of the later part of the decade which it was released.    Prepare to be transported back to the spandex era on plopping this disc in.
B000957O82|5.0|Hitch is a ladies' man. Or so he thought. He's got a PhD in love and he knows just how to create a slight bit of hope into the life of a man who just does not have the stuff. But the one person he can't help is himself, his name is Alex Hitchens, but you can call him Hitch. Will Smith was born destined to play this role, he expands his great horizon of rap, hip-hop, action and comedy movies into the romantic category. The beautiful and talented Eva Mendes plays the one woman who's falling in love with Alex Hitchens, and trying to ruin Hitch.  <br /> <br />This hilarious, passionate and educational romance story is one for the ages. It ends up teaching all of us a lesson, not of how to impress women (even though I got a few helpful tips), but of the meaning of love and how difficult it is to achieve it.
B000GDH9RI|5.0|Nightwish's - End of an Era DVD is a must have for any true fan of music in my opinion!  It's professionally filmed and edited to make for one of the best concert DVD's I have ever watched!  The band members are all in top form and sound great.<br /><br />The only drawback to me is that I wish they would've included more Century Child material than they did.  End of All Hope and Ocean Soul should've been performed that night, but that's a flaw to my personal liking.<br /><br />In conclusion, get this if you can! This DVD is in region 0 format, so it should play in most newer DVD players all over the world.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|First, I have NOT seen the musical...boy, I wish I could but I love in a small, small town.  I just got the CD after recommendation from one of my daughter's friends.  We played the CD all the way home from vacation and then have since played it everytime we have gotten into the car.  Popular..Lar is my favorite because it's upbeat and funny.  I love all the others, except the spell casting song.  I really wish I could see the musical then maybe I could understand the songs better.  I love to sing with my daughters and this cd has produced hours of fun in just a few days!  Oh yeah, my husband even enjoyed it..and this is totally not his cup of tea!  He loved the percussion!
014028009X|4.0|This book is funny. No one can doubt that. The reader can truely feel the joy, the sadness, the hope, the loss, the success and the failure that Bridget Jones feels from page to page. The movie is, indeed, hilarious, and to some extent better than the book. Do not expect flowery writing styles like that of Maya Angelou. Expect a more simplified style, such as that of Meg Cabbot (although more 'adult,' as it were, intelligent and thought/emotion-provoking) Expect a good page-turner, which keeps you rooting for the character to find the perfect sex-God who will love all fluxuating 131 lbs of her and keep her mother quiet all at the same time. Most greatly, however, you wish nothing less than for her to be happy with the Bridget Jones that you will grow to love. Most certainly reccomend. Good summer- or plane-ride-read
0064407667|4.0|This book and the entire series that follows are unusual in many ways. The most noticable one is that there's no happy ending, so don't expect any. Every book seems to end with the misrable siblings escaping yet another plot to kill them and steal their fortune. Nevertheless, the books are awsome. Lemony Snicket's excellent sense of humor should also be noted. Mostly subtle and unobtrusive, but very very funny.  A word of warning though- the first 7 books are fantastic. Intriguing, funny and leaving you wanting more. But it all goes downhill from there, when the 12th book, the last one out in the date this review was written, is confusing and disappointing. I'm going to read the last book in the series when it comes out because I don't like leaving things unfinished, but I don't have high expectations. In short- read, enjoy, and if you get bored, just drop it. Don't wait for a conclusion because there isn't any (that's my guess, anyway).
B000AP04L0|5.0|This movie is a cult classic, and deservedly so.  Hilarious from start to finish, with dozens of lines that colleagues and friends in your office are quoting to each other every day. <br /> <br />If I had a million dollars, the first thing I'd do is buy the special edition of this flick.  Well, OK - maybe the second thing.....
B000F0UV0E|2.0|This is a good technical musical piece of work but I didn't feel there was a great alive feeling with these two together.  I'll listen to it again but probably with the same colorless, emotionless lack of memory of anything to whistle to later on feeling I usually like to get from a music experience.  Plus, I didn't think there is any point to their title of this collaberation except that they both may be burned out in their art posture.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I love Rise Against. One of my favorite bands. I honestly thought that with this album, the major label would get to their heads. I couldn't be more wrong. All I can say is, damn, this is one hell of an album. <br /> <br />First off, you should'nt be comparing this to Siren Song of the Counter Culture. It was their worst album, but it's still a very good album. You have to listen to ALL of their albums to appreciate this one, and by that I mean The Unraveling and RPM as well as Siren Song. Siren Song was their first major label record, and it was surprisingly good. But the production was too much for them. It sounded like they made they entire album on a computer program. This new album sounds more like RPM, as far as production and songs go. It's definitely better than Siren Song, and what really blew my mind was: this album has the least screaming than all of their albums! Which is AWESOME! Tim's screams are good, but Siren Song did it way too much. The Sufferer and the Witness has some of the best musicality the band has shown to date. The guitar work is perfect, and fits the Rise    Against style just as well. Bass is also amazing, but didn't have as many solos as usual, which is a let down being as I am a bassist. Lyrics are amazing as usual. The drumming is really shown off in this album, like the snare rolls in Chamber the Cartridge. Just overall, extremely good album, might be my 2nd favorite behind The Unraveling. Get that album, it's divine. Favorite Tracks: Chamber the Cartridge, Bricks, Injected, and Drones.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Looks pretty good. Obviously it was shot on video 4:3, and doesn't look a whole lot better than the VHS. Sound, on the other hand, is a different story. It's absolutely blazing. Wonderfully mixed and absolutely crystal clear. Wonderful definition throughout. If you have a high end system, you will absolutely love this.
B000FGGE68|4.0|As one reviewer stated, this movie had \\"anti-christian rhetoric\\". Thats quite a reach if you ask me. This type of thinking only shows just how far someone would stretch something just to make an argument. A ridiculous, unfounded argument that further fuels what so many people think of christianity today. That its nothing but a group of bored, lifeless people who need to pick apart anything and everything to give themselves some sort of voice or meaning, to give themselves something to defend when its clearly only one sided. Those people are what gives christianity a bad name. No, I don't think this film is anti-christian. The thought never even crossed my mind. (No pun intended) I highly doubt the writer/director was trying to offend christians as much as he was trying to bring a bit of the \\"vampiric\\" look and feel to the movie. Some people need to question their priorities and start fighting against more important things instead of a movie.<br /><br />As for my review, I found the movie to be enjoyable, not nearly as horrible as I've heard. Yes, the plot is one of those, thin, straight to the point, you can pretty much guess what happens next, kind of plots. Even so, this was a beautifully done film with an original vision and graphics to make up for anyhing it may have been lacking. And Milla Jovovich never looked better. I recommend this movie only for those who go into it not expecting a perfect masterpiece.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|I know every breath of this Album by heart. Can't say that about many other albums.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is one of the most subtle and enlightening movies that i have ever seen. It had everything, most notably it wasn't a movie that was made for everyone in general. The Wachowskis have done something that is far better than the Matrix trilogy, not for its' action, but for its' plot. And I thank them for making a movie that actually makes a person use their brains. The musical score was absolutely stunning for lack of a better word. <br /> <br />My final sentences are BUY THIS MOVIE AND WATCH IT, I mean actually sit down and watch it, and think about how much this is on par with Orwell's vision in 1984. You will be very pleasantly surprised.
B00005JOQS|1.0|It was suspicious when the Daily Planet staff recounted how Superman fights for \\"truth, justice, and...\\" but choked before saying \\"the American way.\\" Evidently one third of the Man of Steel's principles have corroded away. Perhaps more - the director could find only token interventions in disaster and crime in Superman Returns in which Lois Lane was not herself directly imperiled. <br />  <br /> If hearing the sound track from outside the theater, one would think the movie abounded with action and adventure. But the crescendos only marked poignant moments of a love-sick Superman or of his heartthrob. It did sound as though a story could break out at any moment, and in the last thirty minutes of this two and a half hour movie the director did finally honor promises to produce an actual event. By then it was clear that the drama was not the story, but rather a character study of frustrated lovers. <br /> <br /> Superman has been off in space on personal business for five years, during which time Lois delivered a son from their overnight tryst. Not to worry - she is living with a man whom her son calls `Dad.' Fortunate that the man is available, or one would wonder how Lois manages to be a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter and still have time to be an intimately devoted mom. Oh, what we expect of a woman today - we must go to prepare a place for her in CCU. <br /> <br /> Lois's partner is an everyday but too-good-to-be-true Joe, who's duties at the Daily Planet happily leave him with abundant free time. He suspects but accepts that Lois's heart belongs to Superman. Should he not also admit who the child's father is, he will ultimately face the day the boy jumps a tall building with a single bound. Fortunately the lad reserves his superpowers exclusively for rescuing his mother; the apple did not fall far from the tree. <br /> <br /> Thus,  Lois, not Superman, is the motivating theme of this movie. Only her editor is able to treat her as an actual person and not as the center of the universe. The movie should be titled, Superman Returns to Me. <br /> <br /> Lois is the contemporary version of a woman who wants to seduce a god. But a modern woman is compartmentalized, and wants a super man to overwhelm her without intruding upon her daytime pursuits. That makes Superman an object of consumption - yes, in just the way that women resent men treating them like objects. One begins to understand why he's always resisted yielding to love for her - in the sequel Lois Lane will have become Lola Lola of Sternberg's classic, Blue Angel, and it will finally be clear why Clark Kent is so clownish. <br /> <br /> The director advances Superman beyond a simple wish-fulfillment character to make explicit that he is not only a modern world's god (a man who's superhuman powers have scientifically explicable origins), he is a secular version of Christ. One could have thought that a character's comment that \\"the world doesn't need a savior\\" was simply a coincidence of vocabulary were it not emphasized, and later revised that \\"We do need a Savior.\\" Superman himself repeatedly assures Lois (if no one else) that he is \\"always around,\\" and takes her for a flight to remind her of his divinity, that he is not only omnipresent, but also omniscient because he hears (and sees) everything. In a further coincidence Superman commits a life-sacrificing act, and after saving us all he collapses back to earth with his legs tight together, arms splayed out and palms open, forming a crucifix. His side is pierced with a shard of kryptonite. On two or three occasions we even hear the voice of the facsimile Christ's father speaking from the beyond, although he now lacks sufficient force to make his words intelligible over the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> One can't fault the director for attacking religion because he offers one himself. It is the religion of the secular man, in which right behavior is ambiguous, but wrong is addressed with police force. This contrasts with the classic religions, which influence behavior by changing the person from the inside. If gods are another consumer choice, why would we choose a god of power over a god of beauty? Inevitable, I suppose, when a man's character is quantifiable now, as his `credit score.' <br /> <br /> Whether or not one is concerned about Hollywood bastardizing Christian motifs,  there remains the equally grievous matter of Lois's lifestyle. The director presents her as the ideal - the brilliantly successful career woman who fulfills a mother's role equally well. With two such commitments, no wonder that she is not also able to commit either to the man with whom she lives or to the boy's father. We are to presume that her illegitimate son is not adversely impacted by this situation, nor confused by the lie of who his father is (what is the first of Superman's still lingering principls, again?) though it is inevitable that he will manifest god-genes; the child will mature with some blend of our human nature and superhuman powers. It should not be missed that the boy kills a man to protect Lois, even though the director treats this as incidental - the Damien look-alike has already tasted blood. <br /> <br /> In short, presenting Lois's lifestyle as the ideal attacks the traditional concept of permanent family. Rather than ideal, this is pandering to our developing norm.  America, like Rome, is unlikely to be defeated by might of arms, but is decaying from within, and at high-tech speed. Superman's Lois-centered character brilliantly portrays and accelerates the trend, without a whisper about the consequences. <br /> <br />Robert C Flanders <br />author of The Beautiful Fountain <br />ISBN 1-4208-5014-8
0385507755|5.0|Okay, you people who have wrote some of those hatred things about the book need to look past what the public has told you. I feel alot of people judge the book before they open the cover. It is not a bunch of lies, yes some of it may be fiction but in my opinion it is a portrayal of his expirences through a  book, the book in a sense being a metaphor. I feel that some of the things that are said are to represent feelings he was feeling inside that the public could relate to. If he were to tell it exactly as it is we would not feel any emotion about it. Not many of us have been through this so he changed it so we couold relate and feel the pain in a way we can comprehend. It is a book of emotions portrayed through some altered events. I am not saying it is all fake, just modified a bit.  <br /> <br />Also, people should stop saying that just beacuse you have money you are set for life. NO. Not true. Money can't buy you security, or the right friends, or for that matter the will to always make the right decisions. People screw up, welcome to life.  <br /> <br />The book was amazing. It shone a new light into a dark coner or my brain were thoughts like that have never been thought. It helps to tell us the emotional struggle he went through. It was enlightening and is one of the best books of our time.  <br />  <br />
0765342294|5.0|This book is a \\"Starship Troopers\\" for the Information Age, where enemies never come within a thousand kilometers of each other, but live or perish depending on how well they play computer games.<br /><br />Six-year-old Ender has his personal monitor removed after living with it for three years.  Now isolated from his overseers, he's a target for the school bullies and his homicidal brother, Peter.  Only after he overcomes these obstacles is Ender allowed to join the International Force's Battle School in space.<br /><br />This is the beginning of Ender's real struggle.<br /><br />Humanity was once almost wiped out by aliens called the buggers.  Only the brilliance of a single general saved us.  Now the International Force is trying to create a new general before the buggers show up again and complete their genocide.<br /><br />Ender is an extremely likeable genius--the exact opposite of the clich&eacute;d 'evil genius,' which I was getting pretty bored with anyway.  He's a sort of six-year-old Byronic hero, earnest and determined to succeed in spite of his new enemies (geniuses themselves) at Battle School.  His new mentors immediately and publicly single him out as someone special, and as a result Ender has to break one bully's arm on the shuttle up to school.<br /><br />Thanks a lot, Teach.<br /><br />This book's science is plausible, the background story is interesting, the mock battles are exciting and a great device for revealing Ender's growing tactical genius.  His character is strengthened through his constant struggle with his envious and sometimes sadistic classmates.  I wasn't too interested in the chapters concerning his psychopathic brother and loving sister, but I suppose they're important to the numerous sequels to \\"Ender's Game.\\"  This book's ending is a bit contrived, its climax impersonal and deflated, but other than that Orson Scott Card treats us to brilliant science fiction that is well deserving of its Hugo and Nebula.  Ender is the true heir of Heinlein's smart, likeable, believable heroes.he true heir of Heinlein's smart, likeable, believable heroes.  <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Almost watched it just once but frankly it was only after the second viewing that all of the humor, rich scenes, and depth of the characters really impacted me. Now I'm still enjoying it and still getting something new from each viewing. Haven't seen that kind of quality in a film for a LONG TIME. Had to own it!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Great songs.  Very enjoyable even though I haven't seen the show.  Currently one of my favorite soundtracks.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Clerks in many ways is one of those kind of films where the memory of it may be more funnier or effecting than the film itself. Don't get me wrong, the film is funny but I remember it at one point being hysterical. Whether or not it's as good as people say it is, that's beside the point. Point is it's an entertaining movie that people should see regardless of how well(or badly) it's aged. <br /> <br />Dante, the embarassingly pathetic clerk at a local Quick Stop, is called into work on his day off with his boss promising he'll be there by lunch. So Dante goes in and basically has a really terrible day. 2 losers, Jay and Silent Bob, deal outside of the store. He overreacts about his girlfriend's past...\\"escapades\\", his best friend often comes over to bug him and he finds out the former girlfriend/love of his life is getting married. And more happens than that in one day in the life of a convenience store clerk. <br /> <br />Now first off, I'm going to have to tell the film's flaws. One: the acting. Now it's not terrible but it's merely serviceable. Many characters just seem to be reciting their lines, as if the saying of the dialogue was more important than the delivery itself. And the dialogue at times has that \\"too smart for its own good\\" feel to it. And like I said before, some parts are not as funny anymore. Although some are outright hilarious (\\"37?!\\"), other jokes kinda fall flat in a way but it still manages to be entertaining without eye-rolling. <br /> <br />This package quite frankly is packed. Disc 1 has the version we all know as well as commentary. Disc 2 has the original version as well as an optional video commentary. Disc 3 is where everything is: reviews, documentaries, specials and more. For some it's rather overkill, and it kind of is, the superior Chasing Amy Criterion Edition had less features than this. It's great to see everything on a release for a change without resorting to double-dips though. (I'm looking at you Black Hawk Down which has count-em 4(!) separate releases on DVD. <br /> <br />It is worth your time? Definately, but first: it's probably slightly aged by now and Chasing Amy is the far superior Kevin Smith film. Track that one down too.
0743454537|5.0|Very enjoyable, very sad.  Writing was superb.  I will read other books from Jodi Picoult!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Every time I hear this I am unfortunatly reminded how insignificant and untalented I am!  This is my all time favorite CD and movie.  I get chills every time I listen to it.  It fits the movie perfectly. If I were Klaus Badelt & Hans Zimmer I would fall to my knees everyday and thank the Lord for my talents!<br /><br />If you think there are no good modern instrumental CD's - think again.  Pirates/Black Pearl rocks (as my kids would say)
1932100385|5.0|This is the most comprehensive study of nutrition ever conducted. You will not be able to put this book down. It is a gift to humanity. I only hope its wisdom shall be heeded by the many, not the few, so that we can begin to heal ourselves and restore the intended balance between Nature, the animals and human beings.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The Pink Floyd Pulse DVD will be out tomorrow. I will get it first thing in the morning at Barnes and Noble.  <br /> <br />Pink Floyd are one of the greatest musical groups ever. Their concerts are spectacular and this one will be too. Can't wait for tomorrow.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|Yes, I know this is not a very easy album to listen and to enjoy... But in my opinion is an album where celine sings exactly what she is feeling... The songs are made for her voice and she proves that she doesn't need to reach that big notes to put out a very great and emotional album. My favorite songs are \\"Miracle\\", \\"Baby close your eyes\\", \\"Come to me\\"; \\"Le loup, la biche et le chevalier\\"; beautiful boy (this is a great cover!!) and \\"In some small way\\".
B000F7CMRM|1.0|I'm surprised and glad to see others as disappointed in this movie as I was. \\"Disjointed\\" and \\"convoluted\\" sums up my reaction to it, too. <br /> <br />After all the hype and good reviews, I expected a good movie. Unfortunately, the writing and editing are extremely disjointed and whatever points it is trying to make about global oil are completely lost in the endless and baffling shuffling of images and people onscreen. <br /> <br />Clooney's casting almost seemed like a gimmick, a way to get people to pay attention to a pretty bad picture. <br /> <br />Disappointing.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I know the cliché, \\"A breath of fresh air,\\" is tossed around a lot, but this album is truly just that.  I liked the 1st two singles, \\"Like A Star\\" and \\"Put Your Records\\" on, but the best material on the album is yet-to-be-released.  Oh my...on songs like, \\"Til It Happens To You,\\" \\"Choux Pastry Heart,\\" \\"Breathless\\" and \\"Seasons Change,\\" this woman is not just singing, she's PREACHING.  Her music goes beyond melody and really speaks to your soul.  As far as American tastes goes, she has a nice mix of pop, r&b, rock, hip-hop and funk to suit any palate.  Not only does she sing, she also co-wrote, produced and played guitar on her 1st major release.  This album is in heavy (i.e. exclusive) rotation in my car and Ms. Rae deserves to be a star.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album.  I feel the highest compliment I could ever pay an artist is to support their art, so my hat is off to you, Corinne.  Thank you for making an album that I could listen to all the way from beginning to end.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|This is the master at work. Great songwirting, great music and superb performance. These are songs that will stay with us and bear repeated listening. The CD is filled with new classics. This is Clapton at his peak of musicianship. Tasteful, upbeat and a joy to listen to. Forget the naysayers, if you like Clapton, get this one.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|I think what made this movie so enjoyable and endearing to me is the star studded cast.  I marvel at how they could make such a beautiful woman as Emma Thompson so hideous at first, and what a delight to see Angela Lansbury on screen again!  I have really missed her and again, I marvel at how they could make another beautiful woman look like such  an unpleasant creature! <br /> <br />The acting was extraordinary by each of the characters including the children!  The story line was delightful, romantic, funny and also very touching.  The fact that Emma Thompson wrote the script for this movie was one of the reasons I was so drawn to it in the first place.  She has such a gift for taking popular classic stories, such as the children's books that this movie was based on, and turning them into films that whole generations can enjoy.  My husband and I have watched it several times now. <br /> <br />Oh, another thing, my 2 1/2 year old loves it too!  She often breaks into \\"Oh, Nanny Fee!\\" while she is watching it.  So if you question whether this movie works for small children, you have one emphatic \\"Yes\\" from the mouth of a 2 1/2 year old! <br /> <br />In the end, I cannot say anything negative about this movie.  It is an instant classic in my book and is a very welcome addition to our collection.
0553801503|4.0|Wow, there is quite the debate in here regarding this tome. Well, I want to add my two coppers to the mix. Is this book not as thrilling as the others? Perhaps. Is this series going to become another Wheel of Time? Come on! Stop crying out \\"Another Robert Jordan!\\" I agree that Martin is clearly in love with his world, and it seems that, yes, he has written a very self-indulgent book. But the sheer imagination of his tale is incredible. He is taking us on a journey through his world, focusing not just on major characters but the \\"smallfolk\\" as well. Again, is this perhaps an example of the author drooling over his creation? Could be. But people, I think if you hold to faith and wait for the next book, you will see the action picking back up. And for all of you crying over how you can't keep track of the characters, you should have all discovered by now that, with these books, you need to remember that you don't have to memorize every character in exacting detail. There is a trick to it that Martin readers should have learned while reading the first book. In the end, I give this 4 stars because I like being taken on a trip to a fantastic world like Martin's, one that is clearly beloved by the author. BUT, there were points even for me that dragged. To one and all, to each his or her own, right? Let's all agree to disagree. Happy reading!
0385507755|5.0|All the reviews of this book I have read are stating how much they DON'T like it. They say it's full of...crap, and very fictitious. Let me remind you that this book is a MEMOIR. It's not an autobiography or anything of the sort. A memoir is a person's recollection of what happened. James Frey had stopped all these drugs cold when he was in the rehab center, and therefore his perspective might have been different than ours.  <br />   James wrote that he had been in jail for months, when really, it might have been only a couple of hours. Now let me ask you this. Have you ever been in a very boring meeting that lasted only and hour, yet felt like 5? Maybe this is what happened to James. If you were in Jail, I almost guarantee it will feel longer than it actually is. Remember, folks, this book is a memoir. It is how James felt about what happened, not how it was in the eyes of others. <br />   James said that Lily isn't the real name of the girl he was in love with, and that her form of suicide wasn't that of hanging herself. He changed these events for the privacy of her family, and in respect for her. <br />   The fact that James didn't have any painkillers during his root canal surgery at the dentist may or may not have been true. Haven't you ever heard of dentists making mistakes? They are human, you know. <br />   As Kohoute stated in his/her review, people can't vomit that many times a day, every day, for months on end, and live to tell the story. People are built differently. James was on drugs, and his body might have been functioning differently because of it. James might have been so used to vomiting, that he was able to vomit multiple times a day for months, regardless of what the average human should or shouldn't be able to live through. People have been shot in the head and lived...that isn't possible either, is it? <br />   Emilyfish states that James' parents both had good jobs; therefore James grew up in a good family, so he should've turned out good. I don't understand this comment at all. Just because you have decent parents, doesn't mean you're going to turn out just like them. You don't have to be weak to become addicted to drugs, either. In high school, I had many strong-willed friends who ended up turning to drugs just because they liked to party. It's sad, but it happens. <br />   I don't see how so many people hate this book because of the exaggerations included. It doesn't change the fact that James had been addicted to various drugs, and went through a hard time. It's a very powerful book, even if it did happen to be fiction.
B0000026T4|5.0|Trash is Alice Cooper at his heavy metal best! If there were more stars to use to rate this album I'd use them! This album rocks! From the hard core hair metal sound of the music to the poetic genius in his lyrics, there is not a bad song on it, (well, maybe one). His all star line up of hair band rockers such as Jon Bon Jovi, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton, to name a few, are a lot of fun to hear and blend well with Alice Cooper and his band. I think I read that this is the number one selling A.C. album of all time and \\"Poison\\" is still one of my favorite heavy metal songs. Buy this album!
0451196716|4.0|King is pretty much hit and miss for me despite writing really well every time. When all is said and done, though, \\"The Long Walk\\" is a hit. Well, most of it, yeah.<br /><br />In this, King is actually writing under the pen name of Richard Bachman. In the Signet reprint, there's a cool introduction by King himself explaining the importance of being Bachman in which he sheds some distinct light on this particular matter. Funny how he never meant for people to know Bachman was really King and that once the word got out, it meant Bachman's death, back in 1985. This and other early manuscripts are then really what Bachman's wife found hidden away in the attic of the Bachman's residence in New Hampshire. Meaningless and made up but interesting. Personally, I don't find much of a difference between King and Bachman, but then again this is the first Bachman book I've read.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it takes a very good premise and uses it to muse about life and the meaning of it all. One hundred boys have been drafted for The Long Walk, a yearly event where you can't stop walking literally for the life of you. If you stop, you're warned. If you don't get moving, you're warned a second and a third time. Then you're no longer warned. You're history. The last man standing is proclaimed winner and takes the Prize.<br /><br />\\"The Long Walk\\" reminded me of \\"Stand By Me\\" except it's inherently more gory. King suceeds in progressively turning sanity into insanity as time goes by and the boys each reach their ultimate stages of resistence much in the same way that you sense the crazyness going on in \\"Apocalypse Now\\". It's there, you can feel it, everything becomes more and more outworldly as time washes by. Where King in my opinion doesn't quite succeed is that the plot drags a bit in the middle and the end though surprising can be frustrating. If I got it right, that is.<br /><br />A good book but by no means essential King.
B000001GXB|5.0|Giving a hearty recommendation to this recording would not do it justice.  The sound is quite good and the performances are simply spectacular.  I'm lucky enough to have complete works by Kempff, Claude Frank, Bernard Roberts, and Ashkenazy (excerpts).  They are most worthy masters in their own right but for me, this set really speaks from the heart.  There is incredible intensity in some passages combined with a poignancy that is difficult to ignore.  I am rather puzzled that theses works are viewed by some as cold and overly technical. Though technically superb, I would not refer to this work as cold by any standard.  Listen to to the Adagio Sustenuto on sonata 29 and decide for yourself.  Possibly the finest recording I have yet heard of that piece.  Upon an initial hearing I had to replay it two more times to believe my ears.    One of the most enjoyable features of this recording is the tempo of the pieces. The quicker passages have all the necessary flair and the slower movements are played with a deft touch. I have tried, desperately at times, to find renditions of the sonatas that capture the essence of the work.  This set is a veritable gold mine and a purchase you can make without fear.  You will be pleased with your decision for a long time.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I am very picky about what I watch on TV...fact is I don't watch much...but when I found this show I got hooked. It follows two brothers Sam and Dean on a search for their father and the thing that killed their mother. There is a great story in this show, a lot of emotion, and a big family element. I fell in love with it because of its other worldly aspect as well as the family aspect that runs through the show. If you watch it you'll be sucked in and you will not regret it. This is one of the best shows on the air.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Heard so much about the movie, I decided I wanted to own it.  Amazon has such good prices that I took advantage of the offer.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|usually, i am very cynical of these types of albums, but this one blew me away. Honestly, \\"Ask me anything\\" is a Great song, loaded with lyrics only true strokes fans would understand, whewre they are making fun  of other bad bands who have nothing to say and drag on. Also \\"You only live once\\", \\"Razorblade\\", \\"heart in a cage\\", \\"red Light, \\"electricity Scape\\", \\"killing lies,\\" and \\"Juicebox\\" are all wonderful songs. And the rest of the album is typical Strokes, so if u are a fan of the strokes, you wont be dissapointed.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|Muse is one of those rare bands that have potential to really make something of themselves in terms of leaving a legacy.  There's nothing else out there right now even remotely like Muse.  Their music is epic and Black Holes and Revelations holds true to that level of delivery. <br /> <br />I think this album is as strong as anything Muse has done.  But, it is also true that there isn't a single song as strong as \\"Sing for Absolution\\" or \\"Bliss\\".  But, at the same time I feel like there are songs that are much weaker on Absolution and Origin of Symmetry than the songs found on Black Holes and Revelations.  There isn't a song that couldn't stand on its own...which is very rare, even for the most experienced bands.  So, overall I think this is their most balanced and solid album.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay is for anyone who just loves great music, they are excellent at what they do and how they express themselves; they are a band with true heart, soul, and power; and they will definitely knock your socks off. <br />\\"X&Y\\" contains a certain energy that couldn't be found in \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", though that's saying a lot, as it was also a superb album. X&Y is one of those CD's you can listen to from beginning to end without skipping tracks.  <br />Ever since I heard their first CD, \\"Parachutes\\", I fell in love with there their unique style and simple yet profound lyrics; the likes of which I've never heard before. Wether your speeding down the freeway or unwinding after a hard day, \\"X&Y\\",from the band that deserves to be a genre on its own, is sure to please you!
B000FP2Z0S|2.0|I purchased this cd on a whim. It was on sale at a local retailer for 6.99. I had moderately enjoyed \\"Siren Song\\" and (being nearly a quarter Jewish) simply could not pass up such an attractive price. I returned to my auto-car and pealed off the rapper. A leap of faith, an open cd is rather difficult to recieve a cash refund on...or is it?  <br />Three tracks into listening it became painfuly obvious that I had made a grevious error. While the song titles and lyrics promised punk ideals the music was quite over produced and left the impression of Post-Hardcore in tattered Punk clothing. A good effort. But, durring the few moments I feel the desire to partake of Hardcore Punk I would much rather do so in some dilapidated dive-bar, where 6.99 would get me 3 bands and 1 domestic bottle.
0156027321|5.0|This is the best work of fiction I have ever read. Even better than The Alchemist, this book has it all - religion, philosophy, adventure, danger and a happy ending. So beautifully written, I grew to love Richard Parker as much as Pi did.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Let's just get this over with right off the bat - I am a music fan.  I'm very knowledgable about all genre's and eras of rock music, I love everything from The Dead Kennedys to Chuck Berry to Led Zeppelin to At the Drive-In to Frank Zappa.  So you can at least have some respect for the fact that I consider Ghost Reveries to be the best album ever. <br /> <br />I was an Opeth fan about a year prior to this album being released.  I got Still Life and fell in love with pretty much everything about the album and the band, then proceeded to get all of their other albums.  Needless to say, when I heard they were coming out with a new album, I was quite excited.  However, when they released The Grand Conjuration a month or so prior to the album, I was pretty disapointed.  It was so much simpler than all of their older stuff and even a bit boring.  However, I still got the album, and thank god for that, because every single second of it is pure genious.  On previous Opeth albums, it's kind of hard to do a song-by-song analysis, but all of the songs on this album really stick out as individual tracks, so here I go - <br /> <br />Ghost of Perdition: 5/5 - The song that reasurred me Opeth hadn't sold out.  Though most of this is nothing that wasn't on Blackwater Park or Still Life, they're so good at the sound now that everything is super-tight.  Also, this is the first time that an Opeth melody has really been catchy. <br /> <br />The Baying of the Hounds: 5/5 - Another awesome song basically in the same vain as the first one, but this time with organ.  Cool. <br /> <br />Beneath the Mire: 5/5 - At this point, Opeth starts to get a little bit out of their element and starts experimenting, and the result is just as great as everything else.  The beginning is pure rock, the play between the guitar, drums, and keyboard is awesome. <br /> <br />Atonement: 5/5 - Though this one is soft and relaxed, I wouldn't call it \\"beautiful\\" like some would.  Actually, the one word that sums this song up is \\"cool.\\"  It has an awesome jazz meets indian music beat and melody to it. <br /> <br />Reverie, Harlequin Forest: 4/5 - This is personally my least favorite song on the album, but it is still brilliant.  It has nice loud/soft dynamics and the end is awesome. <br /> <br />Hours of Wealth: 10/5 - Oh my god.  Now THIS is beautiful.  This song gives me the chills everytime I listen to it, and I swear the first time I listened to it it brought be to tears.  The chord progressions are amazing, and the guitar solo at the end is the best part - this does NOT sound like a metal guitarist.  You would swear it was Santana, it is so damn soulfull. <br /> <br />The Grand Conjuration: 4/5: - As I said before, I didn't really like this song the first time I heard it and for Opeth to release this song first was in my opinion kind of a bad move.  However, in the context of the album, the song works really well and is definitely very enjoyable. <br /> <br />Isolation Years: 5/5 - Another breathtakingly beautiful song, the chorus of this one puts me in a trance.  The perfect way to close the album <br /> <br />All in all, I would absolutely consider this the greatest album of all time.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Whathever, the movie has no plot, which i think is what makes it so funny.The sex stuff is also funny! <br />The opening scene of the patio of drew barrymore looks just like the one in scream.The movie also makes fun of the blair witch project , i know what you did last summer , scream 2, matrix , and charlie's angels. <br /> <br />There is something that is really funny about Anna Farri's performance. This is great.
B00005JP0A|5.0|\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is the best movie I have seen all year!  Hands down.  This is a wonderful movie that has some of the best acting I've ever enjoyed on screen.  The film says \\"quality\\" from beginning to end.  It's for people who like real movies more than Hollywood formula tripe. <br />  <br />I think that most everyone knows that Meryl Streep is one of the greatest living actresses this country has ever seen, and she proves that to the max in Prada.  I believe this may have been her finest role.  Meryl Streep plays \\"the Devil\\" (Miranda Priestly) and Anne Hathaway plays \\"Emily\\" (Andy Sachs) in this wonderful comedy which is also a movie about choices and values.  I will tell you nothing about the plot.  It's best to let it unravel before your eyes.  Is it about working in the fashion industry for the top fashion magazine.  Who would have thought that could be so fascinating? <br />  <br />It will have you laughing hard from human interest type comedy, and it will have you sympathizing with both the \\"victim\\" and the \\"villain.\\"  In the end, it will have you crying. <br />Take my word for it, this is a truly wonderful movie that will lift your spirits and keep you glued to your seats.  Do your friends a favor - take them to see this.  They will be grateful that you have such good taste. <br />  <br />I give this 5 out of 5 stars, and I would give it double that if I could.  This is the best movie of the year.  If Meryl Streep doesn't win an Academy Award, then no one should get it.  No one can top her.  She is just too good. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000FVQYYK|5.0|<br />Nearly three years since their US breakthrough album \\"Absolution\\", Muse will be releasing their fourth-coming installment called \\"Black Holes & Revelations\\". While taking most of 2005 off to recoup from their lengthy tour, one of UK's favorite bands have gotten more in touch with the experimentation of other genre's including Funk, R&B, and Electronica while also keeping up to date with their signature aggressive guitar riffs and falsetto vocals. The first single \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" takes you on a dance type beat ride mixed with alternative guitar that will keep you aching for more. On other tracks including \\"Assassin\\", it shows you more melodic guitar combined with harmonizing tales of futurism, science, and the supernatural that we loved with their previous work. Newest single, \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" combines actual trumpet playing and vocals from Bellamy's higher and lower ranges that have been compared to the great Freddie Mercury of Queen. This CD will definitely not disappoint as it has a little something for everyone to enjoy.
6304698690|5.0|We were unfamiliar with virtually all of the cast except for Maggie Smith, and kind of felt like we were throwing the dice. Well, I'm happy to report that this one is a first class keeper. The acting, casting, staging, direction, sound and picture are all excellent.<br /><br />Kate Maberly, who plays the part of Mary, is compelling as the orphan who discovers the secret garden. The rolls of Colin and Dickon are also well performed. Maggie Smith, as usual, turns in a convincing performance.<br /><br />The movie is involving, and seems to be over too soon. One is left wanting more. The joy with a DVD is that it can be watched again, and again.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album should have come with CD players the way Super Mario Brothers used to come with Nintendo.  It is the fundamental basis and foundation for the entire 90s popular grunge rock movement which spawned out in countless directions before reaching the current state of rock and alternative music.  It is the benchmark for creativity that all popular musicians should be measured against before their automatic acceptance, and a testament to people who refuse to allow themselves to be ruled by masters who insist on producing only that which is marketable and trendy.  A legacy of Cobain who would not \\"Pay to Play\\" and be the lunchbox cover of the week; who will maintain his individuality forever as opposed to what's-his-name with the tattoo and the haircut that went triple platinum and changed nothing.
B000F1IQNM|3.0|My wife had seen this movie in the theater, and raved about it. When it came out on DVD I bought a copy and saw it for the first time. It is entertaining, but somewhat over the top in my opinion. The humor is rather \\"in your face\\". I actually enjoyed it a little more on the second viewing. The audio and video seem to be good, and it comes across well in surround sound.<br /><br />I think it leans a little toward the female audience because of Colin Firth. I have not personally viewed it in the presence of children, but I'm inclined to think that younger children would enjoy it. I'm certainly not ready to put it in the same class as \\"Mary Poppins\\".<br /><br />In general, I don't regret having added it to our collection.
B0001LJC2K|3.0|This disc was my introduction to Muse. The reason I bought this was drummer extraordinaire Mike Portnoy, on his website, mentioned \\"Absolution\\" as one of his favorite CD's of the decade. Thank goodness, we all have different tastes (the world would be boring if everyone liked broccoli) and I welcome everyone's opinion. The comparisons to Radiohead are justified in that the vocalist's tone is similar but the music (a blend of upbeat, spacey, and modern rock) is not. No doubt, this is a good disc and is worth a listen, but disc of the decade? Judge for yourself.
B00007KWHG|5.0|If you had an older, teenage sibling during the late 50s or early 60s then this CD will bring back some memories!

B000000WHX|3.0|One called \\"One Love\\" the worst song on the album, Horace Andy has more vocal talent in his little finger than any other male vocalist this band ever employed. Since this is all about personal opinion here is mine : Tricky is WACK, Del Naja's vocals are about the worst EVER. \\"Safe From Harm\\" is the bomb, check out the original \\"Stratus\\" by Billy Cobham.  <br /> <br />The coup de grace of reviews here is the one numb-skull who claimed that trip-hop came before hip-hop and that \\"American negros\\" borrowed form this. Some British people crack me up. They suck up all our culture and don't bother to actually learn about it. <br /> <br />Go ahead and slam this opinion, but you know Tricky is over-rated and Del Naja has a pathetic singing voice.
0823016714|4.0|This is currently the best and most cost-effective photo reference for heads, features, faces, expressions, angles, and different ethnicities, genders, and ages available today *in-print*. A great price & above-average quality- it's pretty easily worth getting. See also his 2nd book: [[ASIN:0823096157 Babies to Teens]].<br /><br />Some ideas for next edition- mainly my own preferences: more younger models- less older; white pages with white backgrounds- instead of grey pages with black backgrounds; get rid of the skull sections; get rid of the 'art inspired by' amateur art; get rid of the sequential expressions section; expand the kissing section- younger models please; and give us more of the model on pages 234-235! :)<br /><br />Some of the criticisms here by others really amaze me(!). This is the *only* book of its kind available today- there's simply no competition. Sure, other photo references exist, but none with this specific content. Where else can we find so many expressions, ethnicities, and extreme angles of view? This is a tremendous help in learning to draw heads from memory. Combine this with some of the better how-to-draw type books, and it's hard to find a better value these days. Photo-reference books can sometimes be expensive!<br /><br />It's unfortunate but true: some of the *greatest* photo reference books ever created seemed to quickly go out of print. Sometimes they popped back into print; sometimes they didn't. The Illustrator's Figure Reference Manual series is a great example of this, as is the Elte Shuppan Pose File series (currently a 9-volume series). Awareness seems key to their survival. It's just a simple reality: these books are intended for a very special & specific audience, and if demand for these books fades, even for the briefest of times, these books go out-of-print & then often become extremely expensive to get. I've written a few reviews for these out-of-print books, but happily *this* book is still available today.

B0002858YS|5.0|This album is one of the best, if not the best, albums yet by The Killers. The songs are all upbeat and interesting. Usually, when you buy a CD, you get a couple good songs and then you have the bad ones. Well, that isn't the case with this album. I bought the entire album and I'm glad that I did. The CD is an excellent example of what an album should contain in order to attract customers, and it certainly worked on me.

6304297912|4.0|The Danny Boyle directed \\"Trainspotting\\" was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of Scottish heroin addicted losers.  While the film garnered accolades, I found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted.  Ewan McGregor playing Mark Renton and his crew which included \\"Full Monty\\" star Robert Carlyle, as violent psycho Begbie, swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high.<br /><br />Congregating in a filthy, deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high.  As a group they're abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix.<br /><br />McGregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies.  Remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories.  In a humorous scene, cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in Scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories.  He then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them.<br /><br />McGregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations, escaping to London and working as a realtor.  His buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life.<br /><br />McGregor and Carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true,........the big drug deal.  They manage to complete the deal for 16,000 pounds which McGregor decides to steal.  He intends to use the loot to start a straight and clean life anew.  Fat chance.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|Cool never goes out of fashion and this movie remains amazingly watchable almost 40 years after it was made. Steve McQueen did better work than this in his tragically shortened career but this is one of the movies that helped make him a screen icon. He's at his thousand-yard-ice-cool-stare best as the maverick cop assigned to protect a key government witness against a crime syndicate. Robert Vaughn lends great support as the oily politician keen to see the witness kepts safe - or at least so it would seem. McQueen, as Lieutenant Bullitt is forced to resort to unorthodox methods when the assignment goes awry.<br /><br />This is the movie that introduced me to one of the great loves of my life: the city of San Francisco and in my view, the city is indeed one of the iconic characters of this movie. Director Peter Yates does a great job of using the real urban setting to make more of the movie than the otherwise predictable script might have allowed. Jacqueline Bisset is gorgeous as Bullitt's typical 60s model-like girlfriend and there are notable appearances from the likes of a young Robert Duvall, Norman Fell and, especially interestingly from a black man's perspective, Georg Stanford Brown as the quiet but capable ER doctor.<br /><br />The hill-jumping car chase scene (for which Frank P Keller won a well-deserved Oscar for editing) is now legendary - and actually the most popular car chase in Hollywood history - and whenever I watch the scene involving Bullitt's beautiful green Mustang GT 390 (and whatever the other car was), I am transported back to my teenage years when I just used to sit and stare.<br /><br />And dream.<br /><br />The extras on this two-disc special edition DVD make it a must for anyone who loves this movie.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I have loved Muse for some time now, and can attest after hearing this album that they continue to parlay things they do well and take come calculated risks to move forward sonically. \\"Assassin\\" is close in spirit to \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\", and \\"Invincible\\" culls some of the best elements from much of Absolution. These guys build tension in songs like few bands currently producing new music. If you would be interested in hearing what Radiohead, Black Sabbath, Abba, and Franz would sound like if thrown together in a blender, by all means check this out. Muse are one of a handful of bands that actually produce new music that I buy as soon as it comes out.This disc demonstrates why that is.
0805209999|3.0|The Trial tells the story of a half balding post office clerk who questions his own existence after having lost an eye in a terrible tram accident. Terrifying, for its vivid portrayl of office clerks in Vienna in 1908, this story follows the realist tradition of many great writers. Fred, who is a middle aged man with dementia and an unknown skin disease, imagines a life away from the crumbling empire, which is about to enter World War 1 but he can not get away from the post office because of his stamp licking addiction. Great scene includes when he smashes a portrait of the king on the floor, realizing it was actually a painting by Renoir and when he imitates a squirrel in the park.

And though this album is truthfully nothing new in terms of Metal-core, it is leaps and bounds above the competition.  Generally speaking the Killswitch-Style of heavy verses and overly melodic, sing-a-long chorus don't do it for me... Truth is, I just can't stop listening to this (And even singing along!)   Phil Lebonte is one of metal's finest and easily most diverse vocalists, showcasing high pitched shrieks, low growls, hard-core screams, and a fantastic singing range.  Herbert and Martin, as always, rock the guitars with fantastic song writing and face melting solos.  New addition female bassist, Jeanne Sagen holds her own providing a nice backdrop for the insane guitar work of her counterparts.  Other new comer Shannon Lucas is an absolute savage behind the kit... giving the All that Remains camp the well need heavy boost which 'This Darkened Heart' had lacked on drums.    <br /> <br />Honestly, I could rant and rave about this album but I will spare your time...  <br />All you need to know is THIS is the premier New-Wave-Of-American-Metal album... hands down!  <br />Prior to this CD I would have ranked, `This Darkened Heart' or Unearth's `The Oncoming Storm' as the premier Metal-Core Album....

Even the silly \\"I'm Going Bananas\\" isn't completely unlistenable. That title is taken by \\"Vogue,\\" which has absolutely no business being on this album, because I can't see how it was even inspired by \\"Dick Tracy.\\" As far as I'm concerned, that song symbolizes everything that was wrong with post-\\"Tracy\\" Madonna--the repetitive Shep Pettibone beat that would be used for at least two-thirds of her next two albums.  <br /> <br />Standout tracks are \\"Back in Business,\\" \\"Something to Remember\\" (that one's my personal favorite) and \\"Now I'm Following You.\\"  <br /> <br />Pat Leonard has always been able to bring out the best in Madonna's voice, and no better example exists than \\"I'm Breathless.\\" Just take out the CD when you hit \\"Vogue.\\" <br /> <br />

B000002HMH|5.0|I am an oldschool, hardcore Metallica fan. I have seen them live many times. While Load is not their very best album, it is still really, really good. The production is excellent, the songs have strong grooves and memorable riffs. Pretty solid lyrics. The whole reason this album gets a bad reputation is because of the shock when it came out. The hair cuts, the new sound, etc.  <br /> <br />Re-Load has about 3 or 4 good songs on it, and St. Anger is a decent headbang but a pretty poor album overall.

B000BTC5LW|4.0|Well after dozens of release dates that have come and gone, Pulse was finally released on July 11th, 2006.  Every fan of Pink's music should pick this up if for no other reason than I predict it will eventually be \\"out of print\\" and probably go for hundreds of dollars (just a gut feeling).  Anyway, the sound is phenomenal and you can close your eyes and really feel like you are at the concert.  Of coures that would defeat the purpose of a dvd, which will inevitably dissapoint those hoping for 5 star quality.  You won't find that quality here, but no worry.  You've got Pulse.  Enjoy it.   <br /> <br />RIP Syd, Shine On
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|I stumbled upon this cd by accident. I had just taken a job far from home, and my best friend sent me a \\"mellow\\" mix to cure my homesickness, and Joshua Radin was on it. The song was perfect. I bought the cd, and the entire thing is wonderful. It is the perfect complement for a rainy day. The vocals are incredible! Not to mention the strings on \\"The fear You won't Fall\\". This cd is incredible, and if you are even remotely tossing around the idea of buying it, DO!
B000E41MS6|5.0|By the time the series was broadcast in the US, anybody who REALLY wanted to see it probably found a way.  One of the reasons that I bought the series DVDs was the inclusion of the \\"Doctor Who Confidential\\" episodes.  Unfortunately, these wonderful 30 minute documentaries on the making of each episode have been trimmed back to 11 minutes.  Having seen the episodes that go with the second series, but not the first, I was very disappointed.
B00003CX9E|2.0|I sat down to watch Citizen Kane unaware of it's \\"number #1 all-time ranking\\", etc. etc. With that said, I found the camera work curious, but the story very tedious.<br /><br />I understand that there was a great deal of creativity and innovation that went into making Citizen Kane, but it was in all the wrong areas. The story, plot, acting, and pacing were extremely tedious, making Citizen Kane one of the dullest movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />I do not believe an art form can be called the best of its kind if it does not, first and foremost, entertain. Innovative? Yes. Entertaining? No. If Citizen kane were a car it would have an innovative look, and innovative features, but driving it would be pure torture. If Citizen kane were a chef's creation, it would have an innovative combination of ingredients, and an innovative plating, but would taste like trash heapings.<br /><br />While there has been a lot said about this movie, I will leave you with this. Place Citizen Kane before an average modern movie fan and they will be wrestling the ZZZ Monster half way through. I was, and unless you're an artsy-fartsy film school geek who fawns over camera angles more than story, you will sleep too.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 33<br /><br />11 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />5 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />1 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />5 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br />10 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />1 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?
B000AARKW6|5.0|Directed by Brian DePalma, Carlito's Way is a realistic story of Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino), a hardened Puerto Rican criminal who has just been gotten out of jail early by his dedicated lawyer, Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). Carlito has learned his lesson in jail and is dedicated to going straight. He feels a great loyalty to Kleinfeld for going above and beyond the call of duty to get him out early, so when Kleinfeld asks him to get a nightclub running properly \\"as a favor\\", Carlito agrees. He figures this is a way to repay his friend and get some legitimate start up funds before he runs a car sales business somewhere warm and sunny.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Carlito, his friend Kleinfeld is a real slimeball. Carlito has to deal with an up-and-coming punk, Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo) who he thinks is just an obnoxious kid trying to act tough. Carlito seeks out his old girlfriend, Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) who has dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer - but has had to resort to stripping to pay the bills. There are many poignant scenes where Gail wishes her reality were different, and desperately hopes to get Carlito away from the friends who she is sure will bring him trouble or death.<br /><br />Kleinfeld, a coke-head and thief, gets into more and more trouble, and turns to Carlito to bail him out. Carlito knows this is going to be bad, but he still feels the obligation of having been freed and goes along for the ride. Soon the Italian mafia is after the two of them. Carlito does his best to cut and run, to escape with Gail - but this movie is laid out to be a tragedy from the beginning and watching it unfold is both beautiful and heartbreaking.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen has a short but memorable role as Lalin - once a handsome power-man in the Hispanic mob scene but now reduced to cutting deals with the cops from a wheelchair. He snivels to Carlito that he feels worthless now that he can't walk, and begs for Carlito to just kill him. Carlito - either feeling sorry for him or feeling that life was enough punishment - lets him go.<br /><br />I loved the power and poetry of this movie. It's an in-the-streets mob film, but it's not about the violence. There is actually very little shown. Instead, it's about the way human lives are degraded, about the things the street will drive a man to do even if he wants to live a moral life. There's even a scene of Carlito telling Gail about a fight he had when he was 13 - that he didn't want to fight, but he did want to live and had to defend himself. They talk about how you do the best you can with what life throws at you.<br /><br />I found the actors all to be quite stunning in their roles. That being said, I found it extremely odd that this movie is all about hispanic characters - but that pretty much none of the actors (except Luis Guzman) were actually hispanic. Al Pacino is of course Italian - and there's a funny scene when he's talking with the Italian mob where they comment that they thought he was Italian based on his looks. Sean Penn is rather transformed as a Jewish lawyer with receding, frizzy hair. Viggo is definitely not hispanic! It makes you wonder, surely with all of the hispanic people in the world, they could have found high quality hispanic actors for these roles. Did they not look or try?for him or feeling that life was enough punishment - lets him go.<br /><br />I loved the power and poetry of this movie.

B0002W18MU|5.0|You don't have to be a Cash fan to love this album. It is the most touching from start to finish. It is a must have if you are a music fan. Although his voice is weaker than in younger years, it is perhaps in best form nevertheless. His song \\"If you could read my mind\\" a Gordon Lightfoot songs brings tears to my eyes. Sit in silence and listen, it is centering, it is moving and will touch you in places you didn't know you had. He stayed true to himself, he lived his last few years with courage and dignity and never stopped singing. What a wonderful tribute album. KH in Lake Havasu City, AZ
B000008HPE|5.0|There are some very quality songs on this album, from the hit Jacob's Ladder to the a capella Naturally to Hip to be Square.  The gamut is covered here.  It's a more mature collection than Sports and as such it wasn't the commercial success that the aforementioned album was.  That shouldn't diminish its value as to the listener.  Unlike many recordings of that era, this one isn't filled with trite bubble-gum ditties or overly-dramatic anthems.  It strikes a good balance.  It's one of my favorite albums of the period and my all-time favorite of the band's.
B0000DBJDM|2.0|When Johnny Rotten wore a T-shirt saying \\"I hate Pink Floyd,\\" this is probably the sort of fare he had in mind, not \\"Arnold Lane\\" or even \\"Green is the Color.\\"  This project boils all of the humor and verbal elegance out of  a band that at its best unites cool melodies  and  compelling lyrics.  But in this desolate if beautiful locale,  the Floyd  plays  ponderous, predictable instrumentals that can't compete with contemporary efforts by Crimson or Yes,  and  two of these stodgy, interminable pieces  make useless and unfunny references to murder in their titles.  This is a slog fest  musically with banal if well-shot  visual poetry about volcanoes and ruins larded in.  This obviously gave the makers of \\"Spinal Tap\\" grist for making fun of prog rock's pretentious attempts to cathect to archetypal histories and energies while ironically making dull music. David Gilmore himself says of this era of the band:  \\"we were scraping the bottom of the barrel.\\"
B00000IOSU|5.0|Many people (such as myself) often judge an artist by their ability to perform their own works live and Sarah McLachlan doesn't disappoint.  Her voice is beautiful throughout and there's just enough crowd noise and interaction to get the \\"feel\\" of being live without getting bored with it.  While I would have preferred the track list that the DVD has, I was very pleased with the quantity and quality of her selections as well as the performances themselves.  If there's one song I really wish was included, it would be Ben's Song, but aside from that, you get a great overview of her great career prior to Afterglow.  It has everything from uptempo Sweet Surrender and Vox to slower tracks like Angel and I Love You and even includes the fun duet with her husband and drummer Ashwin Sood \\"Ice Cream\\" though in the future he should probably stick to drumming. :)<br /><br />Mirrorball ranks as one of the best albums in my collection and for a live album that's saying a lot.  It is also my first choice for anyone who asks, \\"I want a friend to hear her stuff but I know know what I should suggest\\".
B000FVQYYK|4.0|If I were to say I've been a Muse fan for as long as I can remember, I'd be lying. Mostly because I've liked Muse since Summer 2004 when a friend of mine first showed me \\"Hysteria\\" from the album \\"Absolution,\\" and I can vividly remember 2003, 2002, and so forth. Clever introductions aside, I am really a Muse fan! Absolution and Origin of Symmetry are, in my opinion two of the greatest rock albums of all time and feature some of my favorite songs ever! Needless to say, I was really excited when I heard that the band was finally going to release a new album, titled \\"Black Holes and Revelations.\\"<br /><br />\\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" is a much different album as their previous efforts. For Muse fans, it's about the same as the difference between \\"Showbiz\\" and \\"Absolution.\\" In other words, very different. The biggest change for this album over their past works is that \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" is more of a politically-charged, straightforward rock album than the epic, orchestra-laden nature of \\"Absolution\\" or the catchy, power rock of \\"Symmetry.\\" In that light, it could be viewed as a bit of a disappointment to many Muse fans, but it is undoubtedly sure to capture new fans along the way.<br /><br />The first song on the album, \\"Take a Bow,\\" is also probably the most politically-charged song, just as \\"Apocalypse Please\\" was for \\"Absolution\\". This time around, though, it's much more intense and angry than its predecessor and it doesn't take a genius to figure out who Matthew is speaking of when he belts out \\"Cast a spell on the country you run. You will risk all their lives and their souls.\\" At the same time, one can't help but agree when he proclaims \\"Our freedom's consuming itself. What we've become, it's contrary to what we want.\\" It's a very powerful song, and poignant for those who share his views.<br /><br />The next notable song on the album is the first single, \\"Supermassive Black Hole,\\" which superbly showcases Muse's range of ability. Being a danceable, rock-pop song, the track is far different from every other song on the album. That being said, it's also my favorite and I've been listening to it regularly for over a month. For Muse fans, it might be a tough sell, based off of the falsetto vocals and poppy guitar riffs, but it is by far the most accessible song on the album and is sure to win the band some new listeners. \\"Map of the Problamatique\\" seems pretty accessible as well. Though I didn't really enjoy it too much, the lingering piano in the background for some reason remind me of really cool 80s music, and that makes it somewhat bearable.<br /><br />\\"Soldier's Poem\\" is another politically-themed song, but this time written from the perspective of a soldier at war (which I'm sure Matthew knows so much about!). The song really harkens back to 50s rock ballads. The Flamingos especially come to mind here, especially when Matthew sings, \\"There's no justice in the world and there never was.\\" It really is a beautiful song and serves as a very nice intermission, or a break from the rock music.<br /><br />\\"Invincible\\" is also a powerful song, whose military-style drum cadence helps build the song to its dramatic climax when Matthew declares \\"Tonight we can truly say `Together we're invincible'\\". The last or so of this song is beautiful, shocking, and amazing and really must be experienced to understand. My only complaint about the song is that Mathew seems to be over-singing throughout most of its 5-minutes. Despite this, it still manages to be a standout track on the album.<br /><br />\\"Assassin\\" is a pretty driving rock song at the beginning, sounding surprisingly like Pantera for a while, but it eventually becomes pretty repetitive and, as a result, boring. Still, if there was a song on the album that \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" fans would enjoy, it would probably be this one, even though \\"Oppose and disagree. Destroy demonocracy!\\" is an actual lyric in the song.<br /><br />The next notable track is \\"City of Delusion,\\" and is arguably the most impressive song on the album in terms of musicality. Matthew pulls no stops on this song and the rest of the band follows, even adding in the string-orchestration that made \\"Absolution\\" such a fresh album. There's even an incredibly impressive trumpet solo about 3/4s of the way in that makes the song even better. \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" is the last track on the album, and it features one of the coolest choruses in recent memory; a heavily vocodorized harmonic declaration of \\"No one's gonna take me alive! Time has come to make things right! You and I must fight for our rights! You and I must fight to survive!\\" Honestly, it's really a very cool way to end the album and the guitars and drums that accompany it are also incredible.<br /><br />When I first listened to \\"Black Holes and Revelations,\\" I was a bit disappointed. As a hardcore Muse fan, I have to say that I was expecting something much different than what I got. In a sense, I was expecting more of the same from one of my favorite bands. What I got, however, was the next evolutionary stage from a band that has evolved consistently since their inception. I should have known better, but I'm glad I gave it a few more listens. \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" truly has some amazing songs on it, songs that could undoubtedly be considered some of the best of the year, thus far. If you're a Muse fan who can't decide whether or not to buy it, I say go for it! There's really not a whole lot to lose by purchasing this album. It is breathtaking!<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Muse and anyone who really wants to be rocked!<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Take a Bow\\"<br />2. \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\"<br />3. \\"Soldier's Poem\\"<br />4. \\"Invincible\\"<br />5. \\"City of Delusion\\"<br /><br />4 out of 5 Starserms of musicality.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|How many compilations exist for the Beatles?  Whether it's the Red & Blue sets, Anthology, or Rarities, you can't swing a stick without hitting some collection of hits.  Which one do you choose?  You simply can't go wrong with One.  It's got every number 1 hit on both the US & UK charts so there are very few classics left out.  It also has the benefit of being an unbiased method of song selection.  It's not comprehensive, but you can't beat it if you want some general Beatles stuff for your car or your iPod.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Every once in a while, you stumble across a movie that is surprising in its ability to entertain.  This movie surpasses that standard by leaps and bounds (literally).  I didn't choose to watch this film, and wouldn't have, but am very glad I did.  Other reviewers have told you the plot, and I won't bother.  What's worth knowing that others don't tell you is that if you want to maximize the entertainment, watch it in dubbed English WITH the English subtitles.  You'll find that they use completely different scripts that were prepared by people having wildly divergent abilities to translate from the original Cantonese.  Taking both in simultaneously only adds to the hilarity of an already tumultously funny film.
0812550706|5.0|If you like Star Wars and space books then you will like Ender's Game.  I am going into high school and I am 14 years old. There are a good amount of characters.  Ender is a 6-year-old boy who is supposed to save the world.  He is a genius.  It is interesting because a 6-year-old tries to save the world when this doesn't normally happen.  The book shifts scenes so it keeps you on your toes.  The language is challenging so it should be for a high school or older kid.  Someone reading this book will want to buy the next book because the last chapter leads into Speaker for the Dead.
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|This isn't a good movie, the dialogue and acting are not first class, it is not gritty, is is not amazing.  Everything that Clint Eastwood touches does not turn to gold.  The acting is painful to watch. The characters are mostly so objectionable, you hate them all.  This is a mediocre thriller devoid of excitement. The murder is explained at the end but there are many holes in the story. The reasons for the killing were quite weak. This movie is slow and dull. Too many talky scenes between the policemen. How many more movies do we have to see with disagreeing cops?<br /><br />The actors are pretending they are acting in a great movie. That sums it up for me. It's not a great movie. It's basically an extended TV show.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I didn't wanna like it. I refused to watch it. I'm in my 30's............ <br />This is the best show on T.V. <br />Fans range from 6 to 60. Male and female. <br />I have now seen every episode available. (Bought all 4 seasons on Amazon and will buy 5 in September.) <br />Can't wait til' Season 6 begins. <br />WATCH THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />It's the best show...EVER !!!!
B000002C1W|5.0|To be perfectly honest,  I was merely a fair- weather Floyd fan back in the day. Of course I had Dark Side of the Moon and Meddle, then Animals. I found The Wall too cynical for my tastes, although it was a far- out trip while under the influence of certain substances.... This music sounds an awful lot like Pink Floyd to my ears, regardless of the involvement of several guest musicians and the absence of Roger Waters. No, the lyrics don't have the same angst or sting, but a little of those go a long way with me. Thank God as I got older I wasn't so freakin' angry all the time! But here's a good example of just how good this music is. Whenever I purchase a used CD I'll listen to it to make sure it doesn't skip (and some of these sessions can be downright dull!) But I couldn't wait to listen to this over again (and again.) This is quite unnatural for me so I thought i'd better get on the horn and let those who have missed- out on this for so many years (like me) can rest assured that this disc is worth the asking price. I guess I never purchased this earlier because I got kinda sick of \\"Learning To Fly\\" on MTV (whatever happened to them?) and \\"On The Turning Away\\" was always on the radio, which is still one of my fave songs EVER. But there's a whole lot more vintage- sounding Floyd to experience here. And Dave's guitar never sounded better. So do yourself a great favor. Take a deep breath, push the \\"ADD TO CART\\" button, and enjoy immensely!
B000BTC5LW|3.0|After waiting years to see Pulse on DVD, I have to say I am disappointed with the DVD. The concert is amazing, but as already posted in other reviews, it was shot in video instead of film. The result is clearly visible and the image quality is poor - too bad, as the visual effects would look amazing on a large screen. <br /> <br />Anyway, it is still a must-have for Pink Floyd fans. You might be a little disappointed with the image quality, but you will definitely not regret your purchase.
0060254920|5.0|I remember this book from my childhood, and when my daughter became old enough, I bought a hard cover edition for her. It's her favorite bedtime story. She is 4 years old and can recite almost the entire book from memory. <br /> <br />It's the simplest of stories, but the thing that always strikes me is the faith that home is the place where you are loved most of all, and supper will always be waiting for you. And it will still be warm.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|Rihanna is the new face of Urban Pop.  What is Urban Pop?  It's been around since the creation of R&B.  Sure, it's had other names you might be more familiar with like Poppy R&B, Mainstream R&B, or even Hip-Pop.  Whatever you call this sound, it's a formula that's worked for many people, whether it's just for a single track or an entire career.  Artists can catch the Urban Pop bug when they want to \\"crossover\\" and sell their work to more than just the loyal fan base that's paid the bills for them since day one.  Sometimes it can be fatal when you switch up your style just for airplay (look at Ja Rule), but then sometimes it can be profitable too (i.e. Black Eyed Peas).  But then you have artists who just simply embrace the format as if it was a separate genre, namely Rihanna.  She's hard to place in one category or style of music since she can bust out a power ballad then turn around and do a Caribbean-induced dance track in the same breath.  It seems to have worked for her with  2005's Music Of The Sun.  Now back again less than a year later with her latest album A Girl Like Me, she further places herself in the ever-growing category of  'OTHER'.<br /><br />The first single \\"S.O.S.\\" goes straight for the pocketbooks of the mainstream with its reassuring melody.  Her power ballads like \\"Unfaithful,\\" \\"A Million Miles Away,\\" and \\"Final Goodbye\\" go well beyond the regular stuff you'd see on American Idol.  The best ballad on the album has to be \\"P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You)\\" with it's well thought-out lyrics and straightforward delivery.  She doesn't run away from the dancehall ditty of her previous smash \\"Pon De Replay\\" though.  She enlists the help of Sean Paul for \\"Break It Off,\\" a definite contender to be the next single off the album.  She also embraces her Caribbean background for songs like \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\\" \\"Dem Haters,\\" \\"Kisses Don't Lie,\\" and \\"Selfish Girl.\\"  She has some regular, nondescript songs like \\"A Girl Like Me\\" and \\"We Ride\\" as well.<br /><br />Sure, Rihanna doesn't have any problem grabbing the attention of everybody that listens to popular music.  Her looks are non-threatening to industry professionals (and the men and young boys out there certainly aren't complaining either), the pop style that MTV loves, the urban flavor that BET looks for, and the innocence that parents seek out for their daughters to listen to.  A Girl Like Me is a sure thing on all levels.  Being a native of Barbados, Rihanna has the complete package when it comes to developing her into an international superstar.l.  <br /> <br />Sure, Rihanna doesn't have any problem grabbing the attention of everybody that listens to popular music.

B000BTC5LW|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this is a great DVD and I am a huge Floyd fan.  The problem is that 4 songs were left off.  Astronomy Domine, What Do You Want From Me, A Great Day For Freedom and Hey You.  Hey You?  Are you kidding me?
B000003TA4|5.0|First of all, I'd like to say something directly to the reviewer \\"achilles last stand\\". Kurt Cobain was a rock god and the voice of a generation, and anybody who says things like you did about him deserves do be crucified. So next time you feel the urge to talk s***, just hold it in. To all people who are looking for a great album, buy it. 'Nuff said.
B000002J7U|5.0|When it comes to relaxing music which makes your soul recover and you brain waves move in an harmonic way Vangelis' Voices is a must. Chariots of Fire and Oceanic are also Vangelis albums that has a beautiful overall feeling and can also be considered masterpieces withing their genre but Voices is the album that at least for me works best when it comes to relaxing and just feeling good after a stressful day or after a day full of pumping rock music around you.     The reason I think many people like this album even though they don't like New Age in general is Vangelis' capabilities to mix colourful, touching and melodic music into something soulhealing and relaxing that makes your soul get lighter and easier. Many New Age artists has the ability to write music that works as a stresshealer, but many listeners I think get turned of by the lack of emotion in the music. There's a lot to take in here; a loads of touching sounds and beutiful harmonies and a sound that sometimes makes me feel like I can touch it, like it moves into my body like a healing energy making me leave the place I'm in for the moment. Works excellent for both meditation and background music but maybe not for party :).
B00005B36H|5.0|OK. I know a lot of people have complained about this album because it doesn't sound exactly the same as \\"Aenima\\" or \\"Opiate\\" or \\"Undertow\\". That doesn't matter. Tool changes and gets better with every CD. All of you who are mad becaused they changed, why would you want to buy the same CD. Most bands stay the same and get boring. Tool never lets you figure them out. I will go as far to say that this is the best CD ever. I fyou don't agree, click \\"NO\\". If you don't buy this record, its your loss alone.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|My friends listen to John Mayer.  I heard his music through them.  I liked the music but it didn't reach my soul.  I actually didn't pay much attention.  I was flipping through the TV Channels late one night and caught a PBS concert.  This guy was playing the guitar like Stevie Ray Vaughn.  I didn't even recognize this guy as John Mayer.  I love Stevie Ray Vaughn and was so impressed with the talent of this guitar player.  At the end of the concert I realized it was John Mayer.   <br />The next day I told my co-worker who is a big John Mayer fan and she said to listen to John Mayer Trio.  I immediately bought the CD.  This music has touched my soul,deeply. This albumn is outstanding! I am a John Mayer fan for life!
B000EULJLU|5.0|First of all, what the f*** does filler mean. If you think that this album does not live up to any of their others, then you are a complete idiot. Being a long time fan of Tool, I have all of their CD's and know that they get better with each release. When I picked this up on May 2nd, I was blown away. People who gave this low scores because they were expecting Aenima 2 are just stupid. I recommend to anyone who likes good music. To all low reviewers: if you don't like it, form a band. When you make a better album, I'll back down.
B000002G0P|5.0|This album ranks in my top 10 of all time. It's not all about the lyrics for me, but the quality of the recording that blows me away. I have rarely heard a better mixed album. A glass of wine..some great headphones, and you are in for a great evening of listening pleasure. I am glad to see they are doing a few re-union dates.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Or, Blowing [expletive!]* up in Defense of Liberty is no Vice.<br /><br />Look: Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman, who has the greatest name in show biz) is an underemployed former uber-hacker who spent some time in the pen and squirms under the Mother of All Restraining Orders, forbidding him any quality time with his adorable little daughter, now the step-child of a California Porn-King (those Kali divorce courts, man, I tell ya!).<br /><br />Given that he bats golfballs off the top of his stinky trailer, situated in what looks to be a combo nuclear waste-dump/oil refinery/Hellhole, it doesn't take Hugh a lotta thinkin' to consider hopping back on the Hackery Horse, especially when the offer is ONE-HUNDRED-THOUSAND Iron Men, just for a meeting with his prospective Boss, the mysterious Gabriel (John Travolta & a Moustache).<br /><br />It doesn't hurt negotiations that Halle Berry (Ginger, but you knew that) shows up to do the, um, negotiating. Let's cut this short: Gabriel & his Moustachio want Jackman to dump a cyber-worm, a vicious little buggy program, into the cybernetic spine of a series of DEA bank accounts (you don't need to know), looting, raping, burning and pillaging about 10 billion bucks from Uncle Sam. Hugh lets his tappity-tapping fingers do the walking.<br /><br />That's not really why you see \\"Swordfish\\", though: this sick, nihilistic little sliver of cinematic Jagermeister is, to me, Happiness Incarnate, a film I can watch a zillion times and love all the more.<br /><br />Why? Because director Dominic Sena & Uber-Producer Joel Silver get it: I go to flicks because I want to see John Travolta (& freaky chin-stache) ripping out their SAW and taking down military black-ops guys while speeding down Wilshire Boulevard in a street-illegal Tuscan TVR-S. Yeah!<br /><br />Because they know I want to see Halle Berry shimmy it down to a wire & a G-string, and mebbe a magazine, dropped at the best possible moment. Because I want to see [expletive!] blow up. Because I wanna see helicopters, and police troopers in riot gear, and villainous cigar-chomping US Senators (courtesy, thank you very much, of Sam Shephard, who chomps and plots with the best of them) and little nasty steel ball bearings ripping through all of God's Green Creation, because when I go to an action flick I wanna see action, dammit!<br /><br />And because I wanna see Travolta in some weird Chin-Fu moustachio & a beret. Oh, and did I mention Travolta spends time a) kicking [naughty word] and b) taking names? And he really doesn't get around to taking names because he's totally swamped kicking [censored!]?<br /><br />There's also a kind of admirable ethos at work here---to say any more would spoil your fun---and it's always a joy to see a little Termination, with Extreme Prejudice, employed in the service of God and Country.<br /><br />Dominic Sena delivers: lots of [naughty word] blows up, Halle Berry lets it all hang out, Travolta tears around town in a bunch of exotics, smokes stogies, unloads whupa$$ with a fully-loaded-for-bear SAW, and spends quality time with his funky chin-moustachio.

B000E97HIA|4.0|Prince deserves to blow up HUGE again and show the music industry and world what a true artist is.  I think \\"3121\\" is a terrific step in that direction. <br /> <br />I like every song on this one.  My favourties are: \\"3121\\", \\"Lolita\\", \\"Black Sweat\\", \\"Fury\\" and \\"Get On The Boat\\". <br /> <br />I hope he keeps up his penchant for more \\"commercial\\" fare so that he can recapture the glory and praise of his heyday...he deserves it!  Not many artists this long into their career can still blow em away.
0679731725|4.0|When one begins to despair about the quality (or lack thereof) of the modern novel you come across a gem which dispels that despair for the time being. Not only is this one a gem but also it is something much more and being just over 240 pages one that I finished all too quickly. I could not get enough of it. The narrator and main character of the novel is a Mr. Stevens who is the butler of a mansion where he heads a considerable compliment of staff to keep it running smoothly. His employer, a Lord Darlington, is doing what he can to alleviate some of the supposed harsher terms of the Versailles treaty and realizes too late that he was being used as a pawn by the Germans. And what did Mr. Stevens think of this? He didn't, he maintains that wondering about what was happening would have interfered with his running of the estate. There is also the head housekeeper that he buts heads with a few times and also a few other instances which makes one wonder if she has something other that a professional interest in Mr. Stevens. You'll have to read the book if you want to know more. I read mainly Victorian literature simply because they are well written and what passes for a novel nowadays usually is not. If you get this book you will not be sorry.
B000FA57RG|4.0|Alright, so lets get a few things out of the way. First of all, for anyone out there that is looking for a Truth Or Dare Part II, they will be in for a disappointment. Secondly, if you are looking for a documentary with extensive concert footage you are not going to be pleased.  <br />What \\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret\\" does is show the world where Madonna is at mentally, emotionally and spiritually at this point in her life and in that lies its greatest strength. The former Material Girl has certainly come a long way from the sexually decadent, impossibly spoilt and narcissistic entertainer she was back in the early nineties. Now she is a devoted wife and a mother of two who finds herself asking deeper questions about the purpose of her life and how to reconcile her fame with hew newfound sense of spirituality. <br />I don't there is any other rock documentary out there that leaves its audience with the inspiration to go out and become a better version of him/herself and provokes thought the way this one does. I think the best parts of this documentary are Madonna's own personal meditations and thoughts on life. For example her description of what is light and what is chaos, her desire for not wanting life to be easy because that means not growing and, the one that really spoke to me, how to change...by constantly working at it. <br /> <br />Now I can already hear some of the criticisms coming towards this documentary. This is not an honest presentation of who Madonna truly is, this is yet another example of her manufacturing an image that she is trying to sell to the public. But even if that is the case, at least she is using that image to spread some good and positivity in the world. <br /> <br />As far as the music is concerned, it works as a backdrop to the documentary itself. There is not enough concert footage in here for any fan who did not get to see her Reinvention Tour and that is one the greatest flaws of the documentary. What is given are little snippets and small sections of songs from the setlist. Madonna's voice strains to be heard over all the techno beats and instrumentation and the only time it truly shines is during the haunting ballad \\"Lament\\". Other moments that struck me as odd watching this documentary was how once the tour ended, the entire focus of the film was bluntly shifted towards her devotion towards Kabbalah. Also, the moments that introduced her with her husband and her kids seemed horribly contrived on film. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the overall message of this documentary is one of inspiration. Madonna said in the film that she feels that is her job to wake people up and give them a direction. Well with \\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret\\" she certainly rips the blindfolds off the world and makes her audience questions who they are and how they can become better people.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuasion may not have the wit of Pride & Prejudice, the morality of Mansfield Park or Sense & Sensibility, or the delightful twists and turns of Emma and Northanger Abby, but it is probably Jane Austen's most mature and achingly romantic story.  By the same token, this film version of Persuasion, while perhaps lacking the glamourous faces and costumes that adorn the flock of Austen films produced in the mid-1990's, is far and away the most faithfully adapted movie of the lot.  Nick Dear's script is beautifully spare, relying on the subtly expressive faces and gestures of a cast that is absolute perfection.  Filmed completely on-location, and using only natural light, every scene seems to have been painted directly from Miss Austen's imagination.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|You just have to shake your head in wonder when it comes to someone like Madonna. The woman is pushing 50 and still has this inability (or obsession) to NOT stay in one spot. If you look at her career right from the beginning it is littered with examples of her ability to not let people pigeonhole her into one category. Whether she shocks people by writing onstage at the MTV Awards in 1984, creates an uproar with the Vatican or locks lips with Britney Spears, you just never know where Madonna is going to take you at any given moment. <br /> <br />With her latest release \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" Madonna winds back the clock and returns to her dancefloor origins. Enlisting the help of DJ Stuart Price, Madge has put out one of the most consistent and polished album of her career. Forget the ballads or any breaks between the songs, this album is one designed strictly for the dance clubs and it is a solid reminder as to why Madonna is commonly referred to as the Queen of Pop. <br />Right from the opener, the impossibly catchy and infectious \\"Hung Up\\" straight through to the final notes of \\"Like It Or Not\\", the album plays as the soundtrack to one crazy, sweaty night on the dancefloor. The lyrical themes within the songs are reminiscent of the introspective, thought provoking lyrics of her previous album \\"American Life\\"....yet considering how that album flopped commercially Madonna wisely packages her lines around Stuart Price's compelling beats.  <br /> <br />Truth be told, the true star of this album is not Madonna. That could be the case for any album she has ever put out. Madonna's greatest strength in the studio has always been teaming up with the right people at the right time and managing their input to give her the sound that will re-invent her...that is what her career has always been about. This time around it is no different, the real stars of \\"Confessions...\\" are the producers that breathe life into Madonna's weak and straining voice and give her the platform to work her charm on a live audience once she hits the road with her \\"Confessions Tour\\". <br /> <br />As a whole package, this album is great fun to listen to and will guarantee to get you on your feet and dancing along to it.
B00005JOQS|1.0|When I watched the trailers I thought wow, this is going to be good!  But no chance, it fell well below expectations.  Only good bits were the special effects, but unlike the trailers were they are all crammed together this film drags on so much you hardily recognise them.  When you watch a film and your concentration moves away, you know its a bad film.  Don't be fooled by the Teaser/Trailers - Avoid !
0688014291|3.0|My first real manager pointed me in the direction of this book, and you know what it's helpful.  Offering some nice tips on how to make people feel important.  One tip in the book about touching people on the elbow or shoulder really adds something to a quick exchange.  Nothing earth shattering here but if you are new to managment or want to brush up on some concepts before going on a first interview for a managment job this is a nice read.
0345452585|1.0|I certainly would not recommend this book to anyone as a first Kellerman's novel.<br /><br />There are too many medical jargons and terms as if Kellerman is trying to show off his medical knowledge. There are just too many unnecessary references to either the rarer or more serious and feared disorders unrelated to the story and thus causing a lot of side tracking which to me is a pure waste of time reading and boring to readers especially those with medical knowledge. It took me a long long time to finish this novel and thought of discarding it numerous times even when I was more than half way through the novel! This is especially so after having read the very exciting Robert Crais's \\"Demolition Angel\\" followed by Lee Child's \\"One Shot\\".<br /><br />The story in this book are also full of loop holes and I cannot buy the idea of a Conspiracy Club using Jeremy to get to the killer and allowing more murders to take place while he was stressfully doing so.<br /><br />However, I must admit that I did enjoy reading a couple of Kellerman's other novels \\"Murder Book\\" & \\"When the Bough Breaks\\" quite some time ago.
038542471X|3.0|You can hardly read this with out putting it down... although I grew up with Brad Renfro a smartmouthed, punk being Mark Sway... in the book... he is a bit of a weenie, I mean in some parts I see the movie Mark, like in the book when they are at Clifford's house.. he wasn't afraid of anything.. but some parts he was crying unconsolably... you kind of get mixed feelings about mark... I don't know maybe if I had read the book first, I would feel differently, but I feel the movie was much better... made Mark seem more real in my honest opinion. I will give Grishams other books a chance.. the only other movie I have seen is A Time To Kill... The Client was my first Grisham book/movie.. I'll have to check out ATTK...
B00006LWSF|5.0|Seeing I am a big fan of Eminem I had to get this soundtrack. It has the new single Lose Yourself and other songs by Eminem + lots of others by other artists. It has the song \\"8 Mile\\" the movie title and \\"Rabbit Run\\" a great lyrical song. Only two of these songs (Lose Yourself and 8 Mile) were actually played in the movie but the rest of them were good to make up a whole album of good rap material. You should also get \\"More Music From 8 Mile\\" which has all the songs played in the film, with songs by 2pac, Mobb Deep, Notorious BIG, Outkast, Naughty By Nature and more all pretty good. On the soundtrack Lose Yourself would have to be my favourite song. Lose Yourself is actually one of my favourite of all Eminem songs with great lyrical verses etc. However i'm also a fan of 50 Cent and D12 so their songs I am a fan of aswell. Good Eminem
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I won't bother to review the disc since the concert has been known for a long time as amazing. It brings back great memories of seeing that tour twice (including the ONLY indoor performace in the U.S. at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse). The sound is phenomenal. Is it just me or are the some of the cutaway shots grainier than the VHS? Must be one of the \\"technical difficulties\\" Gilmour was referring to.
B000006XSD|3.0|... is that he tries many differnt styles of music and obviously seems to have fun making all these creative and original songs and albums.  Though, this is one of his weakest, it is still worth the price as some songs are just beautiful such as \\"It's Hot Tonight\\", \\"Lace and Whiskey\\" and \\"You and Me\\".  Alice is incredibly talented and always keeps things interesting.  Also, try the following album FROM THE INSIDE, thats far superior and absoutely flawless.
B000AADYYO|5.0|For me, Ghost Reveries started out as a so-so listen.  It was good, but I found myself returning to Blackwater Park each time I tried to listen to Ghost Reveries.  Then...one day...I got it.  I don't know what happened, but I finally just calmed down and listened to this disc with a keen ear.<br /><br />I've now come to the conclusion that this recording is the best piece of music I've ever heard (so far).  That's saying a lot for a dedicated Rush fanboy.<br /><br />This record has it all.  Killer drum work, outstanding guitar playing and sound, and a sonic assault on the bass guitar.  Textured, beautiful, acoustic guitar work is also found here.  Akerfeldt's vocals have never been better.  You think death vocals are easy to do?  Don't think it's singing?  Try and imitate Mikael Akerfeldt sometime.  What's more, his \\"clean\\" vocals are just that...clean, pleasing, beautiful.  This record breaks new ground and sets a standard I don't think anyone can live up to...'cept maybe Opeth.<br /><br />I like these guys so much that in my next novel, they're getting a nod on the \\"Acknowledgements\\" page.  That's how much they've inspired me to strive for excellence.  That's what this disc is...about an hour's worth of excellence.
0440539811|2.0|This book was a disappointment because of the wonderful potential it wastes. Conspiracies within conspiracies, numerology, the ancient origins of man, immanentizing the eschaton, horrifying creatures from Lovecraft's imagination, a golden submarine, an evil rock band, and a sea monster nearly as old as time itself--all of these are fantastic fodder for what I expected to be the ultimate conspiracy book. Unfortunately, Wilson and Shea went out of their way to make the book as unengaging as possible, thereby squandering many of the great ideas they began with.    *Illuminatus* is weighed down by a small army of characters that, save for five or six of them, are either feckless, uninteresting, unlikeable or completely irrelevant. For every fascinating character like Hagbard Celene, we have guys like Markoff Cheney, who has an interesting background but adds little to the overall story. Same with Otto Waterhouse. And Atlanta Hope. And Jim Cartwright. The list goes on. The book's second-most intriguing character, Robert Putney Drake, gets several scenes and a terrific back story. The authors reward us for investing in Drake by having him brood about his purpose in life and little else. There are too many people to keep track of, especially frustrating considering several of them could've been combined (George Dorn/Joe Malik) or deleted altogether (Muldoon, Pricefixer).    A worse sin, however, was the writing itself. Plot lines and points of view will change mid-paragraph with no warning whatsoever. The prose is poorly constructed, loaded with passive sentences.    This book's defenders will say its free form style is done on purpose to create an acid trip-like reading experience, or pull out excuses like, \\"it makes you think,\\" or \\"you just don't get it.\\" The authors--and a few reviewers, apparently--cannot tell the difference between a \\"mindf**k\\" and \\"confusion for confusion's sake.\\" Being irritating on purpose is still irritating.    Hey, some books are more challenging than others. I don't mind walking uphill to get into a novel. I do mind when the authors expect me to walk uphill while a gorilla throws barrels at me.    This book is not a complete wash. I loved the 23 enigma, the law of fives, the American Medical Association, and many other aspects of this book. The good parts are as fascinating as any book I've read. But you often have to wade through fifty-plus pages of rambling philosophy to get to them.    This trilogy could have--and should have--been shortened by at least 300 pages. The authors' inability to self-edit explains why this book had difficulty getting published originally. That they were able to get this self-indulgent mess into print at all is testament to just how good their good ideas are.
B000EGCITG|5.0|After the somewhat dissapointing, (but still great) cd Try This, Pink disappeard for a few years from the music scene practically without a trace. Finally news of her new cd started leaking in magazines and the net. I kept up on the news and kept track of the cd. The day it came out I went and got it.    Pink is an amazing woman who is very talented and a woman of her own. This cd is her best by far. Let me break down the track list    \\"Stupid Girls\\" 5/5-Very funny song, classic Pink. Very funny music video to go along.    \\"Who Knew\\" 5/5-Very heartbreaking about loss of a love to drugs. Very sad just like \\"Family Portriat\\" one of my favs.    \\"Long Way to Happy\\" 4/5-Very rocking song, more of her Mizundastood days. Shows she can rock like the rest.    \\"Nobody Knows\\" 3/5-Kinda mediocre although her vocals still shine. Wrote for her husband.    \\"Dear Mr. President\\" 5/5-VERY good song. About time someone asked some much needed questions to the president. Wonderful collaboration with the Indigo Girls.    \\"I'm Not Dead\\" 3/5-Another one that isn't a fav. I think it's Pink saying that she's not dead from the music scene and to be ready for her return.    \\"Cuz I can\\" 4/5-Very funny song and very Pink. Bitchy and sarcastic to a point.    \\"Leave me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\" 3/5-Another okay song about Pink just saying she wants to be left alone sometimes and not to smother her. Still independent.    \\"U and Ur Hand\\" 4/5-Another sarcastic Pink song and very bitchy, very good and funny.    \\"Runaway\\" 2/5-Probably my most unliked song, of course her vocal are top notch, but don't like the song.    \\"The One That Got Away\\" 2/5-Ok another not very liked song. Pretty good song, just dont' like the sound.    \\"I Got Money Know\\" 5/5-Good song, talking about how she pretends not to be lonely or need friends because she has money and that's all she needs. Doth I protest too much??    \\"Conversations with my 13 Year Old Self\\" 4/5-Good song, sad. I think it's what Pink would wanna say to her self ifshe could go back in time and see herself.    This cd is a must for true Pink fans, and even ones that want to see what she is like. It has Pink in all her glory, from slower sad songs, to fast sarcastic songs, and even rock songs. Amazing
B00005UEAR|4.0|After the very succesful Scenes from a Memory album Dream Theater needed to release something fresh and inspired. This album has both those elements while still maintaining the characteristic Dream Theater touch. The album begins with one of the heaviest songs they have written and continues with another interesting song. Misunderstood is an interesting power ballad. Unfortunately the next two songs are nothing to write home about. The second CD consists of one single 42 minute song divided into 8 tracks. Very interesting song. To conclude, this album is a very good attempt by the band and is highly recommended.
0143034901|5.0|i started reading this book in a translated version to Chinese, and as for many other novels that i read, i usually split them up into several parts as possible so it wont disrupt my daily schedule.  however, the chinese version of La Sombra del Viento sounded a little bit hard to convince me due to the translation of names and places, though skeptical, i kept on readin. the night before my exam, i thought i could relax a bit by readin a novel then fell asleep peacefully..  unfortunately, i held the book until 6Am and my exam was within two hours,  i couldnt leave the book on the side because the storytellin master Mr. Ruiz Zafon has captured me completely into its shadows.  the book was very well written, stories within stories, plots and mysteries just kept me awake until i found the truth,  now, the chinese version really isnt enough for me, i m goin for the spanish and english version to see if i can be equally appalled by Mr. Ruiz Zafon even in other languages.!!
B000000993|5.0|Many people came to know Tool with the latest releases such as Lateralus and made themsome kind of gods. As a matter of fact Lateralus is a somewhat weak album compared to this masterpiece (and also its followup AEnima). This album is the one that set Tool as one of the best Progressive (with every meaning of the word) metal bands. They brought a fresh sound to an otherwise stale genre and still remained heavy with large compositions which never failed to remain interesting. \\"4\\",\\"Sober\\", \\"Prison Sex\\"....so many good songs in here. Listen to this album. It deserves it.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Others wrote really in depth reviews.  Read them, they are very good. All I'm going to say is that the music was absolutely amazing. The interviews and playful banter a bit odd. But best of all if reminded me of the late 60's early 70's.  The way people looked and talked.  If nothing else buy it for the music and the trip back in time.
B000002UB6|5.0|Interesting.  The last Beatles album.  \\"Get Back,\\" \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\"  \\"Across the Universe,\\"  and \\"I've Got a Feeling\\"  are the best tracks.   It would have been interesting if the Beatles would have stayed together for another 10 years.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I could watch the DVDs over and over. I love how I was able to relate to the characters and all they go through throughout the season. It's as close to capturing real life situations as is possible from a television show. It lefting me wanting the remaining seasons.
B00000064E|5.0|This is a perfect album, with perfect singing so intimate you feel like he's whispering in your ear, perfect guitar playing from the acknowledged \\"Hendrix of the acoustic,\\" and perfect arrangements with perfectly tasteful orchestrations and perfect contributions from the likes of Richard Thompson and Rocky Dzidzornu. <br /> <br />How this man avoided superstardom in his own (tragically brief) lifetime is anyone's guess... more than anything his refusal to tour and perform behind his albums probably did the most to conceal him from the public.  I suppose none of that matters now that so many people have jumped onto the Drake bandwagon and he is almost a household name, better later than never. <br /> <br />That said, there are no words to describe the shimmering beauty of not just these songs, but every single one the guy ever recorded.  Several of these tunes are legitimate entrants into the ongoing, mythological \\"Most Achingly Gorgeous Song Ever Written\\" competition, if there were ever to be such a thing.  \\"River Man\\" in particular is as close to Heaven that you'll find on Earth, odd as that seems for a song that alludes to the Underworld and Death.  Definitely the most melancholically beautiful song ever attempted in 5/4, that's for sure. <br /> <br />I adore every note of this record, but the standouts for me are the cryptic tale of the mysterious Jeremy in \\"Three Hours\\" (driven exquisitely by Rocky's percussion) and the opening song \\"Time Has Told Me,\\" which features an unbelievably soulful guitar commentary by Thompson, an inarguably certain first-ballot Music Hall of Famer in his own right.  Some people point to these two songs and a few others to make the claim that they prove Nick was gay, but that's all useless speculation that will never be resolved and who cares anyway?  One of his talents is in the oblique resonance of the lyrics (much like in Sandy Denny's work), where you don't quite get the whole picture of what he's talking about but it brings you totears anyway. <br /> <br />If you have never heard or heard of Nick Drake you should just buy the whole catalog of his 3 albums and the 2 compilations released posthumously (\\"Time of No Reply\\" and \\"Made to Love Magic\\") immediately and dive right in, because like I said he made no missteps whatsoever, just rare and complete perfection throughout.
B000002UAR|5.0|REVOLVER is one of the most influential records in rock and roll history.  The songs on the record helped defines the band's further experiment with music, which drew from various influences from drugs, poetry, and music from other musicians -- the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson, Blood, Sweat, and Tears, and the Lovin' Spoonful.  The album is a departure from their past efforts, and the three part harmonies and the yeah, yeah, yeah's of \\"She Loves You\\" are no longer present.  In its place are a tapestry of eclectic sounds that may heard from backward tape loops, strings and brass arrangements, and fuzz guitars.<br /><br />A few of the album's highlights include the opening track, \\"Taxman\\", which shows the band's political side (yes, Paul plays the raw lead guitar, which has been mentioned in Bob Spitz's Beatles biography and also in Barry Miles's McCartney bio MANY YEARS FROM NOW), John Lennon's \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" \\"Dr. Robert,\\" \\"She Said She Said,\\" and George Harrison's \\"Love You To.\\"  Paul's \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" and George's \\"I Want To Tell You\\" offer the most sentimental side of the record.  Yes, \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" has a very dark and brooding poetic quality, but Ringo and the boys offer fun and galore with the animated \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and \\"Good Day Sunshine\\".<br /><br />REVOLVER is the record before Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and the sounds that are heard on this record further blossomed on Pepper.  If listeners hear the albums in chronological order, one will definitely hear why the Beatles are significant in musical history.
0763619612|5.0|As a special education teacher I took a different message from the one intended by the author: when we honor what children CAN do, and give them the time/opportunity to demonstrate how far they can take that...they may surprise us, and even surprise themselves.  I think it is particularly telling that the author/illustrator dedicated this book to his 7th grade /math/ teacher...clearly a teacher who could challenge/inspire/motivate his students to excell, even if that excelling was to be demonstrated in an area other than his own. <br /> <br />Mrs. Robin Killoran
B00003CXAW|5.0|With the recent re-make of this film, I hope more people take the opportunity to check this movie out, the original King Kong, if they've never seen it. <br /> <br />This movie must have been astounding to the people watching it over 70 years ago. I doubt they'd ever seen anything like this, action-wise, and monster-wise. It is still fascinating today, even with the great advancements in special effects. <br /> <br />Most action films from the classic years, from 1920 to the late 1960s had corny mostly unrealistic special effects but this film still holds up, extraordinarily so considering its age. The film also had a tremendous amount of action. People today are usually bored watching old black-and-white movies but they wouldn't be bored with this one. Once the \\"girl,\\" Fay Wray gets captured by King Kong, the rest of the movie is one long action scene.....but not way overdone as the 2005 version was. <br /> <br />Two re-makes and this old, old film still is the best King Kong. Amazing! <br />
B00005JNJV|3.0|I'm not sure I like Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Everytime I see him, I await for him to pull out a chainsaw and start slicing people. Yes, I'm referring to his role in American Psycho. A role he will never be able to escape, in my opinion. He has looked menacing in everything since that movie. And Batman Begins is no exception.    I miss the interpretation of Michael Keaton. Before 1989, no one would have fathomed Keaton as Batman. He was predominately a comedic actor. But he made it work. He was slightly off-kilter and bumbling, but could still kick butt when it was time. He understood the balance and the difference between Bruce Wayne and Batman. Something none of the others could.    I'm not going to even comment on them casting Katie Holmes, a girl just barely in her mid-twenties playing a D.A. We seem to be witnessing the same problem in the latest Superman movie with Lois Lane. Hollywood, there are women in their thirties around.
1573921394|5.0|Sitting here is Baghdad, one hears often a simple solution to the counter insurgency problem.  Usually it's some combination of winning hearts and minds and killing terrorists.  The solution may be closer to burying money in the sand.  That idea came from John Maynard Keynes who faced far larger problems than the war in Iraq.  It's been 21 years since I read Keynes' General Theory, eighty years since it was first published.  (My Econ department believed in teaching both major economic choices of the day:  Capitalism and Communism.  So I got some look at both.)  What sold me on Keynes was his General Theory.  What turned me against Marxism were my visits to Eastern Block countries where I could see its effect...on the economy and on humanity.  There is a heart inside Keynes book, the General Theory, the same heart that wrote The Economic Consequences of the Peace. Keynes does get blamed for failed economic policies of those Keynesians of the sixties and seventies who believed they could tinker the economy into perfection.  Mistrust developed in Keynes General Theory.  But when I read his book, from start to finish, I came to the conclusion that people just didn't finish the book.  They must have skipped over the second half to believe you could just spend your way to prosperity or reverse bad times with clever monetary policy.  His theory has worked for 80 years.  The book may not be for you, but it is a masterpiece, something to be savored as the seminal work which transformed Classical Economics at a time when the world needed saving, when the alternative, Marxism, which stole the heart of half the globe, but would prove capable only of impoverishing and dehumanizing. The world owes more the Keynes than it acknowledges.  If you love the history of ideas, it's a must read or at least it adds a credibility to your library which a select few can appreciate.
0425173755|5.0|Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express is by far the best mystery novel I have read to date. I picked this book up three years ago when I was in seventh grade and let me tell you it was worth it. This book is very concise with detailed descriptions of each passanger boarding the train. One's idea of who did what changes with each chapter as more convincing evidence comes to light until the final five pages where the mystery is solved throws you off balance. This novel kept me thinking for hours and you will not regret buying it!!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|British singer Corinne Bailey Rae is a talented performer. She plays  the piano, the  guitar and various other instruments.  She is first and foremost a R and B singer, but I think her voice simply appeals to anyone who enjoys good music.  My favorite track is Put Your Records on.  This is a perfect for the  summer because, this  song is about listening to music and having fun with your friends.  Trouble Sleeping is another highlight here. Corinne Bailey Rae's vocals are smooth as silk on this song.  I enjoyed the horn playing on this track very much.  I love the  track Call Me When You Get This.  It is a song that gets my body moving.  Like A Star and Enchantment are two very romantic tracks about how one person can change your life completely.  I'd like To is a sensual track with a groovy beat.  Choux Pastry Heart is a track that shows Corinne's talent on the piano.  It is a beautiful but rather sad song.  I enjoyed listening to this CD from  Corrine Bailey Rae very much.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I cannot comment here anything. The art cannot be discussed. The future will show if they have right or not. The effects are amazing and the rest of the discs are very interesting. To see these before the movie, you'll understand the philosophy behind the scene. I give an AH for Wachowski brothers.
B000002KK2|5.0|You know how you are a fan of a recording artist and you wish that you could hang out with them based on your listener ship and the feelings that evokes. I would give anything to have sit in on a recording session with Rickie on vocals and Tom Waits on the synthesizer and Warren Zevon swigging on a brew. I guarantee you that would have been my most marvelous and enchanting night ever. I remember a picture taken long ago in the 1950's of Rickie Lee Jones along with some locals barefoot in the sand on a Santa Monica beach, near the pier with her stark blond hair and her totally aloof persona spilling out and head locking me from the confines of that beautiful image. When Rickie mentions the Pantages theatre(Chuck E's In Love) in Los Angeles which may be even gone now, she brings out a nostalgic twinge which coincides with her brilliant and jazzy puerile quality which permeates other works on this CD like Last Chance Texaco and Weasel and the White Boys. This is an artist that projects almost an innocent quality, child-like in it's presentation. But remember when Brittany Spears put on a school girl outfit and caused a commotion that was both titillating and provocative? Rickie, similarly does the innocent=naughty routine, capable of duking it out with the best of them.In closing, Rickie Lee Jones is one of the recording industry's most enduring, unimagineably interesting and purely competent vintage Jazz Rock players.Push the button and grab yourself a fabulously crafted, critically acclaimred CD.<br /><br />Jay Adler  Massapequa, New York
B00005UW7V|5.0|More than this. They can feel and create what human are not capable. A movie that is a paradigm shift in the movies history. The reality is mixed with fiction, feelings are confuse sometime and humans become robots and robots become human. <br />For me, this movie show a very possible future where robots will feel anf become, in one day the next generation of humans. <br />Do we dream real sheeps?
B000FGGE5Y|3.0|I enjoyed this movie for its edgy visual appeal (and yes it does look rather like anime, but I think that was intentional); however, I was left feeling dissatisfied with the story. Certain elements of the plot were either lacking or not explored fully enough. It was odd, because I had to listen carefully to catch a couple of things, and yet the story line was overall too predictable. Watch this for the visuals, not the story. I think it's quite enjoyable on that level, but if you want both--stunning visuals and a strong story--watch Aeon Flux.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Neil Simon's \\"Murder by Death\\" is an absolute, 100% hoot, from beginning to end.  This classic spoof from 1976 remains funny and fresh--and, as an additional benefit, it's suitable for family viewing.  All ages will appreciate the steady stream of visual, verbal, and even audio gags.<br /><br />  The all-star cast members turn in fine performances in a suitably macabre \\"dark old house\\" setting.  Peter Falk is especially good as film-noir detective Sam Diamond, and Peter Sellers matches him as San Francisco sleuth Sidney Wang.<br /><br />  The movie stands up to repeat viewing for me, a person who usually lacks the desire to see presentations again.  Five stars?<br /><br />Without a doubt this one deserves 10!
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! Robert Downey, Jr. is one of my favorite actors, and he certainly shows why in this film. He is intelligent and sarcastic, but also has a big heart. The first time I watched this film, I thought it was great, but a lot of the plot didn't make sense since it was kind of all over the place. The second time, I found myself repeatedly saying, \\"Oh, okay!\\" The day after the second watching, I kept thinking back on several of the scenes and laughing to myself again. Some of it borders on slapstick, but there is also a good murder mystery going on. Downey's character keeps blowing it, so your heart goes out to him while you're laughing at his foibles. The \\"gag reel\\" at the end is a must-see. I almost fell out of my chair at a couple of the scenes. Val Kilmer was great, too, obviously having a lot of fun and not taking himself too seriously. This film is definitely \\"different,\\" which is probably why it wasn't a huge hit. If you like dark comedy with a very wicked sense of humor, give this one a shot!
B00005KK3J|5.0|... you may want to give this one a go.  I'm amazed to realize that it's 37 years old; I think this film is going to end up among the classics when it gets a little older.  I'm not a big Western-watcher at all.  But I end up watching this one when it's televised because the cinematography is marvelous.  It's what I loved when it first came out (I'm revealing my age) - that and William Goldman's screenplay.  For those reasons, even if you don't care for shoot-em-ups, it's worthwhile.
B000A7S4B0|2.0|\\"Howl\\" comes so close to being good. They capture a real authentic \\"backporch\\" sound, with great production. The lyrics are passable, the singing isn't too obnoxiously affected. But there just aren't any good songs on here.  <br /> <br />It's like when you meet someone who dresses well, seems to share some common interests, and can make small talk like a champ. But then when you finally try to have a substantial conversation you realize they are thoroughly uninteresting, and just sort of suck all around. Well, it's the musical equivalent of that.  <br />They set a great vibe for beer drinking, sitting on the porch, etc. Just like a tape of whales calling to each other really gives you that authentic ocean feel. But nice as they sound, whales don't write good music and niether do the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. <br /> <br />Alot of people see music's primary function as providing a nice background. I'm sure they'll be pretty happy with this cd. Also, a lot of people are lifeless zombies with no souls.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|For me, this was a necessary reminder that the world has been dealing with terror tactics a long, long time. I faintly recalled the events with the athletes and the sad story that unfolded, though I was young at the time. We often forget that this is an on-going tragedy around the world and many are at a loss as to how to obtain a solution without becoming just like the terrorists. The film is a good fictional adaptation that was inspired by true events. Though some factual areas had to be a guessing game, it was very well put together.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000062YAZ|3.0|The fastest Slayer album. There is a lot less variety here than on other Slayer releases, which is great if you only like the band for their thrashiest parts. I personally prefer some tempo shifts, and a little variety, so this one sort of puts me to sleep. Try as I might, I end up spacing out, and not paying attention everytime I try to listen to this straight through. <br /> <br />If you want to sound \\"authentic\\" though, you are pretty much required to say this is the best thing Slayer ever did, and possibly the best metal album ever made. It's not. but don't let that stop you.
B000007MVM|5.0|Syd Barrett was the original Pink Floyd frontman, a witty, whimsical fellow. With Pink Floyd, he recorded \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" in 1967, a psychedelic album full of interesting sounds and evocative lyrics about everything from planets, to gnomes to bicycles. Sadly Syd lost his mind, his friends and his band soon after due to mind altering drugs. He was left with wild, staring eyes and an unpredictable temprement.  He'd go on record a couple more songs with the Floyd, two solo albums (with enough material for a third, \\"Opel\\" which was released later), then he retreated back to his parent's house in Cambridge, where he spent the rest of his days. He's been an influence on everyone from David Bowie to R.E.M to The Coral. <br /> <br />Syd Barrett died just recently, and I haven't been hit so hard by a musician's death since George Harrison. Syd Barrett's music is one of those rare bands (along with the Beatles and the Smiths) that I can truly say got me through some tough times. He's an inspiration, he really is. God only knows what terrible things he was hallicinating or hearing as he was playing, and yet he plays and yet he still has a sense of humour and warmth to his songs. I'm sure a lesser man wouldn't have been able to play anything at all under those conditions. He has sad moments, lonely times, but it never gets him completely down. He was always sure he could get better, than he could make another record, and even though it didn't happen after his second solo album \\"Barrett\\", I think it was a great attitude to have. It doesn't matter that a few notes or off, or the rhythms a little shaky at times, well not to me anyway. The music is as ragged as Syd was inside. It makes sense that the songs are this way, I think. <br /> <br />\\"The Madcap Laughs\\" (1970) is his first solo album and, in my opinion, his best work. Syd's opted for a more folky feel here. There's a lot of just him and guitar, like the tracks \\"Terrapin\\" and \\"She Took A Long Cold Look\\". That'snot to say there isn't sonic variety, there's psychedelia on \\"It's No Good Trying\\", distortion and fuzz on \\"No Man's Land\\", organ and spine tingling harmonies on \\"Long Gone\\". There's just as much variety in the emotional department too. \\"Love You\\" is a silly, upbeat, ultra happy song, \\"Here I Go\\" is a whimsical, self-deprecating song (\\"This is a story 'bout a girl that I knew/she didn't like my songs and that made me feel blue\\"), while songs like \\"Late Night\\" and \\"Dark Globe\\" are lonely and tragic, you get a glimpse of what an awful time being mentally ill must have been for him. <br /> <br />Syd's lyrics are worth mentioning. Often they are scrambled, have bizzare descriptions (\\"an eskimo chain\\", \\"dodge a tooth\\", \\"borrowed a page from a leopard's cage\\", \\"trip, trip to a dream dragon\\", etc) but I love them, they're unique and suit his sense of humour. When Syd's a little more lucid, he's very straightforward and honest about his feelings, and it makes the songs very personal (\\"Inside me I feel/alone and unreal/and the way you kiss/will always be/a very special thing to me\\"). Speaking of lyrics, he also quotes a bit of James Joyce on \\"Golden Hair\\". <br /> <br />If you can, I recommend you get yourself a copy that includes the bonus tracks (either an import version, or the copy-protected re-release in the Madcap Laughs/Barrett double CD pack).  There's an acoustic take of \\"Octopus\\" and \\"It's No Good Trying\\", two different acoustic versions of \\"Love You\\", an alternate take of \\"She Took A Long Cold Look At Me\\" and a rather different four-track stereo version of \\"Golden Hair\\", which Syd does harmonies on, unlike the original. <br /> <br />The booklet that comes in this CD is fairly good, apart from the annoying fact it doesn't have the full set of lyrics printed out. There's details of when each song was recorded and what take it was, as well as some liner notes documenting how the album was made, as well as hinting at some lost tracks (which I would really like to get my hands on). <br /> <br />If you only have one CD of Syd Barrett's stuff, I'd make it this one, rather than the Best Of available. There's diversity in both instrumentation and emotion, and his lyrics are less vague than they are on, say, \\"Barrett\\", a perfect taste of the man I say. If you get this CD, then the others, and start to get into Syd, I also recommend the band Gong, led by a chap called Daevid Allen, who sounds a little bit like Syd and sings about similar things (Gnomes, etc). Unlike Syd though, he'd eventually give up drugs, coming out relatively unscathed.  <br /> <br />Rest in Peace, Roger \\"Syd\\" Barrett. I really wished I could have shaken your hand.
0375836675|5.0|I bought this book recently on a serendipitous bookstore trip during a family reunion in Colorado. It is most definately worthy of the multiple starred reviews it has received. Ed Kennedy, a 19-year-old with no forseeable future, is extremely likeable and readable. His life takes a sharp turn for the positive when he receives the first card in the mail-an ace with three addresses and times. It suddenly becomes clear that these people need his help, whether in large ways or small acts of kindness. Three more aces follow, and thus embarks Ed's adventure to help other people, and naturally in the end help himself. His friends are very realistic and their issues are almost as compelling as Ed's. There is a bit of romance, but it doesn't overpower the rest of the book-it's a very nice balance. Family challenges are a major theme here, as is learning your true potential. I would recommend it to teens over the age of 15 (some swearing and violence), but it is more than adult-friendly, and interesting enough to be a page turner for all ages, and the price is unbeatable as well. All I have to say thank heavens for spontaneous trips and books like this!
B000F5GNX8|4.0|The commentary, where the director and actors talk over the movie, in the extras, is better than the movie, and had me laughing out loud. Val Kilmer is a riot ! The movie isn't bad, either.

B000007MVM|1.0|Now that Syd Barrett has officially left the planet (he unofficially left over 35 years ago), the truth can now be told about his overrated music.  This is something that his diehard cult just would never listen to.........for over 30 years they continued to worship a fat, shaved head man who spent his time watching TV in his mum's basement.  I am a lover of 60s British psychedlic pop music and grew up on it.  Favorite LPS back then were \\"Revolver' by the Beatles, 'Something Else,' by the Kinks, 'Sunshine Superman' by Donovan, 'Salty Dog' by Procol Harum, 'In the Court of King Crimson', 'Odessy and Oracle' by Zombies, etc.  But trying to get into the music of Syd Barrett, with a handful of exceptions, is very difficult.......even before he became an acid burnout.   For example, try listening to this CD more than a couple times.  You'll find it very forgettable, most of the tracks are demos or unfinished tunes, and very mediocre.  \\"Terrapin\\" starts it in a somewhat interesting direction, but it goes downhill from there.  \\"Long Gone\\" is another nice tune, but the rest of them are only interesting if you're trying to get inside the head of a mentally ill man who foolishly took acid on a daily basis from 1966 - 1968, and lost what little muse he had.  As far as music that will live forever is concerned, did Syd write any?  \\"See Emily Play\\" is still probably his greatest song, but can you begin to compare it to \\"Across the Universe\\" \\"The Inner Light\\" or \\"Fool on the Hill\\" by the Beatles?   Or \\"Three Kingfishers\\" or \\"Sunshine Superman\\" by Donovan?  Or \\"Hung Up on a Dream\\" by the Zombies?  Or \\"In the Room of Percussion\\" by Kaleidoscope?  Or \\"Voices in the Sky\\" or \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" by the Moody Blues?   Sorry, but Syd Barrett never wrote anything that stands up 40 years later like those tracks do.  The best thing that Syd Barrett ever did in this life was start Pink Floyd with Roger Waters, then inspire the song \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" years later.  Go on worship and glorify this burned-out acidhead if you choose.......I grew up with a lot of versions of him.  But I'll continue to enjoy the music of Pink Floyd on my CD player, who only hit their stride when David Gilmour took over the reins from Mr. Barrett.   Rest in peace, Syd.
0345440900|5.0|I saw a number of negative reviews regarding this book - but I found it to be my bible.  I am about to have child #2 - and just went back to review the concepts in preparation.  NOTE: I bottle fed my child, so I did not focus on the breastfeeding chapters (which have seemed to garner a number of critics).  But as to the sleep routines and sleep basics (softer approach than Babywise), Tracy provides a great game plan and tips, that you can modify to suit your needs.  There is also a wonderful website with message boards that were very helpful after reading the book.
006054094X|2.0|As a work of history, \\"1421\\" simply does not suffice.  Gavin Menzies creates an intriguing tale, but his methods leave the reader waiting for additional evidence as well as the opposing viewpoint before making up their mind.  The book appears to be written from the perspective of someone who has created a theory and is trying to prove it, instead of being written from the perspective of an impartial historian trying to find out what the true story is.  To be fair, Mr. Menzies does state in his Acknowledgements that \\"this is a book for the general reader, not the academic\\", and he does offer to make his notes available as well as provide an internet site with more information. <br /> <br />Mr. Menzies through the course of telling his story bombards the reader with a lot of circumstantial evidence in such a way as to make his conclusions look like the only possible explanation.  However, there are times when he makes statements which are incorrect which leave the reader wondering about the other evidence he presents.  For example, he repeatedly states that the Chinese discovered America before the Europeans, and had colonies in America before the Europeans as well.  However, even if he is completely correct about the stories of the Chinese fleets, the events would still be hundreds of years after the Vikings first came to North America and had a colony there.  Some speculate that the Irish may have been in North America even earlier than the Vikings. <br /> <br />Some of Mr. Menzies evidence doesn't seem to add up either.  For example when talking about the Piri Reis map, he mentions that \\"the ice depicted on the Piri Reis map corresponds with the normal maximum limits of drift and pack ice in midsummer\\", referring to the Antarctic.  Later, in an effort to explain differences in another map, he states \\"Sea levels in 1421 were lower than they are today.  Global warming has caused the south polar ice to melt, causing sea levels to rise slowly but inexorably.\\"  If the second statement were true, then we would not expect the region around Antarctica to be depicted as having the normal maximum limits of drift, but instead to have considerably more ice.  To make matters worse, he supports the idea of the Chinese circumnavigating Greenland with the statement: \\"Greenland was far warmer than it is today.  In 1421 it would have been a country of green pastures where cattle grazed in the open...\\"  If that is true, then runoff from Greenland and North America (and probably from Scandinavia and Russia as well) would serve to raise water levels and counteract some of the effects of more ice in the Antarctic region (if indeed there were more).  Thus, it is difficult to imagine a world climate that would completely support his theory of Chinese exploration. <br /> <br />Another thing which is puzzling is why the Chinese didn't visit Europe in their attempt to map the entire world and to create trade.  Mr. Menzies never offers much of an explanation as to why they covered the entire world outside of the one continent whose civilizations would have recorded their visit.  Of course this isn't proof that things didn't happen as Mr. Menzies claims, but it is a mystery left to be solved if the rest of the story is true. <br /> <br />This book is very entertaining, and it is a good story.  However, it can not be taken as the final word on this subject, nor can it even serve as a solid historical document.  If this story is true, then this is merely the tip of the iceberg.  If it is not true, then this is just a collection of evidence used in a misleading way to support a false theory.  Additional historical documents and scientific testing of the evidence may eventually determine the veracity of this theory.  Because of the contradictions and mistakes, and the resulting weakness of the evidence, I can only give this book two stars.  As far as the writing goes it is very readable and would fall between three and four stars if that were the only criteria. <br />
B000002G7E|4.0|Nearly four decades on, The Velvet Underground's task on their second album - White Light/White Heat - is simple but daunting: follow up the greatest and most important debut in American popular music. I say that without fear of contradiction. In fact, I am almost willing to replace \\"debut\\" with \\"album\\", and \\"American popular music\\" with \\"the English-speaking world\\". For better or worse, only about six people outside of the band had heard The Velvet Underground & Nico, and with their subsequent break from Andy Warhol's Factory, most of them disappeared (VU & Nico reached #171 on the US chart, White Light/White Heat peaked at #199). Therefore, the VU minus Nico had no idea what a standard they had set for themselves to be judged by in the future.<br /><br />While WL/WH is quite different from VU & Nico, it sticks to a similar set of aesthetic principles, expanding them in some cases, contracting them in others. On the debut, Lou Reed's relationship with his wife (\\"Heroin\\") seems to be a tumultuous one. On the follow-up's pulsating title track, it seems to have worked itself out quite well (or perhaps he had found a new spouse). This song - musically and lyrically - aims to paint a far prettier picture of the junkie lifestyle than its predecessor.  This the first of the four more conventionally-structured songs, if the word conventional can be used to describe anything that The Velvet Underground ever did. \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\", sung nicely by John Cale - with some cool interruptions by Reed - is a definite high point among these four songs, and probably the first song ever written about a lobotomy. The other two tracks, \\"Here She Comes Now\\" and \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\", are polar opposites of each other. The former, though it may be the weakest track on the CD, provides a gentle, simplistic breather before giving way to the corrosive feedback and shards-of-broken-glass riffs of the latter. \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" also features the album's second reference to a split skull.<br /><br />Two of the album's six songs take up nearly 26 of the disc's 40 minutes. As one might guess, these are not songs in the strict sense of the term, which was pretty much the only sense that existed when this record was released in late 1967.  \\"The Gift\\", written by Reed and narrated very convincingly by Cale, would be a tragic story if it weren't somewhat difficult to feel sorry for the quixotic Waldo Jeffers. But however absurd his fate may be, at least he met it in the name of true love. Note that this 8-minute song is spoken, not sung, so we may check this off as another trailblazing act by this incredible band. Finally, there is the notorious \\"Sister Ray\\". Plenty has been said about this hydrogen bomb of a tune, so suffice it to say that it manages to give equal treatment to all of the Velvet's favorite topics, most of which were verboten at the time: drugs, S&M, fellatio, and masturbation. Granted, it is 17 1/2 - minutes long, and while it overstays its welcome a bit, it makes its point - there are no more barriers, that noise can be music and music noise. Now start counting the number of bands that have taken that to heart, and imagine what rock music would be like without them and all of the bands that they subsequently influenced. (It isn't a pretty thought.)<br /><br />The most difficult part of reviewing a VU CD is deciding what standard to hold it to. Do I measure it in terms of how it stands up to any other CD out there, or do I rate it in terms of the standard set by The Velvet Underground & Nico? Almost any CD -  Sgt Pepper, Exile On Main Street, Blonde On Blonde - pales by comparison to their debut. But then again, the band set the bar pretty high for themselves, so why should I not expect them to keep up the good work? Were I to take the former route, I would of course have to grant the fact that albums can earn the same number of stars without being exactly as good as each other. Ultimately, I feel that I must split the difference, and award this CD points for the risks it took and the ground it broke, and for the fearlessness of its creators. Like any VU CD, it must not be thought of as an island, but as part of a whole, just as a chapter is part of a book.erence, and award this CD points for the risks it took and the ground it broke, and for the fearlessness of its creators.

She dominates every scene she is in.  She is both cruel and funny, sometimes at the same time.  Hathaway, Tucci, and Blunt are also very good, especially when playing off of each other.  This is definitely a \\"chick flick\\", but is entertaining and really funny at times.  Not everyone's cup of tea, but worth giving a shot.

B000FMGTTE|4.0|The first time I'd heard John Ottman's work was in X2, so I was very sceptical that he could pull this off. John Williams soundtrack for the original film is still the Gold-Standard for all Superhero films for the past thirty years. How can you top that? <br /> <br />Answer? You don't. Instead, like Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard on Batman Begins, you take a different approach and write music that's appropriate for the film. The result is a quieter and more introspective soundtrack - not as moody or atmospheric as Batman Begins, but not as bright and upbeat as John Williams original work either. <br /> <br />My only criticisms are that much of the tracks could be mistaken for \\"incidental music\\" on an initial listen - especially if you haven't seen the film. The mark of a great soundtrack is that watching the film first isn't necessary. Unfortunately, that isn't the case here, and neither is it the case for Batman Begins. <br /> <br />Another criticism is the choices of which music to use. For instance, there's a fantastic use of the Superman Theme at the end of the plane sequence that really, really should've been included at the end of the \\"Rough Flight\\" track. Another is in \\"Memories\\", where the music for Clark crashing through the barn roof, isn't used. <br /> <br />In the end, both John Ottman had the odds stacked against him for this soundtrack. It's a thankless task, trying to top a classic. I think Ottman did an okay job with it, but I do sometimes wish Bryan Singer had asked John Williams or even Howard Shore to to it instead. In all fairness to Ottman, It's not easy to score a film and edit it at the same time.
B00005JNRY|5.0|Man, I cannot believe Pixar.  I felt they were going to start to slip when they released The Incredibles and I thought it was just another superhero movie, when it turned out to be an exploration of discovering your identity and knowing who you are and what you can do.  Then I thought Cars looked kind of uninteresting and reviews that called it derivative didn't help.  However, though this movie may be a bit derivative, it still is a huge helping of Pixar heart.<br /><br />Everything about this movie exceeded my expectations.  I thought I'd hate the characters, especially Lightning and Mader because Lightning is selfish and Mader is voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, but I ended up really liking both (and all of the other characters too).  I didn't believe Pixar could have made their animation even more stunning, but they did, both with high technological neon lighting animation and gorgeous natural vistas.  Heck, I thought the movie would feel preachy, but it still feels very caring.<br /><br />It's also a slight return to form after the Incredibles in that it returns to homages of cinema past and tie-ins to other Pixar works, something that is both fun to look for and shows how much the crew working at Pixar really love their job.  These films are still really magnificent and I can't wait for Ratatouille coming in 2007.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B000089RVX|5.0|(pardon my terrible spanish) i dont listen to much, but this is one band i will listen to no matter wat...i was so sick of hearing nothing but [...] on the radio, and when i got this cd (and \\"origin\\" and \\"anywhere but home LIVE\\") radio was history for me...it provides a nice break from all the typical songs u hear, and is wonderful for people who like darker bands and variety in their lives (believe me u need it to stay sane)    this band is called \\"gothic metal\\", but realy, i dont c much that would make it extremely gothic...its just darker, thats all...sure, they got a song called \\"Tourniquet\\", which is about suicide, but that dont mean its goth...it just addresses a topic not discussed b/c people r too afraid or uncomfortable talking about it...good song, not great, but good...the other good ones are \\"My Immortal\\", \\"Going Under\\", \\"Bring Me To Life\\", and \\"Whisper\\" (my faves, ill admit)...some realy good guitar solos can be found in \\"Going Under\\" and \\"Haunted\\", and if you like ballads, \\"My Immortal\\" gives it to you...oh, and amy lee CAN sing...shes realy good, and has a pretty voice...im so envious...she can realy hold a note, too, which to me is rare...i dont see many people holding a B note for 3.5 measures...and thats pretty long when u have a normal 4/4 beat...    the whole cd is wonderful b/c its different from other bands...yeah, some people said this cd sux beyond relief (thats how i interpreted them), but realy, its just b/c they got different taste, and they thought the best way to say that was to diss a perfectly ok band...but oh well, thats their prob...all you gota do is listen, and youll find this is a cd worth adding to your collection...
B00079HZUM|4.0|This film could bear comparisons with Shakespeare in Love; actors playing cross-gender roles, falling in love whilst playing out a play by Shakespeare. <br /> <br />This however is more 'adult' in some of the themes including sexual confusion where boys were brought up learning nothing but how to act as girls. <br /> <br />Billy Crudup is one such, who also acts as a 'bum boy' (the term used in the film) to the Duke of Buckingham. But fortunately he finds true happiness with a woman.
B000000ZGO|3.0|1. Walk On By - Everything comes together on the first track - why do you think they put it there...? <br /> <br /> <br />     2. Hyper... - Suffers from terrible female chorus; bogs down to a jam session, and is saved later by Hayes' piano work. <br /> <br /> <br />     3. One Woman - Totally forgettable...it's a song you can't wait to end. Only listenable once; you will skip it from then on. <br /> <br /> <br />     4. Phoenix - Painfully long intro about some imagined fella Hayes thought would fit at the start. Skip this to the song itself, and you get someone who is trying very hard to be sincere, but isn't. Although he does seem at times to be inspired by the lyrics.  <br /> <br /> <br />          Judged by today's standards, this would be a 10, but up against the context of the great albums of 1969, this is a 3. If you want a truely sincere, soulful, heartfelt album by a black artist that came out in the same year, get George Benson's \\"The Other Side Of Abbey Road\\".
B000EGCITG|5.0|This is the first Pink's album I bought. The song to Mr. President roused my curiosity and I bought the CD now I listen it all the time. All songs are provocative funny, some very serious. I just love how she makes fun of today's society and the music world.
B000E41MS6|5.0|If you are a fan of the old Doctor Who series for kids you may be surprised by the new series which is anything but kid stuff. Some of the episodes are now too scary for young children. Although Doctor Who always had a high body count, the deaths are made to seem more poigniant and real by artful cinematography and a full emotional score. The vastly-improved special effects and the increased quality of acting in this series reduces the camp elements making the dangers feel more real. <br /> <br />The Doctor as played by Christopher Eccelson is much darker and much slicker than previous incarnations. Having survived the \\"Time War\\" which is said to have destroyed both the Dalek race and the Time Lords, the doctor appears shell-shocked. He is full of guilt for his part in the extermination of his own race. This makes him both angry and vulnerable. His guilt over being the last surviver of his race makes him hesitant in some situations, and vicious in others. He is especially determined in his desire for all remaining Daleks to be destroyed.  <br /> <br />The doctor's guilt and vulnerability also make him susceptable to romantic attachments , and he becomes romantically involved with his companion Rose. This makes him extremely sensitive to situations that put Rose in danger. <br /> <br />In one situation where Rose is threatened he yells out, \\"I'm gonna wipe every last stinking Dalek out of the sky!\\"  <br /> <br />A phrase that it is difficult to imagine any previous Doctor saying. This Doctor is much more emotionally involved in the world around him, a situation hightened by the fact that he has no safety net. There are no other time lords around to fix his mistakes. The Doctor must constantly face the consequences of his actions, from getting slapped by Rose's mother for stealing her girl away, to observing the degradation of a world that he thought he had set right.  <br /> <br />This series is also more sexually suggestive than previous series. Much of this is found in the character of Captain Jack, a former time cop gone freelance implied to be bisexual. This character also appears nude in one episode although nothing is shown. <br /> <br />Although some episodes may be too intense for children, the series is too good for older science fiction fans to discount. <br />The great special effects, beautiful score, and incredible acting make it worth seeing. If you are already a Doctor Who fan. You should see this series, because of it's different take on the doctor. The box set includes DVD commentary on all episodes, and several hours of special features. Fast-paced and intense, this series is a good buy.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|There have always been very gut-level, instinctual reasons Muse hold the title of my all-time favorite band. Sure, I could write endless amounts on why I love them, but in the end, it's not an academic love. It's a bit more difficult to pinpoint.<br /><br />It has something to do with the way every aspect of their music sets itself against apathy and indifference. How Matt sings every chorus like it's the most important thing we need to hear before we die. The way it's just the three of them up there on stage, creating this wall of sound so much larger than themselves. How they write music without caring if it sounds over-the-top, theatrical, pretentious, insane, at times even childish or naive. There is no \\"image\\" to risk: they have no image at all. They don't hide themselves, and they don't glory themselves. They just express, and express. And it can be euphoric, or ridiculous, or hilarious, or painful, or (many times) all of the above.<br /><br />My point is this: when Muse goes about writing new music, it's usually not a question of whether or not I'll like it. It's a question that sounds more like: dear Muse, I know you've grown up a bit in that three-year absence. But how?<br /><br />The answer: well, they're still nuts. Still meddling like twitchy scientists with tried-and-true rock formulas. But this time, that crazy paranoia is a bit more laced with optimism. Not settled, not at all - there's nothing \\"safe\\" about this album. Italian flamenco and synthesizers happily occupy the same space, for heaven's sake. But more mature - yes. Which is always true, with every new album. They never stop looking ahead.<br /><br />A few random impressions:<br /><br />\\"Take a Bow\\" was made to open their live shows. It builds and combusts more than \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\", which I didn't know was possible.<br /><br />There is so much happening musically in \\"City of Delusion\\" your head will spin trying to keep track of it all.  Arabian strings and trumpets alongside lyrics like \\"I will avenge and justify my reasons with your blood\\"?  Yep, they make it work.<br /><br />\\"Assassin\\" is Muse at their all-out heaviest.  Rife with Queen-esque background choruses and a melody that soars just above the controlled chaos of sound, it's a glory to behold.<br /><br />If Fox Mulder of the X-Files had a theme song, it would be \\"Exo-Politics\\" - possibly outting \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" in the hook department.<br /><br />\\"Hoodoo\\"'s mad piano mayhem was so unexpected I think my heart skipped a few beats.<br /><br />\\"Invincible\\" is probably the most positive and upbeat song they've ever written.<br /><br />And of course, what more can be said about the already-classics... \\"Knights of Cydonia\\". \\"Map of the Problematique\\".<br /><br />I cannot fathom how they're going to pull off some of these tracks live, but I know it will happen, of course.  Because if there's anything that beats new Muse, it's new Muse live.<br /><br />For those long bouts before and after they tour your area, though, this beauty of an album will suffice.

1592401791|5.0|The Beatles were truly a multi-dimensional group - pop idols, social activists, fashion trend setters and media sensations. However, it is as musicians where their true legacy resides. Geoff Emerick, the engineer who began his career the day the beatles arrived at the EMI studios and played a pivotal role on the Revolver through Abbey Road albums, has here produced a book which properly concentrates on the production/engineering aspects of the Beatles music. To those of you out there interested in how the Beatles produced some of the sounds they achieved, this is a primary resource. You will learn, for instance, how Paul McCartney achieved the \\"larger than life\\" bass tone on Paperback Writer, the development of the soundscape \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", and the revolutionary engineering strategies used on Sgt. Pepper. The book is full of little obscure bits of information, such as the fact that \\"Blackbird\\" was recorded on the roof of the EMI studio and some of the bird sounds were actual birds which happened to be nearby. Having said this, there is also a wealth of information on the Beatles themselves, the exhilaration of the Revolver/Pepper days and the depression of the White Album/Let it Be sessions. What you see here is an insider's view of the Beatles as they reached their creative summit and gradually drifted apart. It is all here, McCartney's creative genius, Lennon's avant garde extremism, Harrison's eastern romance and Starkey's solid journeyman spirit. Paul McCartney does come off as the major center of creativity in this book. To be fair, this may be a long overdue recognition of his true leadership role in the group. It is true that Geoff Emerick and Paul did share the greatest interest in production. The book also exposes the fact that players other than George Martin performed crucial supporting roles in the development of the Beatles' sound. The book leaves you with the impression (and rightly so) that, in the end, the Beatles were just a small group ofextremely talented musicians with a true spark of creativity which, in fact, resulted in the greatest popular music of the 20th century. Geoff Emerick played a major role in shaping the sound of that music. His book is essential reading for any person interested in the Beatles, modern music in general or the history of music engineering.
0790734850|5.0|Quite frankly, this is as good as any film in the entire decade of the 90's. It is an exceptional modern version of film noir.<br /><br />The acting and variation of characters is superb in a way few movies can match. The principles are excellent, of course (Crowe, Pearce, Spacey). But the supporters (Basinger, Cromwell, DeVito) are equal to the task and add a layer to the film that made it the best of the 90's, in my view.<br /><br />This is a movie that one can pull out every 6 months or year and thoroughly enjoy each time.<br /><br />It was a shame that Titanic won best picture. Taking nothing away from that film or its historic impact, in decades to come, you will see LA Confidential on classic movie channels far more often. It not only launched or revived several careers, it is a film that has lasting value - not just the latest hyped \\"big\\" movie thriller. People won't continue to watch a big ship go under. They will continue to watch great writing, dialogue, and exceptional acting; as well as a classic film noir.<br /><br />I would like to disagree with the reviewer who indicated his disappointment that things turned out well for the protagonists. Since when does film noir have to turn out dark for the good guys? In my view, had this happened, the film would not have been nearly as well received or enjoyable. Several of Humphrey Bogart's noir films had good endings for the heroes.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|This album is explosive. Muse has really stretched into a territory that retains their glamorous rock sound by adding fast paced electronic/pop melodies to echo their message of an uprising. Its wonderful. Fans of their past albums should be surprised and excited about this new creative effort. Blackholes and Revelations has a really thought provoking album cover and intriguing message throughout. They have evolved into a mind- bending group of musicians whose operatic glory and passionate Rock God attitudes make this album mesmerizing. You will listen to it for weeks. Its fantastic, go buy it right now. I can't wait to see them live.
0743243307|4.0|I read this for a book club and really enjoyed it. it's kind of chick-lit-y and exciting and it moves quickly, yet it's moody and deep and intellectual at the same time. monica ali is a very gifted storyteller. she has an impeccable feel for mood. I gained a fresh understanding for the immigrant experience. my only complaint is that the novel seems to bog down a bit at the end with several long anecdotes about the protagonist's native country of Bangladesh, as though Ali were trying to cram these into the book somewhere.

0688014291|4.0|The tools the authors advocate in this book are effective and easy to work with in any organization.  They are simplistic but surprisely effective.  They are not a silver bullet for all the ills of an organization.  However if practiced, they will lead to a better work environment.<br /><br />As with many management tools, the policy advocated in this book are not a cure for all organizational difficulties.  In organizations that don't care for their workers, this policy would not work.  Organizations using only this method will not become more profitable.  This is just one of many tools a manager should use in leading his/her organization.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I always thought that Pearl Jam had tons of good songs, but were never able to make an album that stood up the whole way through, so i never really bothered to become a very big fan of their music.  Nonetheless, I picked this CD up a week after it came out, as i was buying the chili peppers' new release, since I felt that I should own at least one pearl jam lp.  I didn't even listen to 'pearl jam' until about a month after i bought it, since i was so immersed in 'stadium arcadium' that i didnt feel the need to try this cd out.  then one day i finally gave it a shot.  i immediately loved 'life wasted,' 'marker in the sand,' and 'unemployable.'  they were all melodic hard rockers that really had a message.  i went back and listened to some old pearl jam stuff that i hadn't ever paid attention to, like songs on 'vitalogy' and the merkinball single.  i even checked out a live dvd.  pearl jam quickly became one of my very favorite bands.  after brushing up on their past releases, i listened to this new CD again, and i finally realized just how important this CD is:  'Pearl Jam' is simply the best overall album by the greatest band of the last decade and a half.  every song is good, wait, great (maybe with exceptions of 'big wave' and 'comatose'), and the album flows along perfectly.  This is one of the most important albums of this decade as well, since it tackles many important issues, most of which having to do with the current state of the US.  The Life Wasted theme (there is a haunting reprise of the song), which was most likely inspired by the death of Eddie Vedder's good friend Johnny Ramone, adds another element to the lp.  this album is viewed as a comeback from pearl jam, and in a way it is, since this is the first 5 star album they've made since Vitalogy in my opinion.  of course, they've always been around making great music though, so it's about time that they get recognized for it again.  'Inside Job' and 'gone' are 2 of the other amazing songs that i must mention.  All members of the band manage to stand out on these tracks.  so if you don't own this CD, i strongly encourage you to go pick up a copy of it.  maybe it won't turn you into an insane pearl jam fan like it did to me, but if you know anything about good music, i'm sure you'll at least enjoy listening to it.  oh and one more thing:  people who are bashing this album must be idiotic.  most of them seem to have a problem with eddie vedder's voice.  he's very original and sings with a lot of feeling, and doesn't sound like the horrible 3 chord punk junk frontman that seem to be popular right now.  i guess people have a hard time recognizing talent these days.  anyway, this has quickly become one of my favorite albums ever, and i'm very glad that i've finally been able to become a huge fan of a band that's still in their prime!
0192802631|5.0|At the end of the day, Persuasion is worth reading because it offers a simple hope for how we can live together. Unlike, say Pride and Prejudice, where in the end the characters more collide than marry, the orbits of protagonists Anne and Captain Wentworth eventually come to revolve around each other. <br /> <br />When I read Austen, I often wonder whether the author likes her characters.  In Persuasion, it seems like the author strives to make her characters contest to find their proper standing, and neither breeding nor education (nor gender) determines the mettle of a man or woman.  However, determining how we can live together, faults and all, is probably more important than the sort of personality and tribulation time trials that some of Persuasion's characters attempt to determine among themselves.  More important is the comparison of the various family units, the Elliots, the Crofts, and the Musgroves, and what a wise reader would learn from each. <br /> <br />Make no mistake, this is no drawing room bodice ripper, of the \\"she slinked into the room scantily clad\\" variety. And its indolent upper class ever-vacationing denizens may appear quite impossible in today's society. However like occasional dessert, I found it better digested slowly, at the end of a day of intellectual toiling, rather than as a main course, or as a substitute for breakfast, lunch or dinner. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed this as a younger person.  This is apparently the author's final work, and she did not live to see it published.  So it is probably the artist at the height of her craft.  If she left us with anything to think of how we might all get along, this is, in my estimation, it. <br />

B00005JKHP|5.0|This DVD takes you back to Star Trek the way we all grew up watching it.  The story line is interesting in the way the old TV series used to be.  In fact, it's a take off of one of the old TV episodes but with much better special effects.  The only criticism is that too much time is spent showing off the ship in the first few minutes of the movie.  However, you can fast-forward through all of that if you become impatient.
0140187650|5.0|Jewish author Hannah Arendt has provided a wealth of information that goes far beyond the trial of the German war criminal Adolf Eichmann. This review focuses primarily on matters that have scarcely been discussed in previous reviews, it at all.<br /><br />Arendt (p. 39) gives the readers a taste of the scale of the Kristallnacht (November 1938): 7,500 Jewish shop windows broken, all synagogues burned, and 20,000 Jewish men incarcerated in concentration camps. In common with many others who wrote during the first two decades after WWII, Arendt (p. 5, 11-12) addresses the issue of Jewish passivity in the face of death during the later roundups and transports to the death camps.<br /><br />Arendt briefly discusses the fate of Jews of some individual European nations. She mentions the conniving of the Bulgarians (with, of course, the implied freedom to do so) performed in order to avoid sending their Jews to the death camps, and the fact that Finland, Germany's ally, was never seriously pressured to turn over her 2,000 Jews to be murdered (p. 170). Clearly, the latter part of the oft-repeated statement, \\"Not all of the victims of the Nazis were Jews, but all Jews were victims of the Nazis\\" is incorrect.<br /><br />Throughout this work, Arendt gives various biographical details of Adolf Eichmann. For example, she mentions that he was a Gottglaubiger (p. 27), a Nazi term for those who had broken with Christianity, and which Eichmann maintained right up to the very moment of his hanging, having refused the solace and Bible reading of a Protestant minister (p. 252).<br /><br />Arendt briefly discusses Hitler's flouting of the Versailles treaty and his rise to power. While Jan Thomas Gross has asserted that there were Poles who praised Hitler in the 1930's, Arendt makes it clear that this was far from limited to Poland during that time: \\"...Hitler was admired  everywhere as a great national statesman.\\" (p. 37).<br /><br />While most Holocaust materials focus on the real or imagined collaboration of locals in the sending of Jews to their deaths, Arendt is unsparing in her criticism of Jewish collaborators in this regard: \\"Without Jewish help in administrative and police work--the final roundup of Jews in Berlin was, as I have mentioned, done entirely by Jewish police--there would have been either complete chaos or an impossibly severe drain on German manpower. (p. 117). She adds that, because of this collaboration, only a few thousand Germans, most of whom furthermore only did office work, were able to send hundreds of thousands of Jews to their deaths (p. 117). Finally, Arendt concludes that: \\"Wherever Jews lived, there were recognized Jewish leaders, and this leadership, almost without exception, cooperated in one way or another, for one reason or another, with the Nazis. The whole truth was that if the Jewish people had been unorganized and leaderless, there would have been chaos and plenty of misery but the total number of victims would hardly have been between four and a half and six million. (According to Freudiger's calculations about half of them could have saved themselves if they had not followed the instructions of the Jewish councils...\\" (p. 125).<br /><br />Arendt (p. 42, 118, etc.) elaborates on the actions of a Jew, Rudolf Kastner. He made a deal with Eichmann in which 1,684 Jews were allowed to go to Palestine in exchange for Kastner's silence before and during which 476,000 Hungarian Jews were sent to the gas chambers of Auschwitz.<br /><br />Jan Thomas Gross, who has gotten a great deal of publicity for his books (NEIGHBORS and FEAR), has stated that the 2-3 million Poles who died in the hands of the Germans were primarily the collateral victims of military action. Arendt knows better: \\"...Eichmann knew that right behind the front lines all Russian functionaries (\\"Communists\\"), all Polish members of the professional classes, and all native Jews were being killed in mass shootings.\\" (p. 95).  \\"At no point, however, either in the proceedings or the judgment, did the Jerusalem trial mention even the possibility that extermination of whole ethnic groups--the Jews, or the Poles, or the Gypsies--might be more than a crime against the Jewish or the Polish or the Gypsy people, that the international order, and mankind in its entirety, might have been grievously hurt and endangered.\\" (pp. 275-276). Arendt realizes the alternative future: \\"The measures against Eastern Jews were not only the result of anti-Semitism, they were part and parcel of an all-embracing demographic policy, in the course of which, had the Germans won the war, the Poles would have suffered the same fate as the Jews--genocide. This is no mere conjecture: the Poles in Germany were already being forced to wear a distinguishing badge in which the \\"P\\" replaced the Jewish star, and this, which we have seen, was always the first measure to be taken by the police in instituting the process of destruction).\\" (pp. 217-218).<br /><br />Arendt praises the Danes for saving Jews during WWII and then, without mentioning the incomparably more difficult conditions under which Polish rescuers of Jews labored, nevertheless gives the Poles their due. After listing some individual examples of Polish assistance to Jews, Arendt adds the following: \\"One witness claimed that the Polish underground had supplied many Jews with weapons and had saved thousands of Jewish children by placing them with Polish families. The risks were prohibitive; there was the story of an entire Polish family who had been executed in the most brutal manner because they had adopted a six-year-old Jewish girl.\\" (p. 231).\\"At no point, however, either in the proceedings or the judgment, did the Jerusalem trial mention even the possibility that extermination of whole ethnic groups--the Jews, or the Poles, or the Gypsies--might be more than a crime against the Jewish or the Polish or the Gypsy people, that the international order, and mankind in its entirety, might have been grievously hurt and endangered.\\" (pp. 275-276).

1592400876|2.0|I just finished reading this book, and I was not really that impressed.  I found it to be quite boring.  The whole book Lynne Truss just talks about all the errors people make on signs and in writings.  She also points out \\"rules for punctuation\\" that almost everyone already knows.  Save yourself some money and go to google and look for punctuation rules and just print them.
B000002JSP|4.0|In Through The Out Door is certainly a change from the Zeppelin I grew to love. The album explores different areas of music which had previously been disregarded for the more acoustic and heavy side of things which catapulted Led Zeppelin into rock stardom. In Through The Out Door explores synth and provides an early insight as to what the 80's were to bring, only portrayed in classic Zeppelin style. The album has it's fair share of toe tappers, sing alongs and pure works of art, mainly being the opening \\"In The Evening\\" and classic love ballad \\"All My Love\\". One of the apparent stand outs on the album is \\"Carousleambra\\", for me an up and down of musical peaks and lows. The opening (highly Jones inspired) synthesiser may paint the wrong picture of what the song is truly capable of. By no means should this album be underestimated as after a few good listens it could very well fast become yet another classic Zeppelin album in anyone's eyes.
0451191153|5.0|Simply put, this is one of Rand's most powerful works, if not, her most powerful.  A novel which possesses a modern edge that exploits the vices and struggles of humanity--especially the conflict of the individual with the outside world. It emphasizes the grip society has on a person, making her inadequate of recognizing herself as the god of her own destiny in the face of her oppressors.  Probably one of the most startling and revealing works of the twentieth century.  In fact, by reading this reveiw you have already become a victim to the devices Rand stoically warns her readers about.  Nevertheless, a must read!!    Note:  If this work seems a little long and intimidating, you may first want to read Rand's _Anthem_.
080701429X|5.0|I'm surprised there aren't a lot more reviews on this book. It might just be the best book I've ever read (and it's really short and easy to read).  <br /> <br />Viktor Frankl is an amazing man- a psychiatrist who lived in the concentration camps during WWII, and not only made it through and came out alive, but went on to touch many people's lives. <br /> <br />The first half of the book, Viktor takes you through his experiences  as a prisoner of the concentration camps. It's a unique perspective because he's really getting into what happens mentally to the prisoners and guards. Why do some continue to have the will to live despite everything? Why do others give up and let themselves die? Why do some prisoners show incredible cruelness toward their fellow prisoners, while some of the guards show compassion and kindness? Everything seems to hint to the fact that we are not just a product of our experiences. Even in a concentration camp where it seems like every freedom is stripped of the prisoner, the prisoner is still free on some level to make choices about his own will to live and his own character. So what is it that causes different men in the same situation to make different choices? <br /> <br />The second part of the book delves into the answers he came to for all of those questions, as Viktor explains his psychotherapy (or \\"logotherapy\\"). I'm not going to get into all of it now, because I'd rather just recommend you read it yourself. I am sure you will not be dissapointed!  <br /> <br />
B000EHRVP6|2.0|good movie for the non-squeemish. You have to stetch your imagination a bit at times, and remember the \\"good old days\\" of teen flicks for other times, but overall not bad at all.
B00005JKNF|4.0|I gave this film 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves being an award winner for best film, because you really should watch it more than once.  You can't appreciate this movie unless you watch it more than once.  Some things go by so fast or are so subtle they are missed the first time.  Seeing it 3 or even 4 times really gives the watcher a full appreciation of this story and the talents of the actors, director, and most of all the story about the statuses above and below stairs.  It's fascinating to this American, but then always has been.  Past traditions explored and authentically reproduced in a movie.  Great!
B0000025DV|5.0|I bought this a year or two after it was released waaaay back then and bought a few other ELO albums after that, some of them were disappointing to me, but this one is the \\"best\\" in my opinion. I still listen to it sometimes today. It is a feel good album!
B000AU9UYM|4.0|While I agree that this is not the Bruce Wayne we've seen in other Batman movies, this is a younger Bruce Wayne, so I don't see why nobody seems to take into consideration his lack of age reflects his lack of wisdom. <br /> <br />Aside from that, there was only one flaw I really had a problem with in this movie. <br />The machine meant to \\"fog up\\" the city is described in the film as originally being a military weapon designed to shoot microwaves to diminish enemy water supplies in desert combat from long distances... <br /> <br />You can't focus microwaves from long distances. They need to project into a cone after a certain amount of travel, which would make it mighty ineffective for combat, as it would probably spread the beam out and hit our guys too (Wheee!). <br /> <br />So, HA! Try to look intelligent by complaining about the film now, all of you whiners! You didn't even know that microwaves can't be focused into a consistent beam, which is the most important premise to be taken into consideration, as the whole film revolves around it. <br /> <br />I mean, seriously! How could you NOT know that about microwaves?! That's the first thing anyone would know! <br />Ahahahahahahahahah! <br /> <br />I mean, how stupid do you have to be- hahaha- not to know that microwaves do not have a single-ray projection dynamic- hahaha, how insidiously insipid of you! <br /> <br />Anyhow, the film was pretty. So I was able to let that slide and pretend the machine did something else to diminish water supplies. <br />After that, the film is pretty forgivable. <br />I give it 3.5 stars.
B00000DHRX|4.0|I love George Michael's music and did not have all of his albums, only Faith, but I loved some of the later stuff and earlier stuff too, so I just had to have this CD. If you love the hits and don't have those albums or singles, get this.
B000FILW86|5.0|A recent Associated Press story described Cheap Trick as \\"aging rockers.\\" Aging?   Rockford shows no sign  this band is ready for retirement. In fact, with the band taking more control as producers, Cheap Trick has recaptured the youthful exuberance of its early recordings and come out with one of its finest collections.  The opening track Welcome To The World sets an energy level that sustains throughout. The compositions are strong. Rick Nielsen's guitars are nothing short of blazing.  And there's just enough of those Beatlesesque influences in  This Time You Got It,  O Claire, and  Perfect stranger to make you think this may be Cheap Trick's best Beatles record to date.       <br />  Rockford is a great summer play. Take it to the beach. Put it in your car stereo and roll down the windows and do what CT meant for you to do. Crank it.
B00000DLUV|5.0|They sound awesome on here! it just shows that even with age, the Brothers still sounded fantastic!! I especially loved hearing Heartbreaker, their own version (which was originally done by Dionne Warwick) and Immortality (sung by Celine Dion originally) was great....I loved their version even more than hers. A must have for all Bee Gees fanatics like me!
0393317552|4.0|By now you know what this book is all about and I guess you are reading the reviews to check if it is worth your time :)     The initial chapters, where the author establishes the role of environment/geography in shaping the pre-historic way of life are very, very good.  However, he then makes a giant leap of conjecture when he completely ignores the role of established culture(s) in paving the way for future developments. He briefly argues that culture may also be a factor of environment but by not supporting this claim in any substantial way, he asks the readers to assume too much and leaves us unsatisfied. To give a small example - according to the author, the middle-east had every advantage throughout history (in his terms) - then why is it that we find some of the most closed societies there? Environment lays the initial groundwork but it becomes less and less of a factor as culture/ethos take over. The present day US is another living example...no matter what the season/terrain, the lifestyle is almost the same everywhere.     The best thing about GGS is its accessibility (it borders on entertainment) and is well-worth your time and effort. Without any doubt, it is a monumental work of scholarship. The book would have been even better if it were Part I of a II or III part series.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Like someone else said, Elton John and Bernie Taupin \\"did\\" have the midas touch and no, you can't put ALL the great hits from those years on only 2 CDs but.....this is a must have for all Elton fans. I became a fan as a small child in the 70s and i collect \\"everything\\" by him.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|After many years of waiting for this concert to be put on DVD, many of us die hard Pink Floyd fans were expecting and anticipating something great, I have to say I am somewhat disappointed.  Everybody talks about the great sound quality. I don't hear it.  I have a High quality Denon DVD player(it is only 2 years old - I guess this is already outdated for the new mix), Somebody please tell me how I can get this great new 5.1 mix - 640kbps that is in the Audio Setup - Maybe I'm missing something.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great band and a great concert, I'm just not hearing this great new sound.  I have many great Concert DVDs and I can definetely tell when there is good sound.  This DVD, I had to turn up louder than normal just to get the BIG effect that I was expecting.  Overall, nice DVD; however just not Great like I was expecting.
B000002GY9|5.0|Really, what more can be said. If you are reading this review, wondering, \\"Gee, should I really buy it?\\" the answer is a resounding \\"HELL YES!\\" <br /> <br />
B000EGCITG|5.0|yeah 'stupid girls' was good.  not great, but good.  i have to say, i wasn't expecting much for her latest release.  then i heard some tracks, mainly 'u + ur hand.'  i was blown away.  the whole cd is absolutely fantastic.  AMAZING vocals, poignant lyrics, and flawless production.  she really came into her own with this album.  get this cd.  listen to it all the way through.  enjoy.
B00000331V|2.0|Being a huge fan of J. Geils' \\"Full House,\\" I was encouraged by some reviews here to believe that \\"Blow Your Face Out\\" was a similar live effort. But the only similarity is that they were both recorded live. \\"Blow Your Face Out\\" is funky and laid back. Not bad, if that's what you want. But anyone expecting something along the lines of Full House will be tremendously disappointed. In fact, \\"Lookin' For Love,\\" which will knock your socks off on \\"Full House,\\" is done as a slow, elavator Muzac tune in \\"Blow Your Face Out.\\" Why did they even bother? <br /> <br />The energy level, which is consistently frenzied on Full House, rarely gets above \\"low\\" on \\"Blow Your Face Out.\\" After listening to it twice, I realized there is no song on it that I want to hear again. Not that aren't a couple good songs on it. There just are no high energy songs other than House Party. I wasted my money.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|I was surprised to see all the negative press on this Album.  The songs are catchy and have an irresistable draw to them.  I love the  contrast of \\"I chimed in with, 'haven't you people ever heard of closing the g-d door?/No, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.\\" <br /> <br />The unfortunate thing is that verses and choruses are both repeated, which means this isn't a CD you'll be able to listen to over and over again.  Also, the effects are overdone (and it's obvious they're first-time recorders), and there's not a lot of variety in the sound of the music. <br /> <br />Still, I just loved the first listen, and I'll keep their songs on my daily playlist for sure.  Enjoy.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I will be very surprised if any fan of the orginal series does not enjoy this return of Doctor Who. I was not a big fan of the first Doctor William Hartnell but the second Doctor and all the rest I enjoyed. I especially liked Tom Baker, Pertwee, and Davison. This new Doctor played by Christopher Eccleston has his own distinct personality which always made previous Doctors unique and kept us interested. The cast and the music is good which you could say about previous Doctors episodes, but the special effects are excellent which you could not say about the previous episodes. Sure we still love them, cheesy F/X or not, but it is nice to see some cool new effects. I have several episodes of earlier Doctors on DVD, and now I just ordered this from Amazon since their price is very reasonable. Especially if you price what it would cost for 13 episodes of the originals at around $18 plus a piece. I don't see this getting much cheaper since the demand is there as it was with the other Doctors and everyone is looking forward to seeing a new season and a new Doctor. I recommend this to all fans of SciFi but in particular to fans of the original series.
0312330537|5.0|A must read for anyone who grew up in India - especially Bombay (Mumbai). It is a remarkable story - part autobiography, part documentary, part history - by an incredible writer. The author is fortunate to have experienced the incredible life that few would even believe was possible. <br /> <br />Every character is remarkably described - there are many Prabakers, and many Khaderbhais - yet they are all unique. <br /> <br />Thanks for sharing, Gregory.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Almost 11 years to get the official Pulse DVD.  This edition has a lot of good material.  But my evaluations are audio and video quality.<br /><br />First, inside the DVD box, you read, this is an analog recording.  So if you have a CRT TV you will see an amazing video quality, but if you have a Plasma or DLP TV you may see pixels, and some grain in dark scenes.<br /><br />Second the Audio is good, given you 3 options 1)Stereo, 2)DD5.1/448kbps 3)DD5.1/640kbps  So depending how did you setup your receiver you will listen diferent sounds.<br /><br />A bad thing the video format is 4:3<br /><br />The extras are a plus, given you over 1 hour of cool feelings.<br /><br />I'm waiting for the Delicate Sound of Thunder (DVD), so looks like many years to come to get it.
0743454537|4.0|This is a novel pulled right from today's headlines, one filled with ethical conundrums and ambiguities. Medical advances that put us in the position of playing God (but without the infinite wisdom) have no easy right/wrong answers, as Picoult makes abundantly clear in her captivating book. Picoult's characters are as real as your friends and neighbors, good people at heart caught up in troubling issues that are only going to grow more vexing as medical advances continue to outstrip our courts and our ability to come to terms with all the moral implications. Unsettling yet fascinating, My Sister's Keeper is a must-read. It would have received five stars if it weren't for the ending, which could have been much more definitive and less of a convenient, simple way out of a problematic situation. Still, My Sister's Keeper wins a solid recommendation. There's another thoughtful good book, An Audience for Einstein, that explores the ethics of advanced medical science in a somewhat gentler way.
B000002H48|2.0|I really liked this when it came ut on vinyl, but in retrospect, it was the cause, not the music. B. Raitt is grand, G Nash with an excellant Cathedral, J C Young, and the highlight to me We Almost Lost Detroit by the great Gil Scott-Heron. But the second disc is second rate. Edit the filler and it rates higher.
B00005QXXO|5.0|So we all know that a CD can't replace the live experience, but this one definitely withstands the test of time.  The recording values are unparalleled by other band's live sets and the song selections capture the band's adventurous ethos from the first second.  From the opening radio static of \\"The National Anthem\\" to the the final acoustic fade-out of \\"True Love Waits,\\" this album surprises almost every time you listen to it, both in the ways in which Yorke & Co. complicate the original studio versions and in the performance abandon which they bring to their songs; you can hear it coming from the speakers.<br /><br />Radiohead is the best live band I have ever had the privilege to witness (and I've seen Floyd, the Stones, et al).  I've seen them in Grant Park in Chicago and in the Sound Advice Amphitheatre in Boca Raton.  Both times I've had epiphonies (sonic epiphanies) attending their performance (these were certainly aided by the monster video screens and certain unnamed chemicals).  I am struck by how well these epiphonies translate to CD here.  \\"Morning Bell\\" is especially effective on this CD (just like it is in the flesh).  When the band goes out into the electrosphere on their assorted gadgetry, it goes to such unexpected places that one can't help but swoon into oblivion (video/chemical-aided or otherwise, I can attest).  This unexpected element is what keeps them at their place as the best band out there today; they are constantly able to surprise themselves, I am sure.  You hear such prime examples of this aleatory sublime on this live CD, certainly in a much better fashion on the myriad bootlegs that exist of their live shows.  The editing, recording, and performances on here are all superb.  Buy this, whether you've seen them live or not.
B000001EYO|2.0|How can a collection featuring Yma Sumac, Townes Van Zandt, Nina Simone and Moondog get only 2 stars, because of Kenny Rogers & the 1st Edition. This version of the song sucks, and the scene in the movie sucked. Edit this self indulgant dreck out of both and they rate higher.
B000EULJLU|1.0|Before you folks throw the song - \\"Hooker with a penis\\" - in my face, let it be known that never in my life have I ever purchased a cd from this band in my life... <br /> <br />I downloaded it for free from the internet. :-D <br />Also, there is the Radio. <br /> <br />Sorry, I believe that Maynard is a sellout and exploits the stupidity of his fanbase. <br /> <br />He may have more money than me, but what is important is that he doesn't even have a dime of my dollar. <br /> <br />Maynard: You suck for free. For every song of yours that somenoe dowloads, you lose thousands of dollars. <br /> <br />Doesn't pay to be a media whore, does it, stick man? <br /> <br />Tool x Washed up (Maynard = Sellout) = Steaming Pile of Dhiarhea
B000FIMG68|2.0|Lost was such a breakthrough series last year and everyone here in New Zealand was watching it, it was in the top 5 highest rated shows and everything. Then Season 2 came. It was terrible. No plot advances just more questions and very little answers. They are really dragging this out to death. Now since about half way of season 2 Lost isnt even in the Top 15 rates shows. Everyone is over Lost. I watched Season 2 on and off to see if anything had changed and nope! nothing! The Season finale was also very underwhelming. I was upset that Desperate Housewives didn't get any Emmy nominations because on a level, they kind of deserved some nominations. But LOST! I am EXTATIC that it got no Emmy nominations because this can tell the makers of the show to pick up the pace and start answering more questions. Season 2 of Lost for me.....was definitley a sophomore slump.
0140143505|4.0|What I loved about the book was the realization that relationships, even the best of them, are often built on just a few words. Nuance, humor, inflection, or feeling need not be wordy or complicated to attract people to each other.  The breif, often impersonal letters of correspondence between Helene and Frank, who never met otherwise,  over the period between 1949 and 1965, forged a relationship that was quite unique and memorable.  Treat yourself to an easy, heartwarming read from the past.
6300216039|4.0|While I respect the tragedy of \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" I always thought it was a little overrated. (Especially when compared to Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caesar,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"King Lear,\\" and even \\"Coriolanus.\\") But whatever my feelings toward the play itself are, there is no question that Director Franco Zeffirelli made the absolute most of this play. (As he did with his \\"Taming of the Shrew,\\" \\"Jesus of Nazareth,\\" and \\"Hamlet\\" as well!) In the event you have not read the play, this story revolves around 2 lovers. (Romeo and Juliet) They are of different factions, Romeo being a Montague and Juliet a Capulet. These different factions have been feuding for sometime, and while the feud has its final stronghold (Juliet's cousin Tybalt), it is clear that the feud is dying. (An obvious example is when Romeo crashes the Capulet party and Juliet's father tolerates his presence and even speaks quite well of him!) Isaac Asimov points out that while Tybalt seems to be trying to keep the feud alive, Romeo may have asked his father to negotiate with Capulet and possibly even arrage the marriage between Romeo and Juliet to the benefit of all. BUT, Romeo is a romantic and not a rationalist! This is underlined when Romeo talks of dreams, and his eccentric (but highly intelligent) friend Mercutio points out that dreams are just unconscious thoughts. Well, as most of you know, Friar Laurence comes to the aid of Romeo and Juliet, and all is happy. (For a moment) A duel that starts almost as a joke with Tybalt and Mercutio ends in disaster, and Romeo gets banished. From here, things get worse and even the benevolent Friar Laurence chooses a possible solution that has uncertain results. And being that this play is a tragedy, the end is far from happy. As usual, Franco Zeffirelli's scenery is beautiful. He also adds wonderful music and dancing. The scenes of violence are done with taste, and emphasize that violence IS a disturbing thing. Hussey brings beauty and dignity to Juliet. Leonard Whiting is a convincing Romeo. John McEnery handles the difficult role of Mercutio well. Michael York brings a fierce energy to the feud's final stronghold Tybalt. If you like this, be sure to see Michael York as Lucentio in Franco Zeffirelli's \\"Taming of the Shrew.\\" Michael York worked with Franco Zeffirelli yet another time in \\"Jesus of Nazareth.\\" (He was John the Baptist.) Olivia Hussey would also rejoin Michael York and Franco Zeffirelli in \\"Jesus of Nazareth.\\" She would be none other than Mother Mary. I'll finish by saying that even if this play by Shakespeare is overrated, Franco Zeffirelli did a great job with it.

B00005JO20|1.0|First and foremost, the original 1933 version of King Kong still <br />stands as the quintessential monster movie. The special effects <br />are still unsurpassed, realistic and wrenching. The cast is perfect, especially Fay Wray who by herself invented the movie scream. the fact that the original is seen in glorious black and white adds to the films moodiness and mystery. In short, it is an unequaled work of art that required no further rendition. <br /> <br />Now to the recent remake. I titled this review No Progress because as soon as I saw the action on Skull Island I realized that the CGI looked cartoonish, unrealistic, phony and remarked <br />that 73 years later, film making took a giant step backward. <br /> <br />This remake, like many others is a classic example of subtraction by addition. The sad fact is that many young people <br />will only know this colorized version and not appreciate the <br />extraordinary vision and achievement of the original. <br /> <br />No, it wasn't the airplanes. it was CGI killed the beast
B00004BZ0N|5.0|It freaks me out that this album is 25+ years old, and that I've been listening to it for at least 20.  A guy I worked with in the mid-80's turned me on to it, claiming it was the best album ever.  It didn't take long for me to agree, putting it alongside \\"Sticky Fingers\\" as my all-time favorite.  The ambition, musicianship, variety, sound, energy, lyricism...it's all here.  Absorb this masterpiece, and then lament what a sorry state popular music is in today by comparison.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I hadn't heard of Corinne Bailey Rae until I read a review of her self-titled debut CD in Entertainment Weekly. It intrigued me so I bought it without having heard it or seeing the video for \\"Put Your Records On.\\" I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. She has a unique, soulful and sultry voice full of feeling and emotion. I can see how she has been described as a fusion of Billie Holiday, Norah Jones, Alicia Keyes and a touch of Macy Gray. My favorite track on the CD is \\"Trouble Sleeping,\\" but the entire CD is very listenable. I look for more good things to come from this artist and highly recommend this CD.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Three black rabbits with hollow eyes circle the logo for AFI's latest release \\"Decemberunderground\\".  Davey Havok and company are back with a musical vengeance bringing out heavier guitar riffs and melancholic lyrics that have many fans wondering if AFI is back to their dark roots. Originally formed in 1991, AFI helped to make independent label, Nitro, an overnight success with \\"The Art of Drowning\\" in 2000. Their 2003 release, \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" was their first record with DreamWorks and seemed to veer the band off of their morbid path. Sorrow was more catchy than thought provoking, but was able to sell more copies than any other record they had previously released. On their official website, Havok discusses the idea behind the name and emotion of their new album, \\"Decemberunderground is a time and a place. It is where the cold can huddle together in darkness and isolation. It is a community of those detached and disillusioned who flee to love, like winter, in the recesses below the rest of the world.\\"  The album seems to bring AFI from the depth below the world and awaken the AFI that many of us thought were lost forever. The first single off the album, \\"Miss Murder\\" will have the MTV kids running to the their local Tower Records to buy the album while songs like \\"Kill Caustic\\", \\"Affliction\\", and \\"Kiss & Control\\" will give long time AFI fans the pleasure of watching the MTV kids cry to their mommies.
B000002UAU|5.0|Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, I was born in the late 80's, so I wasn't around to experience seeing the Beatles, and therefore, I wasn't around to experience the feeling of buying the coolest album of the summer... the summer of love.  I do know however, that this is one of several great albums that the Beatles made.  It contains catchy songs like \\"Lovely Rita Meter Maid,\\" \\"When I'm 64,\\" and \\"Getting Better.\\"  It also contains a few trippy songs such as \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" and \\"<br />A Day in The Life.\\"  \\"Within You Without You\\" was an Indian (as in India) themed song written by George Harrison with one of the first uses of the citar.  1967 was a year in which there were a lot of experimental albums, and this is a great example.  This is one of the Beatles best albums and definitely worth buying.
0060245867|5.0|...make sure to have cookies and milk to share right after you are done reading it! What a fun book for preschoolers and a good book for introducing sequence of events. One of my son's favorites.
0689865384|5.0|I liked how this book makes the good point that real beauty isn't outside of you, but inside. Uglies was very suspenseful, and dealt with issues of truth and betray as well, as Tally struggles to either join the others in Smoke, the rebel town, or turn the rebels in to Dr. Cable so she can have the operation to be pretty herself. I look forward to reading the next book in the series. I also recommend two other thoughtful books for science fiction fans, An Audience for Einstein and The Giver.
0316776963|2.0|I must admit, while I found some of his stories interesting and things I could relate to, and very easy to read, I don't understand all of the raves about him - the funniest writer around, side-splittingly funny, etc.  A friend who has read other things by him thought that it might just be an acquired taste, as she has found each of his works progressively funnier.  Sorry, but I really didn't like reading it, kept waiting for it to be over, and would have put it down if I wasn't reading it for a book club.  Just being honest.
0156012197|5.0|Does this book need another review?  Probably not.  Had I not been emailed by amazon to review my recent purchases, I likely wouldn't have bothered... <br /> <br />Anyhow, I bought this for my seven-year-old daughter for summer reading.  She liked the surface story but didn't quite grasp some of the mythos and analogies especially the side stories making fun of adult behavior. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this book is a classic certainly to be read and reread by generations.  I actually am saddened by the thought of the day my daughter will be able to understand the concepts and emotions the author conveys, since that will mean she will have grown up, and lost some of the innocence that the little Prince character so endearingly exudes.

B000003CUJ|5.0|If you're looking for a single CD of orchestral music from Wagner's Ring, I'd like to recommend this one.  Here's why.    Wagner's tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen contains some of the most magnificent, most stirring, most imaginative music ever written (along with some that's pedestrian and dull; there are glorious moments, splendid peaks, and there are arid stretches, longeurs that make one wish that Wagner the supreme egotist had submitted his work to the judgment of a good editor).  The four operas comprising it are Das Rheingold (1869), Die Walkure (1870), Siegfried (1876), and Gotterdammerung (1876).  Taken together they form the towering masterwork and crowning achievement of Wagner's maturity.  They are also immensely long:  about 17 hours.      The problem has always been to extract the best parts of the Ring for satisfactory concert presentation.  The Ring does not make this easy:  it contains no conventional overtures or preludes, no conveniently extractable bits. Thus various hands ever since Wagner's day have carved out \\"bleeding chunks,\\" with mixed results, and the practice has always been controversial.      This CD presents a different approach.  In order to make this recording---to quote the Wagner expert in Third Ear:  Classical Music:  The Listener's Companion (ed. Alexander J. Morin, 2002; an excellent book, by the way)---\\"Maazel decided to create his own vast symphonic suite from the Ring, and he has toured with it around the world. . . .  If you want to hear the best parts of the Ring without sitting down to 17 hours or so, this is your best bet.\\"  I agree.  Maazel's 70-minute symphonic synthesis of the best music from the Ring has a consistency, an integration and seamless flow, an organic rightness lacking in other Ring orchestral-highlights programs, with their \\"bleeding chunks\\" approach.  Also, Maazel's suite gives a better idea of the scope and variety of the Ring, of its full range of colors and sonorities, than the standard orchestral excerpts.      Let Maazel describe his priorities in putting his suite together:  \\"I was intrigued by the challenge:  could a symphonic synthesis of the Ring reveal the essentials?  I bolted the following list of criteria to my drawingboard:  One:  the synthesis must be free-flowing and chronological, beginning with the first note of Rheingold and finishing with the last chord of Gotterdammerung.  Two:  the transitions must be harmonically and periodically justifiable, the pacing contrasts commensurate with the length of the work.  Three:  most all of the music originally written for orchestra without voice must be used, adding those sections with a vocal line essential to a synthesis . . . .    Four:  every note must be Wagner's own. . . .  Though no conscious attempt was made to include all the Ring's motifs, most of them do surface in one form or another.\\"     The result as represented on this CD is eminently satisfactory.  Maazel is a seasoned Wagner conductor, and has conducted the complete Ring at Bayreuth and elsewhere.  The Berlin Philharmonic is one of the world's great orchestras.  Both it and Maazel are in top form here:  the performance is idiomatic and assured, sweeping and eloquent, played to the hilt, bristling with authority and conviction.  I hope I'm not being fanciful in finding that listening to the whole suite straight through yields a kind of catharsis.  The sound is robust, full-bodied, with wide dynamic range, with solid weight and impact.  Telarc's engineers have done a commendable job of coping with the problematic acoustics of Berlin's Philharmonie; this is probably just about the best sound that can be extracted from that vexed venue.      The recording was made in Dec. 1987.  Total playing time is 69:40 (broken out as follows:  Das Rheingold 14:47, Die Walkure 12:42, Siegfried 6:15, and Gotterdammerung 36:33; if this seems to give short shrift to Siegfried, it has always been musically the weakest of the four operas).      In short, it'shard to imagine a better orchestral introduction to the glories of the Ring.  The virtues of this CD move it to the top of its class:  highly recommended.
B0002W18MU|5.0|My mom died recently and I cried through virtually this entire album (in my car--sobbing, probably should have pulled over).  The first song I played over and over.  Also the song about the train taking off with the mom while the baby was crying so much his eyes were red...Sorry I can't remember the titles.  The part where he sings he heard her call his name.  How poignant.  More crying.  <br /> <br />All I can say is that Johnny Cash was a huge part of the music in my parents'house as I was growing up (in the 60s and 70s) and not discovered again until \\"Walk the Line\\" reminded me of my time as a child listening to the radio while driving across country with my parents and brother. <br /> <br />I will definitely play this CD at my mom's memorial at sea.  I love this CD--it was gut wrenching and soul inspiring at the same time.  I am so glad I bought it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I can feel this cd every time I put it in.  Chris Cornell is one of the best singers I have ever heard and every song on here show his vocal skills and range.  When I hear him sing it is like he's in my soul singing from within me.  I highly suggest this cd to everyone.
B00006CXSS|5.0|...is the most profound legacy of the actions of veterans of WWII, such as those in Easy Company whose heroic exploits against pro-White Germany are documented in Band of Brothers.  It would be hard to come to such a conclusion from a two-or-three-hour film like Saving Private Ryan which--in conforming to narrow plot conventions--presents an abbreviated, textbook example of both the horrors of war and its competing causes (i.e. freedom vs. tyranny), the only things one can divine from brief exposure to such an enormous subject as WWII in the European theater.  With its meandering serialized form, BOB can more accurately depict the totality of life during warfare:  moods, sensations, joys, lust, comraderie, hunger, fear, hatred, compassion, and, most of all, boredom.  The sheer drudgery of war--the monotonous beat of advancing columns, battle prep, attack and counterattack--is simply beyond the scope of any film.  When one is absorbed by the subtleties of BOB, one begins to see the metaphorical forest which, for me, was the forest, or more specifically the color of the forest, and the snow, and the dirt, and the soldiers and their uniforms.  The muted, almost monochromatic color scheme is striking, as is the fact that virtually everyone is white.  Could any of these soldiers even conceive of the world they were bringing about in this battlefield, this \\"crucible of time\\"?  They fought for our freedoms, yes, but our free society is--at least in theory--ephemeral, as political systems may come and go given the current circumstance.  In the aftermath of some staggering disaster, I doubt that a freewheeling democracy would remain when a more authoritarian regime would be better suited for those in need of mere survival.  I am in no way suggesting that the veterans deliberately wanted to alter the racial composition of Western societies, but, that is the ultimate legacy of the outcome of WWII, whether you like it or not.  I would not be surprised if the prescriptively white nature of Euro-theater-themed works is the main reason for their popularity and  continuing creation.  With its non-triumphal tone and lack of Spielberg-ian contrivance, \\"Band of Brothers\\" is the most poignant of these time capsules.
B000A2RRF4|2.0|Onkyo receiver - Check <br />Thunderous Surround Sound - Check <br />50 Inch Panasonic Plasma - Check <br />Thrilled (no pun intended) with this concert - NOPE <br /> <br />VERY Disappointing.  It is the HBO special.  They did NOTHING to this DVD.  Picture quality is poor - Sound is poor.  I'm going to watch my Alicia Keyes DVD now...THAT's a GREAT production - someone needs some tips.  I'm glad it was only $12.99. <br />
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for Pulse to come to DVD and I wet my pants. It was talked about for years, and actually had a street date about 3-4 years ago. But now it's out, and it's amazing. The audio is incredible and the video looked quite good! Its comparible to the audio quality of Dark side in Super Audio format. Great use 5.1!  <br /> <br />It was incredible after all the wait, the DVD came out on the day the announcement of Syd Barrettt passing away......Pretty sad, but kind of a nice way to celebrate a persons life. Buy this disk, and hope the future they are in widescreen. <br /> <br />Next on the list of Pinl Floyd DVD's will be the Live On An Island Tour, and after going to 4 shows I know it will freakin rock... Go Dave, we miss you Roger, but will see you in LA performing Dark Side in October...and you know there will be a DVD from Roger soon after this tour! <br /> <br />Oh yeah did I mention my dog is name Gilmour!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I did not watch this series when it aired on TV. In fact, I had never even heard of it when I went to the theatre to see the movie, Serenity. I went because the previews showed a quirky and unique movie- both characteristics that I like. I loved the movie and when I was raving about it to a friend they mentioned that it sprang from a defunct TV series. Well, naturally, I rushed out to buy the series and it has become my all-time favorite.
0670034711|5.0|You'd have to know what a cheapskate I can be and that I almost NEVER read a book a second time -- even when I tell myself I will -- to know what a huge deal it is for me to buy a hardcover copy of a book I've already read. That's how much I loved the book.  <br /> <br />Elizabeth Gilbert is just a flat-out wonderful writer. Any story she has to tell would be worth reading, it seems to me. Her voice grabbed me at the start and I literally could not put down the book. I read it over two days and was racing the clock to finish it on Sunday night so I could discuss it over dinner with the friend I'd borrowed it from. <br /> <br />Many people who've posted here have done a wonderful job of encapsulating the basic premises of this book. I'll just had that this book has the wonderful, indescribableness of Anne Lamott's nonfiction. You learn so much, you laugh so much, you feel so much. All the joys of reading are here. Highly recommended!
B00004XQ83|4.0|I never saw this movie but one day I heard the song \\"I am a man of constant sorrow\\" and I had to have it.  I love just about every song on here.  One of my favorites is \\"Big rock candy mountain.\\"  This cd is very blues,country and soul sounding.  So if you like any of those kinds of music I am sure you will enjoy this cd.
1591791707|5.0|If you read this book...you'll, at least, sleep a lot easier at night.<br />I bought one for each and every ex-wife to date! Mind you, they have all suffered from bouts of insomnia at one time or another in their (unread) past....
B00005JLWN|4.0|I liked this movie for the space it created in the sci-fi area.  Christian Bale was as usual dead-pan and perfect for the roll and Tye Diggs did a good job in the role of adversary.  The colors played right along with the cold and lifeless mood the controlling powers evoked in the population and I almost  let out a gasp when the M??? L??? work of art was set ablaze.<br /><br />(movie buffs check out Farenheit 459, I thought of it while watching this one). The high-lite for me though was the very idea to combine modern day hand gun technology with the age old art of martial arts.  The fighting sequences were fantastic and the pace of the movie seemed to me to move along enough to keep me interested.  I think that this is one move that action fans will watch over and over again.  I was very close to giving it 5 stars but I hate when beautiful women are lost.  Good stuff!!!
B0002234LS|4.0|Johnny Depp Stars as Mort Rainey, a semi-famous author living in the mountians as a sort of shelter from his (pending) ex-wife who cheated on him in a hotel with Ted Milner played by Timothy Hutton, her current fiance (also understandably,... pending). Very soon after the movie begins we meet John Shooter, an angry and very eccentric Mississppi man who is led to believe that Mort plagerized one of his beloved stories, \\"Secret Window\\" (what a suprise!),. Conflicts rise, animals are killed, people get mangled with screw drivers while others get diced with axes. You get the picture if you have seen a few horror or thriller films. The movie though is more of a guessing game for the first hour or so but in the end lies a twist, dont get to excited because the twist is actually quite common in films nowadays ... but overall all very good acting makes veiwers to believe that the film is actaully better than it is. The story is based on a Stephen King novel. The screenplay is really not hat great same goes for the directing, but overall I found the film to be somewhat convincing and overall pretty good with the ending. Though the ending might be some what confusing, if you were paying attention than you should understand everything just fine. Johnny Depp gets right down within the \\"Depp-th's\\" of the film and is really convincing. John Turtorro's performance as the bad guy (John Shooter) is also really good.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good horror film than this is not for you, it's PG-13, very low on blood and not at all scary, BUT the film his more than it's share of sheer suspense and is a pretty good, involved thriller.<br /><br />Grade: B-
B000FVBLEI|5.0|This is a metal masterpiece. Plain and simple. If you love metal--buy this album.  Excellent!!!
B000FVQYYK|3.0|..and i can understand why. it's good, it really is, especially starlight, supermassive blackhole, and the absolutely lovely soldier's poem. but this music is ultimately rehashed, with maybe a few new elements thrown in (namely that synthy eighties pop sensibility that's been so popular as of late). it's the same uninspired hit or miss chord progressions/vocal patterns, though they are getting better at it. in all fairness i'd give this 3 1/2 stars, but i'm rounding down because so many people are already giving this incredibly undeserved 5 star ratings.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I got this cd after hearing a song of his on itunes.  I loved this cd from the first song.  Every song is very acoustic and relaxed.  For all you people out there who get home from work and are stressed out and need to relax this cd is for you.  Just put on some comfortable clothes, get a beer, turn down the lights, turn the phone on low and just feel the music.  This is a great cd and each song should grab you and make you want more.
0553801503|3.0|This book very fully developed the dullest and most boring non-central characters. I spent the entire novel waiting for one of the interesting central characters of the previous plotlines to reappear and was mostly disappointed. Instead of resolving and nurturing the various subplots as needed, the author went in an entirely different direction. Warning: any writing involving Danaerys is a total yawn. Very glad that I didn't waste $28 on this hardcover, just sorry that the person who gave it to me as a gift did. Please, let book 5 be less of a snore!
B000EHSVQE|5.0|What Napolean Dynamite brings to film is something that we have never seen before, with it's pathetic nerd humor \\"Napolean Dynamite\\" is one of the most clever films to come around in a long time. John Heder in his first performance in a leading role, or really any role period ... shows that he knows exactly what he is doing and should be looked at as one of the new elite comical actors.  <br /> <br />The no budget film \\"Napolean Dynamite\\", honestly doesnt really even have much of a point to it, and if it does than it can pretty much be summed up in three words ... \\"VOTE FOR PEDRO\\". If you want to watch a comedy that stars an actor like Adam Sandler and has a big budget, than you will most likely be dissapointed because this movie is not meant to be like that ... at all. A low budget movie is a completely different kind of film altogether, A low budget comedy has to have it's laughs 99% from dialouge usually a subtle type of comedy. Napolean Dynamite's Dialouge is outragously sad yet completely comical. The people, plot and setting are all very different but all well thought out and purposely pitiful. <br /> <br />After seeing this film I was hoping for many more of it's kind. In June the Director of this film released his second film \\"Nacho Libre\\", though it had pretty good numbers in the box office, overall the film tried to be like \\"Dynamite\\" and pretty much ... failed. Though it had a few laughs the movie was not very good. I think that \\"Napolean Dynamite\\" is a one of a kind, unique and great comedy that people will remember, love, laugh and talk about for many years to come... <br /> <br />Grade: A-
B00005YW4H|2.0|Don't get me wrong, this is not such a bad piece of music (most buyers and reviewers seem more than satisfied). But, since Ms Jones is often referred to as a jazz musician, I feel obliged to point out that from the jazz point of view she has very little to offer.<br /><br />Not only does she come from country and pop music as much as she comes from jazz (at least at this album; I haven't listened to much of her other work), she has terrible influence world wide. Because of her financial success, all sorts of easy-listening singers get labeled jazz-divas even in my small country in South-East Europe.<br /><br />I hate to disagree with the popular vote, but for me this album falls somewhere between background music and background noise.

1401302378|5.0|In many ways, Chris Anderson's \\"The Long Tail\\" is a tale of post-modernity meeting marketing. In our current post-modern culture, choice is everything because experience is everything. And, peer recommendation is everything because believing other people's stories (their narrative of their experience) is everything.<br /><br />This rather pedantic sociological analysis aside, Anderson's subtitle explains well his premise: \\"Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More.\\" Or, as one wag cutely and curtly summarizes, \\"niches are riches.\\" In other words, not everyone can be rich and famous. However, with the explosion of technology, everyone can find their passion and promote it successfully to a livable extent.<br /><br />Of course, in some ways this is not much different from ancient \\"modernity.\\" For instance, it has long been the practice in publishing that the top few authors receive the vast majority of promotion from publishers. The only difference now is that the starving author or artist might actually find enough takers to feed her or his family.<br /><br />What's the \\"take home\\" for the average Jane or Joe entrepreneur? Location, location, location. That is, get the message about your message (be it a book, a song, a new business, etc.) out to the right people. And who are the right people?--your target audience. Know who wants your message and know how to reach them. And, know how to encourage them to tell their friends about your product. Word of mouth truly does work in post-modern niche marketing. Forget spending the big bucks on professional marketing--leave that to the big boys. Save your money by focusing on the \\"pass it on\\" principle\\"--one satisfied customer telling other hungry potential customers about what you have to offer.<br /><br />Back to Anderson, he takes this rather simple message and both creatively and statistically relates it to our current culture. Of course, he is the head of the long tail, but the rest of us at least can find hope to be somehow connected to the body.<br /><br />Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Soul Physicians,\\" \\"Spiritual Friends,\\" and \\"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\"the body.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|I first heard of Panic! At The Disco when they were still underground, and I am so glad that they have begun to emerge as a solid rock band, because their music is outstanding, and this album proves it.  It actually amazes me very much that this CD is the band's first, for to me, the music reveals a level of musical maturity that is hard to find these days, even from older bands.  Now, on to the actual music... <br /> <br />Overall, the music is very good.  The music is very refreshing, and it has an almost quirky edge to it that is just enough to grab your attention--and keep it--but not so much that it's too much in-your-face.  The boys (I say \\"boys\\" because they are only 19) do a fantastic job blending \\"traditional\\"  rock music with more edgy, not-so-conventional sounds to produce an amazing musical experience.  Most new listeners are probably most familiar with the band's first single, \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\", and if you like that song, I'll guarantee you'll love the rest, because although this song is a great one, it is definitely just a teaser for the fabulous songs surrounding it.  \\"I Write Sins\\" was the first song I heard, and I'll admit at first I was caught off-guard by the unusual-sounding song, but that distinct sound is exactly what separates this band from the rest.  Brendon Urie, the frontman, is a fantasic singer with a very crisp, pure voice, and he displays quite a range that is impressive.  And Ryan Ross, the band's guitarist and lyricist, displays some incredible skill not only at his instrument but also by the witty, clever, catchy lyrics sung throughout the album.  Also, the songs' titles are from books and movies, a fact I found to be very interesting.  If you want to know which song is the best on the album, I personally think it is \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\\"...you have to hear it to know what I mean. <br /> <br />In all, \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" is a fantastic new album by a very talented new band.  The music is very refreshing,catchy, and engaging.  The lyrics, as is the music, is very clever and innovative, and the boys have done an incredible job producing an excellent album.  This CD, in my opinion, is a must-buy.  Hope this helps!!!
B0006PV5US|3.0|El contenido artístico de este Hybrid SACD contempla obras impresionistas de los titulares franceses. <br /> <br />Por un lado, Ravel, con su Bolero y bajo la dirección de Munch, a mi gusto no llena la expectativa comparado con otras opciones disponibles de esta obra.    Lo que Munch no alcanza, es ese nivel de tensión creciente conforme también crece la riqueza orquestal de la obra, la cual debería interpretarse como un crescendo constante hasta alcanzar el climax; en el caso de Munch, arranca bien, pero se mantiene relativamente constante en el medio de la obra y el climax aparece casi exclusivamente en la última recapituación del tema principal. <br /> <br />La Rapsodie Espagnole, otra obra subproducida en interpretación; por largo están otras que, sin necesariamente ser las mejores, superan a esta rendición, como por ejemplo Giulini con la Orquesta Sinfónica de Chicago, también con la Filarmónica de Los Angeles o Karajan en su última rendición de esta misma obra... <br /> <br />Por el lado de La Valse, la realidad cambia drásticamente y encontramos una calidad artística de muy alto nivel en lo referente a esta obra; obviamente, ayuda en mucho la tecnología DSD y el sonido obtenido a través del SACD.   Bien podría erigirse como la referencia en lo que respecta a la misma. <br /> <br />Finalmente, Debussy con sus Imágenes para Orquesta, cuyo sonido es intoxicantemente delicioso, no así la consistencia de la interpretación, la cual presenta momentos sublimes de inspiración y otros muy lejanos a este estándar. <br /> <br />No me cabe la menor duda de que el Sr. Munch fue un gran ícono en su época; no obstante, su época se encuentra en el pasado y podríamos obtener mayor calidad interpretativa en grabaciones más recientes, a excepción segura, de lo referido en La Valse. <br /> <br />Por último, el sonido obtenido a través del DSD y SACD compra el tiquete para disfrutar este CD con el mejor sonido que se pueda obtener de estas interpretaciones históricas, lo cual en muchos casos los tienen muy bien merecido, como en la gran mayoría de lanzamientos realizados por RCA de las interpretaciones de Fritz Reiner.

0307276902|3.0|I don't want to say a whole lot about this whole mess with James Frey and \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" - believe me, the Smoking Gun (click above title for link) and Oprah and every other piece of media out there has already done so. Pretty much everything has already been said on the matter. But as an avid reader, I'd like to throw down my dime... <br /> <br />I picked this book up at the library near the time it was first released. The reason I picked it up? Solely for the cover. I do this sometimes while at the library - grab the books I've ordered and then a few more, based only on aesthetic reasons. Might be the cover design, might be the size of the volume, might be the title - anything that grabs my eye and appeals to one sense or another, for whatever reason. Sometimes I find a good book, and sometimes not. <br /> <br />\\"A Million Little Pieces\\" fell into the \\"good, but forgettable\\" category for me. I enjoyed the read, but didn't find it profound, and didn't recommend it to anyone. The book was on the new arrivals shelf at the library, so I had no idea it was supposed to be a memoir. I approached the book from a fiction perspective. <br /> <br />I'm sure some portions were drawn from personal experience, as most written works are, and particularly so for first-time writers. At any rate, I was really surprised to hear all the hoopla surrounding the book these past few months: Oprah's selection (which I had not heard about), the Smoking Gun report, blah, blah, blah... Even more surprising was that so many people were reading this book as nonfiction, and as inspirational nonfiction at that. <br /> <br />I understand taking something away from a book one reads - that's the mark of a good book. That brief and entirely personal moment when the book is closed and held close. But to take a printed work at face value, simply because it says \\"memoir\\" and might be shelved with the other nonfiction is sheer folly. If something inspires one to change his or her messed up life, does it matter if its a work of fiction or nonfiction? Does it matter if it was Oprah or Dr. Phil, or a picture of a basket of puppies? And if one's resolve fails after finding out the truth about whatever he thought was his inspiration, was his will to change that strong in the first place? <br /> <br />On the flip side of Frey's current negative press - is there really any such thing as bad publicity, particularly for a writer?
B000EMGAGW|2.0|due to the several set-backs this album failed miserably in sale's...the album has a couple good tracks, then it also had POTENTIAL..but all that 50 is worried about is making money, and this was an obvious FLOP...in one of 50's songs \\"Not Rich, Still Lyin'\\" he states he is going to have a \\"New Album\\" released july 18th, here it is july 12th and no news on this \\"album\\" someone needs to tell the people at INTERSCOPE that 50 is telling everyone one thing, and not delivering it..
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I was looking forward to this version of my favorite novel because I wanted to see how they would slice it down to two hours runtime.  I was delighted with some of it.  Miss Knightley's performance is quite good and she seems to possess all the fire of Elizabeth Bennet.  Brenda Blethyn and Dame Judy Dench (perfection itself) were also standouts, although Miss Dench's important final scene with Miss Knightley was abridged.  And why does she mention a pretty sort of garden (taken from the novel), when they play this scene inside the house at night? <br />   <br />I found quite a few more flaws in the production.  The best dialogue is taken directly from the book.  When Miss Austen speaks, the film and the actors are just fine.  When the dialogue is newly invented, it doesn't seem to fly along.  I found Matthew McFadyen rather wooden and not as attractive as the characters say Mr. Darcy is.  Also, the family relationships are not correctly delineated as Miss Austen wrote them.  In the novel, Mr. Bennet favors Elizabeth for her wit.  Of all his daughters, she is the only one, he confides in the book, that he can converse with on an intelligent level.  Also, Lydia (in the novel) is an exact replica of her mother -- which is not apparent in this film.  Also, Mrs. Bennet favors Lydia above her other daughters in the book.  This is nowhere apparent in the film.  It seems that the daughters are all lumped together as one by their parents.  Mr. Bennet's financial concerns are barely brought to light and Lydia's scandalous elopement with Wycham, which is so important to the denoument, is reduced to little more than a trifling matter and is over with in less than three to four minutes.  The ending is like a fast-forward (obviously they were running out of time), and we get a tacked on coda that has Darcy and Elizabeth at Pemberley in a love scene.  Miss Austen's \\"psychology\\" is missing nearly throughout this film.   <br /> <br />The DVD supplies us with the actors being interviewed as well as screenwriter and director, and here is where we find where they went wrong.  It seems that all of the information they are giving us is not at all what Miss Austen intended.  Donald Sutherland himself (Mr. Bennet), constantly speaks of how much his character loves his daughters.  Maybe he should try re-reading the book.  Mr. Bennet spent nearly all his time in his library wishing to be undisturbed by the noise of his wife and the household in general. <br /> <br />I am forever grateful to the BBC for having taken the novel, one of the finest in the English language, and giving it the royal treatment in 1995 with superlative actors and a screenwriter who knew how to aptly recreate Miss Austen's world.  How fastidious they were with every detail and Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth seem to be the quintessential leading players in this beautiful production.  We have it for as long as DVDs and film last. <br />   <br />This new production, even though it is sliced down, seems slow, oddly enough, and I could not wait for it to be over.  I look forward to sitting down with the 1995 version soon. <br /> <br />
B000001DVV|4.0|UKJ come into town on their one trick pony. The whole schtick of appealing to normal middle class kids desperate to think the world is against them....  Well the packaging sets that trick up nicely along with the title choice. Not to mention the song Neighbour as lead song.<br /><br />But darn it all this pretty much works. Sure it's based on nothin' but air, a few squared off riffs and Whitfield Cranes engaging vocals but most of the time when you reach for the skip button something stops your hand. Tracks such as Come Tomorrow and Panhandlin' Prince work their witless charm though when the delve too deeply into whimsical territory things fall over (see Busy Bee).<br /><br />Madman and Everything About You are regurgitated from the debut EP and everyone at the time became familiar with the bands take on Cats in the Cradle. This tune split many at the time - dunno 'bout you but I always felt the original spoke louder to parents, while UKJ's version with it's more youthful attack spoke more clearly to those not yet dads.<br /><br />In summation a totally non essential release but definitely a good party album full of irreverent lyrics and simple cartoon style songs - some of which have some surprising heft such as Goddam Devil. Not to mention the closer, the track Mr Recordman which has a spark of maturity about it.
0930289234|5.0|If you're looking at this product, you must have already heard what people say about it. It's all true. the acclaim, the shock and awe. Read it. Buy it, read it twice, read it again. you'll find something new EACH TIME. that's how much work alan moore put in here. amazing.
B000EYK2GE|5.0|You really have to see the video of this wonderful show to fully appreciate it, but an album version of this concert has been long overdue for years since this is some of the hottest rockabilly ever performed in one setting. Carl Perkins, George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Dave Edmonds, and Rosanne Cash have rarely sounded better than they did in this totally infectious 1985 rockabilly session taped in England.    The top-notch backing band led by Dave Edmonds does a great job of recreating Carl Perkins' classic songs in their original arrangements while making them rock like never before!  There is a great, driving version of \\"Matchbox\\" with Perkins, Clapton, and Ringo all singing verses of the song.  Another highlight is a rockin' version of Roy Orbison's \\"Mean Woman Blues\\" that features Clapton wailing away on a scorching guitar solo!    The powerhouse performance of Perkins' masterpiece \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" is reason enough to buy this CD. Anybody who still associates this song with Elvis needs to hear Carl tear into it with his heart and soul in this performance. This is simply the greatest version of this rock n' roll classic ever performed by anyone!     Get a copy of this CD, but most importantly, be sure to get the video of this superb show if you've never seen it. This is as good as rock n' roll ever gets!
006054094X|4.0|This remarkable book owes its publication to the rare and happy confluence of naval experience, curiosity, persistence,ample time for never-ending research and adequate funding. I found Menzies work to be well reasoned and a valuable contribution to setting the historic record straight. Building on scattered, previously known, facts as well as new evidence, Menzies did his research intelligently and connected the dots deftly. At the same time he allows for divergent views and the need for additional research to further substantiate his hypothesis.
0385474547|5.0|This was required reading for a world literature class that I took. But I read for enjoyment, and so I opened this book up to see what it had to offer me. I was rewarded with a very thought-provoking story. I should say here that I attend a Christian college associated with the 'missionary' denomination, and books that challenge the missionaries' ethics and purpose are handled very carefully by the faculty. Because I spent three months in Africa and because I have been on missions trips, Achebe's tale spoke directly to me about the way that we as Christians tend to handle the people that we are supposedly 'evangelizing'. I do not call myself a missionary by any definition of the word, but 'Things Fall Apart' was an eye-opener to the way that we treat people who are different regardles of how we may feel about them.
B0000714BP|4.0|In real life (correct me if I am wrong), I thought that drag queens only dress as women to perform. This movie has the \\"ladies\\" in face 24/7. Wouldn't that make them more like transexuals? Other than this confusing item, I thought the movie itself was quite good. There were a few cheesy scenes, but overall the writing and funny lines more than made up for any flaws.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I have literally waited over FIVE (5) years for this release!!   <br />Thanks to the over 7,000 fans worldwide that signed the internet petition!!   <br /> <br />Bought the last DVD copy they had and thats on the first day!! <br /> <br />This is by far and away the best car racing movie ever made, period!!  Captures a golden age now long gone.   <br /> <br />You do not do it justice at home and not on the big screen, but home theatere plasma, 5.1 sound and you are there in the car!! <br /> <br />Even though a sometimes syrupy plot, the action, cinemetography, and sound in this film are a classic and masterpiece for 1966.  The only regret is John Frankenheimer passed before this was released and his commentary.  A true visionary.  Buy this DVD~!!  If you like motorsports, this is a true gem and a milestone film classic in every sense of the word!!
B00004T9UF|4.0|I'm not gonna say that this album is the greatest album of all time. But it is a good album from Eminem. Eminem is probably a great white rapper but not the greatest rapper of all time. With this album Eminem just came out with the flows in this.B!t@# please 2 is the best song on here and my favorite Eminem song too. Dre also put it down with some good beats and this album had some good apperances like Dr.Dre, Snoop, Nate Dogg, RBX, and more. This album has many memorbile songs like Stan, The Way I Am, The Real Slim Shady, and also songs that got Em in alot of Heat like Kim and Kill You. This album is known for violent lyrics, and use of hateful words to gay's but it didn't stop me from hearing. Not that  don't have a problem with gay's but everyone was talking about it that I had to give it a shot. It may not meet the standards of great rap albums like All Eyez On Me, The Chronic, Doggy Style, or Enter The WuTang Clan (36 Chambers), but this is good. Anyway I didn't expect to like this album but I did. Not one of my favorite albums but an album I like to hear now and then. I suggest hearing this album from someone who has it. If you like then go out and buy it. Way better than his crappy album Encore.
B00080ZG10|4.0|My husband and I liked this movie - except for the horrible plane crash that Hughes experienced. It was so graphic and painful that my husband was still talking about it the next day. The portrayal of OCD in Hughes life was very brilliantly played by DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett made a surprisingly accurate Katherine Hepburn.<br /><br />The Aviator is a movie that we have to plan to watch because it is so long and time-consuming. Usually it's a rainy day film, or one that we reserve for pizza nights when it's just the two of us. It IS a long watch. I find myself skipping ahead to some more poignant scenes at times. Overall, we like it - once in awhile.
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|I enjoyed Season 2 of &#34;The O.C.&#34;  Granted it wasn't as great as Season 1, but it's still up there right below it.  The reason I knocked off a star is that there were too many predictable moments.  Too many set ups that were so far fetched that it was absurd.  This was in the little things such as characters showing up at another characters door when they have no idea where they live, but wanted to pop by to tell them three sentences.  No one would do that in real life.  I realize this isn't real life, but make believe TV, but at least in Season 1, they made it as believable as possible.<br /><br />Some spoilers up ahead, but I'm assuming at this point those who wanted to see this show have already done so, if not, then don't read on as I might ruin it for you.  This was a darker season where everything really seemed to go wrong especially with the main O.C. couple Sandy and Kirsten.  The writers pushed them both to teeter on that fine line of having affairs, which is really out of character of who they were in Season 1.  And then making Kirsten fall into alcoholism, which her character would never have got that vulnerable.  Suddenly Sandy is trying to send her to rehab.  So what, she's been hitting the bottle a little too much for a few months.  Sending her to rehab that quickly seemed too unusual.<br /><br />There were some finer moments and the actress that does play Kirsten showcased some strong acting chops in this.  I liked that they made Julie Cooper more likable in this season, even though know you can't entirely trust her, but you longer look at her with venom as you did in Season 1.  The ridiculousness with the kids was irritating at times.  Summer not knowing whether she wants to stay with Zach or Seth. Speaking of Seth, he grew more irritating in this season.  Even the characters around him were getting to the point of rolling their eyes.  There was a nice addition to the cast in a number of episodes with actress Olivia Wilde, who would later become the more famous actor coming out of the O.C.  She played a rough tough chick running a bar.  She has a romance with Seth as well as Marissa.  Speaking of which, Marissa Cooper was a little more likable in this season over the previous season.  She was a little more grounded and less reactive over everything that Ryan does or says, but then again they were barely together as a couple in this season until towards the end.<br /><br />While this was still a good dish and a guilty pleasure, it had one too many absurdities where situations felt way too contrived and controlled by the writers just to force a dramatic plot to happen.  Despite my criticisms with this Season, I still enjoyed it.me the more famous actor coming out of the O.C.  She played a rough tough chick running a bar.

0743454537|5.0|My sister gave me this book to read after her book club read it. I could not put it down! The topic of the book will stir debates about what is and isn't going too far with genetic engineering. The chapters are written from each of the characters' viewpoints and that lends a great deal of vibrancy to the story. Pay attention to the fonts that each chapter is written in, and when you are done reading the book, go back to the beginning and re-read the opening for a shock of clarity. I've never read a Jodi Picoult novel before but I thought this was a very enjoyable read.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|So many of these reviewers are complaining that it's not in WS. It wasn't shot that way, virtually NO concerts were back then if they were shot on Video. Get over it! To make it WS they would have to chop the top and bottom off of the the original image! <br /> <br />sheesh
0440237688|5.0|I absolutely adore this novel.  I remember reading it in junior high school and now I find myself re-reading it in college.  This is one of my favorite books of all time to say the least.  Any person can read this book and I can predict they will not be able to put it down.  The writing is incredible and the character of \\"Jonas\\" is so real.  \\"The Giver\\" is one of the best novels ever written without a doubt.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Grand Prix is the greatest racing movie of all time.  Having searched and paid a premium for the VHS version, you can imagine my excitement when I learned of the DVD release of the movie.  I was not disappointed.  The pedigree of the movie is stellar.  The director is John Frankenheimer.  An international cast includes Eva Marie Sainte, Toshiro Mifune, James Gardner, and Yves Montand.  Francoise Hardy (\\"Tous les garcons et les filles\\") is so hot, also credibly acts in this film.  Actual team names and cars (Ferrari, BRM, and All American Racing, but sadly not Lotus nor Honda) and famous drivers (Phil Hill, Graham Hill, Bruce McClaren), are in the movie and involved in the filming of the movie.  Actual race footage is incorporated into the movie.  Actual drivers are present in the movie.  The film won three technical Academy Awards, best film editing, sound and sound effects.  Before IMAX, before video games, before video cams, using sixteen Panavision cameras, some mounted on the racing cars, some in a Ford GT 40 chase car, Frankenheimer provides the exquisite shots we expect today on ESPN or SPEED...the view of the driver and pan to the front view, the vibration, the buffeting, the sweeping blur about a hairpin of actual driving.  That is why the movie stands the test of time.   As stated in the additional materials, it is unlikely that a racing movie of this scale will ever be made again.   <br /> But this is not a documentary.  A great movie, even if it isn't true, is realistic enough that you believe that is reality.  The story lines touch on real issues... is winning everything, why do men like to go fast, are their significant others uneasy, why is death or danger ignored, can relationships be serious or merely transitory... It also provides a vicarious look into Grand Prix racing in the 1960's, the fashion, the life, the glamour.  Grand Prix DVD also provides special features that demand purchasing the DVD even if you have the VHS version (sans special features of course).  Five documentaries are provided...This movie was viewed on a 27 inch flat screen TV, sound through a subwoofer and two satellite speakers (two five inch mid-range, one two inch tweeter per speaker) and the sound was great (it did win an Academy award for sound)... I can hardly wait to see it on my friend's 52 inch wide-screen with Dolby Digital 5.1.  Wow...what a movie.    <br />
0385334206|2.0|I am a huge Vonnegut fan. I have read them all. This was one of the last that I read, and by far my least favorite. I barely got through it. DO NOT start reading Vonnegut with this book. Start with Slaughterhouse Five or something else, and save Cat's Cradle for last.....
6305252572|5.0|My step-father received this DVD in excellent condition and in time for his birthday!  Great job!
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is an absolute classic, every song on this album is great. This is definately one of the best albums ever, if you don't have this album then go get it now, u won't regret it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to all rap and hip-hop fans.
6304490399|5.0|My experience with motorcycles has been challenging to say the least. I even fell of a Honda CT-70 in 1975 at 2 mph. Bruce Brown makes this movie great with his commentary. The subjects and the comments have not been exceeded except perhaps by Bruce Brown's Endless Summer movie. that one was about surfing. You will enjoy that two
B00026WU64|5.0|This is by far my favorite Bob Dylan CD (with The Times They Are A-Changin' a close second). As you can probably tell, I am more into the folky Bob Dylan, where his poetic imagery shines throughout with a perfect mix of acoustic guitar and harmonica adding to his sound. Don't get me wrong, I like electric Dylan, just not as much. When you look at the song titles from this album, you realize how many truly great songs he put out on this record. My favorites are \\"Blowing In The Wind\\" (maybe one of my favorite songs of all time!), \\"Girl Of The North Country\\" (amazing!), \\"Masters of War,\\" \\"Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" (influenced by a poem), \\"Don't Think Twice It's Alright\\" (beautiful picking!), and the laugh-out-loud funny \\"I Shall Be Free.\\" As a 24 year old, I am WAY too young to fully appreciate Dylan when he came out (as I wasn't born), but hearing it now, he is still relevant. He sings with such honesty that you can feel what he is singing, even though what he was singing/protesting about was decades ago. This is a great Dylan album to start with if you do not have any of his albums and you don't want to get a greatest hits record. This is pure folk at its best and not many albums can match it.
B000B9VDMO|4.0|The SACD sounds great, a nice surround disc.<br /><br />Be more aware than I was:  The DVD is PAL and is no-pal to the USA standard; it will not play.  The SACD is worth the money and use the DVD as a Frisbee or send it to your mother in Europe.
B000F8O2PG|5.0|The first five seasons of STARGATE SG-1 were notable for their remarkable consistency not only in quality but in style and substance.  There was, in fact, little actual variation.  But Season Six brought some major changes.  First, Michael Shanks took a year off from the show to pursue his own projects, though he did reappear in a few episodes either as Daniel Jackson or as the voice of Thor.  Second, Daniel Jackson's place was taken by Corin Nemec as Jonas Quinn, who had appeared in a Season Five episode as a denizen of another planet.  Third, for much of the season the show abandoned episodes that involved them exploring new planets.  They didn't completely skip visiting other worlds, but they did far less than in previous seasons.<br /><br />Despite these changes, though certainly not because of them, the show remained steady and solid throughout the season.  There were a number of truly superb individual episodes and the show generally maintained the quality that had distinguished it for several seasons.  Corin Nemec did the best he could to fill the gap left by the departure of Daniel Jackson.  To compensate for his lack of education compared to Daniel, the writers gave him an unusual ability to absorb new knowledge.  There were also hints that his physiology was unique in some way that felt as if it would have played a major role in future seasons.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, I suppose), the return of Daniel Jackson to the show precluded the need for Jonas, and he was with only a tiny bit of ceremony shipped back to his home planet very early in Season Seven.  I personally had mixed feelings about Jonas's presence and departure.  He never really meshed with the other characters and never seemed to be a part of the team the way that Daniel had, but on the other hand the way he was so obviously just jettisoned the second he was no longer needed was rather bothersome.  As it was, any attentive fan could sense the abandonment of future plot lines.<br /><br />The absence of Daniel Jackson in Season Six was definitely felt.  Daniel functioned as the conscience of SG-1, the unapologetic idealist.  He adhered unrelentingly to classic liberal ideals of fairness and justice and was unsparing in his efforts in support of those ideals.  Without him, the team sometimes seemed to be without the focus they had had earlier.  Not that the show ever flagged in quality or interest.  It just felt like a different show.  In many ways, the show felt his absence more than it would feel the absence of other characters who left in Seasons 8 and 9.  There were many good things in Season Six, but Daniel Jackson's absence defined it as much as the more specific things that happened.  The season also increased the number of references to the Ancients, which would lead to major things in subsequent seasons.<br /><br />No fan of SG-1 would want to miss this season, but it was the harbinger of things to come.  Namely, each season from here on out would bring major changes in the show, with at least one major character disappearing in each of the next three seasons.  The uniformity of Seasons One through Five would give way to an evolving cast of characters.  In a way, one could divide the series into Seasons One-Five and then Six onwards.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just very different./>The absence of Daniel Jackson in Season Six was definitely felt.  Daniel functioned as the conscience of SG-1, the unapologetic idealist.

B0009MAP9A|5.0|Like \\"The Free-Wheelin' Bob Dylan,\\" this is a great folk album.  However, this album is a bit darker, but just as good (almost, at least).  This is a must have for anybody that likes Dylan or folk.  And check out the price.  Go get this album, close your eyes, and be blown away!<br /><br />1. The Times They Are A-Changin': This title track is an amazing anthem that gets stuck in your head.  After listening to this song, you know you are in for something special.<br /><br />2. Ballad Of Hollis Brown: Sad and effective.  This song has sparse instrumentation but haunting lyrics that stick with you after the final note.<br /><br />3. With God On Our Side: This song makes you think whether in our past as a country we have always done things for the correct reasons or just think that we did.  Very catchy songs that keeps you listening.<br /><br />4. One Too Many Mornings: A slow song with beautiful, poetic lyrics.  Not the best song on here but you won't want to skip to the next song.<br /><br />5. North Country Blues: Not a big fan of this song but it does have good lyrics.  I'd rather hear \\"Girl From The North Country.\\"<br /><br />6. Only A Pawn In Their Game: Amazing song!  Great lyrics and super catchy!  You'll be singing along \\"You're only a pawn-awn-awn in their game!\\"  This is one of the many intelligent Bob Dylan songs about social injustice and racism that does not come across as gimmicky.<br /><br />7. Boots Of Spanish Leather: This is probably one of Dylan's best love songs.  It has beautiful imagery and you can feel his pain in each line he sings.<br /><br />8. When The Ship Comes In: A very upbeat Dylan song with (surprise, surprise!) great lyrics.  I loved the ending lines:<br /><br />And like Pharaoh's tribe,<br /><br />They'll be drownded in the tide,<br /><br />And like Goliath, they'll be conquered.<br /><br />9. The Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll: Like songs 2 & 6, this is one of those sadder, darker songs that works really well.  It's ripped from the headlines and has excellent lyrics.  He repeats at the end of each verse:<br /><br />\\"Take the rag away from your face.<br /><br />Now ain't the time for your tears.\\"<br /><br />And then once the unfair verdict comes in, he changes the words to:<br /><br />Bury the rag deep in your face<br /><br />For now's the time for your tears.<br /><br />Perfect!<br /><br />10.

B00006JDU9|1.0|I first saw this movie while it was in theaters in 1999 when I was only 12 years old.  I had yet to gain respect for the original three for their superb acting, cast, story, atmosphere and special effects and while watching this film through my adolescent mind, I thought it was an excellent action movie.  The reason I perceived it to be good is because that is the age level that Lucas was aiming for.  It is obvious that Lucas was going to make a fortune off the next three prequels and it appears that he decided to screw the fans of star wars and cash in on a mediocre piece of garbage.  Now that I am somewhat older, there is no hiding just how utterly awful this and the next two films are. <br /> <br />The acting in this movie can be compared to the power rangers who have ODed on Ritalin.  No life, no enthusiasm, no sense of the actors really even tiring to put any effort onto the screen.  They just seem to be going through the motions all in a monotone voice, and those are the non-CGI characters (the jokes sucked to say the least).  Also, with the introduction of Jar Jar, Lucas apparently wanted to make episode 1 as big of a disappointment as possible; how could someone in their right mind insert such mindless character?  The only comic relief that Jar Jar will bring is to those under 10 years of age - a real slap in the face to Star Wars fans.  On another note, the droids in this movie didn't have any kind of evil, dangerous feel to them like the storm troopers had. <br /> <br />The plot... humm.  Lucas has gone with the flow of most action films lately, in that there is practically no plot.  Since this is the first star wars film in the series, there should have taken it easy for us to introduce all the characters and let us learn more about their personalities.  Everything is rushed; we get no breaks at all in this movie, just constant action.  The Pod race scene wasn't even necessary; it provided nothing for the story and was only inserted for filler, 20 minutesof filler. <br /> <br />The only this that was remotely positive about this film were the special effects which were still somewhat of a let down, not in it's authenticity of realism, but everything looked super high tech and clean.  Lucas should have tried to keep the 1970 grungy technology feel to everything like the original star wars, which would have helped in really feel like a prequel <br /> <br />I am harsh on this movie because of just how well made the original three Star Wars turned out and the high standards they accomplished.  Although a somewhat entertaining popcorn flick, I can not enjoy it because of the injustice it does to the original three.  It doesn't deserve to belong to the Star Wars legacy.
B000002ARV|4.0|I HAVE LOVED JOHNNY WINTER FOR AS LONG AS HE'S BEEN AROUND. HIS EARLIER STUFF IS MORE ROCK AND ROLL, AS COMPARED WITH HIS LATER WORKS.  THIS IS A GREAT CD, ROCK ME BABY, LUCILLE, ALL TORE DOWN, ARE ALL GREAT SONGS.  ONE CONCERT I REMEMBER IS JOHNNY WINTER OPENING UP FOR STEVIE RAY VAUGHN (THE DOCTOR PEPPER MUSIC FESTIVAL ON THE PIER BY 42ND ST. IN NYC BACK IN THE 80'S).  DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE STEVIE , BUT LISTANING TO JOHNNY TEAR THE HOUSE DOWN JUST SHOWS HOW MUCH MORE HE HAD TO GIVE.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is a \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" film, and you never know if it has more 'love it' or 'hate it' viewers. Personally, I love it -from the first sight, from the last sight, from the eternal sight. It is my favorite film of the 90s, one of my personal twenty favorites ever. I think that American Beauty is an instant classic, and it will stay that way as long as people watch movies.<br /><br />The film is deep, dark, and tragic. The title is American Beauty but it is more like Universal Sadness. It is not about superheroes - it is about very flawed, tired, and shallow people - but just as the tag line says - one must look closer.<br /><br />I live in a town like the one in American Beauty too - nice houses, brick, vinyl, neatly cut grass and flowers. \\"The air is fresh and sweet like a child's kiss\\". I jog in the mornings or in the evenings and people often sit on their porches or water their lawns or jog just as I do. We always smile at each other and say \\"Hi, how are you?\\" I always think to myself - what goes on beyond the closed doors of these people that I see? They could be happy with their families and with their jobs. They do look happy. Or, they may be tired and disappointed with their lives, trying to do something to change it - or just letting the days pass by.<br /><br />Leo Tolstoy opened his novel Anna Karenina with the words, \\"All happy families are happy in the same way; each unhappy family is unique in its unhappiness\\". That's why it is much more interesting for me to try and understand each unhappy family - why did it happen? The family in American Beauty used to be happy - there is even proof - the photograph with three of them, happy, laughing. Where did it go? When? Why? When was the moment in time when two loving people became strangers and prisoners in their own nice house with the beautiful roses outside? These are the questions I kept thinking about when I saw AB for the first time, and I still can not find the answers. Can something be changed? How? What do you do to wake up from the lethargic dream that your life has become? How do you reach the people who are the closest to you? What the hell do you need a $3000 couch for if you can not make love to your wife on it? What is the purpose of material possessions if they become more important than the smile of your daughter? When did you start to think that giving your children the best toys possible would substitute for a talk, for a sincere and honest interest as to what they really worry about? I did not find American Beauty patronizing and simplistic - it asks difficult questions but does not provide you with any easy answers. I still look for those answers. I don't blame the movie for imperfection of its characters - I know they do exist. We don't like them - but can one be mad when looking in the mirror? I want to add a couple of words about Spacey's character, Lester Burnham (BTW, Spacey may stop acting right now, and he probably should after all the flops he has produced since AB, but he will always be remembered for Lester). Lester could say about himself what another flawed but unforgettable character did 25 years before him: \\"Well, I tried, didn't I? Goddamnit, at least I did that.\\" Lester Burnham died a happy man; the last words he heard in his life were that his daughter was in love - it meant for him that she could feel, that she was alive because love changes us and makes us better. His last sight was that of a picture where happiness and joy were captured forever. In death, he had at last captured that for which he had longed for the most in life - happiness.<br /><br />He died a happy man - not many do.ing be changed? How?

B00007LTIG|4.0|what I like about this album is that it is straght ahead, blues-oriented music.  The songs are just a few minutes (particularly side one), without a lot of that eleven minute long \\"noodling\\" by The Dead that I find both annoying and extemely BORING. Here it's just blues music with a San Fransisco sound, and they do it well.  I only wish the Dead would have stuck more closely to this formula throughout their career. Even if you're not crazy about the Grateful Dead you will like this CD.
0780020693|4.0|Federico Fellini's \\"Amardord\\" is a series of sketches about his youth in a seaside town Rimini in the 1930s. In this regard it reminds another favorite film of mine, \\"Fellini's Roma\\". After repeat viewing, I can understand why many viewers may not like Fellini, especially his so called \\"later films\\" -\\"Amarcord\\" may seem too crowded, too loud, too vulgar, too bawdy, and too self-indulgent. It is all true, it is. But so is life - loud but tender, vulgar but touching, self-indulgent but full of humor, love and compassion to the film's eccentric characters. It's been said a lot about memorable scenes and images in \\"Amarcord\\": yes, the famous peacock that spreads its plumage on the snow, a magnificent ocean liner that is been greeted by the townspeople, a local tobacconist - a woman of such size and proportions that it could be simply dangerous for the teenage boys to try and make their dreams about her come true. I love \\"Amarcord\\" - always have - perhaps, Fellini played all the right notes for me or more likely, Nino Rota wrote his best musical score for the film which could be the best score ever. My favorite image in the film - Gradisca's (local beautician) walk accompanied by Rota's music. What is it in the way Italian women walk, the way their hips sway? Monica Belucci in \\"Malena\\", Sofia Lauren in \\"Marriage Italian Style\\"? And Magali Noël as object of every man's in Rimini desire - Gradisca (\\"Help Yourself\\").<br /><br />Wonderful film - by the power of his magic, by the light of his memory, the great master saved the town where he was young and happy. We can visit it as often as we'd like and it won't go away and disappear - Fellini's Rimini is captured forever.<br /><br />9.5/10 (4.5/5)
B000BTC5LW|3.0|I bought PULSE today, and so far, so good.  Sounds pretty great so far, and looks alright.  It's too bad it couldn't have been in widescreen, but fullscreen will have to do.  One thing I HAVE to comment on, however, are the factual errors with the tour map and itinerary.  If you are going to include a list of the tour dates, as well as a map of tour cities, then take the time to get it right.  The map shows like two Canadian dates--there were many more than that.  Also, the DVD provides a listing of what is supposed to be a comprehensive list of all cities on the tour.  I went to see them on June 28, 1994, in Edmonton, AB, Canada, but according to the DVD tour listing, I guess they weren't even in Edmonton at all!  They just skipped right over that date.  Doesn't make much sense to me--it's not like they RUSHED this product out.  They took months and months to release this thing.  A little quality control should have been in order.  So, I have to give them a bit of a beating over that, even though it is a miniscule point.  It is a [lack of] quality issue, nevertheless...    (by the way: some reviewers are complaining that in this new edit, you cannot see the pigs flying out of their towers.  I could have been blind, but in Edmonton 1994, they DID NOT LEAP OUT OF THE TOWERS AT ALL.  They merely bounced up and down. I have a feeling that you guys were seeing things!)
B000022TSH|5.0|i saw chinatown when a friend of mine loaned it to me saying i might like it. at first, the film was getting boring but then when faye dunaway came onto screen the movie just then catapulted into another ball field and i was hooked. nicholson and dunaway bring vivid performences but i felt dunaway was the real star. her character, evelyn mulray, brings true life into the picture and without her i may have turned off the movie. the film tells of jake gitties who is employed by a woman named evelyn mulray to spy on her cheating husband and in the process gets in way over his head as he discovers a huge plot when mr. mulray suddenly turns up dead. with this fist cracking screenplay, excellent music score, and eye schorching cinamatography, chinatown is flat out a great film. a must for you dvd fanatics.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Ryan Adams is one of the best singer-songwriters of all time. This cd should be praised for songs like \\"Sylvia Plath\\", \\"Answering Bell\\", and \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\" that don't come around that often with other styles of music. (By the way, I am COMPLETELY AGAINST Tim McGraw covering When the Stars Go Blue. In my oppinion he completely butchered it. The first time I heard it I almost broke down and cried. If you haven't heard it, trust me it's that bad!) This album is worth its weight in GOLD. Being a woman, many songs on this cd make me think of what I want in a man. All men should take a hint from Ryan Adams and buy this cd. It is one of his best cds, and I don't think there are many others that can be compared to it.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|One of the Best 5 TV Shows in History.  (probably number 1 or 2)CW shortsighted decision to cancel this show, will cost it in the ratings in the fall....hope CW tanks.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|This album is so great. I think Ryan Adams knows what works for him, and he sticks to it. In my oppinion, he never disappoints. I can see why this is titled Cold Roses. That has got to be the best song of both discs. Some other favorites of mine are \\"Sweet Illusions\\", \\"Beautiful Sorta\\", \\"Dance All Night\\", and \\"Let it Ride\\". I don't know what it is about Ryan Adams that makes his music so infectious. He is a wonderful artist, and I couldn't possibly love this album more.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I'm sure that people will appreciate this CD more, in years-to-come.  The production itself sounds pretty original and could very well be the sound of electronica music in the future (guitars and beats work nice here). <br /> <br />No one was likely expecting Madonna to release something so \\"experimental\\".  Mirwais Ahmadzai is a great producer and I think one of the finest that Madonna has collaborated with.  I like the title track (detractors should get over their problem with her rapping), \\"Hollywood\\", \\"Love Profusion\\", \\"Intervention\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\". <br /> <br />For Madonna fans who thought this wasn't one of her finest achievements, it's worth going back to go for another listen or two.   <br /> <br />Madonna's always seemed to be labelled as a \\"pop star\\" and not an artist.  I think \\"American Life\\" defies that thinking as it comes across to me as one of her strongest. <br /> <br />Love it!
0316921173|5.0|A book about the obsessions of addiction that is addicting to read.  This book is a monster.  It will devour you.  There are so many facets to this book that I won't even try to delve into the plot with you.  This book took over my life for a month and then left me shaking and sweaty when I got to the last page.  This book alone makes David Foster Wallace the greatest  author alive today.  I don't give out 5 stars like they were candy.  This book deserves more stars than there are in the sky
1400049628|5.0|800 cans of green beans will cost x amount of dollars and feed y people for z days, if rationed out correctly.  And, no, that is not in the book. <br /> <br />I'm not really a zombie person myself, but I love a good laugh, and this book did have moments that made me giggle out loud. <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite books, because when I first read it, about halfway through I found myself searching the front and back covers for some sign from the author that it was indeed all a big joke...  There was none.  It's great when a book can bring laughs and a little bit of genuine paranoia on the side.  Cheers.
B00005JOQS|4.0|Last summer director Christopher Nolan boldly (and wisely) chose to revamp the Batman saga with the box office smash, \\"Batman Begins.\\" The producers of television's \\"Smallville\\" took \\"creative license\\" with the Superman legend, producing a show faithful to the mythology yet unique in its own right.<br /><br />Now comes, \\"Superman Returns,\\" which pays homage to the previous film and television adaptations, while maintaining the \\"comic book daring-do\\" and peril. Director Bryan Singer has a genuine respect for the character and does little to alter the viewer's preconceived notions of \\"The Man of Steel.\\"<br /><br />And that's the film's biggest weakness: there's very little that is fresh and exciting about this interpretation of the myth.<br /><br />Of course, the special effects are state-of-the-art and one can see the producers' investments were well spent. However, the story itself is rather basic: Superman returns from a self-imposed exile, Lois has gone on with her life and had a child, Lex Luthor is still up to no good, and Superman eventually saves the world.<br /><br />But, even in the scene where an incapacitated Superman is roughed up by Luthor and his lackeys, one never feels that the \\"man in blue\\" is ever in any danger.<br /><br />And the fact the Lois Lane survives not one but two life-ENDING situations stretch the imagination even for a science fiction/fantasy film of this type.<br /><br />As far as the performances go, Brandon Routh does a reasonably good job as Kal-el/Clark Kent/Superman, even though he had some huge shoes to fill, following Christopher Reeve who put his signature on the role. The producers of \\"Smallville,\\" as well as Tom Welling, were wise enough to not have the Clark Kent character interpreted as did Reeve.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth makes a worthy \\"Lois Lane\\" and James Marsden is very good as Lane's suitor who must come to grips that his main competition is a guy \\"faster than a speeding bullet.\\" Frank Langella does an adequate \\"Perry White,\\" while Sam Huntingdon does a good job of \\"channeling\\" Marc McClure from the first two Reeve's films.<br /><br />Oscar-winner Eva Marie Saint is appropriately sincere as \\"Martha Kent\\"; however, \\"Smallville's\\" Annette O'Toole is a more dynamic interpretation and more of a contemporary version of Superman's \\"mom.\\"<br /><br />Parker Posey's \\"Kitty Kowalski\\" is a bit too dense and doesn't compare to Valerie Perrine's \\"Miss Teschmacher\\" from the 70's films.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Kevin Spacey, though probably due to the script, makes \\"Lex Luthor\\" nothing more than a \\"thug with money.\\" In both the earlier films, and both the animated and live action versions, Lex Luthor is calculating, ruthless, but possessing of an air of class about him. Michael Rosenbaum, Gene Hackman, and Clancy Brown have assayed the role, respectively, and have emboldened the character with traits the Spacey's version lacked.<br /><br />On another front, composer John Ottman borrowed familiar themes by John Williams for the original films. However, Ottman's \\"original\\" music sounds so similar to Williams's arrangements that the producers might as well have paid Williams' asking price.<br /><br />It is hoped that the next go-around will be a \\"return\\" that's a tad \\"fresher.\\"<br /><br />3.5 stars, rounded off to 4ing\\" Marc McClure from the first two Reeve's films.

0385336691|4.0|As usual, Lee Child's Jack Reacher hits the pages with grace under fire! Reacher is one of the few mystery characters that becomes more complex and three-dimensional with each book in the series. Although he exhibits the same characteristics as the first novel in the series, you learn little things about him in each book that help make him real.<br /><br />My only disappointment with this book is that I figured out the mystery/plot line almost from the beginning and could almost predict how things were going to go! There was a clue (which I won't reveal here) when Reacher first looked around Edward Lane's residence, that for some reason clicked in my brain and had me saying \\"I know what is going to happen and why...\\"  And although part of me was a bit disappointed that I knew the outcome, the twists to get there were fulfilling.<br /><br />Like I said in my title: I love Jack Reacher!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears is a pop phenomenom.  Regardless of the media form she's presented in, she is no doubt one of the biggest superstars in entertainment history.  Her last studio release to date, In the Zone, is an eclectic mixture of Hip Hop-infused pop.  The standout here is, of course, the Grammy-winning \\"Toxic,\\" a track that is perfect, but other songs like \\"Showdown\\" and even the two ballads (the most popular being \\"Everytime,\\" another radio smash) show that Spears, a product of media frenzy, has the potential to bring a lot to the table if she's given the right material.  Sugary sweet bubblegum classics like \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" may have been where this babe began her music career, but it's songs like \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Everytime\\" that show where she has the possibility to go far with in the future.
B000FPAFVE|5.0|I read this book before I ventured out into the real world, and I read it again many years after I had returned from that world. After I read it, I wanted to kick myself for not learning more from it the first time.... But then, that is also covered in this story, Siddhartha's father could not protect him from the world, nor could Siddhartha protect his own son when the time came. You've got to go forth and learn these lessons yourself. It is the same archetypical patterns, with variations, over and over.<br /><br />I remember that when I first read this story it confused me that the Buddha and Siddhartha were two separate persons. Then I came to realise the truth of archetypes, and immortal paterns that resonate in many different bodies at the same time- all seemingly separate, but all really sharing the same great life. All ultimately flowing together to form the great river of life.
0440237688|2.0|I had to read this book for 9th grade APP english. I found that in the begining i was excited to read it after hearing all the reviews and praise for it. Half-way through the book, I knew that i didn't like it, and I wouldn't be persuded into liking it. This book had alot of potential, but it failed to measure up. It didn't get exciting until the end, and the ending was not satisfying. I understand the ending was supposed to be happy, but it just left the story feeling incomplete.. <br /> <br />
B00005221M|5.0|This movie is awesome!  I'm using it to teach Captivity Narratives in my High School English class.  Although it is rated R, the rating is due to language and not sexually explicit material.  Some of the scenes are pretty gruesome, but the storyline is excellent and provides a view of the Indian nation that is not often portrayed in literature and history books.
B00005JOX6|3.0|I was entertained by this movie, though I wouldn't call it \\"great.\\" I was actually suprised that it was as good as it was, because I really didn't want to see it. There was a few parts that were unnecessary and that seemed pointless to me, such as the duck scenes that kept reoccuring. Overall, I would say that it was a pretty good movie. It made me think about my life in a way(but not like it changed my feelings toward life or anything). I would reccomend watching the movie, but I would not reccomend buying it or going to see it in theaters; maybe rent it when it comes out on DVD.
B000244EMO|4.0|I loved it when I first saw it and I love it now. Purchased the Collector's Edition, very nice extras - some a little corny to watch but still very good if your into this movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers work good together as actors, and face it theres Jesse Ventura! Good action and special effects are done tastefully. Not your typical action flick, deffinately a must see!
B000FVQYYK|4.0|First off, Muse is beautiful. Black holes won't be going anywhere except into the laser light of my stereo for a long time. I first heard Knights of Cydonia on the radio (which is bad, I know), but usually my brain shuts down as I am flipping through the channels. Knights of Cydonia caught my attention as soon as I heard the first note. I knew it was Muse, I knew it rocked. I wasn't aware that they were coming out with a new album...needless to say I was having a happy seizure in the car. I was instantly attached to their new album, and soon figured out MOST of the new songs were beautiful too.  <br /> <br />   Take a Bow - I bet it took about a minute to write this one, but it sounds just like Muse. Good intro of course. 4/5 <br /> <br />   Starlight - I don't really like the way they're going with this song, it's too MTV...2/5 (for filler song effort) <br /> <br />   Supermassive Black Hole - A lot less poppy, (as I heave a sigh of relief). Still...a little high strung. 3/5  <br /> <br />   Map of Problematique - As soon as it started I fell into a VERY deep trance and didn't come out until the next song. IN LOVE with this song. Sure it sounds a little...a lot like U2, but they're on the same island chain of the world so whatever. 5/5  <br /> <br />   Soldier's Poem - You know I don't care if Muse wants to write a slow acoustic song. It doesn't mean I have to like it. 2/5 (for me) 3/5 (for people who like slow acoustic muse songs) <br />    <br />   Invicible - A little too Hawaiian/that Glory movie-esque. I didn't really like it. In fact it sucks...until the bass (kind of)breaks in. Then it is listenable. 3/5 and still maybe too high <br /> <br />   Assassin - Comes in with an annoying riff, but completely makes up for it when he starts singing. Some ominous background vocals as well. Rest of the song rocks. 4/5 just because of the intro. <br />   <br />   Exo-Politics - Classic \\"find a riff and build a song around it\\". Solo is terrible, but you can't get them all right. Still quite listenable and almost addicting. 4/5 <br /> <br />   City of Delusion - Now this song is genius. Everytime this comes on, I'm in Saudi shooting at religious zealots. Love the song to death. Beautiful, Beautiful 5/5  <br /> <br />   Hoodoo - Slow, slow, slow, a perfect cover of every Radiohead song, save the piano. 4/5 Because I like Radiohead, and I love piano. <br />  <br />   Knights of Cydonia - I listened to this song over and over and over and over and over. I still can't get enough of it. This song has easily rocketed itself to my top 20 or 10 or maybe even 5 song of all time. You know that Muse wanted to make this song like a half an hour long. They could have gone everywhere with this one. Score for Muse. I love them for making this song. <br />5/5 For Absolute Perfection. <br /> <br />Just go buy the album, it has enough good songs to make anyone happy.  <br /> <br />
B00005B9UZ|3.0|U-571 is a good action movie. The characters are developed correctly in the beginning and the whole idea of stealing the Enigma which posed such a threat to the American Navy was a great story. However, the historical accuracy's end here. The resupply submarine which was sent by the US was a great idea for a movie, but when the US crew storms the wounded enemy U-boat, there would've been no chance of boarding him. The dive time for a type VIIC was approximately 25 seconds. The attack scene lasted several minutes. Point made. Other parts of the movie weren't detailed correctly either, when the enemys torpedo's \\"brushed\\" by Matthew McConaughey's captured U-571, they would've been dead in real life (German torpedo's used a magnetic trigger which went off when close to metal). The list goes on as you watch the movie. At the end you realize that U-571 didn't have help from anyone who knew anything about WWII sub tactics and that its simply a byproduct of a Hollywood idea gone wrong. Not to say that U-571 was a horrible movie, on the contrary its fun to watch, but for the naval critics and true war fans out there don't expect much. <br /> <br />On a historical note: the real U-571 was sunk in 1944 off the coast of Ireland by depth charges from an Australian Sunderland. Figure that one out, Hollywood.
B0002KQNL8|3.0|The first installment Return of the Living Dead, sure it was campy, and in some parts funny, but it was also gruesome as well with enough chills for true horror fans.....Return of the Living Dead part II?  Not so much. <br />So This film picks up sort of after the first film where the army is picking up and transporting any of the cannisters(that contain Zombies) to...where ever.  The transport truck hits a bump and dumps one of them.  It falls and lands in a drainage tunnel.  The drainage tunnel runs along the property of a Cemetary. How does this zombie get out? A couple of kids let him out, and contaminate themselves too. And when they let him out the gas permeates the grounds of the Cemetary and then it starts raining. Poof! Zombie uprising! <br /> Sure it sounds all good, but then there is the Cheese factor! Fist theres zombies the start arobicizing in someones living room after an excerise tape gets turned on by accident.  Or the Zombies that drive down the street in a jeep looking like a group of wino's out for a good time.  Or the zombies raiding the pet store.  Those are just some of the antics the zombies portray. <br />Next is the corny dialogue(some of it is sorta funny, but corny). Great example James Karen and Tom Mathews, show up in this film only this time as Grave robbers (remember return of the living dead they played Frank and Freddy the Medical supply ware house employees).  After they get contaminated and start to turn Joey(mathews) says, 'I feel like we've been here before, you, me.....them' How cheesy!  Also when Joey turns into a zombie he corners his girl Brenda(Suzanne Snyder) in a chapel and tells her that her brain smells so 'Rich and Spicy'. <br />And for all of you technical people there are some continuity and plot problems that occur, if you pay attention you can see them. <br />Horror movie Fans may recognize some familiar face in this movie to other 80's/horror films.  Suzanne snyder also seen in 'Killer Klowns from outerspace, Night of the Creeps, and Weird Science.  Dana Ashbrook- Waxwork, attack of the killer tomatos.  Thom Mathews-Friday the 13th Part VI Jason Lives and the Vampire Hunters Club(2001) <br />Aside from bad dialogue, and silly zombie antics, this movie did have some cool special effects, and that kid that played Billy(Thor Van Lingen) was really creepy.  Bottom Line.....o.k. sequel if you can get over the silliness of it all.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Understood that many of the soldiers in WWII (or any battle for that matter) experienced alot of loss on the home front with women but this movie is a painful love story for the first 90 minutes. If you don't mind watching Ben Affleck cry then you'll love it. The battle scenes in Europe are highly dramatized (although the actual Pearl Harbor attack was quite detailed IMHO). Plenty of DVD extra's if thats your thing, but as far as a good war movie goes, Pearl falls very short.  <br /> <br />Three stars because I like the effort and the effects are stunning, but if you want an accurate recreation of Dec. 7, 1941 buy Tora Tora Tora.

B0002W18MU|5.0|It seems each person has there own personal story in how this album has affected them. I too have gotten all the American Recordings albums and Unearthed - it was actually Johnny singing on a U2 album that stirred my interest in him again. <br /> <br />Each of the American Recording albums has affected me profoundly, whether it was \\"Bury Me Not\\" on I, \\"One\\" on III, \\"Hurt\\" on IV, \\"He Stopped Loving Her Today\\" on Unearthed and the countless other emotional high and low points. His version of \\"Memories are Made of This\\" on II was our 1st dance at my wedding reception. <br /> <br />So as the other reviewers have mentioned, this is a testament to what Johnny was going through in the final months of his life, how music was keeping him alive to the end and you can feel it in each and every song.  <br /> <br />To me, none affected me more than \\"Four String Winds\\". For understanding that this is a plea to join his wife soon is heartbreaking. He changed the line \\"If our good times are gone/Then I guess I'll be moving on\\" to \\"Well our good times are long gone/ So I'm bound for moving on\\" and is just rips your heart out.  <br /> <br />I had no idea about that subtle change until I watched Neil Young's \\"Heart of Gold\\" and was surprised that it was on the playlist. Do yourself a favor and listen to Johnny's version, watch the Neil Young DVD version and then listen to Johnny's version again. I hope it gives you a much more profound emotional experience as it did me (though the song already moved me to tears the first time I heard it anyway!) <br /> <br />Like others I have been playing this album frequently since I got it. Rick did a great job in finding the perfect accompanient to Johnny's voice. In the end, the voice is all you hear.
B00005JOX6|2.0|I've certainly seen better Adam Sandler movies. I just mainly found it unbelievable (even before the whole magical remote part). His movie wife is far too good looking for him for one thing (I guess when you live in hollywood you forget what real women look like). Plus the women in his office were Barbie doll perfect as well. His boss, played by David Hassellhoff is intentionally over-the-top cheesy. And the attempts at humor were just either puerile or gross. Especially irksome was repeatedly watching his dog humping a large stuffed duck toy. This was a big turn-on for Sander's character and his wife also. Distateful can be funny when done right, but this movie just didn't work for me. I don't think this movie was either funny or effectively dramatic. It did get better towards the very end, but since I found Adam Sandler's character to be repugnant, I didn't really care if he got a second chance to fix his mistakes. Based on other people's reviews I suppose this movie would appeal to you if you like gross-out movies and aren't bothered by unrealistic characters and storylines.
0553573403|5.0|I can honestly say that I'm not much of a reader.  Actually I'm a fairly poor reader.  At the age of 19 I had only read one \\"real\\" book in my life... and it took me six months to finish it.  My husband some how convinced me and got me interested enough that I ended up picking up the book.  And lets just say I didn't put it down till I was done.  Granted ok had to sleep in there a little, but really it was quite similiar to not sleeping cause I just wanted to see what happened in the next chapter.  This book and series is amazing beyond anything you can imagine.  I have a hard time putting into words what this book and series is... it is quite simiply a must read.  The other guy who wrote the reasons to read and reasons not to read I think hit it right on the nail.  Although I beg to differ with his opinion on the endings.  Mainly because I think the endings of his books make you feel like you've eaten a great meal.  Meaning you've had the taste and are satisfied with the ending, but are still hungry for more.  If only there were more genious's like George R.R. Martin out there.  Truly is breathtaking....
B000002U82|5.0|This is the best from one of the best- Pink Floyd.  It looks like everyone has said just about all you can say about this one.   <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin can be credited for having the best collection of 70s studio works, but this album tops everything from that decade.  It's in the short list of 'best of the decade'.  It's up there with the 60s' Sgt. Peppers album by The Beatles.
B00012BSHG|4.0|I bought this pool for my 2 1/2 yr. old. She loves it. But the sides are pretty high so it is difficult for her to get in and out. And because it is a star shape-- it really is smaller than if it were a circle. But it seems to do it's job for a toddler pool.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I just realised I haven't reviewed the BIG 3.  My big 3 anyway. <br />I love to hear arguments about each decades' biggest recording.  As far as the '80s go, I don't believe anyone put out a better record than this one. <br /> <br />1960's (I was born in '69, but I know what the greatest record of that decade is) - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band / The Beatles. <br /> <br />1970s - (I didn't purchase this one until the early '80s) Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd <br /> <br />1980s - (You can argue with me on this one... but I'll win) Brothers in Arms - Dire Straits <br /> <br />Mark and Dire Straits always had great albums, but this is the best and tell me who put a more solid record out in that decade---
0307276902|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book even with all of the bad publicity. All I have to say is - Who the heck cares if some of it is fudged a bit?? What memoir isn't??? If they weren't they would all bore us to tears!! Good job James Frey on the story-telling of your journey, just be more up front on your credentials next time.
0553277472|5.0|This book is appreciated by almost everyone with a desire to think and learn about the world they live in, but it's also misunderstood as to its content... <br /> <br />Phaedrus had issues with the Greek philosophers not because they combined the nature of \\"truth\\" and the nature of \\"good\\". They did no such thing. He had an issue with them because in their desire to order the world and create a method of looking at the world which could be understood and taught readily, they decided to set priorities: They decided that facts and truth in the scientific sense of the world was of the highest importance. The \\"good\\" that had been spoken of by the Sophists and others prior to the debates with Socrates was then called \\"virtue\\" and hacked up using the analytical knife of classic thought, with lots of definitions and research expended to figure out what made it tick. The result of this is our Aristotlean world, in which people have created and organized themslves brilliantly, yet don't seem to understand much about themselves and each other.  <br /> <br />In some ways, Greek philosophers created the mode of thought for our current sociological thinkers. This mode of thought seems to say understanding the world is more important than creating a better world.  <br /> <br />Phaedrus understood that Quality isn't something that can be defined in the sense Aristotle wanted to define everything. The only way to SEE Quality is to see its effect on those who witness it. It is undefinable, because it is always different. Quality is simply what works \\"better\\" or \\"best\\". People need to understand (even now, today!) that Quality can't be defined like an object can. It's a condition that describes life, art, ideas, actions, creations of any kind, and describing it isn't nearly as important as TRYING for it. <br /> <br />I can only imagine what happened in Phaedrus' mind when simple politics prevented him from sharing his viewpoint academically, but I've read ZAMM and it got me thinking about what people are GOING for in life. Why does it seem like everyone wants something and nobody knows why they want it? normal people don't like to ask these questions anyway, but even our best and brightest dodge the question in all but the most analytical of ways.  <br /> <br />In the end, Quality is individual, and Pirsig says that his greatest faith for the future is in quality individuals making quality decisions. I like that.  <br /> <br />If this isn't yuor kind of thing, I can sympathize: Sometimes it's very demanding to \\"think out\\" all of this books concepts, but it's a BOOK, and that's what it's best for. You can read it over and over, piece by piece until you know exactly what is being talked about. That this book is engaging and well written, creating intelligent, human and interesting characters and situations makes all this possible. Subjects this smart deserve writing this good!
0375758992|5.0|From a socio-economic vantage point, a comparison to Isak Dinesen's Out of Africa applies in that Karen Blickson's husband, the Baron, is the archetypical remnant of decaying European aristocracy; name and title, but without means.  One reads the Fuller account of life in colonial Africa as a 20th century continuation of the same mind-set which caused genocide in the Americas in the 16th through 19th centuries: a Neolithic hunter-gatherer society suddenly confronted by, and welcoming of, a military-industrial-religious juggernaut, claiming everything in it's path as the divine right of acquisition.<br /><br />The Fuller Family, avatars of the crumbled empire were out of time and out of place.  No place but England could have produced their embodiment of resilience, arrogance and atavism. Theirs was an earlier England, a world that no longer existed.  But the tropism of Africa, the lure of its sheer fecundity overcame heat, hell and hallucination.  Alexandra Fuller (Bobo) writes, \\"The Valley represented the insanity of the tropics so precarious for the fragile European psyche.  The Valley could send you into a spiral of madness overnight if you were white and high strung.  And we were.\\"  What Dinesen wrote of Berkeley Cole and Denys Finch-Hutton applies to the Fullers:  \\"In the present epoch they had no home, but had got to wander here and there...  Of this they were not themselves aware.  They had, on the contrary, a feeling of guilt towards their existence in England which they had left, as if, just because they were bored with it, they had been running away from a duty with which their friends had put up.\\" Bobo writes, \\"My soul has no home.  I am neither African nor English, nor am I of the sea.\\"<br /><br />Better than the boredom of England were the smells of Africa.  \\"Mum caught the spicy, woody scent of Africa on the changing wind.  She smelled the people:  raw onions and salt, the smell of people who are not afraid to eat meat, and who smoke fish over open fires on the beach and who pound maize into meal and who work out-of-doors.  She held me up to face the earthy air so that the fingers of warmth pushed back my black curls of hair, and her pale green eyes went clear-glassy.  `Smell that,' she whispered. `That's home.'\\" And at Bobo's whites-only school, \\" the playground smelled like sweat on metal from the chipped-paint swings and slides.\\"  Their home in the Burma Valley of Zimbabwe was humid, and thick with jungle and creepers, \\"and it was fertile-foul smelling (as if on the verge of rotting) and held a green leafy lie of prosperity in its jeweled fist.\\"<br /><br />All of which partially explains why the comfort of England held no candle to the extreme discomforture in interrelationships of black and white Africans.  Blacks referred to the conflict between them as Chimuranga.  Whites didn't call it that.  They called it The Troubles, This Bloody Nonsense, and sometimes The War.  A war instigated by \\"uppity blacks,\\" \\"cheeky kaffirs\\" \\"bobby muntus\\" \\"restless natives,\\" and \\"the houts.\\"  For the black Africans' part, \\"When they saw the Europeans were the kind of guests who slept with your wife, enslaved your children, and stole your cattle, they saw that they needed sharp spears and young men who knew how to use them.\\"  The land over which they fought, however, had no interest in who named it. \\"You can call it what you like, fight all the wars you want in its name....  The land is still unblinking under the African sky.  It will absorb white man's blood and the blood of African men, it will absorb blood from slaughtered cattle and the blood from a woman's birthing with equal thirst.  It doesn't care.\\"<br /><br />The Land was equally becalmed when the Fullers lost children.  \\"Adrian dies before he is old enough to talk.\\" Mum said, \\"The nurse at the hospital in Salisbury told us we could either go and get something to eat or watch our baby die.\\"  They eat, and when they return Adrian, who was very sick with meningitis an hour earlier, is now dead.  The Family Story changes contingent upon what Mum's drinking.  The worst in when she drinks everything she can find in the house.  But another child is born, a beautiful little girl, Olivia.  She grows to be a toddler when one day \\"it is almost lunch before anyone notices Olivia is missing.  She is floating face down in the pond.  The ducks are used to her body by now, paddling and waddling around it, throwing back their heads and drinking the water that is full of her last breaths.\\"<br /><br />And Africa?  Africa serenely, violently breathes assaults on the senses; smells \\"like black tea, cut tobacco, fresh fire, old sweat, young grass,\\" and sounds:  \\"At dawn there is an explosion of birds, a fierce fight for territory, for females, for food.\\"  A change in the tone, an increase in the intensity of the birds' activity, break into one's everyday world, and you know that there is a snake nearby.  Then there is the sound of heat; \\" the grasshoppers and crickets sing and whine.  Drying grass crackles.  Dogs pant.  There is the sound of breath and breathing, of an entire world collapsed under the apathy of the tropics.\\"tis an hour earlier, is now dead.

B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Let me start by saying System of A Down has been my favorite band since their national inception.  I think their self-titled album was amazing and yet was outdone by the brilliant Toxicity.  As the release of the double discs approached I became frantic.  The first songs released from Mezmerize showed a ton of promise but after listening to the album I found myself bored and disapointed.  The album just wasn't what I thought it would be.  It lacked many of the great elements that made the band so innovative.  I think the perfect score would've been a 2.5 .  All in all the album just lacks what makes system great. <br /> <br />On a seperate note.  I recently purchased Sikth's Death of A Dead Day which was an Amazon recommendation because I am a SOAD fan. All SOAD fans should run out and get this album.  It's like System on speed and LSD.
B0000047CX|5.0|After more than 40 years, the gentle Bossa Nova rhythms of Getz/Gilberto remain fresh and relevant. <br />Each time I listen to this album, it's like a mini-trip back to the beaches of Rio. <br />Outstanding musical performances by all concerned and, of course, excellent song writing by the inimitable Mr. Jobim. <br />The digital sound is excellent and there is an excellent liner notes booklet. <br />
B00068NVI4|4.0|I just finished watching Song for Tsongas for the second time, and to make a long story short: If you are even remotely a Yes fan, this DVD is a MUST have.  <br /> <br />Having been a fan since 1973 and the Yessongs tour, I've seen pretty much everything they've had to offer. This DVD gives every generation of fans something from every iteration of Yes. Sure, there are a few that I'd like to see lost and replaced with some of MY favorites, but I told began to look at it for what it was: a celebration of music by maybe the best prog band in history. <br />There are some INCREDIBLE gems, including a kick-but rendition of South Side of the Sky. But maybe the most awe-inspiring piece was Ritual from TTO. Perfectly played, it also featured Chris Squire's bass  and Alan White's drums in what reminded me of some of the 70's concerts... POWER. Call me crazy, but TTO was ahead of it's time, and one day it will be seen as a masterpiece. <br />There wasn't much to criticize here... maybe some mixing problems... but that's it. I think the camera work caught what needed to be seen very well. <br />So while you're here on Amazon, scroll up and order this baby... you will NOT be sorry.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Great melding of two tremendous talents. A combination of country, pop, and jazz influences yielding an extremely listenable disc. Their voices are a bit too similar at times; not necessarily a bad thing but overall the contrast I would have liked wasn't there. A few tracks stand out above the others, but I'll leave you to decide which do that for you. Very few performers get a 5 from me, so a 4 is still a high recommendation.
B000687M48|1.0|Think this band sucks, they suck even more live, bad misicanship, lame songs and horrible vocals.
0689835604|5.0|My 16 month old daughter is not overly excited by most books and loses intrest quickly, but she loves this book and can play with it for an hour. She loves to bring it to us to read with her, and she loves lifting the flaps and she giggles at her accomlishment of showing us where \\"baby's belly button/eyes/hands etc\\" are.  <br />I would recommend this book because its great for interaction between your child and you, the illistrations are colorful and cute, and it helps toddlers learn different body parts.

1932100385|5.0|THE CURRENT CONFUSION ABOUT FOOD AND HEALTH STOPS RIGHT HERE! <br /> <br />Throw all your diet and most cook books away (and eventually most of your perscribed and OTC medication) after reading CHINA STUDY and following its sage diet based upon countless scientific research reports (including the 20yr China Study).  <br /> <br />The bottom line message is as startling as it is simple. You will undoubtedly wonder then just why this life-saving/health-promoting scientific data not been plastered all over the media and releases from our national cancer, heart, diabetes, and other agencies.  Why indeed, it cost us many millions of dollars to fund that research. <br /> <br />GREAT QUESTION! Part IV of the book answers that question like a modern day rendition of \\"The Spy Who Came Our of the Cold\\"!! \\"The lines between medical, pharmaceutical and the food industry have disappeared...\\" says Author T. Colin Campbell, the acknowledged \\"Einstien of Nutrition\\". The Author contends that their understanding of the GOLDEN RULE is, \\"HE WHO HAS THE GOLD MAKES THE RULES\\". The combined annual revenue intake of the food and drug industry is over a TRILLION DOLLARS/Yr. <br />Every industry trys to protect and to foster its bottom line and these guys have a BIG bottom line!  <br /> <br />Hence the Author points out that there is scant chance of any scientific report(s) reaching the American public before the spin doctors do a job on it or try to shoot it down, such as his contention that ALL dairy products do promote most of our chronic diseases and that, \\"It's time that we do away with our sacred cows!\\" Remember...this guy grew-up on his dad's dairyfarm, rising at 04:30AM to milk cows and polishing off several large glasses of whold milk each day...AND in his eary years he thought that all Vegeterians were NUTS (so did I, and now I are one!). <br /> <br />...BUT THE BIG BOMBSHELL of the book is that ALL animal protein is BAD FOOD and ALL plant protien (the unrefined kind) is GOOD FOOD...so good that it can evan reverse many of our greatest life-taking chronic diseases, like heart (No.1 Killer) and some cancers (No.2 Killer).  For decades now we have all been taught the mantra that, \\"Meat is Protien and Protien is Meat\\", that the most wholesome meals contain top quality meat products. China Study shows you that that is COMPLETELY WRONG.   <br /> <br />Likewise we have all been taught in school that MILK is absolutely essential for strong bones and teeth. China Study also shows that this is contrary to scientific studies (...like, we're the top hip fractured nation in the world while being one of the very top consumers of milk and dairy products. Hip fracture is considered a solid indicator of a nation's bone health.). <br /> <br />T. Colin Campbell's wife pushed and pressured him into doing this incredible book undertaking because after retiring from 37 years of lab research of diet and cancer and over 20 years as head of the record breaking China Study of Diet, Disease and Environment. She said to Colin, \\"We owe it to the children of this country.\\". I could not agree more. Were they left to continue to hear the serien song of the food/drug/medical industry that the current animal-protien-rich diet is \\"JUST FINE\\" and to consume this Western Diet of Affluence, eventually our healthcare system will become a terminal case, itself, and the children must look to a bleak future of countless years of infirmary, pain, horendous medical expenses and even death.   <br /> <br />I have sent copies of CHINA STUDY to all my children and grandchildren and about sixteen more copies to valued friends and their families. <br /> <br />Finally, consider the truth in the old addage, \\"A word to the wise is sufficient.\\" I consider that word \\"CHINA STUDY\\". <br />
B00005JP4U|5.0|In addition to an excellent overview presentation of the realities of global warming, this documentary offers a disarmingly human look at Al Gore - a view that should have been seen six years ago. <br /> <br />The graphics and reasoning of his presentations are first rate. The reliance on a broad range of converging scientific studies is impressive. And contrary to early reviews of this movie in other venues, the scenes of Gore trapsing through airports, undergoing security scans, working nights in his hotel rooms, and following up on peripheral critiques of global warming helped bring home the perserverance and dedication of this man. <br /> <br />A quick scan of negative reviews of this movie suggests strongly that the authors must have been in the lavatory when the segments they criticized were on screen. See this movie! It's well organized, thoughtfully presented, and thorough.
B000A0GP0Y|3.0|For fans of the original you'll definately be let down.  The main reason being that instead of doing like Oceans 11 did and take a good older movie and then write a different movie where only the prime concept is the same.  This longest yard took the original script and made just enough changes to make it a bit more updated. <br /> <br />There's already a lot of good descriptions about what was wrong with this movie (And Sandlier was definately the wrong pick for the \\"Wrecking Crew\\"  He just couldn't sell it) so I'll keep mine brief.  I guess the most striking aspect was that the movie tried to follow the original when it should have gone it's own way, but went it's own way in some areas where it should have followed the origina.....In particular the game itself.  In the original they had a prison football stadium and patrons came to the prison to watch....In this one they had some of the biggest nastiest killers in the place just hop a bus and go play at a high school field that they strung a little razor wire around for security.  Oh and a number of cops brought in for extra protection........Can you imagine any warden getting the go ahead for the thousands of dollars it would cost to put on such a game....Even if ESPN paid some of it? It was all too rediculus to even be probable. <br /> <br />If you never saw the original, then you'll probably find this an alright movie.....But then you really should make a point to view the original so you can see how it was done right the first time...
B000FFJ85I|4.0|I came across december underground somewhat by accident while doing research on the ancient symbol of Three Hares (a version of which is featured as the cd's cover art).  I bought it on a whim and was not disappointed. I love the fact that AFI has successfully combined several unlikely-together genres of music -- rock, punk, death metal, synth-pop.  Musically it is a very catchy album that inspires me to jump around, dance, and scream along with Davey Havok's powerful vocals.  His voice is truly amazing, ranging from these rageful screams, to something beautiful and painfully sweet and melodic. HOWEVER, my one caveat is the horrific (in my opinion) songwriting.  I prefer  lyrics to clearly tell a story from beginning to end, using a wide range of poetic vocabulary. The songwriting here seems to be mostly minimal lyrics with disjointed and repetitive themes featuring a smattering of Goth buzzwords such as \\"kill\\" \\"murder\\" \\"blood\\" \\"kiss\\" and \\"suicide\\" randomly thrown together and seemingly designed simply to draw in an audience of angst-ridden teens. While I can appreciate these themes, I feel that bands such as My Life With the Thrill Kill Cult, Rob Zombie, and 80's titans like New Order and Depeche Mode have attacked such themes in a much more creative manner.  But as I said, I still am not sorry about the purchase because the music itself speaks to me and it's very catchy.  If AFI is ever able to integrate the sophistated level of their music and vocals with that of the song lyrics, they will be able to break out of their underground bracket. But for the poor songwriting, I truly believe AFI would now be as successful if not more so than current fan favorite, the punk-rock-pop band Green Day.
0553801503|4.0|The song of ice and fire series has thus far been amazing....I say thus far. I have this fear welling up inside me that R.R. Martin is becoming Robert Jordan! The series suddenly looks as if it will have no end! Even more disheartning is the fact that I am begining to get lost in the sea of minor characters. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this book, but R.R. Martin is starting to display some qualities that will make me less and less excited for his next book...
1593974744|5.0|What an amazing story!  I have read a lot of science fiction in my life, and this story is truly unique.  So many people can relate with Ender.  His story is sad, triumphant, thought-provoking, so many things.  A MUST READ for science fiction fans.  It made my hour-long commute fly by!
B000E1155E|4.0|WPSIATWIN is an awesome debut from a great band straight out of the U.K.   <br />1. The View From The Afternoon: 5/5-Fantastic intro with a great chorus. <br />2. I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor: 5/5-The most popular single off the CD, and it's a great, catchy song. <br />3. Fake Tales Of San Francisco: 3/5-This is a song that a lot of people seem to love, except me.  I thought it was alright, not anything really memorable though.     <br />4. Dancing Shoes: 4/5-A boring intro, but besides that a pretty good song.    <br />5. You Probably Couldn't See The Lights But You Were Looking Straight At Me: 5/5-long title, short song.  It's short, sweet, fast paced, and to the point, I love it. <br />6. Still Take You Home: 4/5-Pretty good song, again, not that memorable though.     <br />7. Riot Van: 4/5-It starts off slow and boring, but the lyrics tell a story and you get sucked right in to it, which is great.    <br />8. Red Light Indicates The Doors Are Secure: 5/5-Probably one of the most underrated songs on the album.  Lots of people don't seem to include it in the great songs, but I think this ones fantastic, and some great guitar playing here too.    <br />9. Mardy Bum: 5/5-Ahh yes, this is the one song that everyone should love, even if you don't like the Arctic Monkeys.  Great, upbeat, catchy tempo to somewhat darker lyrics.     <br />10. Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong But...: 2/5-Probably my least favorite song on the cd.  It's too long, not that catchy, boring chorus, and pretty much always a skip for me.  I like the title though...   <br />11. When The Sun Goes Down: 5/5-Another one of the best songs on the cd about a guy who picks up a prostitute.  It starts out slow and builds up quite fast.  Great song.   <br />12. From The Ritz To The Rubble: 4/5-Great song to get you pumped for a sport or anything like that.  The song isnt the most memorable, but it's still a decent song. <br />13. A Certain Romance: 5/5-This tracks one minute intro shows the bandsmusical ability without any lyrics.  When the singing kicks in it's just as great.  This one is one of the better songs on the cd. <br />
B00000DCHD|5.0|Billy Joel is a gifted composer and musician. \\"52nd Street\\" shows Joel at the peak of the mountain in both ways. Even when I have the 4-CDs BJ boxed compilation, it lacks for \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\", \\"Honesty\\" and \\"Until The Night\\". If you don't have it, get this album ASAP, you'll never regret about it!
B00004U2EZ|5.0|This music is simply breathtaking. Just especially beautiful.  I have both this version, the two-CD complete version, and the English.  The two-CD set (I think 52 tracks) is the best.  This is second best.  The music in this abridged CD is not presented in chronological order, however, and sometimes, due to this and the missing tracks, there is something lacking. However, it's just gorgeous music.<br /><br />The acoustics are amazing.  I'm not sure if this is really noticeable unless you hear it immediately before or after the English version.  The cast is absolutely amazing.  There is so much emotion in their voices.<br /><br />I'm surprised there is so little about Richard Cocciante, the composer.  This music is some of the best I've heard. I would have thought there was an abundance of music written by Richard Cocciante that I haven't heard. From what I can find out online, there isn't.  This is just a masterpiece.<br /><br />There are many reviewers who mention the translation issue.  If you think of this as a popular musical, I can see that the translation may be an issue. However, think of it as an opera-- which it also is (not in the classical sense).  We don't concern ourselves with the translation of La Traviata, La Boheme.  Same with this. . . just enjoy the music.<br /><br />If you can possibly find the 2 CD complete set (sometimes available for download elsewhere, find it before purchasing this.  But, if you can't find it, get this.  Also, as a side note. . . the DVD has the entire libretto included and offers English subtitles.
B000000WA4|5.0|This cd is awsome and radical, it really shows the diversity of the Smashing Pumpkins. It is truly a classic cd, just like Pixies's Doolittle and and Husker Du's Zen Arcade. It has alot of emotion and every song is pretty strong, some songs are a little weaker than others but not really any filler to me. It's the Smashing Pumpkins that we knew from Siamese Dream and it's something completely different.
0307276902|1.0|When I first heard about this book 2 years ago, I immediately put it on my wish list.  I purposely avoided reading the details of the controversy surrounding it until I had the opportunity to read it first.  Just this week, I finally checked it out of the library.   <br /> <br />The book itself is intriguing, if exasperating.  The repetition, oddly random capitalization, thinly veiled references, and \\"prose\\" made me shake my head and often skim over entire paragraphs, but for some reason, I still couldn't put the book down.  It reads like a black comedy, and is therefore arresting. <br />Immediately after finishing, I went back to the Smoking Gun articles and excerpts from Oprah's show.  No matter how interesting, any one half educated will find the book a little fantastical.  I was SHOCKED to find out HOW MUCH is fabricated.  It was more than just a little elaboration; it made we wonder just how much of his story is actually true.   <br /> <br />Orginally, I thought: \\"who cares?\\" Whether labeled a memoir or fiction, the \\"truth\\" of the message is enlightening.  Now, the more and more I think about it, the more angry I feel.  Having read \\"The Corner,\\" a really harrowing and tragic HONEST account of addiction, and experiencing a brother who is now coping with Alcoholism, I wonder whether it's a message or sheer truth itself that is more important.   <br /> <br />I would have more respect for this work it had simply been labeled \\"fiction\\" and had Frey not lied about it for 2 years.  Frey consistently admonishes AA and the twelve steps in his \\"novel\\", claiming that he will simply make a decision not to rely on substances.  What kind of horrific message would that send to someone trying to cope with an addiction?  Frey consistently relies on machoism, melodrama, and pointless descriptions of his own vomit, \\"pain\\", and psychosis.  What kind of coward exploits this type of physical and emotional trauma in order to sell books? Especially if he had gone through it himself?It makes me wonder what his problems REALLY were.   <br /> <br />Furthermore, what draws the reader into his story is his apparent vulnerability, and the colorful characters he allows to help him heal.  I wonder now if any of them are even real!  Wow.  Frey certainly has a talent for fiction.
B00005JO1R|4.0|Walk the Line sheds light on the life of the well-known singer Johnny Cash.   <br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.   <br />The only major setback is in relation to Ginnifer Goodwin who is not that great as Vivian Cash.  <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!  <br />In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!  <br />
0618477942|5.0|As a gay man, I was amazed at how much I identified with this book because it deals with the larger question of gender identity, not just sexual orientation, ie how are we imprisoned by expections of others regarding what behavior is gender appropriate.  And that is just one of the many levels this books works on.  LOVED IT!  It is annoyingly honest, Bechdel expresses her antipathy towards the SISSYNESS of her dad, ironically enough.  A rich, moving experience.  I want MORE!

B000BTC5LW|3.0|First let me start off by saying I love Pink Floyd and ever since my DSoT concert I've wanted to share the experience with freinds and family....I've put in my VHS version of DSoT in my old dusty VCR to my 55\\" HDTV to show off how amazing a show they put on to everone who'll watch and was soooooo damn excited to have a DVD version of Floyd in concert to really show off the sound and video..............wellllllllll I have to say I'm more than a little dissapointed in this DVD. Now don't get me wrong, it is the best DVD of Pink Floyd available at this time but wow I really had expected much better quality. The sound is first rate with a few exceptions but the video is just bland at best, it really fails to show off the incredible light show. The lights wash out the screen so much I spent alot of the show explaining to my girlfreind what was actully happening but just couldn't see....yes as the previous reveiw mentions was shot in a 4:3 ratio on video which sucks for a couple of reasons. One is that any of us with widescreen TV's will have a stretched wide picture if we want to fill the screen and because it was shot on video instead of film the picture detail is poor. Even Old old movies shot on film which by the way is almost always widescreen looks so much better than any video recorded event. Now I'm picky admitedly about quality video and audio it really matters to me so most people who arn't so particular about that sort of thing will be just fine with it but for those like me who expect more especially from Floyd will probably be disapointed as well. I guess I'll just have to hold my breath for another 10 years for a Blu Ray version of a Delicate Sound of Thunder..wishful thinking.
B00005JNRY|1.0|Is it the lack of education?  Is it the drugs of today?  Or is it that this newer generation is so into computer generated effects that real talent doesn't matter anymore?  I took my nephew to see this film and i couldn't wait for it to be over.  What happened to the sharpness of the older cartoon features.  As old as \\"Snow White\\" is, that had better quality than any feature cartoon made in the past decade.  I think because of the lack of american education the kids today will accept anything that is put in front of them.  I'm so glad i'm not a kid anymore.  Total waste of time, don't bother to see this film, or rent it, or buy it.
B000E8NRR6|3.0|Donald Fagen took a small break from Steely Dan and came out with his first solo album in over ten years, Morph the Cat. While I don't think the album is a classic, there are still some pretty good songs to be found on here.<br /><br />Before I go any further, let me first point out that this album could be taken as a storybook, as each song follows a different concept. Because of this, I suggest that you actually buy the CD instead of downloading the songs because the lyrics are included in the liner notes (as well as the meaning behind each song), and without them it may be hard to understand what Donald is talking about. Still, I couldn't quite get into \\"The Great Pagoda of Funn\\" or the title track either, for that matter.<br /><br />Speaking of the title track, another problem there is that during the chorus (if that song can be said to HAVE a chorus) it's hard to understand what Donald and the background singers are saying. Oh, well; there are still great songs like \\"What I Do\\", \\"Security Joan\\" and \\"Mary Shut the Garden Door\\". But another thing that gets me about this album is that it's 52 minutes long yet there are only nine songs. This is because several of the songs are way too long due to three to four minutes of extra music after the actual songs are done. The music doesn't sound bad, but as I said in my Stevie Wonder review, that feels better at a live performance. But Morph the Cat is still a critter worth adding to your Donald Fagen/Steely Dan family.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000F3TBIO|2.0|It's not that bad.  However it didn't live up to the long wait and hype. Compared to the wait & guest artists; it's a dud. It's not very FNM-ish to me.  Yes, I too love him and am a huge fan of all his stuff and seen him live many times but there's better stuff he's done lately.  I've listened to it many times by now.  \\"Tomahawk\\" and \\"Director's Cut\\" blow this, \\"most accessible cd\\", out of the water.  General P. & Susp. Animation are better also.  Bungle & FNM are light years ahead.  My friend who loves him also, listened to it and didn't even bother buying it! I usually like just about every song on his cd's but there's tracks on here that I would just fast forward by if they were on a Bungle or FNM cd.  Well, actually I am skipping them now.  There are a couple tracks on here that are fantastic but it's only like 2.  I agree with the reviewer who called it a bunch of B-tracks.  I doubt I'll even listen to this cd much.  Sad cause I want to love all his stuff.  It just stinks for me because I had high hopes for this and it doesn't even come close to some of his better work lately. Sidenote: It does come in one of the coolest cd cases I have in my collection- Kudos to Ipecac for using cool cases.  Hopefully, the future Tomahawk/Fantomas cd will right this wrong.

B00011RPB0|5.0|It's sometimes interesting to go back to a film, that was on it's initial release...hyped with praise (and criticism) for an independent  film, that truly brought director Sofia Coppola, to the attention of the rest of the world.  For all the awards and nominations that the film received....it's probably interesting to point out that, there was a large percentage of money-paying cinema (and DVD) viewers, for whom the film completely missed the mark.  So in retrospect....having seen the film several times, since it was originally released in Cinemas back in 2003.  But I've gone back very recently to watch the film...and see if it still stands up, several years later.    Most will be familiar with the story of fading movie star \\"Bob Harris\\" (Bill Murray), whose lured to Japan against his better judgement, by a very lucrative promotion for a Japanese Whiskey.  With a marriage that is merely `going through the motions', and his character going through something of a small mid-life Crisis...What initially seems as a temporary escape from the question marks regarding his life, for him...morph into a lonely figure trapped in the hotel, of a foreign country....unable to fall asleep at night.    The other Character is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a woman who having recently finished a Yale Graduation, and still finding her feet within a 2 years marriage to her Photographer husband.  Decides...after having nothing else to do, fly to Japan, with her husband....who is commissioned to be the photographer for a Japanese rock band.  Charlotte having being left to her own devices, due to her husband's daytime photography commitments....grows gradually more bored and distracted, by generally being relegated to spending the majority of her time in the hotel, and she also has yet been unable to sleep in the evenings.    What happens of the course of the 94mins, is nothing more that two people...who wouldn't have meet under normal circumstances, find a uneven common ground, and embark on a gradual appreciation and developing friendship, through the loneliness of their environment.  For Charlotte.....Bob represents a complicated, yet intriguing character, from which she admires and then gradually begins to not only identify, but affectionately warm to.  And for Bob....Charlotte reminds him of his the earlier years in his marriage before the complications of a lack of communication and Children entered into the equation.  In short, simpler happier times.    One of the main criticisms, that friends who haven't liked the film have citied, is the lack of anything truly substantial happening throughout the film.  But arguably that is ultimately the point.  It's a absorbing look at how two initially disparate characters, connect not only verbally, but emotionally as well, first through the loneliness of their environment, and then striking up an unlikely friendship and strong affection for each other.  It's  a perfectly stylised illustration how sometimes meeting certain people at the right place and right time, can and does, have to power to completely change or alter the individuals perceptions.  And although the relationship between the two characters remains platonic, there remains a strong unspoken sexual undercurrent in their friendship, that ultimately, neither one is prepared to compromise their existing relationships over.    One of the most impressive things about this film, is the cinematography...of Japan, and how for a such a wildly populated and bustling city is portray...and yet, without someone with you, that know's the city well, it can be a slightly overwhelming and blindingly isolated place.  The bright neon lights of Japan, represent one aspect of the city (a rapidly developing city)....yet, when Charlotte ventures out of the central town, and to the peaceful shrines, the other side of Japans beauty and heritage shows a different side (it's heritage & tradition).  And in this aspect it's one of the triumphs of Sofia's direction...indicating that being in another country can truly be a lonely affair, and that some people look for anything (or someone) to identify with, or make some form of connection with.   And not only that, but it's the very slight, almost incidental things that linger in the memory....like the way that curious glances are exchanged between the characters without any explanation, or how the camera will inexplicably have a shot of something completely obscure (like Bob's Slippers, or the shot of a building).  Or how certain things or never fully explained (like why Bob's marriage is breaking down / How Charlotte ended up with a husband, at a relatively young age / Or what Charlotte intends to do with herself), or even the little things that the audience is never allowed to hear or be privy to (When Bob Whispers something into Charlottes ear, just before they part for the final time.....which is not audible to the audience).    A lot of the humour is focused around the differences in the language barrier, and the lead characters bewilderment of being in an alien environment, and their adjustment to it.  And it's the way that Sophia skilfully brings all this incidental elements, into a hugely satisfying whole, to makes this film as her finest work to date.  How such uneventful subject matter on paper,  is generally made for riveting viewing, it's also one of those films that rewards multiple viewings....sure the storyline wont become clearer, as it's a very straightforward plot.  But the rapport between the two lead characters, feels more noticeably poignant and developed, and how intriguing their paths intersect, and touches upon how their failings in their own relationships, brings the two of them closer to each other.    For what is consider one of the finest indie films, over the last few years, this film has certainly had its detractors....and without undoing all the work, gone into giving this film, as glowing review, it has to be said that those looking for some trulysubstantial, or a significant development, will struggle to find anything here for them to latch onto.  And if slow-paced movies tend to irate...then you'll find nothing here, that is even worth the price of Renting the DVD.  It's a film that's a little too slow and considered to truly break the mainstream audience, sure it's had various (deserved) accolades humped upon it, but if you ask Joe Public...that actually went to the cinema to watch it, you'll definitely find a handful of people, that just didn't get on with the film.  But for those that regularly cast a keen eye over independent films, or indeed or just looking for something a little different from the norm, then I would argue that this is a film of tremendous resonance, and a truly remarkable film in it's own right, and one that needs to, at the very least be seen by those that have become a little jaded by American cinema over the last few years.   I strongly urge you to see this film...it may not change your perspective on the decline of outstanding films being released over the years, but in the world of independent cinema and distinguished films, it might be considered a small gem...but a gem nonetheless!!!    Extremely recommended....

B00005JOX6|3.0|Spoilers <br /> <br />Storyline (3 Stars) <br /> <br />Doesn't this seem familar to anyone else?  I've seen/read a lot of things generally pertaining to this very type of incident.  But, still, I think it was well executed by the director and actors to make this better than what I've seen pertaining to this sort of phenomenon. <br /> <br />Acting (4 Stars) <br /> <br />I love Kate Beckinsale, and I think Adam Sandler's roles as moderately serious, moderately silly are working much better than his full-on seriousness.  I loved him when he was goofy, in roles like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore.  But, I can't deny that he did some pretty excellent acting, especially at the end, of this movie. <br /> <br />Overall (3 Stars) - The Spoiler at the End <br /> <br />I liked this movie.  I'd recommend you go see it.  But don't expect Spanglish Adam or Billy Adam.  Because you won't get that.  I, personally, think you will enjoy the mixture of the two as they are mostly harmonious in this film.  But, I am just glad it didn't end the way I thought it would.  Go see this film!  It's really not all taht funny, it's just a generally good plot.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|...This album is amazing. From the intro Prelude 12/21 to the final song Endlessly She Said i enjoyed this album. Being a man who comes from a heavy background of hip hop and reggae, i made the switch in my choice of music just over a year ago. This album is amazing, interesting with the use of synths. This is the first AFI album ive ever heard, and i fell in love with it. Davey Havok kind of scares me though (not his lyrics, but the way he looks lol), but its all good. <br /> <br />stand-out tracks are: <br />--Miss Murder <br />--Summer Shudder <br />--Love Like Winter <br />--Affliction <br />--Kiss And Control <br />--Endlessly She Said
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I agree that this show was the best Sci-Fi on television since the Original Star Trek and probably even better. Watching the \\"extras\\" on the last disc reveals even more. Just imagine how good this would be without the constant tweaking demanded by the network pinheads at Fox! Joss Whedon tells about the changes the network was always pushing for with the show and despite his efforts to appease them, they cancel it anyway. How come all the good shows die young? About a decade ago, about the only show I would watch on TV was the wonderfully entertaining Brisco County, Jr. (also quickly cancelled by Fox). Like Firefly, it had stand alone episodes, but a steadily advancing plot with reoccurring characters, and was marvelous. So much of television, even with 500 channels, is assembly-line [...] So, what would you call 500 network executives at the bottom of the ocean? A good start.
0224076051|5.0|\\"Not Even Wrong\\" is a critique of String Theory, written for the non-specialist. Its criticism of String Theory is very effective, even devastating. But the book is much more than that. Woit presents the development of modern fundamental physics, in terms that a  non-physicist can understand (there is not one equation in the book). <br />Of course, as Woit explains, a real understanding of physics can only be attained by those who understand the mathematics in which it is expressed. But Woit does the best job I have ever seen of conveying as much of an understanding as is possible without math. <br />As a former research physicist, I would question some of Woit's assertions about the path which development took. For example, it was clear even before the discovery of the charm quark that a quark model required at least 6 quarks. But this is a very minor quibble. Overall, Woit's presentation is masterly.

B00005JOQS|5.0|\\"Superman Returns\\" is a film shaded with strong spiritual symbolism and meaning; it is also an action film crafted with real love and care. I found the balance among the emotional story of Superman and Lois, compelling action sequences, the villains' nefarious activities, and the demonstrations of Superman's deep sense of mission and caring for humanity to be very deeply satisfying. Even though the newly-returned Superman/Clark Kent is a man of few words, I find his presence onscreen very convincing, and many of the performances in this film are as much about subtle facial expressions and body language as they are about delivering dialogue. Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey portray the most comic-bookish characters in the film, and are great fun to watch.  <br /> <br />It is clear from the wide spectrum of opinions offered here that this film is not for everyone, because people's expectations vary so widely. I can only speak for myself--I loved it. <br />
B000002LUB|5.0|Count me as another listener who realized Dio did another album with Black Sabbath in 1992....and gave it a spin.

As good or better than Mob Rules and Heaven and Hell, seriously.
B0002DB52M|3.0|I'm uncertain what to make of 'Dogville'. It is a movie that seems to consider secondary the accepted devices of conventional filmmaking - such as a varying pace, acceptable length, or even a fully realised set - in favour of inviting the audience solely to accept its ideas and characters. It dispenses entirely with the accepted visual and aural elements of cinema - after all, there is no background music and everything occurs in a single black space, using sparse props and only chalk outlines for buildings. This means that 'enjoying' the movie conventionally is a difficult if not impossible experience because we must endure these directorial choices and focus instead upon what the narrative suggests. In short, if you're unwilling to invest some thought into 'Dogville' then there's little reason to watch it, because this movie rests completely upon its performances and assumptions of human nature. <br /> <br />However, it's interesting to note how quickly we can become accustomed to the terms the movie sets out for us. In spite of the invariably slow pace that the movie insists upon to draw out its narrative, what initially might have seemed jarring in the absence of background music and the use of a single set is quickly accepted and, by the end of the movie, these conventions are barely missed. This is primarily because of the strength of the performances throughout, and it is the credibility of the moral decay of the town's inhabitants that ensures the audience's interest. However, it is perhaps also unfortunately true that very few of the characters seem to exist for their own sake. With the exceptions of Grace (Kidman) and Tom (Bettany) who seem exceptionally individual, the town's inhabitants - in spite of the details of their lives - succumb to what the director would probably describe as `human nature' in a blandly uniform fashion.  <br /> <br />But this is perhaps inevitable given the nature of community to which they seem bound: in `Dogville' the individual is suffocated, if not in spirit then certainly in physical terms, as Grace eventually discovers. This is reflected in excellent fashion in the nature of the set. As already mentioned, the set takes the form of a single black space in which buildings and even the dog Moses are represented by chalk outlines. This, of course, represents the fact that the town's population ensures that everything is visible - even Grace's eventual rape by Chuck (Skarsgard) occurs but metres away from the scene of children playing, and within days this becomes an accepted normality. It is particularly interesting for me that Vera (Clarkson) accuses Grace of leading her husband astray here, when the transparent nature of the town means that she can only be misleading herself - as is true of the rest of the town in their eventual mistreatment of Grace. <br /> <br />Though what is arguably the most mystifying element of `Dogville' is Grace's own reactions to her mistreatment. Although while it occurs it would seem she is simply accepting the lesser of two evils - to accept the abuse of the population of a small town is a better fate than the death possibly awaiting her with the mobsters she has escaped - the movie's concluding scenes would have us believe that she has throughout the movie gone so far as to forgive the townspeople for their mistreatment of her. This is perhaps an arrogance that renders her ultimately unsympathetic as a character in spite of her torments. She uses her plight as a means to retain the moral high ground throughout, and gladly accepts her father's use of `dogs' as a metaphor to describe the towns population that automatically renders her superior to them in her own eyes.  <br /> <br />And this final superiority reflects the ultimately cynical beliefs of the director. It would not by much of a stretch to argue that the events in the film are portrayed as almost inevitable, and John Hurt's whimsical and occasionally sarcastic narration certainly suggests this - as if, nothing can be done to alter the obvious course that the movie takes. People - even the idealistic and high-minded Tom - are bound to fail. Therefore `Dogville' rests completely upon its assumptions of human nature: its ideas stem from its pessimism, and it does not so much discuss them as simply affirm them in the form of this parable/allegory. Although it successfully makes use of sparse surroundings and minimal props - I would like to see more movies so driven by character interaction - the fact that `Dogsville' never questions its own assumptions means it is unlikely to convert anyone not already taken to its point of view, and simply exists inside the limits of its own foregone conclusions. <br /> <br />Oh, and the blatant anti-Americanism of the final credits is, although a very cheap shot, seemingly unconnected to the movie itself which, although taking place in Depression-era United States, possesses a universal quality thanks to its minimal set and widely recognisable character-types.

B0000256VK|4.0|Moody, refined, and mostly absorbing, Avalon has all the ingredients to make up Roxy's most mature album. The slower, less bombastic nature found throughout this disc will please fans more akin to the mellower, more dramatic work from the past, with less focus on it's decadent, upbeat pleasures. The band is in my opinion most focused when it is at it's least glamourous, and the less edgy but more sophisticated writing takes emphasis off the attitude and places more focus where it always should have been, inside of our heads.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|I've been listening to Muse for years, actually since I got a CD in a KROQ calendar in 1999 that had Muscle Museum on it, and was so blown away that I got Showbiz on an import as soon as I could. The thing that struck me about Muse was how talented they were for such a young age. Origin of Silence was in some ways better than Showbiz, and Absolution in some ways better than Origin. Regardless of the CD, Muse has never stayed stagnant. Their production has gotten larger, more grandiose if you will, but in a good way. I like that I can listen to the sweeping strings of Unintended and then flip over to the pounding guitars of Butterflies & Hurricanes. While I enjoy this CD, it's just not as original as Absolution was. <br /> <br />As I said, every Muse CD has improved, they haven't been comfortable just playing the same songs over and over as some bands do when they strike it big. There are some beautiful songs on this CD, \\"Soldier's Poem\\" is so beautifully simple, yet so powerful. \\"Hoodoo\\" is actually one of my favorite songs, with the meandering piano and pounding guitars. \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" sounds SO MUCH like a Queen song, with the harmonies and vocal layers and the strange instrumentation. The only song I don't like on here is \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\", it is just a horrible horrible song, no personality, no depth, nothing. <br /> <br />This CD is a very good CD despite the problems I have with it. It is immensely entertaining, it will get your feet tapping and your head bobbing, and their lyrics really have grown quite remarkably. I just am a little dissapointed at how similar this sounds to Absolution, but that's a farily minor quibble.

B00024I2Z4|5.0|Hands down my favourite Disney movie. This is the wonderful story of Fa Mulan, based on the ancient Chinese story of the girl who disguised herself as a man to go to war to save her aging, crippled father from having to go as representative of the Fa family. <br /> <br />My favorite part? There was romance without being kissy-goo-goo, \\"Mulan, I love you! I believe in you! You GO girl!\\". <br /> <br />It was realistic. Parts of it were violent...ish. (No violence is really shown DIRECTLY.) I wouldn't show it to REALLY small kids, because the Huns might scare them. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like? Why were the Huns grey? With yellow eyes? They weren't fantasy monsters...they were real people! I don't like the dehumanizing of the villains. <br /> <br />All in all, still and amazing, amazing, wonderful movie. Just don't buy that terribly sequel.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|This is the \\"ultimate\\" collection for the sex and the city fan. <br />I love it.  It comes in a beautiful pink velvet box with a  <br />plastic covering.  It has a few bonus DVDs with 3 alternate endings, trivia etc.  My favorite part about the DVD set is <br />it tells you what designer the girls are wearing and where to purchase.  It also tells you what guest appearances were made <br />throughout the seasons.  If you ever get a chance to visit NYC, I strongly suggest to do the sex and the city bus tour.  You will appreciate your DVD set even more!
B000F1IQNM|4.0|If anyone said they didn't like this movie, I would not argue with them. It depends on the viewer and their mood, how much you're willing to buy into the movie and let it work its charm (or not). For me, it works. It helped my expectations were pretty low, but actually, I liked this movie and I did enjoy it, and my niece and nephew liked it. While I'm not saying they are the barometers of what children will like, I think this is a good movie for kids. It is Mary Poppins-like, but I don't think a movie like this has to be predicated on any kind of originality.  <br /> <br />The movie excels in a lot of areas, but I for one am a fan of fairy tales, magical realism, and stories set back in the past, so that was already a plus for the get-go. \\"Nanny McPhee\\" is about a widower Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) is a mortuary make-up artist who lives in a seemingly endless house with his maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald), the cook, and his seven children, Simon, Tora, Eric, Lily, Sebastian, Christianna, and baby Agatha. The children are pretty rotten without a mother around, and they drive every nanny they have wild and cause the nannies to quit with their belligerent and mischievous antics. At the beginning of the film I must say I doubted I was going to buy any turnaround that made these kids sympathetic. Alas, I was mistaken. Anyway, Mr. Brown has to deal with how to raise his kids without a mother and his domineering late wife's aunt, Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury). Aunt Adelaide is wealthy and supporting the family (that house must cost a fortune to keep up, as well as the raising of 7 kids), but she threatens to cut off the money unless Mr. Brown gets married within a month (because she thinks the children need a mother's discipline).  <br /> <br />Since this is 19th century England, we have a pretty good idea what this will entail - the father gets sent to debtors' prison, the kids will go to austere orphanages or workhouses, etc. So things are looking pretty grim, until,almost by magic, Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) shows up and offers to take the vacated nanny position. And everything changes. <br /> <br />The story is pretty predictable, but if you're watching this for outrageous plot twists, you've picked the wrong DVD. What you will find is a charming fantasy with a great sense of time, place, design, character, humor, and heart. The look of the movie is great, such vibrant and almost otherworldly colors let you know what kind of movie this is. Everything, from the setting of the village and the house, to the clothing, the furniture, is all top notch in my opinion. The story is well-written, the children are sharp and smart, which was nice, considering some stories like these insult kids' intelligent, the dialogue is a proper mix of heartfelt moments and good humor. The casting, I think, is inspired. Colin Firth was born to play roles like these, and he pulls it off very well. Likewise, no one plays the sweet, humbly beautiful lower class young British woman character better than Kelly Macdonald. She rarely disappoints in any of her movies I've seen. Angela Lansbury was wickedly delightful in her role as the evil aunt. Emma Thompson may not have a role with as much outward \\"meat\\" on it, but she fills in the spaces and performs her role well. The children are all very convincing and good in their roles. Even the secondary characters, like the cook and the undertakers do a great job with their parts. All around, fine casting and fine acting. <br /> <br />To conclude, reading these reviews on here should give you a good idea of whether this is your (or the kids') kind of movie or not. I'd recommend giving it a shot, it's a pleasant and enjoyable film.
1401308201|5.0|Its totally worth the price. I enjoyed the pictures of the characters with a little bio about them. I heard something about that there was supposed to be a whole script in it. But I mean they couldn't have done that because then people would try to put on their own show without permission. The pictures are amazing and the whole book layout is nicely done.
B000FVQYZY|5.0|Ok, well, I'm just going to throw this out there, I am a very huge fan of Muse.  I have all their full length albums, and I even had Black Holes & revelations 2 months before it was released.  But that still didn't stop me from purchasing it from the stores, that being said, let me talk about the album. <br /> <br />To me, BH&R is not the best Muse cd, I along with countless number of other Muse fans would say Absolution is their best.  But this cd sounds much different than that of Absolution or any other Muse cd out there.  It starts off with a very politically charged song Take A Bow which gives you a good indication of how this album is going to turn out.  The one thing that is missing, which kinda made me upset was the use of the piano.  It is rarely heard, and when it is, it's over powered by other instruments.  Other than that, this album is amazing and should not be overlooked by anyone, Muse fans or not. <br /> <br />But, that's not all.  If you're one of the smarter fans out there, you probably picked up the special edition version that comes with a DVD of a concert they did in June of 2004.  This is the main reason why to pick up this version.  The concert footage is amazing and runs at about an hour's length.  It is amazing, and having never seen Muse live, this was a must have.  Every song on the DVD was played beautifully, especially New Born, Butterflies & Hurricanes, Apocalypse Please, & Stockholm Syndrome. <br /> <br />If you're looking to buy this cd, do yourself a huge favor and pay the little extra to pick up the limited edition.  It's worth the money.
B0002W18MU|5.0|All the American Recordings get 5 stars in my opinion.  I don't like all of them equally but I respect each note on each and every recording more than I respect the sum total of every note played on every CMA winner since pop went country.  The American Recordings are honest and righteous and proud.  This recording continues the legend.<br /><br />Let the arguments continue concerning how the production was done.  It's secondary to the recording and the recording is very, very good.  JC's voice is weak, he's off key sometimes, he misses a note or three at times.  The other musicians are dubbed in later from separate sessions in which The Man In Black did not participate.  Get over it.  Close your eyes and listen.  The music does not lie.
0385486804|2.0|Strange things drive men to publish books; perhaps the worst among them is the idea that they can further cash in on a well-received piece in a magazine by expanding upon it and releasing it to the general public. This is the flaw of Jon Krakauer's _Into the Wild_ - Krakauer developed a winner in terms of magazine articles, but the story of Christopher McCandless, \\"Alexander Supertramp,\\" does not lend itself well to a full-length paperback. While this is not the fault of Krakauer, who struck gold with the same formula with _Into Thin Air_, it was Krakauer's vanity that led him to pursue this idea.<br /><br />Chock full of side-stories and tangents to fill the pages beyond a telling of Chris McCandless' story, Krakauer delves into the psyches of explorers and lost boys past, including his own stint as a rebellious mountain climber. It is easy to notice that all of these stories share one common thread outside the obvious: they are about the length of decent magazine articles, fluffed up beyond repair through repetition and rephrasing. What Krakauer has done with _Into The Wild_ is compile a series of seemingly independent magazine articles, slice them into pieces, and distribute them throughout the pages of his book.<br /><br />One questions the sympathy Krakauer seems to show for McCandless, an intelligent, wealthy boy from a well-to-do family who decided to drop his life after college for that of the wandering philosopher. As the book progresses, McCandless appears less as the introspective philosopher and more as a young adult with grandiose views of himself and nature to the point of arrogance and condescension. While attempting to espouse the views of Emerson and Thoreau, McCandless comes off as just another wealthy kid on a field trip.<br /><br />McCandless' story makes for a wonderful read. The only problem is that Krakauer already told this story successfully through his magazine article. Unlike _Into Thin Air_, this attempt to expand on a story ultimately flops.ely flops.

B000AOJ9X0|5.0|I have been listening to Buddy Guy for 35 years.  He is the best blues guitar player there is.  The first ten times I listened to this album I didn't get it. Buddy Guy doing \\"Lay Lady Lay\\"?  Now after three months I love this album. <br />Buddy Guy shows here that he is much more than a blues player.  He is a great musician and singer.  There are great blues here, \\"Somebody's Sleeping in My Bed\\", \\"Cheaper to Keep Her\\".  But this is more than a blues album.  The variety is awesome and every cut is primo.  Two old Creedence tunes that rock.  R&B Ballads from Curtis Mayfield, Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes.  The best song on the album is \\"Cut You Loose\\".  The guitar work sounds like some of Hendrix best.  Guy sings with the growl of a mean old man who's been done wrong for the last time.  This one cut is worth the price of the album.  The album is a great music experience.  Thank you Buddy Guy.
B000002UZ1|5.0|If not for \\"The Blue Album\\" I would have probably never became a fan of The Beatles. Back in the day-day they had virtually no influence on me whatsoever. I knew many a song from the old days of Beatle-mania, I wanna hold your hand type of stuff. I wasn't terribly impressed. Than one day I was introduced to SGT. PEPPER and ABBEY ROAD thru a friend, and I realized that there actually was a reason why The Beatles are so legendary. In my book the years 1967-1970 are the better Beatle years. More experimental, less poppish, and more.... waaaaaaaavy maaaaaan. More ROCKIN' to say the least.<br />The red and blue albums are perfect starter packs for The Beatles. Someone managed to pick just the right songs to put on both collections. (RED is for the Beatle-maniacs, and BLUE is for the acid eating Beatle-maniacs) both were mixed just right. Sure you don't get everything, but there is far too much to ask for. You get the full versions of the stuff that you are bound to know, and if not will take to quickly and both sets are quality hits packages.<br />I remember when I was around 14 and decided I was gonna get myself a Beatles record. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted at first.. but one look at the track list on here, and I knew I wanted this one. I chose correctly.  The best Beatles hits pack available.

However, Hussein baited us by deliberately withholding materials and not allowing UN inspectors to do what he promised they would be allowed to do.

B0002ZEUJU|5.0|Heroin, sadomasochism, paranoia, hangovers, seductive ladies and a big banana on the cover. The Velvet Underground was unique in 1967 -- even if it never made big sales -- and remains unique to this day, no matter how many bands are influenced by them. (Not bad for an arty band!)<br /><br />Lou Reed tears through a variety of songs, ranging from gritty hard rock to strange ballads. The most memorable song here is undoubtedly slashing, exotic S/M ode \\"Venus in Furs\\" (\\"Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him/Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart\\"). Elsewhere, he dips into pure rock in the desperate \\"Run, Run, Run,\\" but takes a softer turn with surreal junkie ballads and the eerie, soft \\"Sunday Morning.\\"<br /><br />However, German ex-model Nico -- who departed the band in hazy circumstances after this album -- leads with her seductive monotone. She only had a handful of songs, but they remain some of the best: singsong \\"Femme Fatale,\\" steady and slow \\"All Tomorrow's Parties,\\" and the exquisite ballad \\"I'll Be Your Mirror.\\"<br /><br />The Velvet Underground was probably the first real art band in rock history, formed at a time when megabands like the Rolling Stones were at their peak. But they couldn't have been more different from the heavily-publicized bands -- creepy, dark, and both beautiful and ugly. The Velvet Underground was the reverse of mainstream.<br /><br />The music isn't complex, but it is strangely compelling -- the wiggling guitar at the beginning of \\"Black Angel's Death Song,\\" or the tambourines Nico played in her songs. Nowhere else could musical compositions like \\"Sunday Morning\\" -- the delicate tune reminiscent of a music box -- seem so haunting as they do here.<br /><br />The vocals are excellent, although listeners will probably like one or the other. Lou Reed's high thin voice is a sharp contrast to Nico's accented, husky croon. (Nico left the band after this album, which is a shame), but it's the writing that makes it stand out The songwriting is outstanding, and since the frank references to kinky sex and drugs are nowhere near as shocking now as they were then, the raw quality of the songs can shine.<br /><br />The sparse, slithering music and excellent singing add solidarity to the reputation of the Velvet Underground as a classic.

0307276902|5.0|I was married to an alchoholic and addict for 26 years, saw him through many, many treatments, incarcerations and binge after binge. He was beloved by so many friends and family, so I never understood the \\"why\\" of it all until James Frey helped me. My alcoholic and addict couldn't do the 12-steps either. He couldn't believe in it, try as he did. No professional ever told him there was any other was but the 12-steps. A Million Little Pieces maybe could have shown him an alternative (and saved him) if James had been published earlier. I really connected with the reality of James' life as he portrayed it. There were so many similarites, both in the characters entwined in James life and in his experience in rehab as with my alcoholic and addict's life.  Some incidents may have been fabricated personal experiences, but those experiences did indeed happen to others. I recognized so many of the characters as guests at my dinner table, after each failed rehab attempt.  Though my alcoholic and addict didn't make it, I'm glad James Frey did and was able to write so eloquently about his journey to sobriety.  I've read and reread A Million Little Pieces and am touched each time.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Fans have been clamoring for the original, theatrical \\"Star Wars\\" movies from the 70s and 80s for years now. But by the time director George Lucas put them out on DVD, he had redone the trilogy with new special effects and inserted scenes.<br /><br />Buuuuut... that's not what the fans have wanted. They wanted the unadulterated original. And until the end of December, a special two-disc edition of the classic, groundbreaking \\"Star Wars IV - A New Hope\\" will be available, with both the theatrical and the new versions. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to cost any more than a one-disc DVD.<br /><br />Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is bored and frustrated on his uncle's moisture farm. That all changes when his uncle buys two new droids, C3P0 and R2D2 (Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker), the second of which leads Luke to the eccentric old Ben Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness) -- and a transmission of a beautiful princess (Carrie Fisher) asking for Kenobi's help.<br /><br />At first, Luke doesn't plan to go, since he still has to help his uncle with the harvest. But when he returns home to find his uncle and aunt murdered by Imperial stormtroopers, he agrees to come with Kenobi and help rescue the princess -- and train to become a Jedi knight, \\"like my father.\\" But to rescue the princess, he and his new friends will venture into the heart of the planet-destroying Death Star, and have to deal with the evil Darth Vader...<br /><br />Lucas's movie was a groundbreaking moment in cinematic history -- nobody had ever done special effects or science fiction like this before, and it made the mold for future stories with battleships, evil overlords and distant planet. What was better, it was spiced up with influences from Akira Kurosawa to J.R.R. Tolkien, and sprinkled with some Eastern philosophy for \\"the Force.\\"<br /><br />This was also the biggest role for the three stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, as the naive young farmboy-turned-hero, the feisty princess, and the jaded outlaw. They all did very solid jobs, even with the most awkward bits of dialogue, as they run around the slick, claustrophobic Death Star and the slightly run-down Millennium Falcon.<br /><br />What's the difference between the two versions? Plenty, actually. Many of the scenes just have a CGI character or two wandering around, or a ship swooping down over a control tower. But some scenes were never in the original at all (stormtroopers scouting in the desert), and others were cut, redone and put back in again (like Han's nasty encounter with Jabba in the hangar).<br /><br />Some of these changes are good, some are bad. The best ones are the insertion of tiny moving pilots into the X-wings. But it's worth sacrificing that to have the original bar scene back, as it was in 1977: The original featured Han talking to a bounty hunter, and then shooting him under the table; the remastered one has a very fake-looking shot of the hunter shooting first... and missing.<br /><br />Is it actually bad? Not really; the dramatic punch of scenes like the approach of the Millennium Falcon or the victory over the Death Star are still unmarred. But it feels like it's been slicked down until it loses the raw, groundbreaking appeal that the original had. It's a credit to the theatrical version that this many years later, people still want to see it in its original glory, dated special-effects or not.<br /><br />Fans of both versions of \\"A New Hope\\" will find them in this two-disc edition, and those who just want the theatrical can switch it to a single box.

B00007LTIB|5.0|This is my second- favorite Yes album (or third if you take Fragile into consideration...) Tales From Topographic Oceans had just sunk in and I was appeased by Yessongs, when, smack- dab out of nowhere comes Relayer! Just when I thought the boys (albeit a couple different ones,) couldn't come close to Close to the Edge, they threw this significant curveball! I loved the jazz- fusion overtones and Moraz's keyboards fit as if he had been there since the first gig Yes ever played. Steve Howe's pedal steel is back in a very spacey way (I swear, when I listen to the end of \\"Gates of Delirium\\" I experience a small glimpse of heaven!) And Jon Anderson's voice.... Are you sure this guy's not an angel? \\"Sound Chaser\\" is amped- out jazz with a terrific interplay between keys and guitar in what time signature? \\"To Be Over\\" is a great flowing tune that's as close to Country as this guy's gonna get. But, seriously, the lyrics are quite exquisite and the pedal steel adds a very floating- down the \\"calming Stream\\" quality. I was truly floored when I first heard this release and it has spent a great deal of time in my stereo for over thirty years. A timeless classic of epic beauty.

0307263118|5.0|This is a book that grows on you after you have put it down. Like many other winners of the Man Booker Prize (this being the most recent), John Banville's novel is long on atmosphere and style, but short on story; think of a male Anita Brookner, or a Proust writing at scarcely more than novella length. Following the death of his wife, writer and art historian Max Morden returns to the Irish seaside town of Ballyless, where he used to spend summer holidays as a child. Reminiscences of his friendship with another family, the Graces, shot through with tinges of prepubescent eroticism, intertwine with reflections on grief, aging, and personal identity.<br /><br />Banville's style is extraordinary, his insights ring true, and his feeling for place and period is remarkable. I also found this book spoke to me on a number of coincidental personal levels, having grown up in just such a seaside town in Ireland, pursued a brief career in art history, and now being of a similar age to the leading character. But I can imagine that even people with less similar backgrounds, especially those of an older generation, might feel the same hypnotic magic, such is Banville's power to draw the reader into his world.<br /><br />And yet I have two cavils that originally made me question the fifth star (which I ultimately awarded). One is that the long-ago story just seems too slim to support all this rumination; or rather, the connection between those events and the narrator's later life is not entirely clear -- less so than in Jane Gardam's [[ASIN:1933372133 OLD FILTH]], for instance, another recent novel which excavates the past as a key to the present. However, the last twenty pages of the book deliver a couple of interesting plot twists which suddenly shine a new light on the faded memories, akin to cleaning off the varnish from an old picture and seeing it for the first time as it always was.<br /><br />Then there is that style, praised by everybody, and rightly so. There is at least one unusual word on every page, or words converted surprisingly from one part of speech to another, in Joycean fashion. This creates a surprised tingle in the reader, and often enough triggers the delighted recognition that the writer has got the description exactly right. But when this happens too many times, it begins to seem an affectation, overly self-conscious. Two passages in particular gave me pause: &#34;sitting up in my ornate bed as on a catafalque, if that is the word I want&#34; and &#34;I pictured her in bombazine, whatever that is.&#34; Now an author who can use words like revenant, mephitic, flocculent, pharaonic, and prelapsarian without a quiver can certainly handle catafalque and bombazine. But of course it is not the author that is hesitating here, but the CHARACTER, the writer Max Morden himself . . . .<br /><br />I can see now that Max refers self-deprecatingly to his own abilities as a writer throughout the book: mediocre, with occasional flashes of brilliance. And he is clearly conscious not only of the story he is telling, but of how he is telling it. Just before the final developments, he writes: &#34;After all, why should I be less susceptible than the next melodramatist to the tale's demand for a neat closing twist?&#34; Much of his life seems to have been centered on a desire to define himself, whether through others or through his writing, and he recognizes that he turned to the Graces at least partly for such definition. Children often construct stories around themselves, and act out scenarios of their own imagining; but when their imagined dramas intersect and conflict with real-life events, the result can be devastating.<br /><br />I am finding myself thinking more and more highly of this book as I write about it; it acts like a time-release capsule. Good writing can do that. But I still can't help feeling that it would have been better if, over the first fifty pages or so, I hadn't found myself thinking &#34;How exquisitely Banvillewrites!&#34; but instead &#34;Who is this interesting character? Why does he use language in such a manner? I would like to know more . . . .&#34;writes!&#34; but instead &#34;Who is this interesting character? Why does he use language in such a manner?

B00005JOWF|1.0|Ugh. This movie was one of the worst that I've seen in a while. It was hard for me to pay attention to it, and I almost always give my attention to movies in the theater. <br />One of the problems with this movie is that the plot is hard to understand. During some parts I couldn't tell whose side everyone was on. <br />Another thing is that the audience never really got to know each character. We never felt sorry when we thought someone was about to die because we just didn't know that character well enough. <br />Everything was so fake looking, too. I'm not saying that's bad, I just thought I'd mention it. I'm sure it looks much better on the big screen than on the small screen. <br />Also, I thought that the acting wasn't that great. <br />Well, I guess I'm done ranting now. What I'm trying to say is that this movie is not worth your time. I was glad that I saw it at the dollar movie rather than wasting my $8 bucks or however much it is at the regular theater.

B000ELIVB0|5.0|Were you ever curious what it would sound like if David Lynch decided to make an electropop album? Well, Silent Shout may be your answer. This is probably the oddest album since Bjork's \\"Medulla\\" (yet this is much more successful in my opinion). Even darker and weirder than their last album, \\"Silent Shout\\" is also a huge leap forward. \\"Deep Cuts\\" had all the ingredients to be an album I should love, but for some reason it never completely drew me in. I definitely LIKED it, but there were a few too many ideas and it just didn't seem to reach its full potential. \\"Silent Shout,\\" on the other hand, drew me in instantly. It is very cohesive, it builds on all the band's strengths, and it sets them apart from pretty much any other band in existence. It's dark and creepy and otherwordly, yet at the same time there's a surreal warmth and beauty that radiates from the music. It's a mood unlike any other I've experienced before from any other artist. That's why this album draws you in and warrants repeated listenings. Music that is immediately catchy and accessible can be quite nice (like an old acquaintance), but it's these bands that reinvent music and bring something fresh to the table (like a new lover) that keep you coming back for more, and should really be recognized as something special. <br /> <br />Take Bjork's vocals, distort them many different ways, layer them on top of each other until you have what sounds like a choir of aliens or strange forest creatures, then add them to brooding pads, arpeggiated synths, and electronic drum beats, and you have an idea of what this album sounds like (the result is so much better than it may look in writing, though). The music isn't just a novelty either. It really is good from beginning to end. Some of my favorite tracks so far are \\"The Captain,\\" \\"We Share Our Mothers' Health,\\" \\"Like a Pen,\\" and \\"Forest Families.\\" My least favorite is \\"Neverland.\\" It's ok, but I find it a little more jarring than the rest of the album. Just aslight misstep in an otherwise perfect work of art. <br /> <br />Check out the videos from the album, too. They really complement the mood - especially the video for the title track, which has a very creepy David Lynch feel. I watched it before my first listen of the album and it really helped set the tone. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album to fans of electro, darker-toned pop, or any brave music fan. It may seem overwhelmingly odd at first, but if you give it a chance, you may be greatly rewarded. Brilliant.
1594200696|5.0|This book was required for my high school English classes back in the late '60's. As an English professor, I use this book today. Many generations of students have benefited from this book's informal, conversational approach to teaching formal English (that is, excellent English that is precise and concise in form and content). Although I don't personally like the illustrations, this is my favorite edition of the book because the illustrations add a whimsical informality to substantive content.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Absolutely amazing. After seeing it at a friends place, I went out and bought a copy for myself. The use of the surround channels is used extremely well throughout, without being an annoyance.    Sound comes in 3 different flavours, Stereo, Dolby Digital (448kbps), and Dolby Digital (640kbps). I can only speak for the 640kbps version - it'll blow your socks off! Turn the volumne up to appreciate the depth of the sound IMO.    As others had mentioned, the picture quality isn't upto todays standards, but if you look past the grainyness, you'll be blown away with the show.     The bonuses are an excellent addition. Especially the Videos!    Compared to the Roger Waters in the Flesh DVD, I'd got for Pulse any day of the week! I listened to In the Flesh DVD straight after Pulse - it simply doesn't compare performance, or sound quality wise.
B000EULJLU|4.0|This album takes some time to warm up to, but after listening to this for a couple of weeks, I can't seem to take this out of my cd player.  Any tool fan will appreciate it and I would put this album ahead of the RHCP album because to me it has more substance.  To the people questioning the title, 10,000 days is approximately 27 years, which is how long Maynard's mother (Judith Marie - the same Judith he sings about in APC) spent paralyzed but remained a devout Christian before dying.  Highlights: <br /> <br />Vicarious (most complete track - I compare it to Stinkfist) <br />10,000 days <br />The Pot <br />Rosetta Stoned <br />Right in Two <br /> <br />Those 5 songs alone should be enough for anyone to justify purchasing this album.  It's not Aenemia but this is what tool has progressed to and to me it's pretty awesome. <br />
B00000K2W1|5.0|If you enjoy the works of one of the great rock and roll stars of our time, Janis Joplin, I would highly recommend this CD of Janis Joplin-Greatest Hits.  It captures Janis in a number of concert scenes where she was at her best...in front of live crowds..talking and singing...the music, music tones, moods, language, conversation, all make this CD very special...I had the pleasure of seeing Janis when I was a young kid in my first year of high school...she was very special...and her work is very special.  If you don't know of Janis...try this out...it will rock your world.

B000002UB3|5.0|I bought this album in vinyl in the Fall of 1969, when it was first released. I thought it was the best album I had ever heard to that point, and I owned a lot of albums in 1969. I was a new college student then. What great times, exploring a new life with the freshest music I'd ever heard. <br /> <br />This was the first cassette I ever bought in the 1980's, when I could finally afford a new car which had a cassette player. I traveled a lot for work, and kept the cassette in the car. I never tired of it, although I was mildly disappointed that the song order wasn't the same as the same as on the vinyl album. I collected many other cassettes and even made many of my own, but Abbey Road was still the best. <br /> <br />In the 1990's, I was given a CD player and Abbey Road (1st CD) as a birthday present. Got a car with a CD player. Still traveled a lot, still played it a lot. Glad that the song order was back to the vinyl album song order. Got other CD's, made my own CD's. Still my favorite. <br /> <br />I will be retiring soon, 32 years after I started my current job; 37 years after I first purchased this album. I had many albums before, and since, but Abbey Road is still my absolute all-time favorite. <br /> <br />
B00005JOQS|5.0|Superman Returns lives up to all the pre-release hype, and is definitely worth the price of admission.  Kudos to Brandon Routh for making the character of Superman his own; for my money his is the best Superman to play on the big or small screen (heresy to some die-hard Reeve fans I'm sure, but true nonetheless).  The movie was visually superb, and the story drew you in from the very beginning, and held your interest till the credits started to role.  Well worth slipping into the theatre to see it now, while everyone else is beating a path to Pirates of the Caribbean! <br /> <br />As an aside, I am curious why the movie Superman has been turned into a Christ figure, especially when this underlying theme has to be lost on a large chunk of the viewing audience.  The Matrix flix did the same with Neo, as did The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe with Aslan the Lion, so the trend in movies seems to be to go beyond a hero figure to a Christ figure.  I don't remember the original Superman (I grew up in the 60's) being a retelling of the story of Christ in comic book form.  I'm not complaining, I'm simply curious - why do some of the biggest blockbuster movies of the past several years contain so many obvious Christian embellishments?  Hmmmm....
B000FFJ85I|3.0|its a good album, but meh! its too poppy, commercial for my liking!not as rock out as old AFI,this ones more of a sing-a-long!
0679809015|5.0|This book was loved by all my kids at around 1.5 years on up. Get a few copies as toddlers can be rough with the doors and they eventually do fall off. I give this book as a gift as well when friends have babies.  <br /> <br />Kids always love to see animals and hear animal sounds. It is no wonder this book is popular!
B0006TROAO|5.0|Damien, the Irish wonder, decided to package both his brilliant debut `O' and his follow up EP `B-Sides' together so we can experience his entire masterpiece without making two purchases.  Both albums, separately as well as together, are beautifully done and wonderfully executed...so here's a run down of each song on this collection.   <br /> <br />1. Delicate  <br /> <br />This song has deep meaning for me for listening to it helps express exactly the way I felt the day my first love (not first girlfriend, first love) broke my heart. Damien asks the questions \\"why'd you sing with me at all?\\" and that's the same way I felt, staring in her eyes and wondering why she'd pretend for so long only to take back everything she's ever told me. This song perfectly expresses the feelings left when love goes wrong, when everything delicate breaks.  <br /> <br />2. Volcano  <br /> <br />A song of tortured or maybe even forbidden love (\\"she's still too young\\"), or, as those same lyrics could suggest...immature love, this is by far a standout here with beautiful and heartfelt lyrics, and vocals shining by both Damien and Lisa Hannigan.  <br /> <br />3. The Blower's Daughter  <br /> <br />Thanks to the popularity of 'Closer' this single made Damien a household name. The song, set aside the instant popularity, is well deserving of all the attention. It's a brilliantly crafted love song that showcases the despair of a broken heart and the determination to make love last. Damien laments over the broken condition of the one he loves, but will he ever be able to make her whole?  <br /> <br />4. Cannonball  <br /> <br />This song is about the insecurities that amount when your falling head over heals for someone. Damien talks of his doubt, his words \\"it's still a little hard to say what's going on\\", but it's the chorus that really tells it all. When you're in love it's easy to be hurt because you become so vulnerable. So when Damien sings \\"it's easy to fall when you float like a cannonball\\" he so right. When you fall for someone you feel as though your floating high, but that's dangerous for when your that high you have a long what to fall. This is such a beautiful song with such resonance with situations we all have faced.  <br /> <br />5. Older Chests  <br /> <br />This song dissects the changes we go through as a whole, the way the world changes and, as people stay the same it's unhealthy as the world around then changes and adapts all the time. It's actually quite sad when you think about it. \\"I'll be fine, just give me time.\\"  <br /> <br />6. Amie  <br /> <br />Sometimes we meet someone, we know someone and no matter how weird it may seem that someone who we've known for so many years and never thought of passed friendship turns out to be the one you long for. \\"You know when you've found it there's something i've learned 'cause you feel it when they take it away\\" and how true that is...One of the most beautiful and intoxicating songs I've had the pleasure of hearing.  <br /> <br />7. Cheers Darlin'  <br /> <br />When you keep your mouth shut you lose out on the things you long for the most. That's the moral of this song as Damien laments over not taking the chances he should have...\\"I'm too shy, I should have kissed you when we were alone\\"...And now it's too late, for she's getting married and at this point there's nothing you can do, for all is lost and your alone. She's something you'll never have, not once, and even if you move on, even if you find love elsewhere, never having her, never having the chance to lose her will eat you up for the rest of your life.  <br /> <br />8. Cold Water  <br /> <br />Close to my favorite song on the album, Damien and Lisa Hannigan here harmonize beautifully on this song about the feeling of loneliness and the desire to feel needed and wanted. The way Damien sings the first verse, almost as if he's choking...it adds to the feeling of being smothered, of drowning in your sorrow and so you believe him when hesays \\"cold water surrounds me\\"...brilliant!  <br /> <br />9. I Remember  <br /> <br />Sung almost entirely by Lisa Hannigan this song is a shining moment for her until Damien comes in towards the end when the music takes a turn and he steals the whole show. She sings beautifully but Damien is so commanding I almost forgot she sang any part of the song. This song goes into losing your grip on your reality when you fall for the wrong person, when you give up all you thinking ability and devote yourself to them, and they use and abuse you and you end up screaming to yourself \\"I wanna hear what you want what the hell do you want?\\" I know the feeling well.  <br /> <br />10. Eskimo  <br /> <br />This is an interesting song concept, translating an opera. It works well and proves that Damien is a freaking genius! This song, while a little strange (\\"i look to my eskimo friend when i'm down \\") it still evokes brilliance, especially towards the end when the opera screams in the background and your drawn into it's grander...  <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are worth a listen, especially 'Prague' which is beautifully done and worth the bit of silence it takes to discover. Their rendition of 'Silent Night' is also breathtaking, sung a capella by Lisa Hannigan it will give you chills. I recommend this album to any lover of music for that's what Damien is, a lover of music, and here he's been able to build a musical masterclass! <br /> <br />And now for the tracks originally of off `B-Sides' <br /> <br />Damien starts us off with 'The Professor & La Fille Danse' which is the most effective track here. It's musical arrangement perfectly fits the lyrical message about the using of women for pleasure. The song describes, in a somewhat explicit and disturbing nature, the fact that this man knows nothing about this woman. The line \\"and the d*ck left inside only half understood her\\" perfectly (while vulgarly) explains the predicament that this poor woman is being used for a purpose. <br /> <br />The next track is 'Lonelil y', which appeared on the single for Cannonball (another brilliant track) and this song, while not as strong as the previous, has a positive message about love and being with the ones you love. None of us want to be lonely. I like the lyrical message in this song, almost as if they took their relationship for granted and then realized they'd rather be together. The chorus chanting \\"your coming home\\" and you believe that. <br /> <br />'Woman like a Man' is one of my favorite tracks by Damien. This song is elegantly done with beautiful harmonizing. The song itself is a little difficult to follow, I'm still trying to figure out what he's getting at, but I think I got it. It appears as if he's pointing out the role-factors of the sexes today, how men and or women want the benefits received by the other sex and that sex alone. That's just my take though... <br /> <br />I LOVE 'Moody Mooday' if not for the brilliant lyrics then for the way Damien tackles this song. There's a track on 'O' that makes me feel this same way, and that track is 'Cold Water'. On that song, Damien sings as if he were drowning. You believe him. Here it's the same. He sings \\"I find it hard to breath\\" and he sings this with such strain in his voice you know he's struggling to deliver each word. The lyrics are deep in their simplicity, and wording it the way he has, with \\"why d'you have to break free\\" almost as if she was his captive and then \\"why d'you have to phone\\" letting you know she left him in an impersonal manor but then his comment \\"someone else you'd rather phone\\" leads you to believe it was never personal. I personally think she's a hooker...but that's just my take on the song. <br /> <br />The live cut of 'Delicate' is a little to soft. I just think it was poorly recorded. I know it's live but it's no where near as polished as the live cut of 'The Professor...' It's still a wonderful song; it just loses a bit in the translation. <br /> <br />The album closes out with an instrumental and demo version of 'Volcano' which succeeds on both efforts. The instrumental is beautiful but to me it's the demo that stands out as one of my favorite additions to this album. It's raw and downplayed, slow and passionate and it really adds to the umph you get from the powerful lyrics of an immature and maybe even guilty relationship. I just love the whole feel of it. <br /> <br />So there you have it. Yet another brilliant offering from Damien, and something that should hold us over until his next album...let's just pray it comes soon! <br />
0805047905|5.0|This is a classic book. It shows many different animals that are each a different color. My children like to say the name of the next animal before we turn the page. It also encourages imagination because animals aren't always their typical colors...EX: a blue horse.<br /><br />We read and sing this one.<br /><br />All of my children loved this book.
0895260131|5.0|This is one of those books I would happily recommend to everyone. Well-written, well-organized and easy to read, the contents should make anyone stand up and take notice. Buy it now - don't wait another day!
0571202284|4.0|This book fleshes out the process of traditional (pre-computer) animation more than the Preston Blair book which I had purchased earlier.  If you found that book useful, this one will be even more helpful in understanding overall workflow.<br /><br />A prerequisite for this book would be good fundamentals at sketching humanoids and understanding volume, especially with figures.  Just a warning -- until you are able to draw shapes consistently, you will be stuck on the first few pages.<br /><br />Williams' book begins with an overview of moving simple volumes, but quickly dives into the complexity of making figures walk.  He spells out similar-but-different nuts-and-bolts approaches to the traditional animation process through the construction of walk cycles, of which there are many examples.  I am strictly a beginner, but for the seasoned animator, I expect this book would be a handy reference for walk cycles.<br /><br />Over the course of the book, Williams touches on virtually all key areas which animators have to deal with including fabric and mouth movements.  The author also offers sagely advice from the colleagues he learned from over the years.  The text is very readable and makes you feel like you are moving along, learning the business of animation from the inside out.<br /><br />This edition DOES NOT give detailed explanation of the nuts-and-bolts, tools, or workflow of COMPUTER animation as it is evolving today.  HOWEVER, anyone who masters the fundamentals stressed in this book would be prepared for most any style of animation.<br /><br />This is not a book to give you quick-and-dirty shortcuts. The examples progress in a direction to build you into a total animator. I found the examples to be very clear upon studying and practicing them.  The forms begin simple and gain complexity throughout. For someone who is very serious about the CRAFT of animation, I would recommend this book.
B000065PUE|4.0|I owned this years ago, lent it to someone, never got it back. Grabbed it on sale, and boy am I glad! Totally forgot how awesome this album is! Saw the tour a billion years ago, the album brought it all back... the sonic boom, the great vocals! A definate must for anyone who appreciates alt/grunge or who wants to know where it came from...
0670034711|5.0|What a fabulous book! Heard Elizabeth interviewed on NPR and couldn't wait to buy her book! She writes just as lyrically as she speaks! A story of insight, of personalities, and of learning about ourselves! She is hilarious and introspective at the same time. Even though she is much younger than I, I felt such oneness with her thoughts - plus, I know these places very well so that made it extra meaningful!
B000FVQYYK|3.0|So,  <br />I have to admit...I was worried when i started reading a lot of the bad reviews of this record.  How could it be that Muse put out something less than stellar?  But my curiousity peaked and it was on sale for 9.99.  so i bought it.  And believe it or not...it isn't as bad as people say.  It could be a lot worse for sure.  And it's definitely not the same as their last few albums...which definitly fits into my pissing and moaning about how music/tv/theatre/movies all need to go through a renaissance.  There are some pretty damn good songs on this album. (Knights of Cydonia, city of Delusion, Map of the Problematique.)  there are also some clunkers (Assassin, Invincible), but lets not forget \\"sing for absolution\\"...which in my opinion blows.    <br />I think that this could be an album that if you listen to the first time and hate it, you could come back to it a couple months from now and think, \\"eh, it really isn't all that bad.\\"  I think that a lot of these bad reviews come from people expecting Muse to write the next OK Computer with this album...and let's just face it, not even Radiohead is going to write another OK Computer. <br />Not every album a band puts out is going to be stellar.  It's a difficult thing to write ridiculously awesome songs non-stop.  So if you don't expect the band to do such a thing, you won't be dissapointed by this album. <br />  <br />In the end...let your curiousity get the better of you and check it out.  It's not as bad as you might think.
B00005JOQS|4.0|I went into the movie with a lot of skepticism. Star Wars fans all seemed to hypnotize themselves into liking Revenge of the Sith, and I was concerned that so many comic fans liking the new Superman movie was something similar. In this case, I needn't have worried.<br /><br />In the end, I only have minor quibbles. Everything I was worried about (the kid, Lois being engaged) worked out great, the Super stuff was beyond awesome and the visceral impact of seeing Superman \\"return\\" five years after 9/11 was weirdly cathartic: I haven't been to a superhero movie where a lot of people in the audience were crying before, but people were absolutely bawling when Superman was re-revealed to the world after the first big rescue of the movie.<br /><br />Brandon Routh isn't the world's greatest actor, but neither was Christopher Reeve. But both had the decency that Superman (especially the Cary Bates-drawn Superman of the 1970s radiated) requires. Worst haircut ever, though.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth, while not my first choice for Lois, made the character semi-appealing to me for the first time ever (Action Comics was my very first comic book and I subscribed to Superman with my allowance money through the 1970s), although at the end of the day, she's still kind of a bitch. But Singer clearly saw Lois Lane as Katherine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby, and Bosworth was even dressed the part. That sort of manic, well-meaning but steam-rolling character actually could make Lois charming, if the writing ever fully catches up to the interpretation (it never has in the comics -- there Lana Lang was always clearly the better love interest, Betty to Lois' Veronica).<br /><br />Kevin Spacey split the difference with Gene Hackman's over the top version of Lex Luthor (did I mention that this film is an explicit sequel to the Christopher Reeve movies?) and a more realistic Luthor for an audience that has seen Oz and the Sopranos. His comments about prison were a great grounding in reality and his personal attack on Superman at the edge of the cliff (you'll know it when you see it) is one of the great iconic images that I suspect will be recycled in the comic books for years to come.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was fine, although I think Frank Langella was badly miscast -- sorry, Frank, but you're a bad guy, not a generic cipher but generally friendly editor type.

(Although maybe only to me.)<br /><br />I think the twist everyone saw coming was handled very well, and Lois' fiance, rather than being an anchor around the neck of this film, actually added a lot to the proceedings from where I'm sitting, because it definitely gave the feeling that life had moved on and here was a guy that the audience couldn't really dislike and who fills the roles that Clark left empty in both of his personas when he left Earth. (It also proves that he annoyed me as Cyclops in the X-Men movies because Cyclops is annoying, not because the actor is. Cyclops has always sucked.)<br /><br />Without question, though, this is Superman at his most Super in any film or television show.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This DVD is awesome! The CG is amazing, the story is incredible, and the music is just phenomenal. Advent Children brings new life to the characters of Final Fantasy VII as their lives after Crisis Core are revealed. Definitely one of the greatest movies ever.
B000000OXH|3.0|The critics of \\"Alpha\\" commonly state that it is \\"more of the same\\" thing that their debut had to offer.  For better or for worse, this is only half-true.  Asia's debut was compellingly consistent and for the uninitiated, that is the place to start.  However, \\"Alpha\\" is the first to display the inconsistencies that would plague the rest of the band's career in all of its forms.  Don't misunderstand:  \\"Alpha\\" is hardly unlistenable, and at times it genuinely captures the powerfully bombastic aesthetic of its predecessor, but it also represents the aesthetic and personal rifts that would ultimately force Geoff Downes to redefine Asia as a strictly studio project whose success would ultimately be marginal.<br /><br />\\"Alpha\\" was made at a time when the individual musicianship of the members of the project was allowed to define the sound of the group.  At their height, Asia certainly displayed a certain amount of chemistry.  At the very least, they had enough individual musicianship to circumvent any notion to the contrary. However, for the listener that is familiar with Asia and has an acute ear, Steve Howe's increasing marginalization on Alpha is perceptible<br /><br />Howe had been increasingly shut out of the writing process on Alpha for reasons that are still complex and interpersonal.  As a result, much of his guitar work feels \\"added on\\", and certainly not as integrated as it was on \\"Asia\\".  His rather \\"distinctive\\" style does not seem to work as well under these conditions, and although the parts are technically impressive, the end result is not the best example of his work.<br /><br />According to all reports, this exclusion came from the Wetton/Downes camp.  Seeing where Asia was going with the heavier and increasingly relevant 80s pop-metal guitar sound (as Van Halen and Journey were popularizing) that was later apparent on \\"Astra\\" may provide some insight into this rift.  In all probability, Wetton/Downes genuinely wanted to recreate the success of \\"Heat of the Moment\\", but possibly saw Howe's guitar work as archaic.  One might wonder what happened in the alternate universe where Trevor Rabin ended up playing for Asia, who for a short time straddled the fence between prog, pop, and metal.  Asia's longevity might have been different and Yes' fan base would not have had to come to terms with Rabin's reinvention of the group.  Consider the relative dud \\"True Colors\\", which at times sounds remarkably like the winner \\"Changes\\" from \\"91025\\".  I can't help but ponder how Rabin's contribution might have changed the overall sound of the group.<br /><br />In the end it seems like it is Carl Palmer, who I usually enjoy taking a good poke at for his \\"unique\\" sense of time (listen to the band struggle to keep up with him during his drum solo on \\"Wildest Dreams\\" on their debut), that really holds \\"Alpha\\" together.  His playing on \\"Do What I Want\\" is a high point and one that I wish Wetton would have similarly reached for in his vocal delivery.  While he sounds great, a simple turn of the octave at the right time would allow it to reach the potentially emotional heights of the song.<br /><br />The aforementioned inconsistencies take the form of a couple of duds on \\"Alpha\\".  For example, \\"Eye to Eye\\" fails to convince, and \\"Never in a Million Years\\" sports clich&eacute;s aplenty.  The aforementioned \\"True Colors\\" and \\"Midnight Sun\\" might sound more comfortable on \\"Astra\\" with the more metallic Mandy Meyer on guitar.  However, these songs also remind me of more successful tunes like Yes' \\"Changes\\", which is where my previous statements about Trevor Rabin come.<br /><br />However, there are several songs that reach and exceed the expectations that their debut set.  \\"Don't Cry\\" is probably their most convincing follow-up to \\"Heat of the Moment\\".  \\"Last to Know\\" is a moving prog-pop tune that is texturally related to \\"Is She Really Going Out With Him?\\" but that boasts the power of an emotionally bombastic chorus.  Wetton sounds great on \\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\", and while innovations may be relatively sparse, one would be deaf not to hear the lightly tread crossroads between the Beach Boys and ELP on \\"Open Your Eyes.\\"<br /><br />The Lowdown:  For those of you just tuning in, Asia has had a long and sordid history since the release of this album. However, if you see their debut \\"Asia\\" as a classic, then you will most likely at least hold \\"Alpha\\" in high regard.The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\", and while innovations may be relatively sparse, one would be deaf not to hear the lightly tread crossroads between the Beach Boys and ELP on \\"Open Your Eyes.\\"<br /><br />The Lowdown:  For those of you just tuning in, Asia has had a long and sordid history since the release of this album.

0811729117|4.0|I agree with another reviewer who felt that Carius spends very little time describing tank battles and lots of time talking about lost tank tracks, operational areas and the ins and outs of a Tiger's engine. Carius does do a good job of describing what spending 24 hours inside a tank was like, how only a huge amount of training would make a tank effective, and how the 'prime movers' and strong roads and bridges were essential to Tiger operations.
B000059LGC|4.0|This is a \\"deluxe\\" production of an Agatha Christie tale, with a cast employing well-known actors in every role.  Filmed on location, the cinematography is compelling beautiful.  We are treated to scenes of the Pyramids and the Sphinx.<br /><br />  As in all of Christie's stories, her twist-filled plot quickly absorbs the viewer.<br />I do have to admit, this movie seems a little padded and overblown compared to the excellent, more concise BBC presentations of Christie's mysteries.  Especially  near the end, things seem to be drawn-out, overly long; the pace seems to lag.<br /><br />  Nevertheless, the web of mystery is spun well, and if you are unfamiliar with the tale, you will be surprised at the denoument.  Recommended for all ages.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Ahh, Tool. <br /> <br />There seem to be two camps associated with this band, and more appropriately, this album. There are the  folks who are apparently rabid fans of Tool and give the songs lobotmies via analyzation, and they are the ones who are either somewhat disappointed with the album or give it unending praise because of the title slapped onto it (That would be Tool, not the number connotation). <br /> <br />Then there are the detractors who somehow feel it's helpful to berate the band by calling them sellouts, washed up old men, or simply hurl mindless insults. Neither of these people are helpful to prospectful buyers. <br /> <br />Starting out on the right foot here is important, I also frequently get fed up with Tool's apparent mindset that their fanbase is an endless field of zombies or stoners (one in the same?) who claim to have achieved higher being through Tool's music. <br /> <br />Considering they make an album once every five years, the expectations seem to always be monumentic in proportion (apparently the majority of Tool fans have no other bands to pre-occupy their time with?). But once again, after a 5 years stretch of ambiguity and ruthless pranking, Tool has unleashed another album of aggressive, carthatic music. <br /> <br />Their opener is \\"Vicarious\\" and as many have claimed already, it sounds like  a Lateralus b-side at the start. But as time wears on, and the repetitive, but endlessly talented riffs stretch on, it expands itself into something unique and wholly satisfying. It is long and the lyrics are satisfying, the music seems a little more crunchy and a little less mystical than on Lateralus which frnakly, works for me.  <br /> <br />The songs that follow are where the album really begins to open up, there is a signature Tool buildup to an unleashing of heart-pounding fury at the end of each song. \\"Jambi\\" is helplessly catchy, the lyrics are touching in a way you can expect from a metal band, and Maynard is at the top of his game asfar a ssinging goes. Chancellor and the boys are at peak performance, if only because they can keep their fury pounding through all these songs (which are nearly all over 7 minutes). <br /> <br />The album cools from there with \\"Wings for Marie\\" and \\"10,000 Days\\" which are basically  two of the same played and sung in different styles. The most powerful lyrics are undeniably on the track \\"10,000 Days\\", it is unfortunate that \\"Wings for Marie\\" seems to be such a weak track on it's own, admittedly these two and \\"Viginte Tres\\" are meant to be combined/layered, but it makes for rough listening on a simple car stereo. <br /> <br />After the central cooldown things pick up again (this album is set up like many of their songs, starts out swingin' and builds to a furious crescendo before dropping down and slowly pounding it's way to an epic finale). \\"The Pot\\" is an obscure tune, which is par for the course at this point, with lyrics that are simultaneously deep and nonsensical and a bass line that doesn't let up. <br /> <br />From here the CD cools down again briefly with \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" and \\"Lost Keys\\", \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" is interesting, but it seems disappointing after all the crashing and banging 7+ minute songs that a 2 minute chant got an entire track. <br /> <br />\\"Lost Keys\\" is an excellent, almost indispensable lead in to the next song \\"Roseta Stoned\\" which is, for me, where this album peaks. It is a crushing soundscape, it has all the things you probably were expecting, the lyrics are nothing short of an acid trip in motion, the music is crushing and enthralling to the ears and it builds to an extremely violent finish that will spoil you for the rest of the CD. <br /> <br />\\"Intension\\" is overall a weak track, though admittedly a welcome break after \\"Roseta Stoned\\". <br /> <br />\\"Right In Two\\" sounds a bit like A Perfect Circle at the start, but builds to what you've come to expect by this point in the CD.  The lyrics are fantastic, but it suffers from a placement issue. It just feels like \\"Roseta Stoned\\" should have gone after this, but this still should have been near the end, sort of a paradox that could have been remedied with another song. <br /> <br />\\"Viginte Tres\\" is pure disappointment (and mostly silence), seemingly placed just to beef up the track list to 11 when it would've been better left at 10. <br /> <br />After this long of an absence, I merely expected more from te band. Not in the music, for it is fantastic and everything you're looking for as far as talent. The musicians are like master swordsmans, finely honing their craft as time goes on. <br /> <br />More was not expected from the lyrics or singing, they are better than ever, ferocious and soothing when they need to be and should be a joy to see this all happen live. <br /> <br />Simply more in content, \\"Viginte Tres\\" would have been better off  if it had at least had more musicianship, it is minimalistic in approach and leads to a ten minute silence which is throughly unsatisfying as a finish, I'd prefer to be left reeling rather than bored. \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" is definitely necessary, but would probbaly have felt less like filler had another song been placed after it. \\"Wings For Marie\\" has every right to be on there also, but when you hear it right before \\"10,000 Days\\" it seems silly and unnecessary. They should have just combined the two songs for us. <br /> <br />Ultimately, it's magnificent and I'm thoroughly impressed with what is there, but left wanting more, much more, and thus, unsatisfied.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002BQK|5.0|1. Honey (5/5)-Very fun dance, summer song. A typical Bad Boy production <br /> <br />2. Butterfly (4/5)-A very sad, depressing but hopeful song.The title song is about letting your lover part ways with you and having hope that he will return. Something like a kid who has a pet butterfly. See the metaphor? The sultry singer uses a very good pattern that where alll the songs have a hint of depression. I love that though hearing this song many times, it tends to grow old on you... <br /> <br />3. My All (4/5)-A more sexual Carey comes out in this song with that hint of sweet depression, longing, and desperation. If saying \\"I'd risk my life to feel your body next to mine\\" isn't those things then I don't know what is. I believe alot of people will connect with this song whether they have had a similar experience or not. The only ill part are the blank spots. She has a midsection where she kind of hums for 30 seconds. It's too bare. <br /> <br />4. The Roof (5/5)-Easily my favorite track on the record. It is basically My All Part 2 in terms of content but it is more upbeat and sexy. It samples the scorching \\"Shook Ones\\" song by Mobb Deep. This song is most interesting because it reads like a book. Carey paints such a beautiful picture of a mystery man, who gives off the impression of an ex, who is caught up in the rapture of \\"reliving the splendor\\" of the two of you. It's not sex so much as it is desire and an intimate kiss on a roof. Words cannot describe how amazingly sensuous this song is.  <br /> <br />5. Fourth Of July (5/5)- I suppose in chronological order this song would go before Mariah had to let her \\"butterfly\\" fly. The setting Carey shows us in this song is gorgeous and makes you feel like you can see the roman candles soaring overhead as you are holding the hand of your signifigant other. The excessive use of past tense seems to show that Carey has some sort of patterned longing for someone. <br /> <br />6. Breakdown (5/5)-The clear hit on the album. So muchthat she made a spectacular video for it. Carey sings about how she wants to get over her ex but she simply can't. Everytime he comes around she has to put up a front as to not show she still wants him and then when she is alone she cries. It is truely a depressing song but amazing none-the-less. It features the popular 90's group Bone Thugs N Harmony who provide a positve outlook to the song saying that breaking up won't break them down today.  <br /> <br />7. Baby Doll (5/5)-Ah now we get to see a different side to the singer; druggie-Mariah. This song is scary in a way if you ask me. She seems to want to have some kind of sexual encounter with a man who won't call her back and she clearly states that she is obsessing over him. So what do you do when someone doesn't return your sexual invite? Drink and smoke of course. She says in the second verse that she tries to drink him out of her head and later makes a reference to being high. It is a relaxing song though and has a great-sounding bridge. Oh and if your confused by the title she says \\"I want you to be my baby doll.\\" Odd I know but that's Mariah. <br /> <br />8. Close My Eyes (3/5)-Finally a song that doesn't have to do with sex, heartache, or drugs. Carey talks about her childhood which she seems to make small reference to in her other albums. Unfortunatly she doesn't actually say what happened to her in her childhood, she justs says how she felt back then. Though this song seems somewhat out of place. I mean, clearly the theme is her recent divorce at the time to long time manager Tommy Mattola. Also in the terms of the writing it is somewhat subpar to Carey's standards. I was disappointed to hear \\"da da da da da\\" for much of the song. The song simply is skipable. <br /> <br />9. Whenever You Call (5/5)-I will admit it. This song always brings a tear to my eye as I have read that it does to many who listen to this song. Mariah in \\"Call\\" is basically saying that she will always be there whenever he is downhearted and needs someone to talk to. Yes it's a little cliche but heartwarming all together. The reason the song is so well done is that it builds in intensity from the verses, to the bridge, and the big finale. Mariah belts it at the end with everything she's got and it almost makes you want burst into tears. I don't care how tough you are. If you have ever been in love then this song will get to you. <br /> <br />10. Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise) (4/5)-Ok I must say this song is filler space. It is pretty much a disco-themed version of Butterfly without the lyrics. She just says \\"fly away\\" a lot. The nice part of this is Mariah brings in her famous backup singers to sing the almost choir-like \\"spread your wings and prepare to fly\\" as well as repeating \\"butterfly\\". It is a spiritual and uplifting song, much more so than it's original.  <br /> <br />11. The Beautiful Ones (5/5)-Let me warn you ahead of time. If you are planning to listen to this song in it's entirety then try not to fall asleep. Not in a bad way. It's a great remake of Prince's song from Purple Rain but it is very slow-paced and almost seven minutes long. Though if you can keep awake you will recognize Dru Hill, pre-Sisco going solo and making that horid song, accompanying the diva. The two together are nothing short of amazing. Their voices work well. Though you will notice Mariah seems to work well with boy bands; Boys II Men, 98 Degrees, Westlife, to name a few. What I love about this song is how dark it is. It is beyond depressing and is almost gothic due to the obsessive lyrics of wondering why beautiful people always hurt her. I think many can relate. She and Sisco have many moments where they belt how much they want and need this certain someone. You need to be open-minded to truely understand and enjoy this song. Those who have never felt the obsessive feeling of needing to be in love with someone will see this song as wierd or odd.  <br /> <br />12. Outside (5/5)-So we come to a close and when Mariah ends her albums she must end on a universal note. She likes to talk about a problem many have and this time around she talks about being on the outside of everyone else and not being able to fit in. She tells us we have to be who we really are and believe we are good enough because you will always on the outside. Yes, harsh I know but I think she doesn't sugar coat a problem that happen to thousands of teens. If you have this problem, this song will definetly connect with you. It is a beautiful ending to a spectacular album.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|My five year old granddaughter along with her older siblings thoroughly enjoyed \\"Dumbo\\" and I thank Disney for reissuing it for new generations to enjoy.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|\\"1\\" is a compilation of 27 songs by the Beatles, one of the most popular group of musicians in the world. They're probably my most favorite band too. They did pop, they did rock, they experimented, they joked around and most of all had personality and warmth, which shone through in the recordings. This was a band whose members were very close indeed.    You get 27 chart topping hits on this disc, spanning 1962 to 1970, though it excludes certain famous tracks that were on those singles (like \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"I Am The Walrus\\") The style of the group shifts and tumbles as you go, and its an interesting thing to listen to. Since its #1 hit based, sometimes there'll be an album from which you'll get no songs at all, which is a shame.     Here's a breakdown:    1 song from \\"Please Please Me\\" (1963)  Nothing from \\"With The Beatles (1963)  2 songs from \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" (1964)  1 song from \\"Beatles for Sale\\" (1964)  3 songs from \\"Help!\\" (1965)  Nothing from \\"Rubber Soul\\" (1965)  2 songs from \\"Revolver (1966)  Nothing from \\"Sargeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" (1967)  3 songs from \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" (1967, techincally a compilation CD more than an album)  Nothing from \\"The White Album\\" (1968, what a shame! My favorite)  2 songs from \\"Abbey Road\\" (1969)  2 songs from \\"Let it Be\\" (1970)    Some of the singles here weren't released on the albums, but are available on the Beatles \\"Past Masters\\" compilations. There are:    4 songs from \\"Past Masters Volume 1\\"  7 songs from \\"Past Masters Volume 2\\"    The tracks on this CD have been remastered. The biggest difference, I think, is that the sound of the songs is a lot warmer, there's a richer bass, if that makes sense. It makes listening to some of the hard-panned stereo tracks a lot easier to listen to on headphones. I don't know if that was intentional, but being a big headphone listener, it works for me!    One thing this compilation's done for me is made me see how the Beatles must have looked to theolder generations during the 1960s. Snatching glimpses of #1 hits on their radio and television, their impressions may have been based on a playlist very much like this. A popular group, a group that plays well, a group that changed with, if not led, the popular trends. It's a perspective that I probably wouldn't have gained, as I wouldn't have thought to have compiled all the Beatles number one hits. If you didn't already know, I think it'd hard to believe that the same band that sang \\"Love Me Do\\" is the same one that did \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and the same one that did \\"Something\\"    Unlike the Beatles studio CDs, the booklet that comes with \\"1\\" is lush and lavish. It's choc-a-block full of sleeve pictures of the singles, from around the world in some cases.  This also adds to the experience of what it must have been like for a casual listener in the 1960s. This is what they all must have seen in the record store back then. Unfortunately, there's no lyrics for the songs, but there is a little preface by producer George Martin, singing their praises. What happened to Mark Lewisohn writing liner notes, like on the \\"Past Master\\" CDs? Ah well. It's very nice to hear from Mr Martin.    Personally, if I was a newcomer to the fab four, I'd get myself the studio albums one by one. \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" were the first CDs I ever purchased for myself, lots of radio hits and album track classics. They were a good enough introduction to the Beatles for me. \\"Past Masters Volume 2\\" would go down well too, its a fine mix of singles and unique rarities. Still, this is all very good music on \\"1\\", and the Beatles will be a welcome addition to nearly any CD collection, I'm sure.
B00005JNX0|4.0|I must have watched Madagascar 5 or 6 times now, and it is certainly growing on me.  But the real attraction, and the reason I will buy the DVD is see the penguins in the movie and in the features.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I love this album... It's the one that sprouted my interest into Radiohead. The best part is, no matter how much I listen to it, I always love this CD. The way that every song sounds different from the rest makes it incredibly fresh and something nice to hear... It's the complete opposite of all the pop bands today who make money off of songs which all sound the same... And it's because of this it's pretty much impossible to get sick of this CD. It's amazing. And that's that.
0060899190|5.0|I came upon PostSecret completely by accident while perusing a local bookstore.  Thirty minutes later I left the store a different person and felt a glimmer of hope for all those involved in the project.  Hopefully they have received some sort of closure or a feeling of relief by \\"sharing\\" their secret. <br /> <br />PostSecret is a fascinating window into many taboo and untreated societal problems people face.  The book is comprised of postcard requests for people to anonymously mail in secrets that are true and never been revealed.  Brevity is requested and submitters will often artistically decorate their postcards making them works of art.   <br /> <br />The secrets range in topics and length and cover every major human emotion.  Some are laugh out loud funny but I found most to be tragic in nature as they allude to abuse, unfulfillment at the deepest level, or acts of a negative/shameful nature.  There are pictures of some of them here on Amazon so you can get an idea of what they are like.  For me many were very powerful and haunting and a few stuck with me long after I read them. <br /> <br />Many people have mentioned what an excellent coffee book this makes and I agree as it is really thought provoking, entertaining and aesthetically pleasing although in no way should pre-high school age kids be reading this book.  The postcards are presented as if they are real secrets and deal with subjects such as sex, drugs, physical abuse, incest etc.  and some contain nudity. <br /> <br />I'm really curious as to how the authors reacted to seeing their postcards published and how many of them are \\"real\\".  <br /> <br />On a COMPLETELY different note this book is a prime example of price point problems within the book industry.  If I'm not going to display this book, why would I pay 25.99 (in a book store) plus tax for a book I can read in 25 minutes!  Normally I'm against reading books in their entirety in a bookstore without buying them, but I truly believe Warren started this project for reasons other than to make money and thus in this case it's ok to read in in-store. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  A fantastic example of a train-wreck phenomenom..disturbing, intriguing, beautiful to some, powerful and impossible to look away.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Like so many other Pink Floyd fans, I'd been awaiting this dvd for years. In many ways the wait was well worth it. The sound, in gorgeous 5.1 surround is phenomenal and the video image is sharp and clear considering that it was originally shot in a video format (film would have been MUCH better as David Gilmour himself has admitted but it's impossible to change that now). I really don't understand the complaints that some fans are expressing concerning the video portion of the program considering, as I said that it was originally shot in video, a limited format in terms of color balance and saturation. The audio, however, is truly amazing especially considering it was a live show.     Personally the only two real drawbacks as far as I'm concerned are the full-screen 4:3 ratio vs. widescreen (a much better format for a PF concert that size). Full -screen pan and scan is definitely inferior and doesn't do the concert justice. The other short coming is the fact that when this version was edited it seems like the focus is more on distant shots of the stage as well as the films that were projected on the giant circular screen above the stage. Since all of the films were included as extras in the package it might have been wiser to utilize more shots of the band, large as it was.     All things considered, it is an excellent document of a remarkable concert save for a few previously mentioned shortcomings.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Rise Against peaked my attention on a mix tape once way back in the day. I bought the album, 'Revolutions per minute,' and spun that one very often. Then I had to check out their past, and got 'The unraveling' on wax as well. Soon, 'Siren song' came out, and I was just impressed with this band's ability to maintain such quality and their own sound as they gained popularity, and even had a music video or 2 on MTV.  <br /> <br />With this newest release, I was a little afraid that they may have changed their style or message, or anything due to their rising popularity. I was PLEASANTLY surprised to pay only 7 dollars for the brand new album, then to listen to 13 quality songs. This album has not diverted from the band's message and delivery. They didn't quiet down the screaming, they only grew in musical prowess. The only thing \\"mainstream\\" about this album is the lyrics follow a more structured pattern and have a repeated chorus line, but I'm willing to look past that! <br /> <br />This band is the alpha band. They are gaining popularity with the message they started with, and are still doing what they do, like they always have done, and hopefully, always will.  <br /> <br />If you are a first timer for a Rise Against album, please look at their past albums if you enjoy this one.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I was first introduced to Rise Against when I saw them open for Bad Religion. Soon after I picked up Siren Song of the Counter-Culture, and became an instant fan. I also have Revolutions Per Minute, which represents their earlier work. Really, this work is somewhat of a compromise between them -- it sounds studio polished, although not as studio polished, as Siren Song, but still packs the raw and blistering energy that you felt was there more on RPM. Overall, closer to Siren Song, but definitely a step forward from that record. My favorites include Injection, Prayer of the Refugee, and The Good Left Undone. Rise up from your chair now and go purchase this CD.
B00005JOIH|5.0|When a good movie is released I usually get the worked up version of the DVD because I like the extras. When i couldnt find the double disk set of Munich at my usual places I turned to Amazon and it shipped super fast. Kudos. Amazing film, too.

B00005ONMP|5.0|Unlike many all-digital compilations offered by one orchestra and conductor, this collection of Mendelssohn favorites is outstanding in performance and interpretation throughout. Maestro Abbado shows a genuine affection for the composer and his genius by the sequence of selections on each disc, and I find no weak performances anywhere in this remarkable recording.  <br /> <br />Charlie Hastings <br />Falls Church, VA
0743454537|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. First of all, Jodi Picoult has the amazing ability to capture this intricate story from all sides of the family, which is great. Also, the twists and turns made me want to never set the book down. Although tragic, the story is very realistic and Picoult stays true to the characters. Surprising, but worth a good cry. You won't forget it.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|Amazing performance. Felicity deserved the Oscar. TRANSAMERICA is a wonderful low budget film that doesnt try too hard to be likeable. It comes across honest and comedic yet very touching. One of the great films last year. I wasnt sure what to quite expect when I sat down to watch it but within minutes found myself glued to the screen. Terrific. If you love character study films, this is one for you!
B000001AI7|4.0|Of when Michael Jackson was brown. . .My brother's kids don't even believe it's the same Michael Jackson they see today!  My Uncle got me this \\"album\\" when I was 13 years old.  (The same age as Michael at the time). I played it to death.  \\"I Wanna Be Where You Are\\" is a wonderful song and can still hold its own all these years later.  \\"Rockin' Robin\\" is real cute - and was a big hit back in the day.  His voice was clear and on \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" he sounds very mature for his age. The entire album is good because he didn't do all those (\\"Hee hee hee\\") verbal ticks back then that he does now. I recommend this very much.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is truly a blessing to the music scene.  While nothing but the same old rap, hip-hop, r&b, manafactured pop, and male dominated rock have ruled the music world for a good period of time, Evanescence burst onto the scene in early 2003, giving us something we thought we would never hear.  Soaring beautiful female vocals, hard driving guitar riffs, wonderful classical piano pieces, and magnificent orchestrated strings, all mixed into one!!  And boy, is that a treat. The first time I listened to there first hit single, \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" I was absolutley blown away of the sheer power it had.  Anyways, here's a breakdown of the songs: <br /> <br /> <br />Going Under - A great way to start off the album and get it  <br />              going!!  Probably the hardest song on the album. <br /> <br />Bring Me To Life - First single that was a bit overplayed yeah, <br />                   but still, awesome.  A piano intro accompanys <br />                   it. Also guest vocalist Paul McCoy (12 Stones <br />                   is featured on here. <br /> <br />Everybody's Fool - A solid powerful song that declares how many <br />                   people and celeberties (aka Britney Spears)  <br />                   just use sex and looks for there image and  <br />                   how they truly are \\"Everybody's Fool.\\"   <br />                   Awesome guitar work on here!!! <br /> <br />My Immortal - One of the most beautiful heart wrenching piano  <br />              ballads you will ever hear!!!  Enough said. <br /> <br />Haunted -  Starts off with a creepy gothic intro and then pulls <br />           the listener into some hard guitar riffs.  A hard  <br />           song all around!!! <br /> <br />Tourniquet -  A cover of old former metal band Soul Embraced's  <br />              song Tourniquet,  it is very well done!!!  <br />             Probably what get many people thinking that  <br />             Evanescence was Christian. <br /> <br />Imaginary -Not really a favorite of mine, but still a good  <br />             song nontheless.  Violins start it off, and then  <br />             Amy brings in her deep unique lyrics singing about  <br />             her field of paper flowers. <br /> <br />Taking Over Me -  A beautiful piano intro starts this off then <br />                  an awesome powerful guitar part comes in,  <br />                  setting the pace for the song. My favorite <br />                  song off the Fallen album!!  <br /> <br />Hello - Even though the lyrics are kinda on the strange side, <br />        Amy's voice really shines on this one! A sad song though <br />        which is never performed live by the band and it is  <br />        about Amy's little sister who died very young. <br /> <br />My Last Breath - Many people call this the average song of the <br />                 record, but I think its anything but average!  <br />                 Has a synthisizer-techno like intro, then  <br />                 beautiful soothing strings along with an  <br />                 awesome guitar entrance make this song perfect! <br /> <br />Whisper - One of the best wicked guitar riffs accompany this  <br />          song!  At the end of the song also theres a nice  <br />          awesome guitar solo.  Really a head banger!! Great way <br />          to close the album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, I defintley recommend this album to all who enjoy some good rock n roll but not the usual type. This one will blow you away!  It it nothing like you ever heard. And don't forget to pick up Evanescence's new album, \\"The Open Door,\\" which is being released October 3rd.  I'm pretty sure it will be just as amazing as this one, if not, better!!
068987474X|5.0|This book helped me very much. I just didn't get the way men thought. I would think well, this guy seems to really like me and since he's not making any further moves, it must be because he's shy, so I'll call him and let him know I'm interested in seeing him. (That's one scenario.) The few times I asked my father for advice, he would tell me to forget the guys, they sounded like players or commitmentphobes but I didn't understand why. Now I do. HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU reads like a book of guide lines. It's very logical.  It shows you which men's behavior shows that they are crazy about you or not into you. That way you can close the book on the ones who don't appreciate your specialness, and consider only the guys who do. 'Cause you want to be in a relationship with someone who is crazy about you, right? It will save you a lot of time, as well as dignity. (By the way, the guy I called--that was two or three years ago--just finally emailed me a couple of weeks ago. I didn't reply.) The book is also short, quick, funny and enjoyable to read.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|From director Peter Jackson(Who also directed the best movies of all time, Lord of the Rings) comes King Kong. Really, I thought this movie would be stupid and i really didn't want to see. But then one day i got dragged into watching it and when it was done I was like, 'man, that was actually good.' The first hour could have add a little time taken off of it but I thought it was fine, because i love long movies. The part when they are on skull island is the best part in my opinion. Jack Black plays the guy with the camara whos leading expedition(forgot his name in the movie) and does a good job with it. I was really surprised when i learned he was in this movie. Andy Serkis also does the motion for king king like he did for Gollum in LOTR. I didn't really recognize any of the other actors in this movie, but that is fine, cause i like having newer guys play in movies. Naomi Watts does well in her role and so does all the others. The ending is very sad but expected, for those of u oddballs who dont know the story of King Kong, i wont ruin it for ya. <br /> <br />So make sure to watch this movie even if you think its gonna suck casue it is actually good.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />In \\"The Brothers Grimm,\\" director Terry Gilliam and writer Ehren Kruger envision the famed storytellers as two snake-oil charlatans who roam the early 18th Century German countryside using their fame as writers to convince gullible villagers that they can eradicate evil curses (all for a small fee, of course).  Their sleight-of-hand methods, involving ropes and pulleys and a whole host of elaborate disguises and primitive \\"special effects,\\" eventually count for naught when the boys confront an actual enchanted forest filled with mobile trees, diabolical insects and an evil princess frozen in time waiting for that crucial moment when the usurped lives of twelve young maidens will make her young and beautiful again.<br /><br />Gilliam has always been one of the most reliably imaginative and visually inventive of modern filmmakers, so much so that, even when the films themselves didn't amount to much, we could still find much in them to enjoy and appreciate.  Here, however, our hitherto unwavering faith in Gilliam's talent suffers one of its severest trials yet.  In many ways, Gilliam desires to have it both ways in this film; he wants to be iconoclastic in his approach by showing these beloved writers as being mere mortals with feet of clay, yet he also wants to make clear that he believes in all the fantastical elements of the tales by essentially creating one of his own with the Grimm brothers themselves placed front and center as key players.  That might have worked had Gilliam been able to keep his narrative elements in sharper focus.  Too much of the film feels subdued, rambling and disjointed, and although Matt Damon and a fidgety, hyper kinetic Heath Ledger seem to be having a great deal of fun in their roles, they are never able to break through all the nonsense and connect with the audience as characters about whom we can deeply care.  There's some fun to be had in the conflict that develops between the cynical, pragmatic  Damon, representing our modern times, I suppose, and the more fanciful Ledger, who clearly reflects the more imaginative time in which the story takes place, but that theme basically gets lost amid all the confused silliness and special effects-laden overproduction.<br /><br />Thus, despite all the talent involved, \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" turns out to be an empty, joyless, soulless film, a poor tribute both to the fairy tales it endeavors to honor as well as to the men who wrote them.nting our modern times, I suppose, and the more fanciful Ledger, who clearly reflects the more imaginative time in which the story takes place, but that theme basically gets lost amid all the confused silliness and special effects-laden overproduction. <br /> <br />Thus, despite all the talent involved, \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" turns out to be an empty, joyless, soulless film, a poor tribute both to the fairy tales it endeavors to honor as well as to the men who wrote them.
B00005N5S5|4.0|I liked THE TERMINATOR when I originally saw it. I think it was somewhat innovative and Arnold Schwarzenegger was very good as the cyborg that will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance seems to have been inspired by Yul Brynner as the gunslinger robot in WESTWORLD. Brynner's obsessively determined performance was brilliant in that film. The difference here is that you almost begin to empathize with Brynner's obsession as if perhaps he wanted to have been created as a human being and not a robot.  Brynner does have his catharsis. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator has less aspirations and has only a singular purpose in this film. Schwarzenegger's performance is not exactly endearing but he does come across with a certain amount of misplaced aplomb, which adds to his absurdity and fascinating screen presence. Has it really been that many years since this came out!
B000059Z8J|1.0|This is probably great DVD if you're buying it for the nostalgia and want to watch the movie you loved back in the 70s when you were dumber. But to anyone who will be watching the movie for the first time today, it is absolutely horrible. Crazy ridiculous impossible plot with murderous explanation holes (kryptonite? why does that hurt superman again and not ordinary humans?). The real kicker was when he reversed time by spinning the earth backwards.. Oh god... If you finished high school, then this movie isn't for you.    Update:  Okay maybe I was a little bit rough with this review (especially my last few sentences). I apologize for any offense.     I think I'll just sum up what I meant to communicate back in 2006: The plot isn't very believable and the solutions to the problems posed in the movie don't even have a scintilla of sense even, in my opinion, for a superhero movie. Now it isn't very believable that getting bitten by a spider will give you spider powers or that a engineering genius can build an \\"iron\\" suit in his basement but at least the solutions they present to overcome the villains have a foundation in reality with a lot of creative imagination involved. Unfortunately for this movie... turning back time by doing.... *sigh    So if you really enjoy Superman and really enjoyed this movie back in the 70's then you probably will like this DVD. However if you are much younger, like me, and have gotten used to more \\"modern\\" superhero movies then I don't think you will like this movie.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|It SEEMS more energetic and the lyrics are good poetry (gotta read the lyric book, you will not make them out binaurally.)  Ed's quite a poet; can do without the politics.  You want to talk about a reviving album....  Pearl Jam's Yield.  No politics, just a solid album that sounded fresh at the time (and still does).  But that was long ago now, I guess.  You know what was Avante-Garde?  \\"You are\\" off Riot Act.  Make a whole album like that; make the next grunge, whatever it would be called (Trance rock? Techrock?) But, I suppose it would have to come from a band with members still in their 20s.  PJ have had their time.  To compare current work, PJ is not quite as good as RHCP (another older band that is still functioning.)  PJ didn't have as many problems in their past as RHCP, hence they are less interesting, i guess.  Just some theories.....  It's  token PJ energy; it doesn't feel real.
006072448X|4.0|I almost didn't finish this book because I was put off by Eva's initial whiny voice and because I have a hard time taking fiction in the form of a letter seriously - especially when the writer is telling the reader things he obviously already knows.    I ended up putting the book down after about 80 pages. I didn't really care about Eva's marital problems, I wanted to know more about her son (about which I felt guilty after I read her son's speech about how America is addicted to killers), but the book was turning out to be more about her and why she never wanted children - background information that seemed impertinent at the time but adds much to the story.    Eventually, I started reading again, and this time around the book enthralled me. I couldn't put it down. While it took me a week or two to get through the first 100 pages or so, I sailed through the rest of this book in only a few days. Eva's experiences with her son are frightening. That her husband never believes her stories about Kevin's evil doing adds to the horror. And that you eventually sympathize with Eva and understand some of Kevin's points of view (about the meaninglessness of life) can be scary too - because they are both disgusting, but very real, people. This is a must read.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|What can I add to what's been said below?  H. Laser has already said much that I wanted to say.  My very tolerant wife bought this set for me as a birthday gift, but makes me turn it off when she's in the room--Ginger, Jack, and Eric give her a headache.  Well, no marriage is perfect. <br /> <br />Cream gets my vote for the best Rock band ever.  Not that they made no mistakes.  Actually, perhaps 50% of their recorded output is unlistenable (\\"Blue Condition\\"?  What were you guys thinking?) <br /> <br />And yet, with these DVDs, I even enjoyed \\"Toad\\" and(Do I dare admit this in writing?) \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog.\\"  The overproduction that marked some of their studio recordings is thankully missing; It's just the three of them playing their songs.  I had never realized how good a song \\"Deserted Cities\\" was until hearing this version. <br /> <br />I suppose they could have given me a call to ask how to make the reunion concerts better.  I would then have dispensed my wisdom, and told them to play \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses,\\" and \\"Strange Brew\\" or \\"Lawdy Mama.\\"  I'd also have attempted to get Clapton to pick up a Gibson guitar, go back and listen to his absolutely brilliant, singing solo on the live \\"Crossroads,\\" and try to play it more like that, and less like the Strat-Weilding guitar god with the \\"Behind the Sun\\" tone.  And perhaps he could have tracked down the \\"Fool\\"-painted psychadelic-freak-out Gibson.  Last I heard, Todd Rungren owned it.  Perhaps he'd lend it out for a show or two. <br /> <br />Finally--and this is a matter of religious principle with me--\\"White Room\\" is played with a Wah-Wah pedal, or not at all.  (It's my Catholic upbringing coming through, I know.  But you don't eat meat on Fridays during lent, and you don't play \\"White Room\\" without the Wah-Wow-Wah-ah-Wow sound. <br /> <br />Otherwise, I was thrilled that they have reunited for some shows; stunned that Jack and Ginger actually looked happy to be sharing a stage; and ecstatic that Ginger isn't dead.  Although it was he who gave me the biggest surprise:  I (honestly) thought he was doing a funny accent, a la Monty Python, on \\"Pressed Rat.\\"  Turn out, that's how he talks.  AND . . . he wears dark socks when he drums.  Nerd? <br /> <br />Who cares?  Great songs, and great musicians. <br /> <br />See you in another 40 years. <br />
0440237688|5.0|It is a seeming Utopia.  The children are all well mannered.  The adults are content and behave in ways that benefit society.  Everyone knows their place in society and all are content.  It has to be a complete fraud.  This is the world The Giver inhabits.  The society rewards those who emphasize how they are the same as everyone else; differences are not to be discussed.  It would be rude to discuss differences, and there are few differences as it is.<br /><br />Jonas is eleven.  He is soon to turn twelve in The Ceremony of Twelve.  Each December all of the children have a Ceremony graduating them into their next year of life and education and they are granted certain privileges at each step.  In a society of sameness, Jonas is somewhat different.  He is one of the very few with blue eyes and every now and then he sees a flicker of...something...but it doesn't last and he doesn't understand.  At the Ceremony of Twelve all of the new Twelves are appointed their new jobs which they will do for the rest of their lives.  Jonas is set apart even here when he is selected to the Receiver of Memories.  It is the most honored of all occupations and only one person holds the position in the entire community.  It is a great honor.  It is also the event that shows Jonas just how different the Sameness is.<br /><br />Lois Lowry won the Newbery Medal for this book, which is perhaps the highest literary honor for fiction written for children.  The Giver is deserving of this award.  The Giver is written simply and is easy to understand, but there is a real depth to the storytelling and the lesson that Lowry is presenting here.  Lowry has written about a society which has embraced being the same so deeply that any aberrations will be punished (to a greater or lesser extent depending on the violation) and something has been done that the citizens only know a certain amount about themselves and their world.  It is very limited even though everybody believes they are truly happy, and perhaps they are.  But the Sameness comes at a great price: The Receiver is the only individual who truly knows all of what was given up and what the rest of the world holds.  He knows the very good and the very bad that the world has to offer.  It is a crushing weight.  The subtle message as Jonas learns all of this is that it is differences which need to be embraced and should not be something to fear.  Differences are what make life truly interesting and worthwhile.  But there are some out in the world who want to eliminate some differences because it makes them uncomfortable and The Giver is something of an answer to any sort of prejudice and misunderstanding and celebrates those who go out of their comfort zones to really see what differences are.<br /><br />What makes The Giver so remarkable is that it is a novel that works both for adults and for children and is highly readable for both age groups.  Adults can enjoy the book just as much as a child, though perhaps in a different way.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryy, and perhaps they are.

0385336691|1.0|I just finished The Hard Way, and it was.....hard to finish!<br /><br />The first couple of Child's books I read I thought were great but the last two have been horrible. Jack Reacher has become an all-knowing....robotic...boring... character that should be put to rest. The book moves very slowly, the dialogue is nonexistent, and how does a guy who never changes his underwear always get the girl. The only good thing I can say about the book is that it made me laugh occasionally. Unfortunately, the authors intent was not humor. The next time I want to read about a super hero I will buy a comic book and save alot of money.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|APC along with Alice in Chains (among others)manage to convey the most mesmerizing display of human emotions within song structure.  Thirteenth Step is, from top to bottom, one of the most amazing albums I have been fortunate enough to hear.  Maynards voice is firm yet angelic, and the music almost attains perfection.  I cannot say enough about this album, but of course, that means nothing.  Go check it out, you'll be more than satisfied that you did.
0312323867|5.0|In Something Borrowed, Giffin does an exceptional job making the reader identify with Rachel -- despite the fact that she is having an affair with her best friend Darcy Rhone's fiance Dex.  Part of the reason that it works is Giffin's skillful crafting of Darcy's personality.  She is beautiful, but self-centered, shallow and mean.  As the plot unfolds, you can't help but hope that Dex ends up with Rachel and not Darcy.    So when I saw that Giffin was going to explore Darcy's point of view in her second book, I was sort of appalled. I mean, Darcy was horrible in the Something Borrowed. However, in Something Blue Giffin takes her ability to develop her characters to another level.  I loved (in a sadistic way) the first two hundred pages where Darcy receives her comeupance.  As a reader, you can feel a little relief to see that no, things aren't perfect for Darcy anymore and she truly has gotten herself into a situation that her looks can't get her out of.  Yet Giffin manages to develop a character that you can end up rooting for in the end.  Sometime after she arrives in London she does begin to become a better person.  Like other readers, I would have found her transformation a little more believable if it had been a little less of an \\"epiphany.\\"  However, the end result, a Darcy Rhone that readers can cheer for, is worth the jouney.
0345440927|4.0|I like Tracy Hogg...and after reading her first book I was compelled to try this one as well. Although a lot of her wisdom is really common sense, it's always good to get a refresher. It's easy to get caught up in being tired and emotional as the mom of a toddler, so this book made me take a deep breath and re-evaluate my actions. I recommend it to all new moms!
B000GCFO08|5.0|I was very impressed with this movie. From the way it followed the story of the game Silent Hill 1 to the music from the game, everything was almost like I was playing the game all over again. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was they used a woman instead of a man as the main character, but that did not change the story at all. A must-have for any fan of the Silent Hill game series.

0452281881|5.0|I originally read this about six years ago when my boss gave it to me.  Since I figured I HAD to read it, I started the first three pages and discovered that, to my horror, it was all emails.  And about the advertising business.  Figured I'd read 50 pages and fake the rest.  Six hours later, I finished it and laughed out loud all afternoon. <br /> <br />Since then I've given it to at least twenty people in all kinds of careers and they universally loved it and gave it to all their friends. A woman who runs a prominent museum store, a couple of people at my ad agency, a CEO, a President of a cement company, my father, my sisters, a man who owned a prominent research company, his brilliant wife, my husband, an office assistant, a book agent, etc., etc.  They all had the same reaction I don't know why this isn't the #1 Amazon best seller.  I wold say that the chain I started sold at least 100 books.  So buy it everyone, so you can love it too
B000FILW86|4.0|I agree with most of the others that this is a very good Cheap Trick album.  They have stripped away all of the excesses and have focused on strong melodies and plenty of guitar punch.  It's renewed my interest in the band after they lost me in the 80s.  My favorite songs on the album are the last three - \\"Dream the Night Away\\", \\"All Those Years\\", and \\"Decaf\\".  I find that interesting, since most bands stack the best songs at the beginning of the album.  Here's proof that guys in their 50s can still rock!!!
1878424319|5.0|So many books promise to bring happiness in your life, but most turn out to be either convoluted or impossible to follow.  In \\"The Four Agreements\\" Don Miguel Ruiz actually tells you that it will be hard to follow the Four Agreements he puts forth.  While that may be true, it is because they may be major changes in your life, not because they are complex or illogical.    On the contrary, Ruiz lays out the following four conceptually simple ideas:    1. Be impeccable with your word (Impeccable meaning honestly and never with the intent to injure)  2. Don't take anything personally (People come to you with their own baggage and it isn't about you)  3. Don't make assumptions (They are the root of most miscommucication and misunderstanding)  4. Always do your best (Your best is different at different times - apply especially to the first three)    That's it.  Easy to understand, tough to do consistently, but easy to return to after slipping up.  Ruiz makes the point that there will be inevitable slips, but that the important thing is to get back on the proverbial horse.    This is a thought-provoking and inspiring read for those who are looking for a reasonable way to find something that's missing in their lives despite the fact that everything seems to be going fine.  Highly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm sorry to say that I missed this series when it originally aired; however, I'm so glad that I watched the movie SERENITY. Through that medium I found out about the series and made this purchase. I am now, proud to say, a devout fan and have shared the DVD's with friends and family members! I loved getting the background on all the characters (Disk 3), and the series only made the movie more special. BUY THESE DISKS!!! Sci-fi fans won't want to miss out on this collection.

B00005JOQS|4.0|This is a pretty good movie.<br /><br />I think the biggest and most important thing is that Brandon Routh makes a great Superman.  Maybe it's his unknown status, maybe it's his lookalike affinity with Christopher Reeves, but he fits and plays the iconic character pretty much to the T.<br /><br />The other characters, not so much, but that doesn't necessarily mean they were bad.  Kevin Spacey was a brilliant Lex Luthor, but Spacey's bad misfortune is to have a very recognizable face.  He's... Kevin Spacey.  However, the baldness suited him and he really did seem to move around comfortably in Luthor's shoes, so to speak... sometimes acting very chillingly.  Kate Bosworth did a good Lois Lane, but I must say that this movie really made me dislike the character.<br /><br />I don't remember Kitty from anywhere, but that is one great character, especially as a foil to Luthor.  Her ditziness can get annoying, but the way it helps one underestimate her character is actually one of the better parts of the movie.  I can say that Kitty stole the show with this one, though nobody else ever mentions her.<br /><br />Many people told me this movie was too long before I went to see it, but it's really not.  I hardly noticed the playlength.  That, to me, is a sign of a good, well-paced movie.  I didn't really get too much into story as a whole or even the action, it was mostly the characters and especially the exploration of the very iconography that interested me.  I think the most commonly seen image in this movie is Superman holding the weight of the world... various forms of the image \\"the world\\"... on his shoulders.  It's a very intriguing image, I must say.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B000EULJLU|3.0|Firstly, I understand the haters who say Tool has too much \\"filler\\" songs. I can see the point when someone says there is 5 minutes of ambient noise going on. And for sure I can agree with those who say 5 years between albums is f*ing rediculous. <br /> <br />But this is not just music, people. Tool is ART. Art can't be safe(at least great art). Art has to MOVE you. It has to make you THINK. If it didn't, it would not be art. It would be Limp Bizkit. <br /> <br />The visual essence of Tool is just as important as the music part. Maynard James Keenan is not the only member in Tool, you know? Danney Carey is one of(if not THE)best drummers alive today. Not only does he play traditional drums(wood shells, metal cymbals, wooden drum sticks, etc....), but he also uses electronic percussion and sampling WHILST still playing regualr drumbeats! Slipknot has Sid and Craig to do what DC does with two hands and two feet. <br /> <br />Justin Chancellor is a great \\"pocket\\" bass player. Just enough originality to contribute but definatly along for the ride. I've met him, he is a very reserved english gentleman. <br /> <br />Adam Jones is a genius. If you ask me ADAM JONES is the reason Tool is famous. He contributes some of the most interesting and terrifying original art we've seen in a long time. Think of Tool. Now think how less interesting they would be without the visual presence. That's Adam's handywork. As a guitar player of 18 years myself, i can appreciate what he does on the guitar. Just fabulous <br /> <br />10,000 days is not their best album.(That goes to Aenema, for me) and honestly right now all i listen to is Vicarious and The Pot. But i did not care for Lateralus at first and it is great to me now. <br /> <br />So if you take anything away from this review, take away this: Use Tool music as a way to learn new things. experience life. enjoy what little time we have left on the earth before ol' Georgie Dubya gets us blown away by the Iranians. <br /> <br />THINK FOR YOURSELF...............QUESTION AUTHORITY
B00005U122|5.0|This is so far the best DVD available of Pink Floyd music (the old ones).  Roger Waters did what Pink Floyd (current) never did before, giving you the real psychodelic music.  The scene of Shine On your Crazy Diamond, where shown Syd's face is to me the best part of the show.  No question about PULSE and IN THE FLESH, both are great concerts but IN THE FLESH is more deep in sound and feeling.  Just listen the first track \\"In the flesh?\\" it will take you to your young ages with the wall.

It was mildly interesting.<br /><br />\\"Grand Prix: Challenge of Champions\\" is a vintage look at the filming done in Monaco. This featurette is done in that oh-so-60's film style. You can't help but love it.<br /><br />Lemans (the race, not the film) fans, there's something for you too... Check out the GT40 camera cars in the \\"making of\\" documentary!!! :)
B000FVQYYK|5.0|this is very different from Absolution, and while it may not top my 4th favorite album of all time, it may be 5th. I love the politics in this, even if i am a bloody American. the futuristic sound just adds to Muse's epic rock. I do miss the ballads of Absolution though
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The video quality and 5.1 sound rock.  Bright colors, looks great on the big screen, and reminds me of the On an Island Gilmour a few months back.  Highly recommend for fans or newbies.  The extras are way cool, too!
B000FA57RG|5.0|AFTER 24 YEARS OF A SUCCESFUL CAREER MADONNA RELEASES THIS DVD/CD DOCUMENT OF HER PAST TOUR \\"REINVENTION TOUR\\", HERE SHE SHOW US HER PERSONAL, SPIRITUAL, MUSICAL CHANGES LIKE ONLY SHE CAN DO, THERE`S NO DOUBT SHE`S THE GREATEST POP SUPERSTAR, WE ARE GLAD TO SEE HER AT HER BEST & MORE MATURE. VIVA LA DIVA!
B000EGCITG|5.0|After listening to samples of the CD from Amazon, I thought that it would be worth getting this album.  AND I WAS RIGHT!  It is absolutely fantastic.  For some reason, it sounds better than the samples ;p! <br />My favourite songs have to be: Fingers (a bonus track), I Have Seen The Rain (sung by Pink & her Daddy), I Got Money Now, U + Ur Hand, Cuz I Can and Dear Mr. President.  Actually all the songs are good except for \\"The One That Got Away\\".  I feel as if that song doesn't really fit into this BRILLIANT album. <br /> <br />I highly recomend buying this CD as it is fantastic, has a mixture of differnet kinds of songs (ROCK, BALLADS) and Pink sings great!
B000FFJ85I|4.0|A little Pop-py at a first listen but after a few listens I am hooked. A must buy for any AFI fan.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The audio quality of this DVD is so incredible, it makes Pulse absolutely worth the wait. And the visuals just blow my eyes out of the back of my head. The lights seem to project from my television screen and into the living room, flooding the walls around me with an intense glow.  <br /> <br />Very well done guys. <br /> <br />Makes me wish I could go back in time to those two amazing nights I got to spend with the Floyd in Oakland so long ago. <br /> <br />I have over forty great concerts in my DVD collection and believe me...this one is indispensable. <br /> <br />Get it immediately. <br /> <br />
B000BTC5LW|3.0|A great sounding, looking DVD    but its missing one thing  the madman,  the poet  the heart  of Pink  Floyd    Roger  Waters   <br />In  the Flesh  is  much  better !
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is a gorgeous record.  Sold from first song to last.  I think this is a better record than Antics.  Some might say they've riped off other artists from the past, but who doesn't learn from their influences?  That is vital to art.  That is how something new is made; by building on the past.  Turn On the Bright Lights has certainly stood up over the years and it still amazes me.
B00005JPE7|5.0|Back in July, soon after this film was announced, I happened upon this page and found a review (yes, a review, six months prior to the release of the film and before a trailer was even officially released) trashing this film.  This is nothing new at Amazon: people bashing things they have not seen because they did not like a previous film, the actor in it, or just think the movie looks bad or is somehow a bad idea.  I wrote a response - not a review of the film, but a response to the insulting review that the writer thought was so clever (yeah, as if making fun of a \\"Rocky\\" sequel is both original and clever) - in which I urged people like this to wait until the film is released before they write such things.  I said the movie may or may not suck, but wait and see it first.  Maybe that day I was just fed up with seeing premature reviews that can not actually be trusted by Amazon readers popping up everywhere.  But the good news is that reviewer and all the scoffers can get ready to eat their words.  Not only was \\"Rocky\\" a terrific movie in my opinion, but the critics love it too.  Over at rottentomatoes.com, the movie review website that comes up with an average score for a film based on all the reviews from the nations top 200+ critic, \\"Rocky Balboa\\" is at 80%, meaning out of those critics' reviews, 80% have been favorable.  This may sound like no small feat, but for a movie that everyone laughed off and seemed doomed from the start - at least from a critical perspective - it is damn good.  Actually, it is damn good by any standard.  80% actually places it among the better reviewed movies of there year (critics don't like quite a few movies - 80% and above is a somewhat elite bunch).   <br /> <br />See MCW; should have waited... <br /> <br />But forget all that.  Those stats are really just semantics.  The real question is, will fans and non fans alike be able to be swept up again by Rocky after all these years and a few rote sequels that have diminished the memoryof the original, and just how great and effective a film it was? <br /> <br />The answer is a resounding and surprised 'YES!'  And the reason why:  Sylvester Stallone.  As writer, director, and star - and the guy hanging it all on the line - mainly meaning his dignity if this thing is the flop most people are waiting to see - this movie is all his.  That this movie inspires and excites and entertains to such a large, unexpected degree, means the kudos then should be all his as well.  All of Rocky's speeches in the film about life hitting hard, having to hit back, how many hits can you take and keep comin', doing what is right for you, listening to your heart become a huge metaphor for Stallone and his reviving of this character.  I won't spoil Rocky's outcome in the film's main event, but Stallone himself wins big by following those credos. <br /> <br />Confession time:  I am not a huge \\"Rocky\\" fan.  I remember loving the first one, but it has been years since I have seen it.  I hated the last two and the first two sequels were okay at the time when I was a young kid, but seem pretty much a relic of their time to me now.  Also I am a jaded-as-hell movie-goer when it comes to underdog sports movies.  They are all the same and I can not think of one, supposedly inspirational, spots flick that ever affected me. (This does not include movies like \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" (one of my all time favorites), and the like in which a sport in the film is secondary to the actual story being told.  I'm talking about all these interchangeable underdog flicks that we forget which one is which as soon as a new one comes out which, in the last year and a half alone includes \\"Invincible,\\" \\"Gridiron Gang,\\" \\"We Are Marshall,\\" \\"Glory Road,\\" \\"Coach Carter,\\" \\"Miracle,\\" \\"Friday Night Lights,\\" \\"The Rookie,\\" and so many more I couldn't possibly name them all.  Come on, admit it; even if you are a sucker for these kinds of films - and I'm not saying they are all bad, some are good, just that there are too many of them and they are all usually similar and uninspired - you know they all play the same card the same way.  The sad thing is we have great, old-school sport films like \\"Rocky\\" and \\"Hoosiers\\" to thank for this ungodly influx of these films.)  <br /> <br />Watching the new \\"Rocky\\" film, I may have figured out why these movies always leave me so cold, beyond the fact that they are all so similar.  I never felt like I knew any of the cookie-cutter characters in most of those films (I knew them as caricatures from dozens of like movies, but I never thought of them as anything resembling real people - just composites of sport-film clichés), I never felt like I cared much what happened to them because I didn't know them, and I figured we all sort of know what the outcome will be (any number of standard variations on coming from behind to win, losing but learning the all-important life lesson so by default one wins, or tragedy strikes and tears are supposed to swell as the booming score does - very few surprises or anything original in most of these movies).  What Sylvester Stallone does with his script for this film changed all that.  It doesn't exactly avoid all the old chestnuts of sport film lore, but he turns them on their ear just enough.  Even if he didn't, that is not the films biggest feat.  No it's biggest feat is that as a viewer you feel so sucked into the film, caring so much about this character.  You can relate to him.  And even though most of our life experiences don't exactly parallel Rocky's plight, his inner struggle - which he explains in a brief but oh-so effective speech to his son - is something both inspirational and that hits so close to home, whatever your fears, regrets and proud moments may be.   <br /> <br />And don't forget, WE DO KNOW Rocky!  The world knows Rocky.  Watching the bout in this film felt like watching an actual fight you have something invested in.  You care about the outcome because you care about the fighter.Just like a real fight.  You feel invested in it.  From the training montage on, the audience reacted verbally and with claps, and - in a few moments - tears, to everything Rocky did.  I can't begin to say how surprised I am that Stallone was able to pull this thing off.  What sounded like a joke, and any easy target for jokes, from the get-go, turns out to be one of the most exciting (save for a maybe too-long and indulgent first half an hour or so) and freshest feeling films of the year.  It's so old fashioned it almost feels new again.  It's classic.   <br /> <br />Sly has always been a better actor than he is given credit for.  It will be just as easy for his detractors to pick apart his performance here, but if you get it; what he is doing, what Rocky means to him as a metaphor and what he is trying to give the fans of the series, he is nothing short of charming - often extraordinary - in his performance.  <br /> <br />I can not tell you how surprised I am by this film.  It may not work so effectively on you if you don't see it with a theatre audience that roared as loud as the crowd in the movie itself; or if you are too cynical and just looking to find a reason to hate this film you may find them.  But I - a jaded sport-film hater - found myself choked up a few times, on the edge of my seat others, and applauding like an idiot in hopes a fictional character would just be able to stand in a ring for a few rounds.   <br /> <br />It is surprising and exciting just how pumped up this movie gets you.  Rocky is again the underdog - and so, as I said earlier, is Stallone.  You want Rocky to win just as much as you want Stallone himself to be triumphant.  Just as Rocky has been counted out in the ring, so has Stallone as a serious actor.  You begin to realize you are rooting as much for Stallone as for the character he has created.  And the excitement of seeing them both fighting their way back is at times an exhilarating - and emotional - experience. <br /> <br />So, some scoffed at the idea of this sequel, saying things like 'let the character die with dignity.'  The true indignity would be to have allowed this franchise to go out with the tepid \\"Rocky V,\\" which was about as far from what made the original so great as the series ever got.  With \\"Rocky Balboa,\\" not only does Sly sign off with dignity, but he leaves the series - and the character - with a renewed vigor and greatness and humanity that has not been seen since the original.  And this one may be even more inspiring in its message. <br /> <br />And Sly, oh yeah, he's still got it.  And, yes, he's in great shape for 60.  Hell, great shape for 30. <br />   <br />Hate if you must, but you are missing out.  Hear me when I say this - from a guy who is not a fan of sports movies:  I truly believe \\"Rocky Balboa\\" is one of the best films of the year.  It may technically not be all that original, but it is one of the best, most exciting, entertaining, feel-good times you will have at a movie all year.  Even my girlfriend was duckin' and jabbin' in her seat and clapping and crying with the rest of the true \\"Roco\\" fans - and she'd never seen one \\"Rocky\\" film in her life. <br />  <br />All together now:  Rocky!  Rocky!  Rocky!  Rocky!  ................. <br /> <br />
B00004Z400|5.0|Its not easy for me to say this is their best record(considering their body of work) but it is.  Around the Fur is my second favorite and then the self titled.  White Pony is Deftones at their very best(and most diverse).  This record was probaly the most difficult for them to finsh from what I've read.  Chino's lyrics here are so dynamic and unique.  Absolutely artistic.  This is the best band, and this is their best record, to me.  I saw them 3 or 4 times when they toured for this record and I'll never be the same.  Thank God.
B000068IEU|2.0|After hearing so much about this film, I came across it in a Blockbuster and rented it.  I was somewhat disappointed with the film.  The idea behind it is good, but it just didn't live up to the standards that people make it seem to have.  The music is just, how do I put it, wrong.  It simply doesn't fit.  A hapy-pitched disco song during a chase through the woods?  Come on, they could've done better than that.  Overall, it's worth seeing once, and only worth renting, not buying.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|I went into Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with high expectations. Comparisons to the Gene Wilder original aside, Burton had promised a darker movie that was truer to Roald Dahl's classic book. With modern special effects, that sounded like something to experience.<br /><br />The good news is that if you've read the novel, this flick does incorporate many of the elements that the 70s version left out. You get your Indian Prince story, a much grander boat ride down the river of chocolate, and the infamous scene in the nut room. Charlie's father is also back in the story now, and has his job in the toothpaste factory.<br /><br />But then the flick takes some odd turns of its own. The Oompa-Loompa songs use the original lyrics from the novel, but take off in a very garish direction that's neither good nor bad, just...bizzare. Johnny Depp, for all the critical acclaim he's had playing eccentric characters, feels rather forced here. He's distinctive and amusing, but I can't help but feel Gene Wilder was closer to what Dahl envisioned. Finally, the movie tacks on a very sappy subplot about Wonka's dentist father and his parental issues. For all that Burton said about making this movie darker, these parts felt as sugary as the happy ending in the original.<br /><br />I like the Burton version, but oddly enough I still find the 70s original to be a truer interpretation of the whimsical and discomforting world Dahl created. The best effort would probably be a mix of both, and it might be worth another remake 20 more years down the road to see that happen. This deluxe version has some okay extras, but not enough to justify the price tag difference if you see the bare-bones one significantly cheaper. Fans will want both versions for comparisons, families are probably better off investing in the 70s version and saving this one for a rental.
0966638328|5.0|The Pantone Guide to Communicating with Color presents a foundation of basic color theory and then moves on to explain how individual colors, and their combinations, can evoke different responeses from the viewer.  There are many photos to serve as examples so that you see the effects for yourself.  The book does an excellent job of giving enough information to be useful without bogging the reader down with a lot of dry academic theory that would be of little practical use.  In addition, there are Pantone color codes given for all of the specific color combinations shown for ease of use if you will be using professional printing services.  <br /> <br />In summary, this is an excellent resource.  It conveys valuable information about colors and how they effect people in a clear and concise way.  I highly recommend it for everyone with an interest in the subject matter.
0316168815|5.0|I finished this book two days ago and its characters are still haunting me. Alice Sebold created a masterpiece with this book. Once I was finished with this book I kept expecting to pass Susie's family on the street, they were so thoroughly and beautifully developed. The reader even manages to pity the killer, because Sebold expresses his humanity somehow amid all the horror he commits. This book is just plain beautiful.
B000002J09|1.0|I hate Led Zeppelin. They really suck and they are one of the most overrated and stupidest bands in history. They are just a joke and never made anything decent. Even Metallica and Nirvana<br /><br />are better than Zeppelin. Don't buy this album or throw it away,<br /><br />it's just as bad as BROTHERS IN ARMS of Dire Straits.<br /><br />Buy Metallica, Foreigner 4, Love Over Gold, and Nirvana Nevermind insted.<br /><br />Let It Be.
B000B5XOY8|3.0|... what really saves this movie is the casting of Jack Nicholson as \\"The Joker\\"... a better choice for Batman back in '89 would have probably been Alec Baldwin (when he was still in shape).
B000002H97|5.0|WOW! THIS METALLICA ALBUM NEEDS TO DESERVE MORE THAN 5 STARS. IT'S REALLY GREAT AND HAS SOME TERRIFIC SONGS IN ENTER SANDMAN, UNFORGIVEN, AND GOD THAT FAILED. GET THIS ALONG WITH NIRVANA NEVERMIND BUT AVOID BROTHERS IN ARMS FROM DIRE STRAITS WHICH SUCKED HARD. THANKS.
0553801503|5.0|It seems to me that most negative reviewers are so disappointed by not finding what they hoped to see that they fail to notice what the book in fact is: a very good transition piece to the next stage of the series. I especially enjoyed the chapters on Dorne and the Iron Islands, both of which helped to flesh out Westros.     I shudder to think what these negative reviewers would have written for the middle book of the Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers. Imagine the cries of dismay at leaving Gandalf and company for half of a book simply to focus on Frodo and Samwise!    Although John Lee is not terrible on the audio book, he does have a tough time trying to follow in the footsteps of the great Roy Dotrice.    I hope the GRR Martin is able to finish the series within the decade!
B00004Y6NX|2.0|I'm sick of this...people really love the most popular Dire Straits and they suck. Making Movies is just as bad as Brothers <br />in Arms and has some of the worst songs in 'Hand in hand'. It's just a dumb one. This deserves 2 because 'Tunnel of Love', and 'Expresso Love' are the great. Go get Love Over Gold or Metallica Black Album insted. <br /> <br />1 more thing, overrated.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens puts a lump in my throat.... <br /> <br />I feel both sad and happy when I listen to either Illinois, Michigan or any of the great songs this wonderful man has written. <br />Look for Lord God Bird, a song he wrote for NPR about Arkansas... <br /> <br />Sufjan is an indescribable feeling to me....
B00004Y6NP|1.0|Ooh man, I can't tell you how awful this album is, it's really bad. I was just listening to it 1-5 and man, this album is really <br />really bad. It has several really awful cuts depart from 'So Far Away'. 'Why Worry' is one of the worst, most dull songs I have ever heard with 8 dull sad minutes. It's so retarted. I don't like it, I wish you could throw this in your trash can and go <br />get the 1991 Dire Straits album insted. Even Metallica is better <br />than this so stay away from this awful album. Thanks.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|A great solid cd.  I will agree that the sequencing is a bit weird.  Certain songs are not stacked up against each other very well and they dont really run into each other very well. <br />Other than that though this is a wonderful cd.  I would have left 4 songs off of it: <br />Death of a Martian (except the ending) <br />Especially in Michigan (listening to AK sing about mother ducks is just too much even for this diehard) <br />She Looks to Me (it has one of my favorite lyrics, but the song as a whole is nothing special) <br />Hard to Concentrate( Just completely uneccessary on this cd) <br /> <br />Four duds out of 28 songs is really not too bad.  Probably one of the best cd's of the year, and certainly one of the best the peppers have ever done.   <br /> <br />Key Tracks: <br /> <br />Torture Me: this song just sums up everything (the will of god is standing still...) <br /> <br />Warlocks; nice and subtle funk...rip billy preston (i've got a rockapotamus in my hand) <br /> <br />Hey: speaks to me when i am looking back on everything i thought i was (I used to be so full of my confidence...) <br /> <br />WET SAND: best slower song written in a long time (the disrepair of norma jean could not compair to your routine) <br /> <br />Animal Bar: karumba australia (you will HATE it at first...just listen again!) <br /> <br />Turn it Again: sounds fresh like one of their live jams...I love it. (people call out Frusciante on this...I say listen to Chad) <br /> <br />Desecration Smile: just a nice driving song... (we could all come up with something new to be destroyed...) <br /> <br />I really could probably list the rest of them...but I wont. <br /> <br />Great cd... <br />
B000F1IQNM|1.0|I bought this movie expecting greatness from a collaboration from Colin Firth, Emma Thompson,& Angela Landsbury. <br /> <br />I was terribly disappointed with the outcome.  The message to children is really bad and fantatious. <br /> <br />I will not let any children in my household watch it and do not recommend it.
B000002I53|5.0|A classic, I'm happy to have in my collection.
B000E97HIA|5.0|I have loved Prince from his very first album, (when I was in my twenties,)until now. THE MAN CAN DO NO WRONG. Of course there are songs he has done that I do not care for,(very few) \\"BUT\\"  who cares. he is  a genius.There is some redemption in all of his songs.. ... Black Sweat, The Dance ,Get on the Boat, are overwhelming,they take your breath away. <br />The 3121 Album is just astounding..He and Stevie Wonder are the two most AWESOME artist I can think of. They think so very deep, in music and lyric.I consider them blessings from GOD.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Some drama on television is geared at adults while others focus on the teenage/young adult crowd.  Everwood was one of the few that resonated with both thanks to brilliant casting and better acting.  Witty, touching, original, and sincere, Everwood doesn't pander or preach as it expresses to us the importance of family and how you should never neglect that love. <br /> <br />Four seasons was too short for a show of this quality, but it's not the first wonderful show to be lost so soon.  The first season DVDs help ease that insult and injury.  I hope the last three seasons will be released soon.
B0000DIJO2|4.0|It was great to hear the BG's sound the same as they did 20 years ago although looking like we all do with 20 years added on to our youth.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A great premise with increadible character development.  I hope daily that Joss will be able to continue the series in either TV/Movie/or book format.
1401302378|5.0|This book illustrates why WIRED is one of the most important magazines being published today. Fresh thoughts, cool innovations and smart ideas presented in an approachable manner. Kudos to Chris for not only this book but for such a fantastic magazine!
B000FVQYYK|4.0|Some music review sites trash-talked this album, which is so typical. Music critics who are unable to take an album for what it is in itself love to compare later releases to a band's greatest achievements. I do agree this album is not as good as Muse' previous releases such as Origin Of Symmetry and Absolution, but, taken by itself, it is still an amazing and wonderful piece of music artistry. Admittedly, I love the harder rifs and rhythms of the track 'Assassin' as opposed to lighter tracks like 'Invincible' but it also this flow between hard and soft that adds to experience. I also love the very Xanadu-esque opening. I can't wait to go see and hear these songs played live. It will be epic.
B000002KOO|5.0|This album shows what a great band Fleetwood Mac could have been, had they stuck to the bluezie-rock mix that made them so cool back in 1969; the Madge cuts are just killer. The CD sounds just like my LP, and it rocks. <br />Buy it, and forget Don't stop thinkn' about tomorrow. You'll be glad you did....
B000EAT246|3.0|The always present dichotomy between the bad guy who defies the rules and threatens to alter the establishment, and the good guy who lives according to preserve the civilized employment about the military weapons is the central focus of this entertained movie with great special effects on LA. skies.<br /><br />At the historic moment it was released the emotional shock was electrifying, because of the mesmerizing characterization of Malcom Mac Dowell (Clockwise orange) as the embodiment of the evilness has always been of first-rate. On the side of the good guy we may watch to Rob Scheider widely known around the world by the famous movie \\"Jaws.\\"
B00005JOQ9|1.0|I saw this film as it was recommended to me by a friend but I have to say now having seen it I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. To say that it's not for the faint hearted is putting it mildly I'm not sure who could watch this and actually enjoy it. It oversteps the bounds of a normal horror flick by a country mile and lands in territory normally reserved for people with severe Psychiatric disorders. The film fails to concentrate on any form of a story and loses itself in as many ways to mutilate a person as possible. You will certainly feel like taking a shower after watching this and probably never consider travelling to eastern Europe again. You have been warned.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I've never been so moved by watching a concert on a television. Somehow the soul of this performance transcends beyond the pixels of the TV.  <br /> <br />I've been waiting for years for this DVD to come out and finally, after the long wait it's here.  This is with out a doubt one of the best concerts to have ever been put on. Even after all these years PULSE still sets the bar for brilliance in showmanship, musical genius and theatrics. If you have never seen this I feel very sorry for you. There are no adjectives in the English dictionary to describe this concert. It just has to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br />This concert took me away and brought me to a place I've never been to. The atmosphere and magnitude of it all is almost uncanny, but Pink Floyd made it a reality. I will treasure this DVD for years to come.
B00006FM77|5.0|I remember the first album I got in 1969 as a 9 year old kid - Chicago I.  My dad played in a local dance band and I was raised on a lot of jazz along with the rock and roll I heard on the radio.  When I heard Chicago, I had the best of both worlds. <br /> <br />I never got Live at Carnegie Hall when it first came out.  I remember hearing that the band didn't particularly care for it and that the recording was not that great.  However, when I saw the remaster on CD I jumped on it.  These 4 CD's focus on the early power and greatness of the band - the genius of Terry Kath, in your face bass playing by Peter Cetera, great piano from Robert Lamm, awesome drumming by Danny Seraphine and the amazing horn section of James Pankow, Lee Loughnane and Walter Parazaider.  The material covered is from the first 3 Chicago double albums.  There is too much good stuff to mention.  The power of the band is amazing and the improvisation by Walt and Terry is incredible - see how many snippets of other songs you can hear during \\"Purples\\" and \\"It Better End Soon\\" flute solo. <br />Chicago was my FAVORITE band during the Kath years.  While I understand the market they are catering to today, I left it behind and have always focused on the jazz-rock side of the band.  This is a GREAT chronicle of this era.  Thank you Rhino and thanks to all 7 guys in Chicago for a legacy that left a lasting impression on this fan!!!!  Buy it!!!!
B000003C2U|4.0|A wonderful display of true understanding of Death Metal. Chuck and the rest of Death seem to know how Death Metal should be. This album will kick you into overdrive with it's wonderful display of fast-paced music and death-grunt style of vocals. The tracks on Human don't run a little bit together like other Death albums, the tracks all have traits that set it apart from the others. The album even features a great track called Cosmic Sea that is only music and samples. This track shows that Death really wanted to move the genre foward and show people new tricks that Death Metal is capable of. Another great feature on the album is the sound quality. The sound  quality is very raw(only Cosmic Sea is really mixed) and that shows the talent Death has. The only real problem with the album is that the first two tracks don't introduce the album well, being as those two tracks are no good. Aside from that, Death delivers music that will have you head banging all day long. If you love Death Metal, you'll love this album.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Bought it the day it was released. $15 at Ciruit City. Are you kidding me? This is one of the great bargains of all time! The concert alone is 2 1/2 hours of great music for $15!! Stop whining about the extra features. Don't watch them. The encore 3-song set alone is worth the price of the dvd. Also, stop whining about Roger Waters not being there. If he wasn't such a self-centered maniac the band would probably still be playing. All in all major credit to PF for practically giving the thing away.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is it. This is the best album of all time. I have heard nothing better than this album. I am a HUGE Tool fan I can say that this album is a like fresh air to me. Tool's albums Opiate, Undertow and Aenima were good but, you could see small details that make the albums alike but, Lateralus introduces amazing new things. The album is set upon golden wings with the opening track known as \\"The Grudge\\". The track(like most of the album) is very spacey and hypnotic. The tracks after it set a mood to the album, dark and very wise. The next key track is track number 5, called Schism. Tool won a lot of awards for this song, I think. It is the perfect combination of guitars, drums, bass and vocals and has really good lyrics. \\"Cold silence has a tendency to apathy any sense of compassion\\" A lyric from Schism, cool. Anyway, the next two tracks kind of form one song track #6 called Parabol and track #7 called Parabola. These two songs are best for their lyrics and their guitar work from the guitar god, Adam Jones. Track #8, Ticks and Leeches is very heavy and takes a break from all the spacey content on the album. The drum work in this song is amazing and it flows with the good works of Maynard, Adam and Justin. The track that makes the album really stand out is track #9, Lateralus. It seems to send you into a world that Tool has made for you, filled with wonder and imagination. The CD then breaks into a bit of a rest in track 10 and relaxes you and takes you on another journey on track 11, Relfection. The album closes with the music only track Triad and the very odd spoken track about Area 51 and it's contents on Fapp De Oiad. This album is excellent and I think you need to hear it to believe just how good it is.
B0009V92UY|4.0|I was amazed none of the Santana-followers took the effort to review this album. Released in 1979, it must be his last of the seventies. And, surely compared to the music he made in the following decade, it's a good one.  <br />Santana is still under the influence of Sri Chinmoy, who introduces the first track by way of meditating. Well, rest assured: it could have been worse. This moody opening gradually takes on a jazzier or funkier rhythm, with songs that sound fresh and sparkling (Jim Jeannie, Transformation Day, Cry Of The Wilderness, Free As The Morning Sun), haunting (Oneness) and even downright kitsch (Silver Dreams). The guitarplaying may be trademark Santana, but it never becomes the routinejob Carlos displays on many albums following this one. Better still: the master is - with the exception of the boring accoustic track Golden Dawn - in top shape!
B000000H66|4.0|OMG..where to begin...this was my first Death album and I was blown away. All musicans involved in this album are VERY talented and the writing for the songs is very well done. Time and effort was put into this record, heart and soul. The vocals are what to expect of Death, death grunt and rages that go well with the fast-paced, deadly music in the back that will make your head bang until you get whiplash and beyond. The lyrics seem to be very soulful and thoughtful, the lyrics seem to discuss mental and soulful conflict which is a nice change for theDeath Metal genre. The only real problem with the album is that the songs sound a little alike but, that thought gets pushed out of your head and replaced by epic Death Metal tunes. Now, a warning, if you are not into Death Metal, this album is not for you but, if you love a good Death Metal album, this one's for you! I loved the album!
0375507256|2.0|This book has received more hype and awards than can be imagined so  I bought it on the off chance it was going to be a good read, or at least, comparable to \\"Life of Pi\\" or \\"Extremely loud and incredibly close.\\" Or maybe surpassing something like \\"The Time Travellers Wife\\" which seemed to have gathered acolades from the same sources. <br /> <br />But instead, this book was a tiresomly long thing to read. It is divided into several subsections, ranging through time with what is reported to be a 'loose thread' through it all, but since it jumps through journals, books, movies and geography its better just to say there is something linking each section to the previous, but nothing linking all.  <br /> <br />I found it very hard to get into with the first 2 chapters/section containing not very interesting characters or plots. It started to pick up slightly by the third section, but by then, this book was beginning to feel like a marketing tool for the author: \\"Look at how talented I am! I can write different genre's!\\" Persevering through the other sections just cemented this impression. <br /> <br />And never did the book's pace never really pick up and become's simply unputdownable. In fact, after 2 weeks of painfully slogging through a few pages a night, I finally had enough - I had 10 other books I wanted to read and this was taking to long! So I packed away my excuses and read a section a night until it was finished - afterall, the book isn't badly written, its just tedious and the plot lines aren't particularly interesting. <br /> <br />Mericifully the sections (going backwards now) were shorter than those going forward, but I kept hoping for some spark, some revelation than unified these seperate sections and gave the book bit of a purpose. I was disappointed - such a connection was never made. <br /> <br />I'd be hard pressed to recommend this book to anyone. It's nicely written, but lacking in substance and any compelling reason to read it. There are far cleverer, interesting and readable books on the market (such as those mentioned in the first paragraph) and I would probably steer people to those books first if looking for an 'exciting new author/style.'
B000DWMN2S|5.0|My wife picked up \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" for me one day.  She said she saw the DVD cover and thought that it looked right up my alley with its goggle-eyed Elijah Wood and the glaringly yellow background.  I couldn't tell her that I'd seen the flick sitting at the rental place for some time and always passed over it BECAUSE of the goggle-eyed Wood.  However, to my surprise this is one of the best films I've ever watched.<br /><br />It tells the tale of Jonathan Safran Foer's quest to find a woman who saved his grandfather from the Holocaust so many years ago.  Wood's character is very quirky, collecting odds and ends from different periods in his life in Ziploc bags and sticking them to a labeled wall full of family pictures.  He heads for the Ukraine and the almost mythical town of Odessa.  Once in the Ukraine, he meets up with his tour guide, Alex, a hip-hopping cool cat played with charm and perfect schtick by Eugene Hutz.  Along for the ride is Alex's grandfather and his grandfather's seeing-eye b*#$h, Sammy Davis, Jr., Jr.  Don't worry about the dog's weird name, it's hilariously explained in the film.<br /><br />As they make the trip to Odessa, first-time director Liev Schreiber creates and develops his tale with tender humor, moving flashbacks, and Hutz' goofy flair.  He uses wonderful visuals, vibrant and sublime colors, and key moments of silence to progress the story.<br /><br />I don't want to give away much more than the little bit I have.  Just know that Wood's character and his companions grow in heart and mind as the story rolls along.  Hutz' grandfather plays a key and moving role in the film, and it's hinted at until the very end of the movie.<br /><br />I'll be a man and say that this film brought me to tears.  I laughed out loud at times, stared in awe at others.  This is a wonderful work of art and I highly suggest it to anyone who has ever wanted to run the gamut of emotions while watching a film.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I Just received and watched the Pulse DVD. I have to say it is the best Pink Floyd performances I have ever seen. The next best thing to a front row seat!

0140187537|2.0|i found this to be a very disappointing book from an author of steinbeck's quality. the characters are paper thin. what drives the protagonist from good to evil is unclear at best. yes his family wants more from him, but who doesn't face that. the interesting point is that as he turns on the townspeople, many of them, as a result of recognizing his goodness, begin to reward him. this particularly true of the two characters he damages the most. then, even after he learns what they have done for him, he appears to feel no remorse. only after his son shows the same traits does he overreact and attempt something totally unexpected. what saves him is the integrity of his daughter.<br /><br />all of this seems contrived. i had no strong feelings for any of the characters. they are driven by greed with no regard for their fellow man. ethan hawley, who appears to be above the rest in the beginning, ends up the worst of the lot.<br /><br />bottomline, this is low quality steinbeck. why waste your time here when you can read \\"east of eden\\", \\"the wayward bus\\",  \\"grapes of wrath\\", or many of his short novels.
B0002W18MU|5.0|I'm just over 40 years old and almost every childhood memory I possess is set to a Johnny Cash soundtrack.  My Dad loved him and that love is something we share, even though my Dad has been gone for years.<br /><br /> I'm not a music critic, and I wouldn't presume to comment on the technical elements of the songs on this album, but I will say that there is no music being made today that approaches Johnny's ability to capture the heights and depths of the human experience.  Even though his voice is often weaker than that which I remember from my youth as being something approaching the voice of God, there is still a power and grace within it that can not be matched or even approximated.  If you know anything about Johnny Cash or have ever enjoyed any of his music, you won't regret buying this CD.  It's not happy, dance-around stuff, but it is truly moving and great.  All I can say is, \\"Thank God for Rick Rubin.\\"
B000FVBLEI|5.0|i really liked this bands last cd (darkened heart) but i was just blown away by this one,the vocals hit every range  singing,screaming and growling and all of which are pretty darn good and fit the songs very well,if you play the guitar you will be blown away by the playing on this cd, WOW!! tons of wicked riffs to make salavate and some pretty tasty solos also.oli is one bad mofo!!these guys are really on the right track and this release will more that fill your need for mad-riff metal (since the last shadows fall was somewhat lackluster and seemed thrown together just to get out of their contract with century media). this will tie us shredheads over until the new unearth comes out and they better at the top of their game to equal this release!!
B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers has to rank as one of the very finest, and funny, British Sitcoms ever produced.  The writing and acting are without peer and unfortunately not found in the great majority of what passes as TV comedy shows today. The material is not dated and depends upon sight gags more often than not.  You will find it very hard not to have a marathon session with Fawlty and his gang of hotel help....enjoy !

The mother crawling on the floor shows that as she aged she suffers from a form of Alzheimer which is a very real experience for many, many, people.  Its hard when parents start to down slide this way and dispite it we love them forever and always.  This book helps prepare children for what will eventually come, death.

B000ENBSL8|1.0|I tried to like this book, but by page 61, I had to put it down. The main charachter, Helen, is a self-absorbed tramp and an unfit mother. She kisses people on a whim. She flirts and sleeps with anyone in town. She talks about how much she misses her daughter, who is away at camp, but I don't believe that she thinks of anyone by herself. She drops the F-bomb casually, as if that were speech becoming of a lady...which she is not. The plot is absurd. That she could be as callous and crude as she is represented to be and as popular as she is also purported to be, is impossible. This character is lewd, obstinant, selfish, childish, and impetuous. Do not pick this book up unless you admire loose women who are horrible mothers. Disgusting, and not a very funny book, either.

The scratchy soundtrack and dark fading-in-and-out pictures with funny squiggles are different from watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3 on DVD -- if I ever do so. <br />But the fonts are why God made 'pause' buttons. And the human brain is the best filter ever created for squiggles & Rice Crispies soundtracks. <br />The movie is wonderful.
1881273156|5.0|Do you realize that you could be speaking a different \\"Love Language\\" than your partner's \\"Love Language\\" without even knowing that this is happening? If your relation with the love of your life is falling apart, this could be the reason. This but is really an eye opener.    My wife bought this book, and after reading about half of it she bought an additional copy for me. This book single-handled change our relationship for good, and since then it has grown stronger. He found that even when we have a lot in common, we  talk in different love languages, and a result we started to feel unhappy and kind of disconnected.    In this book Chapman identifies five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. The book help you identify your main Love language as well as your partner's language (yes, we can speak several languages, but there is always a native or main language). With this information both can adapt to each other language and start a real effective communication.
B00095MLGC|4.0|THE BAND: Steve Wilson (vocals, guitars, drum samples, bass), with assistance from Richard Barbieri (keyboards), Colin Edwin (bass), Gavin Harrison (drums & percussion on 2005 remastered version only).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1993) Originally released in '93, this elegant digitally remastered foldout digi-pak was re-released in 2005 by Snapper Music. Disc 1 contains 10 tracks clocking in at just under 49 minutes. The 2nd (bonus) disc labeled \\"Staircase Infinities\\" contains 5 tracks at just over 30 minutes (this disc was originally released as an EP on Lazy Eye label in '94). Included with the discs is a 10-page booklet containing a 2-page intro by PT mastermind Steve Wilson, song titles/times, song lyrics, several trippy psychedelic pictures, and thank you's.<br /><br />COMMENTS: For me, this was Porcupine Tree's first great album. While it's predecessor \\"On The Sunday Of Life\\" (1991) had some brief shining moments, it was simply too much off-beat jamming, odd songs and experimentation... quite simply \\"weird\\". \\"Up The Downstair\\" was almost solely created and produced by Steve Wilson. For this remastered edition, Wilson went back to the original recordings years later... he decided to remove some of the drum programs/samples and have current drummer (1999 - present) Gavin Harrison play them live. Still not happy, Wilson redid some of the guitar work... and he himself says it's a better album for it. Much warmer in depth, richer in texture, better playing in general and more listenable... not to mention substantial improvements with the recording equipment. Comparisons to Pink Floyd are frequent (and I'm okay with that because I loved Pink Floyd back in the 70's), but only slightly in my opinion. The Tree gives you many a long space jam, but I think their craft is much more modern. \\"Synesthesia\\" starts the album off as a mid tempo rock/pop song. \\"Always Never\\" features some beautiful acoustic moments laced with some brilliant electric guitars and shredding solos. \\"Fadeaway\\" is a beautiful mellow rocker - a fantastic album closer - as noted in the booklet the song is one of Wilson's favorites. Steve Wilson is a genius at his craft. As good as \\"Up The Downstair\\" may be, I'd recommend starting with PT's more accessible albums... \\"In Absentia\\" (2002), or \\"Deadwing\\" (2005). Then, expand to one of their live albums \\"Coma Divine\\" (1997) or \\"Warszawa\\" (2001)... and then collect everything else they've done including this one. With all their releases (except Deadwing), look for the remastered digi-pak versions. Great disc (4.5 stars).ful mellow rocker - a fantastic album closer - as noted in the booklet the song is one of Wilson's favorites. Steve Wilson is a genius at his craft.

B000001FI7|4.0|I heard a song off this record years ago, and bought it on cassette, and absolutely loved it.  I have bought their second record, and live one since then, and all are great.  However, I didn't have DUMMY on cd, so decided to buy it.  For me,  it was better on cassette than this cd.  The mixes on a few of the songs were a bit different than on the cassette.  I was a bit dissapointed, but still a great record, and a great band. I would have given 4 1/2- 5 stars for the cassette recording.
0553208845|5.0|I can honestly say that this book is one my favorites and it is easy to see why Hesse won a Nobel Prize for his poetic, superb writing. Siddhartha is a powerful, touching story of a spiritual quest within the self - and it's a story everyone should read!<br /><br />It seems that an inner quest for knowledge and happiness takes place within all of us. Aren't we always searching for something and striving towards some goal? The story of Siddhartha not only captivated my attention to the very end, it also inspired me to search for greater meaning in my life. The intelligent, calm, charismatic stature of Hesses's character is something we can all admire. I'm not going to lie, it wouldn't hurt to be a little bit more like Siddhartha! After reading this book I decided to use services like Agogus.com to enhance my knowledge of the world and fulfill my desire to become a better person in every possible way. I realize that I will never become \\"sage-like\\", but a little stimulation of the mind and even some \\"Om\\" along the way certainly can't hurt!
B00005JKNF|5.0|The depiction of life in the early part of the 20th centuary in an English country house is brilliant. I just loved watching Lady Trentham recounting her travails with training her maid. And I loved watching the servants bustling about trying to make their employers' lives comfortable.The snobbery and the bitching displayed was so very upper class English. For an anglophile like myself, who loves English books , this movie was delightful. <br /> <br />The plot structure for the murder mystery was a bit weak. The explanation given for the murder was a bit far fetched. I won't say her why I think its fat fetched because in doing so, I will have to give the plot away.  <br /> <br />
B00005ATQD|4.0|Out of the wondrous imaginative mind of Stanley Kubrick comes this erotic tale of successful doctor William Harford (Tom Cruise) who believes he and his beautiful wife (Nicole Kidman) are a modern uninhibited and sophisticated couple. That all changes when the pair pauses a moment in their sedate and upscale life to smoke a joint. The husband reviews their evening at a fancy ball and reveals he was hit on by a couple of gorgeous women, but had the strength and fortitude to resist their invitation and charms. Taking his cue, the wife reveals that she too was invited to a sexual rendezvous and considered it just another of the many flirts she daily encounters. In fact, she further reveals, she's often had several wild fantasies involving herself and a handsome ship's Captain. This awakens and disturbs the doctor who believes there is much more to the sexual world of his beautiful wife which he is not privy to. Intrigued by the possibilities, he begins a personal but dangerous Odyssey to discover the dark secret world of the sexually provocative. The question arises. Can one delve into the black depths of perversion without losing himself? Eyes Wide Shut is a spellbinding foray of spectral images, complete with an equally haunting theme. All in all, a strange but alluring film where one discovers that enlightenment comes not without a price. ****
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Music over the past few years has gotten really weak, and at this point, Muse is one of the only bands who I look forward to new albums from. I was afraid of what it might contain once I heard Supermassive Black Hole, but thankfully that is the only song of that style on the CD.<br /><br />The CD Starts off where Absolution left off. Where Absolution was about the end of the world, and ends on a sad \\"let's face it\\" kind of note, Black Holes and Revelations starts off on a very strong build up that seems to say \\"let's fight back.\\"<br /><br />I can always live without hearing politics in music, but Muse seems to do it in a much different way than I've heard before. Their music seems to express their points much better than other bands who just seem to scream out cliches like \\"bring down the government\\" and mindless things of that sort.<br /><br />Musically, this CD is of the same quality as their previous albums with a nice extra touch of a few new styles. City of delusion, and Hoodoo have strong spanish themes to them, which they pull off wonderfully. Supermassive Black Hole, Map of the Problematique, and even points of Take a Bow have a techno style which also seems to work for the band. A Soldier's Poem shows a soft yet powerful side of Muse with some background harmony that was just waiting to come out of Matt for years. Knights of Cydonia has the feel of a Zelda game until it's fantastically harmonized climax \\"No one's gonna take me a live.\\"<br /><br />If you liked any of the previous three albums, you will like this one. Just don't go by Supermassive Black Hole as your reference of the CD. That one's just the result of Matt's DJ experience in NY - it gets much better. Grab a copy, this is easily the best album of the year, and it takes chances on top of that. What else can you ask for?
B000F3AAUW|1.0|Reviews in magazines said that this was great CD; that all the songs were great.  I had only heard the song \\"Crazy\\" and I really liked it.  So, I thought I'd trust the reviews and try it out.  It turns out that \\"Crazy\\" is the only song on there that I like.  The rest was just bizarre, especially the first track; none of it was anything like their hit song..  The only advice I can give, seen as everyone has different taste, is to make sure you hear more of the CD before you bother buying it.

For fans of Tom Hanks this us a must have.  For fans of good movies with great stories that you will not forget about this is for you as well.  It has humor and seriousness as well.  You will find yourself wanting him to turn back into a kid as much as he does after watching for a short time.  The story will grab you and make your heart pump just a little faster.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|When the Allman Brothers set out to record Eat A Peach in 1972, it was their first Top 10 album. While recording Eat A Peach, At Fillmore East was certified Gold just two weeks after guitarist Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident. The band members were determined to finish the album as a tribute to their brother/friend Duane Allman. This deluxe edition comes with a 11 page booklet with some great pictures of the band as well as an essay done by Scott Schinder to learn more about Eat A Peach and what happened during and after the recording sessions. As you open up the album you will see some cool art with Eat A Peach: Dedicated To A Brother, Duane Allman. As you listen to the first CD Ain't Wastin' Time No More is a strong opener to the CD. As you get into track 4, Mountain Jam is filled with just about everything any Allman Brother fan would want great jams, crying solo's, good drum solo's, groving bass, and much more. The live tracks on disc one are truely great. One Way Out, and Trouble No More are strong songs. Their are countless hits on disc one Ain't Wastin' Time No More, Melissa, Blue Sky, etc.  <br /> <br />The sound on this Deluxe Edition is absolutely the best sounding Eat A Peach i have owned throughout my years of reissues of Eat A Peach both complete and incomplete. Disc two is my favorite disc for the simple fact that its the Allman Brothers Final Fillmore East Concert, June 27, 1971 (previously unreleased), except One Way Out and Midnight Rider. From the start Statesboro Blues is a completely different version then on the fillmore all of us Allman Brother fans know. I think disc two is truely incredible!! For me In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed is the best song on this final Fillmore Performence. Whipping Post is also a highlight. I have seen the Allman Brothers a couple of times in their prime and I just cant get enough of these Deluxe Edition CD's, these releases are worth the buy 99% of the time. It was truely a dedication to a brother, Duane Allman!!!! Highly Recommended!!!!!

Excellent sound, better than expected video and a treasure chest of extras make this DVD a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes \\"Floyd\\". <br />     I really don't know what some people are whining about. David did an admirable job with what he had to work with and my hat goes off to him! Thanks, old friend. <br />     The only thing I have left to say is, \\"Where the heck is `The Delicate Sound Of Thunder' DVD\\"!!!!!? It blows the \\"Pulse\\" concert away! And PLEASE, this time around, could you put the \\"A New Machine (part 1)-Terminal Frost-A New Machine (part 2)\\" part, back in? Do that! and you'll get 5 stars!

B000FVQYYK|5.0|He might have created the cover art for bands as diverse as AC/DC, Audioslave and The Cranberries, but English artist Storm Thorgerson's sleeve designs for Pink Floyd remain the best coupling of epic graphic creations with similarly grandiose musical flights of fancy. That is, until now.  <br />After Thorgerson's success with previous Muse album sleeve Absolution (featuring perplexed earthbound individuals unnerved by ethereal shadows), the Devon trio have again called on Thorgerson to conjure up a sleeve for Black Holes And Revelations as bold in vision as the music within. Based upon Biblical and conspiratorial theories, the subsequent depiction of powerbrokers engineering global struggles from the deserts of Mars is colourful, detailed and over the top. Perfect, therefore, as the visually accompaniment to an album more mammoth than Mr Snuffleupagus. <br />On Black Holes And Revelations, Muse have at last found the musical energy to satisfy their extravagant aspirations for an entire album. While Absolution lagged on the home straight, this time Muse gallop home for a victory riding the horses of the apocalypse. <br />Opener Take A Bow finds Muse maestro Matt Bellamy hunched over his keyboard like a demented Phantom Of The Opera who knows Armageddon is nigh and is loving every minute, howling about the sinners who'll soon be burning in Hell and snarling at the corruption of the world. From this bombastic outset, it only gets bigger and better.  <br />Supermassive Black Hole is a funky first single deserving of its own robotic electropopping dance, Starlight is an emotive counterpoint as good as anything Muse have ever done and Map Of The Problematique offers a Depeche Mode introduction, thumping drums and guitar sequences so sharp they'll cut you in two.  <br />Elsewhere it's kitchen sink time, as every instrument, production technique and music style are piled skywards in a successful effort to topple everything they've done before. Not only are Muse cocky enoughto steal the title of one of Coldplay's finest songs, they've also provided their Politik with an injection of Middle Eastern strings, a Mexican fiesta of horns and a burbling bassline that sounds like it's been delivered straight from Atlantis. <br />Ambitiously armed with the spirit of soundtrack expert John Williams and Queen's charging taste for excessive production, Muse have created a mighty album based around devolutionary squalor and the imminent fall of mankind.  <br />All hail the new Pink Floyd.

0553801503|5.0|I just recently started reading George R R Martin's book and I have found them all fascinating.  A simple whim at the bookstore landed me with one of the best fantasy epics I have read in a long while.  This book was much different than the last three books, and I found it to be extremely interesting.  I know many people were not happy with this book, but I loved it.  I was a bit curious at first where the other characters had gone, but after checking various websites I realized what Geroge R R Martin planned and found it an excellent choice on his part.  Many of the charcters that we read about in this book have recently been introduced or were introduced very little in the previous three books.  It definately helped me gain a new respect for characters like Jamie, who i positively hated through the first two books and half of the third.  In a way I'll miss reading about them in the fifth book, but we'll see them again sometime.  Seriously, if you are looking for an awesome fantasy epic, try George R R Martin's books.  They are beyond incredible!  I spent my good time reading this one, but still almost two months of reading was too fast!
B00008DDXC|4.0|I think Chamber of Secrets is a step back from the first and third movie.  It begins on a high note but turns dry 45 minutes later (\\"dry\\" by Potter standards).  From that point, it never really recovers.  However, the mysterious story and the dark atmosphere (in some moments, overwhelming darkness not far from a horror flick!) really make it stand out from the other Potter movies.  Probably my least favorite of the Potter films but worth buying indeed.
1401302378|4.0|This is an excellent book. Based on Chris' theory that has been evolving since October of 2004 when he published it first in Wired magazine, this is a culmination of his ideas and contributions from many people on the internet (he has developed part of the ideas in open source format on the web).<br /><br />In summary, the idea of the book is that in internet world, shelf space is unlimited and due to this fact an interesting phenomenon emerges that breaks the intuition around 80/20 rule. Since shelf space is essentially free, if unlimited number of items are kept in virtual shelf and if those items even sell one unit, due to large number of such 'non hit' items, total revenue from 'non hits' will rival those of 'hits'. Therefore in the age of plenty (e.g. plenty of virtual shelf space) 'non hits' become as important and 'hit' products. As case study Chris uses Rhapsody which generates upto 40% of revenue from songs that are not even carried by top retailers. Similar case studies are done for Amazon, eBay and others.<br /><br />Details and implications of the above idea is covered throughout the book. The book is developed in a very well written manner and Chris' background in science (Los Almos) and economics (The Economist) shines through the book.<br /><br />I would say the book is certainly very intersting and a good read, however the core message could have been transmitted in a 50-100 page book, which would have made it more effective.
0060755598|5.0|After being in business for over 21 years and finding myself in a changing market environment, this book helped me get back to basics. I had read the book many years ago and found it very helpful in taking my business to the next level. Once again, I wanted to grow my business and this CD helped me to reflect on what I was trying to accomplish. I highly recommend this CD for any entrepreneur.
0312323867|5.0|I read \\"Something Borrowed\\", couldn't wait to read \\"Something Blue\\" because I wanted to see what would happen to Darcy. I thought that I would stay haiting Darcy but my opinion changed completly.<br /><br />Already with the first few chapters I was laughing because the character, just as she'd been described millions of times on the first book, sounded so self centered, admitted it, and gave a good explanation for it.<br /><br />I read some reviews that stated that the main character changes way too abruptly. I disagree. This character goes through several life changing experiences in a very short amount of time and even just one of those experiences is enough to make one rethink their outlook in life.<br />In this book Darcy is pregnant and all alone in the world. Even her parents avoid her for a while. The story states the events that lead to Darcy becoming a much better person.<br /><br />Neither \\"Something Borrowed\\" nor \\"Something Blue\\" are Shakepearinan prose. These books are just for fun, summer vacation, beach books. I recommend them to any girl whom is just looking to relaxed reading.<br />It took me many days to read Something Borrowed but just a few hours to read Something Blue.  I wish Emily Giffin would give us a third book in the series.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|Muse's popularity has grown with every cd they have put out and thankfully this is due to the increasing quality of production, song-writing, and adherence to the mood of their thematic albums.  After a five star cd with Absolution, Muse's only real two options were to maintain or to regress, which ultimately happened with Black Holes.  From the first to the last track Black Holes is enjoyable and very catchy.  To me, its a cd i can see other bands doing but not this well. What I enjoy is that Muse went a different direction with this cd, (aside from take a bow amongst a few others).  Its a much more straightforward rock album similar to their first cd, but with much tighter songwriting.  Although this cd is vocally very strong, I feel some similarities to Thom Yorke are once again present. I felt this was absent on Absolution and although it is not a bad thing to me it is noticeable.  <br />  I hold Muse to a very high standard and thus can give this cd no higher than four stars. Although its a good cd, it is not as experimental and as deeply rewarding as Absolution.  The subtleties of Ruled by Secrecy and Blackout are gone as well as much of their mood establishing synth work.  I understand bands need to move in different directions to progress, I just wish Muse had delved further into their classical influences and produced a cd that was less accessible on the surface and had more layers. <br />    I still highly recommend this cd to Muse fans as well as fans of any genre that appreciate well-written rock.  Muse is an amazing live band as well and a lot of the songs on this cd i can see sounding great live.  With songs with such immediate accessibility only time will tell whether this cd has the depth to keep me interested a few months from now, but it can always be used to establish a much different mood than Absolution or even Origin. <br />Recommended Tracks: Take a Bow, Map of the Problematique, City of Delusion, Knights of Cydonia
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Pink Floyd's previous tour in 1987 had arguably better lighting and effects: flying UFOs, robots shooting lasers at the crowd, lighting rigs moving around above the audience, etc.  Bbut the home video of that tour (Delicate Sound Of Thunder, available on VHS) is so bad you can hardly see any of it (though the footage still exists and they could fix it).  At least the 1994 tour presented here is easier to see.    Unfortunately the new editing on this DVD isn't the best.  So many great shots from the original Pay-Per-View broadcast of this show and the original Pulse VHS tape are gone, notably the great shots of the screen at the beginning of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" with the lights dithered around the edges (which looks better than the film by itself, presented as a bonus feature on the DVD).  And the most glaring editing problem is they cut out the flying pigs at the end of the song \\"One Of These Days\\"!  (The pigs jumped out of the towers and down to the ground at the end of the song, but apparently PF has to pay Roger Waters royalties to use a likeness of the flying pig...so that has been cut out of the DVD.  And no I'm not thinking of the previous tour.  You can see the flying pigs on the original Pay-Per-View broadcast of this show.)    But, even a Pink Floyd show slightly tainted is still miles above most other bands', so this still gets 5 stars (though Amazon will only let me give it 4 for some reason).  You also get bonus features like the screen films used in the show (and some not used), music videos (including the most commonly-seen version of \\"Learning To Fly\\", though it doesn't include the rare \\"first\\" version MTV used to show), and great sound.  So though it's a shame this edition could have been 100% perfect, the 95% perfection we ended up with is still an incredible bargain.  This is the best DVD available of a Pink Floyd show.    (And FYI, this DVD is NOT in pan-and-scan as some reviewers have mistakenly stated...this DVD IS presented the way theshow was originally shot.  The show was not shot in widescreen and therefore is not presented in widescreen.)
B000007SPT|5.0|Hace más de 10 años que he escuchado este CD y creanme que vale la pena para los que adoramos la música de los Cocteau Twins y Dead Can Dance, es un disco ecléctico con diferentes atmósferas que van desde los tierno, dulce , melancólico hasta atmósferas oscuras y opresivas, pasando eso si con un Pop Rock muy British muy refrescante... <br />Por favor no hacer caso del comentario de Jon Stone, ese pobre tiene papel higiénico usado en su cabeza....da lástima....!!! <br />Compren este disco para sus momentos más personales e íntimos consigo mismo.....
B000301YY8|5.0|This guy is amazing. I first heard his song \\"You're Beautiful\\" on the radio and I had to buy the CD. I then realized that all of his songs are so soulful with an emotional meaning. I am completely in love with \\"Goodbye My Lover.\\" I heard the song for the first time and I just sat there and cried for like a half hour. The part where he sings \\"I'm so hollow,baby,\\" just kills me. It's really beautiful. Some of his songs are difficult for me to understand, like \\"Out of My Mind,\\" but they are still wonderful to listen to. If you don't understand the words, just listen to James Blunt's voice and you can feel his love and pain. Everyone should listen to his music, because it is so personal with beautiful, intense lyrics that sounds like pure poetry. He is absolutely fantastic.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|With special effects and action superseding characterization, Aeon Flux makes for a fast-paced futuristic trip to the 25th century.  There's a definite \\"cool\\" factor to the whole thing, what with all sorts of ingenious futuristic gizmos and Charlize Theron's nifty little outfit, and the story, which is not exactly straightforward, does tie everything together in the end, but this just didn't feel like a complete movie experience to me.  This comes partly from the fact that the movie basically drops you into the middle of an unusual story without really providing you with a guide map at the start, but it has even more to do with the fact that the characters in this film are rather robotic.  The main character, Aeon Flux (Theron), is basically a terrorist, so it's a little hard to sympathize with her early on - especially since you have no way of judging the government or its leader, Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas).  When personal feelings do finally work their way into the story, they really aren't that dramatic at all.  Rather than explore anyone to any great depth, the director just keeps diverting our attention with special effects.<br /><br />Here's the backdrop for this story: in 2011, some disease wiped out 99% of the human population before a scientist was able to find a cure for it.  This scientist basically built a large walled city to house all of those he was able to save - and no one has been outside the walls in the last four centuries.  The Monicans, an underground group of terrorists and assassins, want their true freedom (and seem to be the only folks concerned by the fact that random people just keep disappearing out of the blue) and have decided that the Goodchild regime has to go.  Since Aeon Flux is their top assassin, she is given the task of assassinating Trevor Goodchild.  If you're thinking that 25th century security must surely be better than its modern-day equivalent, think again - Aeon basically just has to avoid some spiky grass and dart-shooting coconuts (and, if you're wondering, the \\"bad guys\\" of the future still can't hit the broad side of a barn).  Once Aeon comes face to face with Goodchild, everything changes for reasons she herself really doesn't understand.  As if things weren't complicated enough already, you also have a coup d'etat thrown in the mix.<br /><br />It takes a while for the viewer to find out what is really going on here, as the film is more concerned with showing off fancy special effects and superhuman abilities than it is in giving us a tightly-wound plot.  I for one would have liked to get at least a cursory look at this futuristic society and better insight into the main characters.  The film's entertaining, and I did enjoy it, but it was more of a snack than the full meal I would have preferred.t-shooting coconuts (and, if you're wondering, the \\"bad guys\\" of the future still can't hit the broad side of a barn).

B000F0UV0E|5.0|Tired of overhyped, pumped up pop noise? Here is the antidote. Well crafted yet simple songs, sparse production, good chemistry between the two. This will go down as one of the best CDs of 2006.
B000068W4I|3.0|Here is perhaps the most well-known and best-selling album in all of GNR's career.  This selection contains twelve tracks with various styles, themes, and tempo; yet the background musical instrumentation and the lead singer's voice provide the indication that all of these songs belong to GNR.  Each one of these tunes is performed with genuinely expressed feeling and determination, which sets the mood for that particular song.    Fast-beat and high-energy tunes are \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", a vivid illustration of the tough life in the inner city, and which was one of the singles (in the USA) released from this album; \\"Nightrain\\", a portrait of a man depending on booze to help him experience the wild nightlife; \\"Out Ta Get Me\\", a story about a boy who is determined to avoid arrest because he is convinced that he is innocent of any wrongdoing; \\"My Michelle\\", a song presented to a girl whose father is involved with pornography and whose mother died of a drug overdose; \\"Think About You\\", a love song; \\"You're Crazy\\", in which the boy criticizes his girl for wanting to leave him; and \\"Anything Goes\\", a piece with a very explicit description of man/woman interaction.  The last track on this album, \\"Rocket Queen\\", starts out fast, hot, and heavy in expression, but slows down midway through the song and becomes relatively mellow sounding, where the guy is more romantic, gentle, and understanding of his girl.    Somewhat less forceful in vocal volume and drive is \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", a story about a guy addicted to drugs; and \\"It's So Easy\\", an illustration of a young man who is quite rough with his girlfriend.  In these two tracks, Axl Rose sings in a smoother, calmer voice which is in contrast to the screaming or shouting in some of the other songs.    A memorable and popular track is \\"Sweet Child O'Mine\\", a love song which sounds quite melodic, and demonstrates the singer's vocal range.  Another highlight of this album is \\"Paradise City\\", which has a nostalgic feel to it; thelyrics, the melody, the harmony in the vocals, and the background music give the chorus in this piece a semi-country flavor.  Both of these items were released as singles in the USA and became quite well-known on the general pop radio stations and on the music charts.  They appealed to a wide audience, not just those listeners who only like hard music.    Overall, this is an excellent piece of work that shows the talent of the singer and the band.  The songs are well-performed and the words are generally well-written in many of the songs.  These are the strengths of this album, which probably contributed to its exceptional sales numbers and nearly classic status (in the USA, at least).    However, there are some features here that may be of concern to many listeners, or to the parents of younger listeners.  First of all, some of the songs (not all of them) in the original unedited version of this album contain a \\"bad\\" word that may offend some listeners and cause them to \\"hate\\" this record and not acquire it or keep it in their possession.  It certainly may motivate some parents to forbid their children from purchasing the CD, or prompt them to insist that their youngster immediately return the product to the store.  In response, the record producers came out with a \\"clean\\" version of this album to please those who do not like the bad words.  The other issues that bother some listeners are the reference to drug addiction or alcohol dependence (in \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" or \\"Nightrain\\", respectively), physical and verbal abuse of a woman (in \\"It's So Easy\\"), and the raw explicitness (as in \\"Anything Goes\\" or the earlier part of \\"Rocket Queen\\").                                    If it weren't for these issues, this album might have had even better sales and higher reputation than it already did.  Then this album might have attained rankings among the super popular and well-known albums produced by some other groups.  For example, some of the very explicit songs on AFD could have been reworded in a more metaphorical way, sort of like in one of the songs from an extremely popular and fast-selling album by another hard-rock band from another country.  That other album made it into the top 5 selling albums of all time; and GNR's AFD album could have become equally or almost equally popular if the lyrics in a couple of their songs were more subtle.  At least in the USA, many people have felt bothered by references to drugs, violence, and innuendos in songs like GNR's.      Probably, the other factor that kept this otherwise great album out of the top ranks are the reputation of the band and its members.  Personal conflicts among the band members caused them to split apart, and this prevented them from continuing making albums, which could have reached high status.  The lead singer and other members also had to deal with \\"issues\\" that may have led to some turmoil on and off stage.  Otherwise, this band may have had a much better rating and popularity among the general listening crowd.    Overall, this album deserves about 3+1/2 stars.  If detailed ratings were possible, the subject variety would get 5 stars, music quality and sound get 4 stars, but the indecency of language (in the explicit version) and behavioral conduct displayed in some of the tracks receive only one star.  If it were not for those last issues, this album would have earned 4 or 5 stars.
B00005JP01|5.0|This movie was SICK!! <br /> <br />And that DANNY BOOKO kid is a total PIMP! <br />Sure it's a third of a movie trilogy, but without any original cast this movie holds it's own. <br /> <br />Plus - That Danny Booko kids is a PIMP!!! <br /> <br />See it.
B00005JO9J|5.0|<br />I started from the very first episode and many people I knew only joined in the second season. The fact is the relation between Meredith and Dr. Shepherd began weakly and could not, on its own, keep the story going. Neither could Meredith's own struggle for her parents. Her life is just too sad and lonely. On the other hand, the character development of Cristina and Dr. Burke flourished and developed into a strong bond. They were unmatched in many ways, their clash of personalities for one, and yet they made an interesting couple. His patience and her insecurity were fun to watch. The forthcoming Izzie, the unsettled Dr. Karev and the easy-to-relate-to Dr. O'Malley display strengths of character.  <br /> <br />The entry of Dr. Addison Shepherd tilted the balance and lifted  Ellen's heavy responsibility of carrying the story alone off her shoulders. Immediately, Meredith has more promising prospects and steers her life in the right direction. Instead of people revolving around the life of Meredith and her Dreamy, it is much more gratifying to view all these characters growing and supporting each other all the way. A TV serial I look forward to watching every week.  <br />
0670034711|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  Liz Gilbert is an excellent writer; interesting, amusing, a very good story teller.  India and Italy are the TWO places I want to visit most; so this book was a great read for me; yet the last section on Indonesia was probably the most interesting from a pure story line perspective. Throughout the book she gives a lot of personal accounts of her life and struggles which I found interesting.
B00003BDXG|1.0|that's the one word that can sum this movie up....I hated it...I dont mind violence, but what I do mind is when it's done to the extreme and with a sadistic, very cold blooded tone..and this movie had a LOT of that....nonstop.....if you love watching a woman in a cafe begging for her life before getting a bullet in the head, or a man crawling on all fours in a pharmacy, begging for his life before getting executed, then this movie is for you. I might also suggest you get some therapy. for others, go ahead and watch it, but make sure you have steal wool and bleach to scour yourself with afterward....
B000BJS4TO|5.0|Absolutely amazing <br /> <br />Such stunning music on a CD is rare to find. I find myself getting lost in the music everytime I listen to the CD.  <br /> <br />I love the Journey to the Hanamachi; you can sense the depth of pain and the uncertainty of the future. Going to School is upbeat and exciting; Brush on Silk is also one to stir the emotions. Of course, the CD wouldn't be complete without Becoming a Geisha, the most elaborate one, in my opinion, on the CD. I also love The Chairman's Waltz and the beautiful violin music. Finally, I believe my favorite (along with the previous track) would be Confluence. If I hear it in a certain mood, I am certain to cry.  <br /> <br />You will not be disappointed if you buy this!
B000EGCITG|4.0|I love this cd! I would say the entire cd is good. There are some soft songs, some pop, and definately some angry chick rock songs. I thoroughly enjoyed singing along in my car to all of them! In my oh so humble opinion, this is her best album yet.
1586217194|4.0|I really enjoyed this audio book.  The author brought to life how we can tap into our unconcious mind.  His utilization of real life examples is what really made this book enjoyable.  The author also provided the audio reading and was easy to listen to and follow.  Definitely recommend this book to anyone trying to further develop themselves.
B0006L5RT2|4.0|James Blunt's \\"Back to Bedlam\\" comes at a time when people seem to have taken to rock and rap music. This album is a throwback really to the notion that vociferous music intinsic to commercially directed songs is the norm of this age. This is the debut album of a man who was in the British army a few years back. \\"Back to Bedlam\\" is a compilation of intensely soft songs dissolved in forceful meanings and implications. The songs invoke a personal tone and their charm lies in their massiove appeal to the listener's heart. <br />  <br />James Blunt himself admits that this his maiden album is actually a personal documentary of himself and no song is as personal or more tragic than the lovely track \\"You're Beautiful\\". This single was the third highest selling track in the UK i 2005 and with this single,Blunt became the first British pop star to lead the US Singles Chart since Elton john. \\"You're Beautiful\\" is a tragic love song that arises out of a host of feelings that crowded on the artist's heart when he perceived his ex-girlfriend in a London subway with another man. This song is easily the best of the album and trembles with longing,sorrow and pathos,a feature that ripples across the album. <br /> <br />\\"Goodbye My Lover\\" and \\"No Bravery\\" are two songs that bear ample bearing to James Blunt's exquisite ability to resound his most intricate feelings with a graceful force in the listener's bosom. \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" was voted a funeral favourite in Great Britain and follows a very,very gentle rhytm and simple but power lyrics and the song probably reflects the singer's pangs of separation from his lover. \\"No Bravery\\" exposes the harsh and disturbing effects of war and blood and death and misfortunes and hopelessness on a soldier and James Blunt's personal experiences in Bosnia coupled with his brilliant and uncommon voice paints a vivid picture of life in the army. <br /> <br />The other songs are grat and follow a similar pattern. They're infused with a regular and smooth rhythm and never reach a mid-tempo proper. \\"Billy\\",\\"High\\",\\"Tears and Rain\\",\\"Out of My Mind\\",\\"So Long,Jimmy\\" and \\"Cry\\" are all good songs but somehow disappoint the listener should he compare them all with \\"You're Beautiful\\". The album is very much romance driven but the stunning song \\"Wisemen\\" with its philosophical intonations brings some kind of  avariety into this undisputably great album. <br /> <br />The best aspect about \\"Back to Bedlam\\",barring the romanticism that James Blunt's career switch evokes,is the unique endearing and appealing nature of all the songs. Emotions and personal experiences are perfectly harmonised in the songs and really few eyebrows would be raised by the amazing success this album has have had all around the world and mainly in the UK where it was rated as the thurd highest selling album in 2005. James Blunt is the new pop music star to hit the music industry and,given the male solo vocalist's elegance and a  smart gentleness underlining his songs,one is invariably led to suspect that this army officer-turned-singer's unprecedented success with \\"Back to Bedlam\\" is not going to be a one-time wonder.
1587264013|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

B000055Y0X|4.0|I wish the Amazon system allowed 4-1/2 stars, because DR. STRANGELOVE suffers from bouts of self-indulgence that blunt the otherwise razor-sharp sardonic humor and keep it from being just shy of 5 stars.  Mercan Muffley as a name?  I know the hidden meaning behind it, but it's an inside joke among better, more accessible joke names that fit, such as Premier Kissoff, and as such it doesn't add anything except an odd puzzlement until you finally discover the meaning.  The same goes for Bat Guano.  Worse, neither name is funny nor sardonic.  Mercan Muffley simply stops you to scratch your head; Bat Guano hits you over the head. <br /> <br />I first saw this movie some 35 years ago and never cared much for the Dr. Strangelove character either.  Whereas Generals Ripper and Turgidson and Major Kong are brilliant spoofs of their targets, Strangelove is too overdone and too self-indulgent.  Same goes for the subtitle:  \\"How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\\"  No one I've ever met uses the full title.  It's a bit like those \\"director's cut\\" editions that leaving you convinced the cuts should have remained cut. <br /> <br />Other than those minor complaints, the rest of the film is a classic for a good reason.  Its brilliance is in its mockery of human vices and frailties that are somehow made all the more real by their outlandish portrayals.  Having served a few years in military aviation, I especially appreciated the B-52 crew and their scenes, which often get overlooked in reviews of the film. <br /> <br />It's a classic.  Now that I have the DVD, I'll pull it out once a year or so, skip the weak spots, and enjoy the rest.
B000001E18|4.0|Zooropa is a very underrated album. U2 felt like doing something fresh and different. They did just that and they did it well.<br /><br />Zooropa - The first track of the album is kind of like an electronica version of Where the Streets Have No Name. It starts with an intro and then transfers into a pretty cool techno guitar riff for the verses of the song. It then closes with a colorful and sort of a springy ending.<br /><br />Babyface - This track is my third favorite song of the album. It really captures the feeling of innocence in a child but at the same time tells the story of a very deep love between two people.<br /><br />Numb - This track does a very good job of capturing the feeling of being bored with life. Bono's background vocals add a little spice to the song so that it doesn't get boring to listen to.<br /><br />Lemon - This is my favorite song of the album. Bono sings in falsetto through almost all of the track which is rather refreshing.<br /><br />Stay(Faraway, So Close!) - This song is my second favorite song of the album. It is a wonderful track which seems to tell the story of a young woman who has been abused by another man.<br /><br />Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car - This track opens up with an awesome drum beat before going into the verses. It seems that the lyrics tell a story about a rebellious young daughter who Daddy just keeps spoiling.<br /><br />The First Time - This song is my least favorite song of the album. It's got good, haunting lyrics but it doesn't have much to offer musically. In my opinion it lacks the kick all the other songs had.<br /><br />Dirty Day - This was definitely one of my least favorite songs of the album. It's not really a bad song it just didn't measure up to the quality of the other songs like Stay(Faraway, So Close!), Lemon, Babyface, or Numb.<br /><br />The Wanderer - The last song of the album reminds me of the taste of coffee. It's an acquired taste. When you listen to it for the first time you may label it as trash or you may like it. Some others may need to let the song grow on them. At first I wondered why U2 was messing with a song written by Johnny Cash, but as I listened to it more I learned to like it.<br /><br />Overall I think Zooropa is a very good piece of work with some very deep messages hidden in the songs. If you don't like it at first give it a chance and let it grow on you.rst time you may label it as trash or you may like it. Some others may need to let the song grow on them.

B000FBGBPC|3.0|I bought three days graces first album on the strength of the first single 'I hate everything about you'.I was expecting a few other good songs and a few stinkers but what I got was an album I didnt skip a single track on which,for me,is really rare.the more I listened to the album the more I loved it,it was definately,without a shadow of doubt the best album I bought that year.no song sounded like the last,the lyrics,structure and riff's where unbelievable.... <br />So as you might expect I was dying to get my hands on this album,after waiting 3 years I thought the boys had taken there time and picked only the best tracks for there 2nd album but after listening to it since the day I got it i've come to the conclusion that theres only a hand-full of good tracks on this album and NONE come close to any of the tracks on the 1st album.the chorus on nearly all the songs has the same structure,the lyrics are'nt anywhere as good and in the last song 'one x' we get mainstream radio crap,its easily the worst song on the album. <br />songs 'over and over','time of dying' and 'gone forever' really save this album.although the subject matter in most of the songs is dark and slightly depressing I feel the songs themselfs are more upbeat then on the 1st album.dont get me wrong Im a big three days grace fan but more than that im a music fan and this,for me,just was'nt as good as it could,no,SHOULD have been. <br /> <br />If you want an example of a 2nd album exceeding the 1st album check out 'Sinch' 2nd album 'clearing the channel'.I also waited 3 years for that album and wasnt disappointed,its an astounding piece of work,actually both there albums are but for me the 2nd more than the 1st.
B000024D4R|5.0|I remember purchasing this along with a package of incense at a local \\"head\\" shop when it was first released. This album took up residence on my buddy's turntable for quite some time (it may have lasted through our whole lease. That part of the 70's is somewhat of a blur to me!) Apart from the anti- establishment lyrics, I feel this is some of Pink Floyd's trippiest instrumental work since \\"Echoes\\" on Meddle. To me, this is where each member of the group was at their tightest, with each instrument contributing to the utmost. The best use of synthesizer thus far, the bass more out front than on other releases, and Gilmour's guitar.... The vocals are smooth and surreal. This is one that should appeal to the hippy in all of us. Some moments are a little harder (borderline metal,) but, all-in-all, a very spacey and relaxing listen. The midsection of \\"Dogs\\" freaked- out my Alaskan Husky, which was a great source of amusement at the time! After purchasing the re- mastered CD, I enjoy this as much today as I did back then. Let me light another stick of incense....
0792165020|4.0|I have to start by saying I've never had such a physical reaction to a movie, like I had with this one!  As the film progressed, I found myself sweating profusely, my stomach in knots!  This is all due to the anticipation (or apprehention?) I felt waiting for Tom Ripley to be exposed as a fraud for impersonating his rich former-friend Dickie Greenleaf!  Just when you think Tom will finally fall flat on his face and be completely exposed as a criminal, he lands on his feet.  Either due to lots of luck or his own quick thinking! It's this anticipation/apprehension of waiting to see Ripley's ultimate humilation that had me in knots and sweating on pins and kneedles.    What an excellent actor Matt Damon is, conveying every emotion the sociopath Ripley felt.  From charming  and sweet, to hurt and vulnerable, to ammoral self-preservation.  Jude Law is perfect as spoiled, rich, party/playboy Dickie Greenleaf.  Gwyneth is like-wise perfection as his likeable, clueless girlfriend who ends up knowing more than anyone else (who's left living)!  Philip Seymour-Hoffman, as Dickie's sharp-as-a-tack, obnoxious pal steals the thunder from anyone else in a scene with him!  Hoffman's Freddie is an un-likable smarty who has Tom Ripley pegged from the second he lays eyes on him!  Freddie is street-wise old-money.  His kneedling, sarcastic comments directed at Tom had me watching those scenes over and over again.     The movie as a whole is excellent, but the ending didn't completely satisfy me.  Although I can just imagine what would happen next (to Meredith, who still thinks Tom is Dickie).  I've never read the book the film is based on, I'm tempted to do so.  Hopefully the book ties up some loose strings?
B000AY807Q|1.0|Isn't Don McLeese, the writer of the feature review here, a music critic from Chicago or somewhere? How much did they pay him to write his review? OMG... Prairie Wind is a flat-out embarrassment, and anyone who truly loves Neil Young's greatest work will sadly watch (the DVD) and listen to a pathetic, warmed-over collection of songs that sound like rejects from his Harvest album, which is, what, more than 30 years old? Just because you used to be a great artist doesn't mean you should keep putting out material. I'm sorry Young suffered an aneurysm, and that his dad died, but a clear-eyed critical assessment of Prairie Wind can only conclude that it's mawkish, boring fare that was ill-advisedly foisted upon the public. Clunky lyrics--including embarrassing references to 9/11 and Chris Rock (!!!)--the same old chord progressions, faux sentiment, and an overall sense of pious self-indulgence combine to make this a very sad effort indeed. The filming of the recording date is also a joke, intending as it does to try to capture a sense of \\"important artist at work\\" reverence. Yuck. It's really creepy also to watch the back-up singers acting like what they're doing is a real challenge or as if what they're singing has all this importance. I don't care how old or famous or formerly great an artist is--if your material is lame, please don't bother to put it out. Young can't possibly need the money, so why would he do this? I dunno. One of the great singer-songwriters of the classic rock era strikes out big-time here, and what's really sad is he has no one around him to tell him how pathetic his material sounds. Recommendation to those who consider themselves devotees of Young's finest work: avoid this one like the Plague.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Always one of my favorite movies, I'm very pleased with the job they did in finally bringing this to DVD.  The 'extras' are worth while too.  I went to my first Grand Prix in 1969 and this movie certainly brought F1 to life before I saw it live.  I've seen 2 GPs at Brands Hatch in the '70s and while the short is excellent, it doesn't capture that excitement of your first hearing the engines. Yes, you really used to be able to get that close to the cars.  And Monaco is still 'the' race of the year.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the movie!
0811729117|4.0|If you've read all the previous reviews then you know what the book is about. It's a revealing portrait of the tactical and political mindset of the Waffen SS during WWII. In today's sense the pace of combat seems almost leasurely. What might suprise most readers is that the commander of a Tiger tank spent so much time on foot, painstakingly walking and crawling the ground around his tank(s). It explains why he survived so many encounters. Equally instructive is the political view of a dedicated, motivated German soldier during WWII. At first glance it seems appalling at how he ignores the massive, unbelievable war crimes committed by Germany and sees it as a victim, but that may explain how a military which included millions of men who were not rabid Nazis allowed it to happen. Like the Waffen SS as a whole, you might admire his elan, but you shake your head at his moral blind spots.
B000000OQF|5.0|First off, this is my absolute favorite album. I have not always felt this way. At first I just enjoyed the hit songs. After listening to the album for several years, I have grown to love every note and word of it. It is perfection.  I love Axl's vocals. I love Slash's lead guitar. This album has some spectacular gutiar solos. Izzy Stradlin also has some great solos and adds to the overall feel of the songs. Duff plays a great bass. I love the way the bass is distingushable from all the other instruments in the songs. Sometimes I just sit back and enjoy certian instruments on the album. In my opinion the only thing that could turn you away from this album is the cussing and that the lyrics talk about sex, drugs, and violence. But hey, if you don't like that, maybe you should steer away from rock n roll and listen to classical music.
B0000041LA|4.0|By any standard this is very good Prokofiev playing. Ashkenazy strikes me as one of the most Westernized of Russian pianists, and his approach here, seconded by Previn's conducting, avoids rawness and astringency in favor of combined lyricism and strength. Perhaps because Decca's sound is so natural, the piano remains limpid and sparkling throughout--don't expect volcanos and thunder a la Argerich and Richter.<br /><br />The only real shortcoming is that these works can use a lot of what Ashkenazy leaves out: bite, wit, irony, and brash attack. Concerto #2 is a specialty of this pianist and comes off beautifully--its lyricism suits him. Concerto #1 seems too middle-of-the-road, which can also be said of the left-hand concerto #4, but the most familiar work, Concerto #3, is authoritative and strong throughout. Previn seems more alert in this work, too.<br /><br />I should mention that although Ashkenazy's approach is much less wild than Argerich and Richter, the Gramophone described these recordings as overflowing with 'panache, swagger and firebrand audacity.' I guess it all depends on where you're coming from.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This one was a true winner!  What a great story!  Disney has done it again!<br /><br />I borrowed this one from my local video rental service and was quite pleased with the total value and extra materials on this one.  A nice story about not \\"burning your bridges\\" as our hero did at the beginnig of the story.  But by the end he learns his lesson, and comes out on top.<br /><br />Nice little story about Route 66 as well.<br /><br />Kind of makes me want o rent an RV, and drive down Route 66.<br /><br />Where were all the people?<br /><br />MC White said:  Well, a'iiiight!
B000002A3T|5.0|Don't even bother reading the 2-star-and-below reviews.  If you are a fan of great melodic/atmospheric music, soaring guitar solos, wonderful keyboards/synths, then get this CD.   <br /> <br />When you listen to the album, actually LISTEN to it.  Break it apart: on ten full plays, listen only to the lyrics, on another ten full plays listen to Wrights' amazing keyboard, on another ten listen to the fantastic combination of all sounds... <br /> <br />BUT on another 1000 plays, follow Gilmour's amazing guitar work.  The last 4 minutes of High Hopes, all of Marooned, the last two minutes of A Great Day for Freedom, all of Take It back and all of Coming Back To Life, etc... <br /> <br />This album is great for too many reasons to list, just get it and LISTEN to it!!
B00005JPE7|1.0|For the love of all things sacred, please do not go and see this one!  It will make you cry with all the passion in your body.  Do not forget how bad Sly's television program and magazine were!  They failed horrendously!  This movie will sink to the bottom of the sea!  I promise you!<br /><br />This is the only movie I know that won an Oscar, yet has nearly as many sequels as the Friday the 13th franchise.  Please just go away, Rocky!<br /><br />That is all!<br /><br />EDIT: 12/6/2006<br />I was just listening to Opie and Anthony, and as expected, the first reviews are starting to come in for this bomb.  As expected, Rocky is showing his age, and expected reactions to this fuddy dudy has been \\"embarrassment\\" at best.  I suggest Rocky take his \\"middle age\\" magazine, and his \\"dinosaur\\" antics in a DeLorean time machine with Marty McFly and Doc, back to 1979, when he was a success. Maybe he'll score with Marty's mom?<br /><br />EDIT 6/4/2007<br />MCW aka MC White responds:<br /><br />Well, well, well, a'int that sweet?!  You finally see the movie that you were \\"positively reviewing\\" before you even seen it!  Ain't that sweet?!  Well, I'm glad!  But you forgot one thing.  To \\"eat\\" our words, we have to agree with your words.  And agreeable, a'int how I'm feeling just about now.<br /><br />And I'm a big Sports movie enthusiast...by the way!<br /><br />I did also see this movie, finally, on DVD.  And you know what?  I thought it was very \\"clickish\\" and hackneyed and stereotypical.  I really did laugh a lot,... at Rocky, throughout the entire movie.  I can't believe he's still trying to paint himself as this \\"castaway\\" Philadelphian.  What a joke.  He owns a restaurant, and he wears a sports coat (the same one every night?) and talks to his customers every night, about being this great fighter?<br /><br />If I were a regular in that fictional restaurant, I'd find myself ducking, and getting very interested in my Pasta Primavera, every time I saw that lout walking towards my table, praying that we didn't make eye contact, for fear of 45 minutes of his \\"dwelling on the past.\\"  Hell, even his brother-in-law let him have it 25 minutes into the film.  And Rocky is probably sustaining his \\"alcoholic\\" lifestyle with his money.<br /><br />I did feel his pain, regarding his dead wife.  I can only imagine how his character must have felt.  But what the hell.  Even Basketball players have awesome `cribs' and tight rides.  Why the hell is he driving around in a beat up white van?  Where's his glass house?  Did I miss something.  Did some Nigerian Banker dupe him out of his millions?  Completely unbelievable.  Sorry.  Just stupid and ridiculous!<br /><br />I don't know why, but I don't find myself \\"feeling\\" for that type of character that is Rocky, I find myself despising that type of character in films.  And you know what. I specifically remember the reviews for this movie in the San Francisco Chronicle being very similar to what I'm saying here.  Clich&eacute;d and silly.  And stupid.  I also remember Opie and Anthony lambasting the movie, and calling it weak on the radio.  I remember very few positive reviews.  At least this part of the country.<br /><br />I did enjoy the black and white with red blood scenes near the end.  I thought that was pretty clever, and visually appealing.  I did enjoy the fight scenes, though I though it ridiculous to see Rocky in the ring with a young fighter.  Very silly!<br /><br />2 stars out of 5.

B000002G30|5.0|Wow...Dave Wyndorf is no doubt one of the most original and self-inspired song writers of our time.  Don't get me wrong, he did have influences like the psychadelic space rock of Hawkwind, and that of Captain Beyond, but even those veteran bands from the 70's don't compare to this cosmic genius.  The entire album glows with great talent.  Ed Mundell's guitar riffs are outstanding.  The only beef I had was that they didn't put \\"Eclipse This\\" (it turned out to be a B-side) on the album.  Look for that on their website and download it, definately a worthy listen.  This is Monster Magnet's last more Space/stoner oriented rock album.  Get it.  It stands above most musical efforts.
B000J10ERO|4.0|Very nice movie.  Very impressive graphics and story-line.  I enjoyed the fact that they did not scrimp on the plotline and story-line.  I love movies not afraid to be over two hours.<br /><br />Can't say I love this genre of films.  I'm actually very bored by them. I have not seen every Superman movie.  My best memory of seeing the original Superman, back in the 80's was when I accidentally went in the wrong theater, showing the film, 1 1/2 hours already into the movie, and not realizing it.  My date and I sat there, very confused.  As a kid, I didn't realize that when you show up on time, usually the movie hasn't started yet.  Maybe we were 5 or ten minutes late, and thought it had started already.  Perhaps that when I first started avoiding these types of movies.<br /><br />My buddy Bobby Asslong recommended this movie.  He stood in line for a midnight showing when it launched at the bigscreen.  I would never do this, let alone, for a regular screening.  But to each his own.<br /><br />I give this 4 starts for excellent quality and story-line.<br /><br />MC White said:  Super!!!
B0002XL35G|5.0|Paris, Texas is a profoundly beautiful film that certainly belongs in any film collection worthy of the name.  It rewards on all levels, cinematography, story, acting, and heart - even soundtrack.  The picture takes you to an eerie and exotic place, both literally and emotionally, and maintains its high-wire level of vivid authenticity for each and every one of its 147 minutes.  Put simply, this is filmmaking at its very best - Paris, Texas surely earned its 1984 Palme d'Or.<br /><br />In Paris, Texas, very little happens - and it happens at a leisurely pace.  Director Wim Wenders uses time opulently, painting nuanced details on a vast canvas; we're well into the movie before Travis (our protagonist) even speaks.  The austere Texas landscapes Travis wanders seem haunted by an exquisite spiritual longing and emptiness, perfectly majestic and perfectly designed to torment him.<br /><br />Harry Dean Stanton (Travis) is a reliably excellent actor, but Paris, Texas is his masterpiece.  He does so much with so little that, even though his character is oddly extreme, we care about him instantly.  We don't know why he's walked through hell, and neither does he, but we need to know.  As we learn more, we must discover what happened to his son and wife, and what will happen to them all.<br /><br />Dean Stockwell, a consistent and underappreciated actor, has his hands full as Walt, brother to Travis.  He and his wife must try to reel Travis back into reality, and in so doing, reacquaint Travis with Hunter; the son he left behind when he went missing four years ago.  That Walt and wife have been Hunter's parents all that time, and are putting the love for their adopted son in jeopardy by reuniting Travis and Hunter, is only one of the film's many difficult moral and emotional choices.  But Walt is a good brother, and his self-sacrifice foreshadows even greater acts of selflessness to come.<br /><br />Viewers who surrender to the spell of this movie will wear their emotions outside their skin; there is vulnerability, openness, and poignancy that is sometimes almost unbearable.  Hunter Carson, as the son abandoned not once but twice, (father and mother), is marvelously unaffected and likeable.  Watching Travis build something good with his long-lost son is a joy.  Wenders has faultless timing, his direction is masterful.  He makes us wait for the payday, admittedly, but when it arrives, it is even better than we had any right to expect.  Nastassja Kinski, as Jane, estranged wife of Travis and Hunter's mom, is astounding.  The scene between her and Travis is as chilling, real, and poetic as anything I have ever seen on film.<br /><br />Choosing Ry Cooder to do the score was an inspired decision, there is a plaintive, melancholy loveliness to his solo guitar that is perfectly at home in the barren, hurt landscapes of both the heart, and the Texas badlands.ons outside their skin; there is vulnerability, openness, and poignancy that is sometimes almost unbearable.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I had been following this release for about 5 years now or so and finally I heard it was released!! I grabbed it up, (for 16.99 I might add with a five dollar rebate..) I saw the concert on VHS and shhh...bootleg, but the concert and sound is great. You have many choices in the sound categories. The screenshots are true pink floyd films, great for everything from pondering reality to pulling out the old college hukka from the attic.  <br />One downside though...the documentary on the crew and bootlegging the bootleggers is lame to say the least. Its a bunch of crew members in their spare time filming stupid stuff and rough cuts of the concert from the audience...both very poor and a waste of time.  <br />But...but besides those two things this is a must have for everyone who is into music period. Highly suggested!! *****
B000683VI4|3.0|First things first, this was a million times better than the book.  This story is a much better visual story than the amateur writing of Nicholas Sparks.  Better than Message In A Bottle but not as good as Walk To Remember (these were all Sparks' adaptations), this novel has many pros and many cons.  The pros is that it had two great and believable actors with Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams (I heard that Justin Timberlake turned down the part to play Noah!).  They do a good job throughout as they battle cliches and syrupy situations.  I thought it was a bit predictable with James Garner and Gena Rowlands' characters (please note that I only read about 75 pages of the book before I could take no more so I did NOT know what was going to happen because of the book!).  All in all, it was an okay film, maybe a great film if you like these syrupy, slightly cheesy chick-flicks.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Doing my part to counterbalance the ravings of a nutjob. <br /> <br />Serenity is a great follow-up for a great series.  Balancing humor, action, and a good storyline with developed, believable characters, it's a treat for fans of the series, and fans of Science Fiction as well.
B00005JP5J|5.0|This is one of the finest low budget indie comedies you are ever likely to see and the finest I have seen since NAPOLEON DYNAMITE.  For a \\"small\\" film this one has a surprisingly strong cast and I would love to know how the producers managed to get so many fine individuals together for this project.  There is no star of the film, but an ensemble cast in which each performer has to carry his or her weight.  Probably the hottest performer in the film at the moment is Steve Carell, who here plays a suicidal Proust scholar and former professor who is grieving over losing a grad student he was in love with to another Proust scholar.  Anyone going to see the film hoping to see Carell as he was in THE 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN is going to be crushed, but those open to something unexpected will be delighted.  The very gifted Toni Collette, who does her usual fine job as the mother in an exceptionally dysfunctional family, plays his sister.  \\"Dysfunctional\\" might actually be a weak term, since \\"chaotic\\" might be better.  Most of the film turns around the attempt to get her daughter Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California, a long drive via Volkswagen bus from their home in New Mexico.  One of the joys of the film is Abigail Breslin's performance as Olive, who while cute as a button is not traditional beauty pageant material.  Many will remember her from SIGNS as Mel Gibson's young daughter.  Greg Kinnear, a rather harried motivational speaker who hopes to achieve great success through his 9-Step plan to become a winner, plays her father.  Alan Arkin plays his father in an absolutely hysterical performance as the lewd, vulgar, and unselfconscious heroin-sniffing grandfather.  Rounding out the family is Dwayne, played wonderfully by Paul Dano.  In the preview that I saw, Dano may have been responsible for many of the loudest laughs from the audience.  Dwayne is a hostilely independent teen who has taken a vow of silence until he manages to get into the Air Force Academy to pursue his dream of becoming a test pilot.  When his uncle Frank (Carell) asks him if he has many friends Dwayne scribbles on a notepad, \\"I hate everybody,\\" then takes time to underline \\"everybody\\" after Frank reads the note.<br /><br />The ordeals the family experiences are all original and exceedingly funny.  I won't spoil the adventure by recounting them, but I was struck throughout by how original the humor was.  Virtually none of the humor was recycled or flat.  There are a host of great scenes that any viewer will remember vividly.<br /><br />After another summer of mind-numbing films that attempt to be blockbusters but only manage to depress, this film will be a tonic.  A long time ago Hollywood seemed to forget that more often than not less is more.  While this is a \\"small\\" film, it manages to be infinitely funnier than any of its larger-budgeted competitors.  It could also quite possibly end up the funniest movie of 2006.<br /><br />I did have one quibble with the film.  I thought the last few minutes were a bit of a disappointment.  Without revealing precisely what happened, I thought the reactions of all the characters were a bit hard to buy.  But apart from that, this is an utterly delightful and very funny movie.y to pursue his dream of becoming a test pilot.

B00005JOQS|5.0|Doing my part to balance out the insane ravings of a bitter lunatic. <br /> <br />It was good to see Superman fly again. <br /> <br />Brandon Routh was amazingly good in the role of both Clark Kent and Superman, up to and including some cute moments of bumbling a-la Christopher Reeve.  The effects were beautifully done, and Kevin Spacey is the best Lex Luthor ever to grace the screen, one moment charming, and the next utterly terrifying.  The score was masterful, I couldn't stop smiling when that familiar theme began. <br /> <br />In short, a wonderful movie, and a wonderful tribute to the man who made us believe he could fly . . . and an appropriate passage of the torch to the next man to wear the cape.

Hugo Weaving did a brilliant job in this engrossing, fascinating look at facism.  The movie was beautifully acted, quick paced and exciting, and one of the best comic films to date.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is one of the best movies I have seen all year.  It is clever, it is funny, and it is unique.  Movies like this one are usually fun, but not this fun.  I don't want to say anything at risk of giving something away.  I enjoyed it one so many different levels.  It mantains it's pace, humor, and plot twisting throughout the entire movie.  It is also possibly Val Kilmer's best role since Doc Holiday.  Just watch it, that is all I can say.
0143034901|4.0|I loved The Shadow of the Wind, if only for the reason it is so different and a complete change of pace from the books I've read of late.  The story is great, the characters unique, the setting, humor, sarcasm, close friendships, and love all blend together to make it a really great, exciting book.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a very intriguing read !  If you love books, you'll love this one ! After all, the book is based on Daniel's love of a book and how it effects his entire life.  Great story !

097477698X|5.0|This review is of a book is also published in hardcover and softcover.  <br /> <br />I doubt that anyone will buy an expensive leather-covered book who doesn't at least know about the regular editions, but if you don't this is one to consider. Earlier Leather bound copies have sold well enough to exhaust the supply. You should refer to reviews for the less expensive editions for good summaries. <br /> <br />This are a few truly excellent books about the Vietnam War. To my mind, this is the best of the best. The focus is Ia Drang, an early battle that should have alerted the Washington types that United States had bitten off a much bigger chunk than it thought it was chewing. Courage, heroism and splendid leaderhip averted another Little Big Horn. <br /> <br />Ia Drang was the first major battle of the war against the regular army North Vietnamese.  Then LTC Hal Moore was ordered there on November 14, 1965 with 450 men of his1st Batttalion/7th Cav with orders to engage the enemy, location and numbers unknown. With  limited lift capacity and speed, Moore had less than half his men on the ground when he learned his troops had been landed in the middle of a Vietnamese stronghold. <br /> <br />There is no point in retelling what the authors write in an account as compelling now as it was when first published. Both went on to more honors in distinguished careers. Moore retired as a general. Galloway completed 16 month tour of Vietnam and returned for three more tours before the end in 1975 and went on to cover many more wars including Gulf I and Iraq.  <br /> <br />Both sides claimed victory from this battle for different reasons.  In reality, the consequence of the battle was the lessons learned and not learned. Each side took different lessons away. The Vietnamese learned to avoid American firepower. McNamara and others saw a vindication of their tactical approach that would result -- they thought --  in a complete NVA defeat. <br /> <br />Although he inflicted casualties on the North Vietnamese at a 5-1 ratio and Americans were not forced from the field, Moore does not consider it a victory. but a draw.  <br /> <br />Americans draw from Vietnam what they want, sometimes without regard to the warriors and sometimes unwilling who actually fought there. Moore is a general, not a politician, and this is an account of two men who were there, not theorizing in a Washington think tank. <br /> <br />A reasoned view of the conflict can be found in a book that carries the primary title of \\"Dereliction of Duty,\\" by a now senior Army officer who has served in Iraq combat areas. The commanders who now serve learned their own lessons from Vietnam. There are others who learn nothing.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Ever since Muse won me over with Absolution, I have been amazed by other bands' lack of experimentation, chord progression and exploration of themes aside from love gone bad. Matt Bellamy and cohorts' theatricality astonish me, even though I eschew musical theater. Like others who have commented before, I at first was a little turned off by the first single, \\"Supermassive Black Holes\\" (I think it was because I found the video a little too Manson-esque), but now I can't get it out of my head. The funky groove and Prince-like falsetto makes me just want to grind my hips on the dance floor--and I don't dance! \\"Starlight\\" is the song that Coldplay wishes they had written, and \\"Map of the Problematique\\" is the best song New Order never recorded. The bombastic, conspiratorial and anthemic overtones continue to build throughout the CD (which was recorded chronologically, it appears) to an explosive climax. Throughout, Matt Bellamy's voice channels an inner Freddie Mercury, and the band as a whole sounds bigger than just three guys. But it's the emotion behind Bellamy's vocals that lends sincerity to the overblown and outlandish--no one can listen to him sing \\"Hold you in my arms\\" on \\"Starlight\\" and not feel the yearning, the pain of being separated by time and space. Is the album perfect? No, but no album is. But I hope that Black Holes & Revelations will help Muse find a larger audience. As much as I loved Absolution and Origin of Symmetry, I think the band relied a little bit more on noise than they did sound, and there are a few more radio-friendly songs here. Bellamy's political statements can be a little polarizing, but I also hope people will put their own personal beliefs aside and let the music speak for itself. In conclusion, I think this is the best album of the year to date, as epic in scope as Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\", but with a more glam-rock bent to it. Stunning, eye-opening and addictive. As a singer/songwriter myself, they have set a new bar for me andthe rest of us.
0345440900|5.0|Saying that this book is a miracle for new parents is an understatement!  It saved our lives!  We were exhausted, couldn't figure out what the heck our new baby needed, she was crying - but dry, fed, and tired. What were we doing wrong.  Tracy told me....and from that point on we had a happy, happy home and both my daughters slept through the night by 6 weeks.  Get this book!
B0007TKNL0|1.0|1. They redid the orginal plot some, not that it effected the show much, but it was dispointing.  <br />2. Emmy can sing and act, but she was horribly micasted. Christine's part requires more than just hitting the notes.  <br />3. The Phantom's disfigurement looked like a sunburn. I laughed when I saw it, I mean, did they really not have the ability to make it look ugly?  <br />4.Gerald Butler has no talent. He can't sing, and the only time the part fit was when he was mad. His songs made me cry when I realized how bad the auditions must have been to cast him.  <br />5. Is it just me or does his hair change from blonde to black in some scenes?  <br />6. They took out Meg Giry's famous ending pose with the mask. <br />7. The chandilier rising was totally unimpressive.

B00009V7P8|4.0|To John Grunwell, why would Damien Rice go \\"back to the UK\\" when he is from Kildare, Ireland? American ignorance at its best, the idea that Rice is from the UK is both wrong and an insult to the man and in a roundabout way you've insulted three and a half million good Irish people. The album is good, if a tad whiny.

B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is a progressive rock album by the band Pink Floyd. It was their 6th official studio album. The album art was done by Hipgnosis, who did the majority of their album covers. Meddle was huge stepping stone in the band's history due to the fact that they would recieve some sort of signature sound that derived from this album. <br />     The Album features 6 tracks: One of These Days, A Pillow of Winds, Fearless, San Tropez, Seamus, and Echoes. <br /> <br />1.)One of These Days (9.1/10) - is a song that features a double tracked bass guitar one played by Roger Water and The Other by David Gilmour. It also has Nick Mason speaking the piece in the slowdown part of the song. The song itself starts off slow with the wind noise but then progresses to One bass which is then quickly accompanied by another. As the bassline progress the background is covered by Various Guitar riffs until it reaches the middle and those infamous words are spoken \\" One of These Days I'm Going to Cut You Into Pieces\\"  and then the song quickly returns to a more band like sound and plays it out to the end. <br /> <br />2.)A Pillow of Winds (9.7/10) - is the 1st acoustic track featured on the album and has David Gilmour on vocals even though the song was written by Waters. The Song transitions in from the wind effect from the previous track which instantaneously starts with the acoustic sound. The song is a soft melody and is almost a precursor for future Pink Floyd acoustic classics like \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Wot's... Uh the Deal\\"  Melodic and Hipnotic Vocals and Guitar with Lite Lovely Lyrics make this song one of the albums best. <br /> <br />3.)Fearless (9.5/10) - a slow tempo song with an almost ascending type acoustic riff which is played by Roger Waters. The Song has similar vocal style to the previous track but maintains its ground of originality with respect-worthy lyrics. Towards the end of the song, a recording from a Liverpool football club game comes on with the fans singing \\" You'll Never Walk Alone\\" <br /> <br />4.)San Tropez (10/10) - a lovely melodic peaceful song that makes Pink Floyd standout as one of the innovators of any genre of music. This song features a more Jazzy Uptempo tropical Sound with acoustic Guitar and Jazz Piano. In My Opinion this is the best song on the Album due to the heavy diversity of the song and the beautiful execution. The song lyrics describe the scenery of San Tropez and are complimented by Waters and Gilmour singing duel lead. Easily one of the best Pink Floyd songs of all time. <br /> <br />5.)Seamus (8.5/10) - a really original sounding song by Pink Floyd that features a dog in the background reacting to the blues guitar. This a heavily blues influenced song. This almost seems to be a sort of Song that a band would include in an outtakes album but It managed to appear on the main album itself. Not Floyd's brightest moment but a tolerable song nonetheless. <br /> <br />6.)Echoes (10/10) - another Pink Floyd classic. This song features David Gilmour and Richard Wright on Vocals with a melodic improvisational piece that is reminiscent of Atom Heart Mother's title track. The song begins with a piano intro but quickly works in the drums and guitar. The harmonious lyrics and haunting vocals make it an Instant Pink Floyd classic. Oh, Did I Mention The Songs 23 Minutes Long!! which does seem kind of lengthy but an enjoyable piece nonetheless and it is especially worth listening for the segway and reintroduction of vocals into the song 19 minutes into the Song. Long but well worth the wait. <br /> <br />Overall, It is My Opinion that this Album is the best Pink Floyd Album. It has very diverse pieces throughout the recording and lyrically its just an amazing piece. It has a really good dark-mellow mood throughout the album and not too mention would go on mainly to flame the fires of Darkside of the Moon, Braindamage was a outtake from this album.  Adieu.

B00005KHEU|4.0|Well it is quite typical among reviewers of this album to start discussing whether this is ELO rendition to disco music, or Jeff Lynne's selling out to disco, or the discovery of a \\"very Disco\\" album, and so and so...    My opinion about Discovery is clear: yes, ELO was influenced by  the contemporary enormous success of pieces of work like Saturday Night Fever, and yes, this is a quite competent ELO offering amid this context. As simple as that.    And I think this is nothing strange at all with ELO. When prog-rock was at a peak of public acclaim with Genesis, Yes and others producing album hits, Eldorado came out. When techno-synt-pop started to dominate the charts, then it was time for Time. (Maybe the contractual bond to make Xanadu in the 1979-1980 season prevented us from having an ELO new-wave album!!)    Why all this? I presume because of a mix of reasons: Jeff Lynne's almost permanent target of making commercial music led him to try to make ELO production to always lay on a succesful track. After all, something has to be made when you have self-restricted your band to ought to be a rock assembly plus an orchestra section (Sorry for this to all ELO classic concept supporters). I'm afraid if you don't try something, you are likely to sound alike all the time and you get bored and bore everybody. Besides, in the case of Discovery, I would bet Jeff was admiring the high songwriting level of Bee Gees efforts and then he tried his hand at doing his own version of that, his own approach, or whatever we may want to name it. Does anybody feel that the melody of Horace Wimp chorus is almost the same than Night Fever verses? The thing goes up to this point.    Focussing myself on my feelings on the album, I have to admit I didn't like it when it came out. At that time I was more likely to listen to oldies as Deep Purple and Pink Floyd, and to new things as The Knack or The Police. Actually, it was Time the first ELO thing I really liked. Because of that, and some years later, I gave Discovery a second opportunity and...that was the moment when I found out what I had missed and became an ELO fan, bought all the previous and following albums, etc, etc.    Confusion, Last train to London, Midnight Blue: Perfect songs. I would have given something big for having written them myself. And beautifully sung and played. Jeff's voice in Midnight Blue is pure velvet!! Wownderrrrrrful!!  Don't bring me down: a terrific sound. Quite outrageous. I still like to listen to it in a dangerous volume for me and the amps.  Need her love: very, very beautiful.  And the rest are OK, as minimum nice. Horace Wimp is very usually under discussion in forums, etc. I believe it's just like Yellow Submarine or Obladi Oblada in The Beatles. Either you love it or you hate it: \\"There's nothing that is in between\\". And maybe that was the intention!    And talking about the remastered version, wow!! Del Shannon rendition by Little Town Flirt is GREAT, GREAT, GREAT. Chapeau, Jeff. I can listen to this version 100 times a day!!!    In few words: A very beautiful album. A pleasure to listen to. No matter anything else to me.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|My expectations for this movie were not that high. I am a Sci-fi fan and saw a few episodes of the series before seeing this but many big screen sci-fi movies just end up sacrificing story for action.  <br /> <br />I came away from this thinking it was one of the most entertaining movies I had seen all year, and my wife, who is not a sci-fi fan, felt the same way.  <br /> <br />The world it takes place is the future earth. There are no aliens, it is more like say Dune where it is assumed humans have colonized the universe alone. The writers have evolved language & culture along believable lines so it looks like a familiar yet foreign world to us.  I really appreciate that sort of attention to detail (something you'll never find in Star Trek). <br /> <br />The movie is not going to win any awards, but it is extremely entertaining with believable characters and an engaging story.
0385720920|2.0|The book is sloppy and uninteresting. I know he was trying to make it unstructured which would have been fine if it didn't take away from his ability to tell a good story. The characters are one dimensional and uninteresting which made me really not care what happened to any of them. One part of the end that is supposed to be shocking is predictable the other part of the end was surprising. I feel that if he is trying to make a story that really builds up to a surprise ending it better be really good but he just doesn't deliver.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I'm not the Super-hero movie type but I love the Superman movies ( at least 1 & 2 ) and I also had an interest in Spiderman so I gave this film a shot. <br /> <br />Well, it was not as bad as I thought it would be.  The characters were cast fairly well with Tobey McGuire being the possible only question mark.  Willem Dafoe is solid as the Goblin and the rest of the cast does their parts pretty well.  I like the build-up of the Spiderman story and how things came about.  The film was paced decently and didnt rush into anything too quickly or drag on too slowly.  The action scenes were OK, nothing great but I've seen worse.  The CGI was acceptable but the transitions from CGI to Live action were a little hacked up.  Basically, the special effects were borderline acceptable but this didnt hurt the film too much. <br /> <br />I did enjoy the story development and the characters did progress enough to keep it interesting. Of course the ending was setup for the next film.  As others have said, the ending was not the best.... oh well.... nothing is perfect. <br /> <br />Despite a few scenes with some violence it is kid-friendly as well and the reviewers that trash the film need to understand that a PG-13 film needs to fall within certain criteria and they simply cannot go overboard with violence or sex stuff.  The action scenes are softer than some other films and the bad guys are not geniuses either.  Again, its PG-13 follks... go watch some R-rated bloodfest if thats your desire. <br /> <br />I would have preferred 3.5 stars but gave a it a 4 just because films like this are NOT easy to do well since there are so many \\"bombs\\" out there. Overall, this is well acted, well executed, and keeps you interested which is pretty good for Comic Book movies that usually are awful ( Hulk, Batman ). <br /> <br />So go ahead and watch it, maybe even buy it if you're into the genre. <br /> <br />Recommended!
0375831002|5.0|Some books have so much power in them, they change the way you look at the whole world. Markus Zusak has captured that power in his self-described \\"small story\\", The Book Thief. Our narrator says \\"I am haunted by humans\\"...and that echos in my mind, as I am haunted by the word-images and characters of this deeply moving story. It is more than a story, really. It is a parable of life. It feels as if I have known these characters personally and have been watching over them for years, just like our narrator.<br /><br />\\"It's the story of one of those perpetual survivors--an expert at being left behind.\\"<br /><br />It is the story of us all.<br /><br />I encourage everyone to read this book. I feel it is crucial that our young people experience this novel, and I have added my nomination that The Book Thief be placed on the 2007 YALSA list (Best Books for Young Adults). However, any adult will be equally touched by this book. Perhaps much more, as the longer we have lived a human life the more we understand the deeper layers of meaning in Zusak's parable.<br /><br />As everyone else here can attest, The Book Thief is a read that inspires change without ever asking for it. It helps us to embrace the truth that we all must die. It reminds us that we have the power to write our own chapters until death comes to carry us away. The Book Thief teaches us that we cannot choose the story we are placed in, but we can choose our actions and reactions that will influence the ending. Whether we choose to be strong or weak, brave or fearful, inquisitive or lazy, kind or hateful, bitter or forgiving, to survive or to give up...we have the power. Markus Zusak is a literary hero. He has given us a book that recharges our human spirit, and allows each one of us to grasp the power that lies within.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|Dune, Lynch's cult classic, is a very good movie. I enjoy it every time I see it. It has an all star cast, great directing, and fun scenes. Sure it may not make much sense, but I think it is a lot of fun. But, let me say this for those of you who haven't seen it: \\"RENT IT FIRST\\". This is a movie that appeals to only a select few. Now, the dvd release... <br /> <br />Original Theatrical Version: A GREAT TRANSFER. It looks awesome and gives you the full experience. Very very cool. Make sure to rent or buy this version of the dvd. <br /> <br />Extended Edition: Wow this sucks, it's truly horrible. It's not the deleted scenes added into the movie, like everyone expected and wanted. It's a hodge podge of crap added to the movie. It's a huge disappointment. <br /> <br />Special Features: The Deleted Scenes are probably the coolest part of this release. It shows you what the original cut of the film was missing, very cool indeed. The other features are pretty cool, but nothing too impressive. The dvd case is very awesome. <br /> <br />So like I said before, if your a first time viewer, rent this addition. If your a long time Dune fan, looking for a great release of the film, pick this one up. Just don't be expecting the extended edition to be any good.
0452281881|5.0|Light, hilarious and genuine: I read this on the plane from London to Chicago, and enjoyed it so much I started it again immediately on the bus ride home from O'Hare. <br /> <br />It never occurred to me that the American edition would be different. What are we, infants? If there's some slang we don't quite get, there's always peevish.co.uk and a host of internet slang dictionaries at our disposal.  <br /> <br />If you want the real thing, get the English version. Can't miss it. It's bright orange with a big purple 'e' on it.

All i can say is that this is one of the best sexy thrillers of all time and its worth owning in any dvd collection!!!!!!

0224076051|5.0|After I read Lubos Motl's review below, I became interested in this book. After I saw that Lubos called Woit and his collegues crackpots in Woit's blog, I became even more interested. As Lubos is a String Theory researcher, one could expect a reaction. But not of this dimension and depth. I have a background in Physics and still love Physics.  If this book makes an active Hardvard physics professor spend time on it and call its author a crackpot and the author is an active Columbia physics professor, then it must have something worth it. As the only game in town, String Theory should be challenged. This book does it.

B00005LK94|4.0|I'm not sure what possessed me to buy this film, apart from the fact we just got it in work, and I thought why not? Anna Paquin is really nice, and Jeff Daniels is an alright actor, although I haven't seen him too much in films, apart from Dumb & Dumber & Speed obviously!<br /><br />What a touching film! I loved it, and got quite teary throughout. Anna Paquin, although shockingly young (but she still looks the same!), is showing herself to be a really good actress, even from such a young age, even more so in the brilliant X-Men films. Even my Dad couldn't believe how she still looked the exact same - old before her years I think. The storyline is that she loses her mother in a car crash in New Zealand, and her dad (played by a very shaggy Jeff Daniels) is in Canada, but comes to get her, and bring her back 'home'. She hasn't seen her dad in 10 years, and he is a bit of a loner himself, but a good environmentalist. After trees get knocked down just outside their home, Amy finds some geese eggs, and takes them home to take care of them. As soon as the geese are born, they latch onto Amy as their mother, and she teaches them everything, even defending them against an evil bad guy cop, who wants to prevent them from flying, and clip their wings. But as they migrate south for the winter, the whole film then revolves around teaching them to fly. A very difficult job, but is successful.  And what a genius way of doing it! How anyone could kill these lovely animals is shocking, and it's amazing how throughout the film you watch them grow, and Amy and her dad's relationship grow & evolve.<br /><br />There are a few shocking moments in the film, some that will bring a tear to your eye, but there are some hilarious moments as well, including Jeff Daniels character bursting in on his daughter in the shower, after she starts screaming. (He's an inventor, and has invented some strange kind of shower gel tap thing.) The look of horror on both their faces was hilarious, and had you in fits, as her dad's character just stands there.<br /><br />There are a few strange scenes as well, particularly of the scene of Anna Paquin either getting her nose pierced, or having a clip on put in. It doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the film,  and is obviously part of a storyline that was ultimately cut, but that was left in.<br /><br />It's such a sweet storyline, and not totally aimed at kids, meaning adults can not feel embarrassed watching a 'kids' movie. I love being an adult (ha) and still being able to watch kids movie, or movies I watched as a kid, and being able to understand and enjoy them better as an adult. You have to see this movie once in your lifetime, perfect for relaxing to, and just enjoying a couple of hours of 'me' time. The movie flies by quickly, and you won't regret watching it.ad you in fits, as her dad's character just stands there.  <br /> <br />There are a few strange scenes as well, particularly of the scene of Anna Paquin either getting her nose pierced, or having a clip on put in.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|Phantom is magnificent as only an Andrew Lloyd Webber production can be!  The music and lyrics are beautiful and Joel Schumacher's film rendition is excellent. Exquisite voices; a talented cast; beautiful sets; believable characters; and a deeply moving story make each viewing as wonderful as the first.  Even the phantom is someone you feel empathy for. This is a musical I will watch freqently and, I'm sure, never tire of.  I highly reccommend that you add it to your collection.

B00005JOQS|5.0|I must say, having grown up with Christopher Reeve as the Man-o'-Steel, was iconic.  To presume any other could play such a role or even consider fulfilling such shoes would be considered in poor taste ... for many.  None-the-less, I went to the movies with my husband and my three year old son.  The later could have waited until he was older.  With that being stated, I must admit the positives: <br /> <br />- Brandon Routh, although little dialogue, did a good job in his physical performances. <br />- Kevin Spacey did an excellent job in replacing the wonderous role of Lex Luther originally played by Gene Hackmen of the late 1970s and early 1980s. <br />- Kate Bosworth did a good job too fulfilling the role of Lois Lane; albeit, changing the characteristics of the character as performed by Margot Kidder and loved by audiences especially from the first two Superman movies.  (Least we mention the later movies were poorly scripted!). <br />-  The actress that played Lex's dim-witted girlfriend was awesome! <br />- The look and feel was interesting and at times it appeared a bit comic book like.  Not sure how to describe this since I noticed this during the times when Superman was flying into space, it just felt a bit too animated with all the \\"blue\\" coloring.  Hope someone can understand and explain this part far better? <br /> <br />Negative/disappointed area: <br />-  I would have  liked to see more from the character Clark Kent. <br /> <br />So, did I get my money's worth?  Yes!  Was it entertaining?  Yes!  Am I worried about what will happen to the sequel to this movie?  Sure!  I have rarely viewed a sequel that has been as good or even better than the original.  The closest movie to proving its worth after an original has been made has been the trilogy:  The Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br />I think as we age we have to pass the torch along to the new generation and let them be the ultimate judge of this movie's worthiness over-all.  Although my son lost interest after half-way through the movie, and understandbly so due to his age, he still runs around the house pretending to be Superman.  With that noted, it appears that the appeal of Superman is long from being over!  :)
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Even having watched every episode of season one when it first aired and being an instant fan of the show, I had forgotten the absolute mastery of the great team of writers and actors. I am in awe of the level of television they were able to produce consistently and the slow and steady narrative they gave to each character and story arc. Bravo! A permanent favorite of my DVD collection!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I watched the series on the Sci-Fi channel long after downloading the episodes from the web.  I liked the 12 original episodes so much I kept hoping for more to come until my husband informed me the show had long been cancelled, but Whedon (the writer/director) had made a movie in hopes of garnishing more followers, etc.  When the movie came out, it was one that I went to see and was left waiting to see if a sequel would be made.  That's how great this movie is.    Interesting notes:    -  The movie picks up essentially where the T.V. episodes left off.  -  Characters are believable and all actors are superb in playing them.  -  Many twists to the movie leaving you on the edge of your seat and one particular one leaving your mouth-left-wide-open from disbelief!    This is a movie that can be highly enjoyed by non-Sci-Fi fans but I do suggest seeing the 12 episodes prior to viewing the movie in order to have a background and understanding of the characters and the over-all essence of how this world lives unlike other science fiction films of today and in the past.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I can't decide if this is my favorite album of the year so far, or Devin Townsend's Synchestra. This is definately Muse's most diverse album. They completley re-invent themselves with every album and this one is certainly no different. The first time I heard Supermassive Black Hole I absolutley hated it, the second time I listened to it I absolutley loved it. It has a very Prince feel to it, which is a good thing. Overall this album is Muse's most diverse effort to date> i can see great things happening for this band here in the states.

B000BNX3B4|2.0|First my heart goes out to John Cusack.  He's about as typecast as Meg Ryan when it comes to Chick Flicks.  In fact, I think those two should do their next chick flick movie together.  Then the circle of life will be complete.  As far a Must love Dogs-it's interesting when you consider neither party own their own dog. Diane Lane, for some reason, didn't come across as believable in her character-which is amazing when you consider she played the character the same exact way as her character in Under the Tucan Sun.  She just didn't up and buy a house in Italy.  But the character arc is the same.  At the end of this film I didn't quite believe that she believed that she was in love with Cusack character.  More like it was just a process of elimination.  All the canned ingredients are here-the nosey and needling family.  The perfect romantic gentleman--who loves Dr. Shavigo (I don't even like that movie) who just can't find the right woman.  (Let's not talk about how this man is supporting himself in a trade where he has NEVER sold anything.)<br /><br />Still the film manages to hold your attention on an HBO night when you have nothing else to do.  But if you have the option of watching this or Dr. Shavigo-then I would watch this film.

0743424425|3.0|A lot of people say this is Stephen King's scariest book.  I disagree.  Maybe because I've seen the movie several times.  Either way, the book is a modern classic.  Everyone knows the story, or at least should have seen the movie.  The book goes into a lot more detail about Jack's personal life which does help give the book an errie foreshadowing that the movie ignores.  I really enjoyed this book even after seeing the movie because it is written so well with a lot of character development.    Help me find a good book - [...]

B00005JNEI|1.0|The best was to get away with a crime is to have the assistance of the police. La Cosa Nostra (the Mafia) understood this simple principle and so do those who ride with George W. Bush. It is not until one views the documentary Loose Change 911 that it becomes evident that Moore is a paid-off policeman who has agreed to look the other way. The release of his Fahrenheit 911 in 1993 was suspicious froim the start. How was a film, purported to be so anti-Bush, obtaining such a wide release through the Hollywood establishment who, for obvious reasons, are overwhelmingly supportive of the Iraq war. Additionally, they have spent so much effort demonizing Arabs and Muslims that Bush's actions are in perfect harmony with all they have represented for years. Again, it is not until one views Loose Change 911 that it all begins to make sense.  <br />This is your key: Despite the apparent disdain that Moore holds for George W. Bush, in the end of his movie HE REACHES THE VERY SAME CONCLUSION AS BUSH--that Arab Muslims did the crime and that Muslims are our enemy! In fact, Moore says that because of Bush's business connection to the Saudis we are protecting the most dangerous Muslims in that country. So, in the end, Moore stands right next to Bush pointing the finger of blame at Arabs and Muslims as the terrorist enemy. Classic disinformation. <br />Loose Change 911 explodes all of this nonsense, by totally exonerating the Muslims and exposing Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and others as the homegrown terrorists who engineered the entire disaster.
B00005AQF7|5.0|I shouldn't really have to say much about what a classic \\"Doggystyle\\" is. Following Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic\\", Dre produced his Long Beach buddy Snoop's 1993 album, and it became one of hip hop's critically and commercially lauded pieces. The album blends production and lyricism like the world had never seen before. Dre keeps the beats at a slow, bass and synth heavy, incredibly smooth tempo, perfectly matching Snoop's laidback drawly flow. Snoop's stories and raps were also pioneering, telling tales of drug crimes, gun fights, gang conflict, women encounters, and life in Long Beach. Snoop is such an amazing MC because his character is incredibly tough and hard yet inexplicably likable. \\"Doggystyle\\" is one of rap's most influential and simply great albums and should be owned by any rap fan.<br /><br />Following the \\"Bathtub\\" skit is the incredibly funky \\"G-Funk Intro\\", aided by LBC peer Lady of Rage. She drops a great introductory verse and Dre's beat is awesome, with a whiny synth, driving bass and hard drum kicks. Next is the legendary classic \\"Gin and Juice\\", the song that defines g-funk. Snoop tells a tale of a party in his city, with a perfect singalong chorus and a beat that spawned a thousand imitators. \\"Tha Shiznit\\" is just a laidback song where Snoop explores his personality, and it has a catchy hook. The slow rolling \\"Lodi Dodi\\" is just a fun song to listen to. \\"Murder Was the Case\\" is the next classic here, where Snoop yarns a tale of murder, Dre drops a creepy beat to match, it's great. Tha Dogg Pound drops by for \\"Serial Killa\\", a tough and smooth cut. \\"Who Am I (What's My Name)\\" may be Snoop's best known song, his signature song with three classic verses, a memorable hook (\\"Snoop Doggy Daaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwg\\") and great beat. \\"Ain't No Fun\\" is probably my favorite song here, a conversation with a lady. Nate Dogg kills the chorus and has a verse of his own. It's a very upbeat, happy tune with a sweet synth and bass. The classic g-funk of \\"Doggy Dogg World\\" and the hard guitar laced \\"Gz and Hustlaz\\" close out the album well.<br /><br />Please note that this 2001 rerelease of \\"Doggystyle\\" contains a different tracklist than the original. The original 1993 pressing had 19 tracks, including a bonus song \\"Pump Pump\\" featuring Mr. Malik of Illegal and five short interludes throughout the album. The original 1993 pressing is out of print, and the rerelease contains the 13 tracks mentioned in the tracklist.<br /><br />\\"Doggystyle\\" is hip hop executed at its finest, just fun and effective music. I recommmend it to all music lovers, for its fun lyricism combined with great production make for an awesome album that you can listen to over and over again. Definitely pick this one up if you haven't.\\" and the hard guitar laced \\"Gz and Hustlaz\\" close out the album well. <br /> <br />Please note that this 2001 rerelease of \\"Doggystyle\\" contains a different tracklist than the original.

B000007MVD|4.0|This CD should settle once and for all that the Beatles were fine performers live.  It would be hard to prove that on copies of broadcasts from Shea Stadium and the Hollywood Bowl.  With the exception of one obvious edit on \\"Hard Day's Night\\" (though to rectify it, they play the ending fadeout riff ad nauseum at the end of the song \\"Here's proving that they're playing live!\\" says the BBC emcee), this is the Beatles live (and usually without the fanfare of screaming teenage fans).      From 1962 to 1965, the Beatles performed live on the BBC featuring not only their own songs but other popular songs from other artists (Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Carl Perkins, Ray Charles and Buddy Holly, to name a few).  There's even a few out of the ordinary songs included, like Ann Margaret's \\"I Just Don't Understand\\" (sung by John) and \\"The Honeymoon Song\\" (sung by Paul).      This is the Beatles at their most fun (and it sounds like they're indeed having fun!).  Featured on this CD are are many songs never before released on LP or CD, like \\"Please Don't Change a Thing\\" and \\"Nothin' Shakin' (But the Leaves on the Trees\\" (both sung by George), \\"Double Shot of Rhythm and Blues,\\" \\"I Got a Woman\\" (sung by John), \\"Lucille\\" (sung by Paul, why did that DJ have to pipe in on the instrumental introduction?), \\"Johnny B Goode\\" and \\"Carol\\" (both sung by John), \\"Hippy Hippy Shake\\" (sung by Paul), \\"Some Other Guy\\" (it's hard to believe that though this is featured in both The Compleat Beatles and The Beatles Anthology, this is the only version to surface on CD, bootlegs notwithstanding), \\"Young Blood\\" (sung by George), \\"Ooh, My Soul\\" and \\"Clarabella\\" (both sung by Paul, the latter featuring harmonica by John), \\"To Know Her Is to Love Her,\\" \\"So How Come (No One Loves Me),\\" \\"Sure to Fall\\" (lead by Paul with harmonies from John and George), \\"Keep Your Hands Off My Baby\\" and \\"Got to Find My Baby\\" (both sung by John), \\"That's Alright Mama\\" (sung by Paul) \\"Sweet Little Sixteen\\" and \\"Lonesome Tears In My Eyes\\" (both sung by John) and the only Lennon/McCartney song never before released (at least aired on the BBC) \\"I'll Be On My Way.\\"  This song was given to Billy J Kramer and the Dakotas after they had written it.      Of course, there's the alternative version of \\"From Me to You\\" (retitled \\"From Us to You\\") at the beginning and there's also also notable versions of \\"Baby It's You\\" (with a jazzy coda, rather than the fadeout on Please Please Me), \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\" (with no echo reverb on George's vocal) and \\"Honey Don't\\" with John on vocals rather than Ringo), \\"I Saw Her Standing There,\\" \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy,\\" \\"She's a Woman,\\" \\"Things We Said Today,\\" \\"Love Me Do\\" (with Ringo on drums), \\"I Wanna Be Your Man,\\" \\"Rock and Roll Music,\\" \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"Till There Was You.\\"      There are no recordings from 1962 featured here but I had read no quality recordings existed.  Also included are short interviews with the Fab Four.  Paul gives a rare serious answer as to what the Beatles miss in the midst of all the fame and fortune, John is the most jovial (\\"No, I play harp on this song! I play harmonica on 'Love Me Do'!\\"), Ringo gets a banana thrown at him (\\"'Ere, Ringo, have a banana\\"), George is wry as he introduces \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" as a song that goes back to 1822 and at the beginning of Disk 1, each of the Beatles introduces themselves (\\"I'm Ringo and I play the drums\\" \\"I'm Paul and I play a bass\\" \\"I'm George and I play the guitar\\" \\"I'm John and I, too, play a guitar.  Sometimes, I play the fool!\\").  Mark Lewishon provides some insightful liner notes and we learn that \\"Ticket to Ride\\" was one of the last songs the Beatles performed on the BBC.  It doesn't include all the songs they performed on the BBC, since there was a CD single featuring 3 other songs from the BBC sessions not included here (also worth getting and probably even harder to find).  Nevertheless, if you're a serious fan of the Beatles and this isnot in your collection, this would be a worthy purchase.

And can i just say that AC/DC are not a metal band contrary to what most people think they are actually a Hard Rock band.  Brian Johnson, well what can i say, hes not the most perfect vocalist to pick up a mic but hell hes raw, rough and powerful, and no one else could possible fill his spot in AC/DC, except obviously Bon Scott, but unfortunatly hes unavailable.  Anyone that compares AC/DC to greenday (and votes greenday), doesn't deserve to be able to listen to music.  Anyway i shouldn't bag this guy too much (hes a GNR fan).

B000F1IQMS|2.0|What a terrible film. Clearly, all the five star reviews here are written by people who have not seen \\"Sword of Gideon\\", which effectively telsl the same story. I was shocked by Spielberg's lack of originality. Many of the scenes have simply been re-made, based on those in Sword of Gideon. And the attention to detail was totally dissapointing, particularly considering Spielberg is renowned for that. For example, Swiss Bank attendants, and Golda Meier, with an American accent? Not to mention most of the rest of the cast. But it is not worth wasting words on. Check out \\"Sword of Giedeon\\" and you will re-evaluate your high opinion of \\"Munich\\".
B00003CX8U|4.0|With the kinetic edits capturing fully the energy of a Broadway cattle call and punctuated perfectly by George Benson's jazzy version of \\"On Broadway\\", the opening sequence of Bob Fosse's 1979 autobiographical musical extravaganza is so dazzling that the rest of the movie feels like a series of climaxes awaiting the big finish...literally. Fosse, who also co-wrote the script with Robert Alan Arthur, encapsulates his own hectic life into a patently self-indulgent movie with unmistakable style and verve and isolated moments of sheer brilliance. His doppelganger is Joe Gideon, who is juggling a major Hollywood film about a stand-up comic (like \\"Lenny\\") and a major Broadway production starring his ex-wife (like \\"Chicago\\"), while simultaneously dealing with his failing heart and a splintered domestic life. A demanding perfectionist, Gideon drives himself with unbounded energy, a heavy smoking habit and an excess of medications. This leads him to the hospital where he faces a personal abyss monitored by the Angel of Death, here a diaphanous woman named Angelique. Gideon's pending mortality starts to take on the stamp of his own productions until reality and fantasy become indistinguishable.<br /><br />As anyone who has seen \\"8 1/2\\" knows, Fosse's film has a Felliniesque aura about it, but the dancer/director/choreographer brings his own unmistakable brand to the film with his rhythmic pacing, unique choreography and show biz savvy. It's a blend that sometimes works quite well, for example, in the erotically charged \\"Take Off With Us\\" number and the sweet pas de deux between Ann Reinking and Erzsebet Foldi on Peter Allen's \\"Everything Old Is New Again\\". Yet, at other times, Fosse comes across as narcissistic and self-serving, especially during the extensive death sequence set to the Everly Brothers' \\"Bye Bye Love\\". Luckily, Fosse cast Roy Scheider as Gideon, a smart move given the actor's innate lack of vanity makes the character's self-absorption more tolerable. It's a smart performance well turned and not overly excessive given the opportunity. The rest of the cast is serviceable though little more - Broadway veteran Leland Palmer as Gideon's ex-wife Audrey, obviously modeled after the legendary Gwen Verdon; Reinking playing a variation of herself as girlfriend Kate; and Jessica Lange, just after the \\"King Kong\\" fiasco, most alluring as Angelique. The 2003 DVD is fairly modest on extras - scene-specific commentary from Scheider, brief interview snippets with Scheider, and very brief vintage footage of Fosse directing the cattle call sequence.ormance well turned and not overly excessive given the opportunity.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|Director Joel Schumacher and producer Andrew Lloyd Webber are truly angels of music. This film boasts not only a wonderful re-orchestrated soundtrack with a new song and some new music, but a very talented ensamble of performers. While devoted fans maybe disappointed by the re-casting of Christine and the Phantom (originally played by Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford) Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler have a chemistry that captivate the viewer.  Emmy Rossum brings a touch of innocense and naiveness to Christine, while Gerard Butler's rock n roll edged voice gives the phantom his \\"power\\" to \\"control\\".   <br /> <br />The love triangle between Christine, Raoul and the Phantom is the mesmorizing main storyline; however, the smaller storyline of the new owners of the opera populaire proves to be a humorous sideline.  With the climax making some viewers wonder what will just happen next, some viewers may want to keep the tissues nearby for the ending.

B00004VWA7|5.0|May be, there is no body who denies this piece value. <br /> <br />But Be careful~! when do you evaluate & comment on it. <br /> <br />I think that, (as Pat Metheny said) \\"it is difficult for people who weren't around at the time of his emergence to fully weigh the impact of his contribution\\" except someone who has ever seen the jaco's debut and has been on the edge of changes in 'Bass' perfomance style and who run to bass playing.    <br /> <br />People say that usually,  \\"Jaco was the best bass player\\", \\"the best album ever I heard\\", \\"good~! very coo~~~l\\"  <br /> <br />Don't conclude the album is good or bad on impulse. <br /> <br />What you should do, knowing the given condition at Jaco's debut. <br />For example, the change of a bass's role and sound in Fusion/jazz rock bands, on the contrary the role/sound like simple rhythm part in traditional bands.  <br />And it is fantastic to look into the another bass players as compasred with Jaco. Stanley Clarke, Ron Carter, Scott Lafaro and more. <br /> <br />Jaco's playing is very different from another's.

B000002J3W|2.0|After reading all of the stellar reviews, I bought this CD used. I expected much more since Skid Row's debut & Slave To The Grind were great records. This record was released in the mid 90's, and it's obvious the band wasn't sure which direction to go in. This is not a metal record as some of the other reviewers have claimed. One song was punk. Only 2 tracks were melody based, and sounded good. There was a lot of great playing on this record, but no great songwriting. Several of the pieces used odd time signatures ala progressive rock. Many of the pieces tried to borrow from the then hot alternative rock scene. I could here Alice In Chains types of guitar riffs, and big diminished chords ala STP. Boz's singing was more of a raspy hurl then actual singing. Nowhere on this record is a great sustained note like in \\"18 and Life\\". Overall, I am super disappointed, and plan to put this back up for sale.

0440418569|1.0|When I finished reading this book, I felt as if I had invested an awful lot of time into a storyline that had promise but ended up being merely unsatisfying and not a little offensive. <br /> <br />I do not mind fiction books that challenge my Christian beliefs--I welcome it.  I'm mostly annoyed that I never knew which characters in this book to root for--who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?  The characters had no sense of their own moral code, which made them boring and ineffectual.  Am I actually supposed to believe that Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter were heroes??  How can you write a good fantasy story with absolutely no \\"good vs. evil\\"? <br /> <br />And then there are the unresolved loose ends: What about defeating the Authority? (I guess he'll just stay weak and hidden away--why was everyone so eager to topple such a wimpy character anyway?) <br />Wasn't Mary supposed to play the serpent--what happened to that? Those details could have made the story really work. <br /> <br />Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series.  Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries.   What a waste of time.  I can't believe this book actually won awards.  It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly.   <br /> <br />Read this book if you read the first two, but don't expect any sort of exciting, meaningful climax. What a shame. <br />

0671015206|3.0|This book, Millionaire Next Door is an essential read for those wanting to become financially independent. It tells you in straight-forward, well researched ways how to avoid spending your entire life chasing money. <br /> <br />The problem I have though, is that after a hundred pages or so, they keep repeating the same information over and over. The format of the book goes something like this: There are two people, Person A and Person B. Person A has a fancy car(s), a large house, nice clothes, affluent lifestyle, etc. Person B lives in a modest house, drives a used car, and looks like a regular working stiff. It turns out that Person B is the millionaire because he carefully lived below his means, started a successful company, and wisely reviews his financially decisions. Person A simply spends all the money he earns. They then state each person's net worth. This is repeated many many times. <br /> <br />Also, a problem is that they only really focus on entrepreneurs. Granted, entrepreneurs are the group with the most opportunity to become wealthy, but there are other ways. They do say as much in the book, but reading through it, they give only one example of a person who was not an entrepreneur and became financially independent. Furthermore, they don't really say how he became financially independent, only that he did. This is disappointing to me because I am not really interested in being an entrepreneur, but still want to be financially independent(they do say that most people are not cut out to be entrepreneurs). <br /> <br />Again, this is a worthwhile book for anyone, even those who don't want to start a business, but I wish they had provided more information for non-entrepreneurs.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I won't comment on the actual score, because I'll assume if you're considering purchasing this you're familiar with the regular soundtrack.  This is basically an expanded version of the original music, much like the extended edition of the film was to the original.  I would only recommend purchasing this if you've listened to the score several times before and enjoyed it enough to want more.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the music from this trilogy, and have listened to the soundtracks from the other two films hundreds of times, but could never really get into the music for \\"Fellowship,\\" which is why I've only listened to this a couple times and haven't enjoyed it as much as I thought.  This CD set is beautifully put together.  The 45-page book that comes with it is pretty interesting and tells you everything you could want to know about the making of this soundtrack.  The inclusion of the Dolby Surround DVD was a nice touch, and I always use it whenever I want to show off my surround sound speakers to someone.<br /><br />Even though I didn't like the music from this film \\"as much\\" as the other two, it is still an incredible soundtrack, and for anyone who really enjoys it you should consider supplementing your CD with the Complete Recordings.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|The writers went a bit haywire in the last episode but there was something there for everyone, with dream sequences and the tying up of loose ends. The scene where Karen walked in looking fabulous and not a day older than anyone else was classic and absoutely true to the character. The song from Jack and Karen was apt for the relationship they had. Megan is a wonderful singer for those who don't have her CD.......... and Jack can hold a tune too! The end was too sad for words but those of us who have collected the DVDs can relive happy memoroies anytime. Goodnight Gracie - and Will, Jack and Karen...............!
B000F7CMRM|4.0|I felt lost in Syriana, as if I were a small rat in a huge maze.<br /><br />Told through multiple storylines, the film's focus is on oil addiction and how it affects everyone connected with it, from the hardworking Persians in the oil fields to the glutenously rich Sheiks and American tycoons. The bad thing about Syriana is that the message stands out more than the film or -- unfortunately -- its characters. It's a valid message that we need to (must!) hear. We live in a global economy and that economy directly influences other nations. From Russia to China and Iran to the U.S., each action one takes will send waves through the other.<br /><br />Murder and pushing business are co-mingled in Syriana as we see Bob (George Clooney plus 30 pounds) working for the CIA in the Persian Gulf region. He's never asked why he does what he does. He simply knows that he's doing it for the good of his country. But when the U.S. turns its back on Bob, he has to make a decision, and it's something that will change the course of his life.<br /><br />Interspersed with Bob's actions are others whose deeds end up causing deadly results. No fingers are pointed at anyone being at fault for this (one of the big bonuses of the movie), and it is this that pulls the viewer into the story. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) plays an attorney searching for a way to make a large oil company merger happen without attracting legal problems. His hard work and initial goodness are muddled by the end as he discovers what he has to do in order to affect such a merger.<br /><br />Byran Woodman (Matt Damon) is a high level financial advisor for corporate America who loses his son to an accident (?) at an Arab/American party, only to be sucked into the lives of the people responsible for his son's death.<br /><br />There are at least three other side-stories going on, but I'm not going to bother with them for one simple reason: they're too damn confusing! And that's the big downside to Syriana. It tries to make too many connections in too short a time. Several times I had to stop and ask myself, \\"Now what does this guy/gal have to do with the story again?\\" I'm a pretty astute viewer but several of these characters' purposes went beyond my threshold of understanding. For instance, Danny Dalton is played by Tim Blake Nelson (Oh Brother Where Art Thou), but I have no idea what his purpose was in the film. He's got maybe two minutes of screen-time and that's it. And Jeffrey Wright's character (Bennett Holiday) has what I think is a father waiting for him when he gets dropped off at his house and they have some sort of angry altercation for completely unknown reasons. And Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) plays a powerful political figure but how, why, and where he flexes this muscle is never shown nor explained.<br /><br />Making people connections on film is fun and a basic requirement for enjoyable cinematic experiences. But if you overload your audience with these connections, the whole can seem like a bramble of fractured stories that never come to fruition. And that's certainly the way I felt when I saw Syriana.<br /><br />So why the positive review? Look at this: George Clooney, Christopher Plummer, Jeffrey Wright, Chris Cooper, Robert Foxworthy, Matt Damon, Alexander Siddig, Tim Blake Nelson, William Hurt, Amanda Peet, and the list goes on. Now THAT'S an ensemble cast! The acting is excellent.<br /><br />The message of over-dependence on oil is something everyone in the world needs to know about and this movie certainly puts it center stage. The slimy business dealings, the underhanded political tactics, and the jihadists against Western involvement in Eastern affairs are all brought into focus without forcing the issues down our throats. Nice job.<br /><br />With all of the horribly shallow films available for us to watch (ex. DATE MOVIE), this one certainly tips the opposite end of the scale. Just be forewarned, you may feel as though you're in a maze with no reference points and no way out.ou're in a maze with no reference points and no way out.
B0000047CX|4.0|This essential bossa nova  masterwork everyone agrees on in a historical context does miss perfection. Despite the commanding songwriting and singing, this newfound vocabulary of sexy chord changes does slightly replay itself throughout the short disc making for parallel melodies throughout, along with the sumptuous, at times slightly awkward vocal phrasings. This is not to negate the fact that this album is a complete triumph of aesthetics, overpowering any specific gripes with it's liquid smooth tranquility.
6305882592|4.0|\\"Harold and Maude\\" is one of those movies that's hard to categorize. It's a black comedy, an offbeat romance, and a little morality play all in one. There are some really hilarious scenes - my favorite is the part where H&M outwit Harold's uncle, a crazed militarist - and also some touching scenes between the two protagonists.<br /><br />I can't quite give this movie five stars, however, for several reasons. First, the production quality is mediocre at best. Second, while Maude's antics are amusing at a distance, she's not really all that loveable. A lot of her \\"advice\\" seems too much like warmed-over late 60s \\"do what feels good\\" drivel; apparently it's OK to steal cars if you're 79 years old. The Cat Stevens songs are often intrusive and annoying . And finally, the scene with H&M in bed, presumably after having sex, is just ... creepy.
B000002AGN|4.0|Completely fun jazz from maestro Brubeck and company, this will appease any enthusiast of the genre. The stellar re-mastering brings out the true context of their classic Take Five, while the brief disc exchanges between traditional and adventurous tracks, all the while retaining a sense of joy and excitement few artists convey without sounding equally as heavy.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|The Fog was remade in 2005, but I heard the 1979 John Carpenter original was more worth checking out.  I am so glad I did.  What a treat - well-paced, well-plotted, spooky coastal setting, variety of characters and good acting.  This is one of my favorite scary movies.  You will never look at a foggy day the same way again.<br /><br />The story takes place in the small, isolated coastal California town of Antonio Bay.  Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as a promiscuous teenage hitchhiker who becomes caught in the middle of strange events occuring on the eve of Antonio Bay's one-hundredth anniversary celebration.  A small fishing boat and her crew are lost at sea.  The radio station owner, a single mom (Adrienne Barbeau) has her office in the town's lighthouse and has a bird's eye view of the strange, glowing fog.<br /><br />I won't reveal more - see it for yourself.  Brrrrr!!!!!  And close the windows!!!
B00005R23S|5.0|I'm probably one of the few species you'll ever encounter: a 36-year-old African American/American Indian who has loved rock and roll and particularly Bruce's from when I was small! I saw this on TV a few years back, and I've been \\"reborn\\" all over again from just listening to Bruce, his wife singing in the background, the wonderful and awesome saxophone player (I've never known a saxophone to speak to my heart the way this saxophone player does)! Bruce and the E-street band rocks!!  I'm going to get his wife's, Patty Scalfia, CD, as well! It's inspiring to see a female rocker rocking with her husband! In this world of the teen and tween rockers who sing whiny songs, keep showing us all what rock and roll is about, Bruce and the E-Street Band!!
B000005JA8|5.0|A great album, but so bizarre to most folks, when me and my furry freak brothers had an unwanted guest, we'd get 'em real stoned, then put this on.  They were soon outen the door.  Worked every time.
0679720200|5.0|Well, I always feel uncomfortable about writing reviews for classics, so I will let my inferiority complex kick in. I am sure a bunch of very smart people have been writing about this book for decades or centuries, and I am sure they are all correct in their points of view; However, if you can read this book our of pleasure, and not a school assignment, I believe you will enjoy it greatly. Guilt, is one of the psychological tools that are used on us from an early age to try to get us to do the right thing, but, what would happen if a person would be immune to guilt? Read the book.
B000BTC5LW|2.0|If you already have the \\"bootleg\\" DVD don't waste your $ on this, it's only a small bit better.  Quality of the picture is PATHETIC!! <br />Concert itself is wonderful. <br />PF should be ashamed with this! <br />A BIG disapointment
B000089RV6|5.0|This was my first AC/DC album...Maybe not the best choice for a first album, but a good choice nonetheless. I am still on the fence as to whether I like Bon Scott or Brian Johnson better. <br />My favorite tracks on this album are definitely \\"Givin' the Dog a Bone,\\" \\"Back In Black,\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long,\\" although it is all great material. The latter two are the main reasons I added this to my collection, the first song on my mind being \\"You Shook Me All Night Long.\\" <br />Many people say they don't like Brian Johnson because he screams and, according to one rather amusing reviewer, \\"sounds like a cat with this b@lls in a vice.\\" But hey, people--that's the sound they're going for. That goes for all the people who say Bon Scott only screams, too. If you think these AC/DC songs would sound better sung by someone like Robin Zander or David Lee Roth, you have another thing coming (No disrespect to Cheap Trick or Van Halen, by the way...they stand with AC/DC among some of my favorite bands). <br />And some reviewers say the music is too simplistic, nothing special, etc...Sometimes it's the simplicity that makes it sound good, you know...but then again what sounds good and what doesn't is an opinion I suppose. <br />Speaking of which, I am perfectly aware that you one-star reviewers are entitled to your opinion as much as anyone else. However, to say \\"AC/DC sucks\\" would be a complete fallacy and totally out of line. If AC/DC really sucked, then I really don't think they would have made it very far. It's the same ideology as the constant Red Sox fans vs. Yankees fans battle--if either of them sucked, then they wouldn't have made it to the playoffs. Do you get what I'm saying? <br />Of course, this review otherwise has no relevance to baseball. <br />So there's my review...Hope you enjoyed it...but if you're a supeficial jerk who doesn't think before he/she talks, then maybe you didn't... <br />Oh, by the way--LOSER is spelled L-O-S-E-R. You really are a total loser if you can't spell that.

0060763280|3.0|Some good advice, but I felt Eker flogged excessively the promotion of his more expensive seminars.  It's like the book is an appetizer but the $$$ seminars are the main course.  Some of the advice is hokie in terms of, \\"Put your hand over your heart, then pat your head.\\"  What's next, the hokie pokey?  Not a bad book, though, to reframe people's thinking about sound ways to accumulate wealth.
0740748475|4.0|I luv Calvin and Hobbes, so though it has few drawbacks I still like this complete collection very much.. <br /> <br />Pro: <br />Complete collection in one package. <br />Good for an archival. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />Very bulky (23 pounds) <br />hard bound is not really a hard bound, so you need to be carefull while using it, else the pages may comeout. <br />you cannot really read it lying anywhere, require some patience to handle these heavy books.
B00000K0DT|5.0|This is a thoroughly entertaining movie that will keep you guessing. Kevin Spacey is perfect in this movie, and Benicio Del Torro and Gabriel Bryne do well in it too. The plot seems to be nothing out of the ordinary action/hiest/shoot-em-up movie plot that is found all to frequently in today's movie theaters, but the ending is what makes this movie a notable one. All great movies should have great endings, and this one does.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|...and it's finally here. My summer is complete. After catching a terrific Gilmour concert at Radio City a few months ago (both Nick Mason AND Richard Wright performed as well!) I was craving to see the Floyd in concert again. I wonder if that's the last time I'll ever see Pink Floyd live again. <br />\\"Pulse\\" absolutely rocks! The video transfer and audio are as good as one could expect from a fifteen year old recording. A \\"must have\\" DVD for every Floyd fan. But I can't help but be greedy. I have to agree with a previous customer who asked, \\"Where is the 'Delicate Sound of Thunder' DVD?\\" That concert video was by far the best concert video of Pink Floyd and I pray it one day makes its way to a modern disk format.
B00006JKOL|5.0|THE BAND: Ian Anderson (vocals, flute, acoustic guitar), Martin Barre (guitars), Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond (bass), John Evan (piano & organ), Barriemore Barlow (drums & percussion). Orchestra arrangements written & conducted by David Palmer.<br /><br />THE DISC: (1975) Originally 7 songs clocking in at approximately 45 minutes, this (2002) digitally remastered edition contains 5 bonus tracks (an additional 13 minutes). Included with the disc is a 14-page booklet containing original artwork, song titles/credits, song lyrics and a 1-page intro from Ian Anderson. Label - Chrysalis Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Another original classic Tull release. \\"Minstrel\\" continues with the string-orchestrated song structures of \\"Warchild\\" but with more detail and serious flare. It's also probably the most acoustic-oriented Tull album. As it turns out, this was bassist Hammond's last album (chose the role of artist/painter instead). Tull's marathon of a song - \\"Baker St. Muse\\" (16+ minutes) - has 4 sub-sections - Pig-Me and the Whore / Nice Little Tune / Crash-Barrier Waltzer / Mother England Reverie - it's a stunner... it is all CLASSIC Jethro Tull... slow, fast, hard, soft, electric, acoustic, flute, orchestra, wit and charm all rolled into one song... one of my favorites in his entire catalog of music. The title track might well be the best known tune on the record, but it's not my favorite here. There are way too many deep album gems... songs that never got much credit whether on compilations or concert tours (not including 1975-76 on this particular tour). Great songs include \\"Cold Wind To Valhalla\\" (brilliant acoustic guitar and flute); \\"Black Satin Dancer\\" (with enough cow bell to make Will Ferrell and Christopher Walken smile from that old Blue Oyster Cult \\"SNL\\" skit) - one of my all-time favorite songs here and some of Anderson's best flute playing in my opinion; and the delicate \\"One White Duck / O=Nothing At All\\" with it's beautiful orchestral arrangement. The bonus tracks fit right in with the rest of the album. 3 of the bonus tracks are studio songs... mostly acoustic guitars with orchestra and vocals. The remaining 2 songs are shorter excerpts of the title track and \\"Cold Wind To Valhalla\\" presented 'live' - though you won't hear any audience. This remastered edition sounds like it was recorded last year (not decades ago) - awesome! Classic Tull (5-stars).acks fit right in with the rest of the album. 3 of the bonus tracks are studio songs... mostly acoustic guitars with orchestra and vocals.

B0000C8AVR|5.0|This is my favorite Bob Dylan album. The album begins and ends with two of the greatest songs ever, Like a Rolling Stone and my favorite Desolation Row. Sandwiched in between are some fantastic songs. The album is filled with incredible lyrics,wonderful music, and a mean harmonica. If you want to know why Bob Dylan is a legend buy this album.
B000ESSTL0|5.0|He leido con mas atencion, las criticas sobre la remasterizacion de este disco, que algunos dicen que el sonido, en comparacion con la edicion antigua de Sire, es igual; mientras que la version de Mute, la nueva remasterizacion es superior que a la antigua version, creo que si y no.  Si, porque en la gran mayoria de los temas suenan excelentes y con una solida remasterizacion de Simon Heyworth, a pesar de que es levemente inferior que al sonido de \\"The singles '86 - '98\\". Digo casi muy buena, porque en \\"Personal Jesus\\" suena muy inferior que al resto de los temas, y además en la parte final, suena una guitarra que se interrumpre bruscamente y eso no tenia en el disco original. No se si se han dado cuenta del error, por lo menos en las nuevas versiones de Mute (UK).
B000F7CMRM|1.0|This is the most disappointing movie I have seen for a long time, in fact, after an hour and a half of trying to understand what it was about, I decided that sleep was a better way to use my time. It had me nodding off anyway. <br /> <br />I don't see the point in all these seemingly unconected storylines that just serve to confuse rather than anything else. Confusing and boring, especially when I was expecting a thriller. <br /> <br />It seems the makers were adhearing to the rule that if you have a poor movie, if you fill it with a cast peo@ple know and love it will pull through. Clooney, Damon and even Plummer could not pull it off with this lemon. <br /> <br />Oh yes, and if you don't speak Urdu, Farsi and Arabic, you will also have the joy of trying to follow a disjointed film while squinting at the tiny whit subtitles which are set against light backgrounds for most of their appearance. Whose bright idea was that, then? <br /> <br />All in all, and awful movie.
B000ESSTKG|5.0|I'm very impressioned for the incredible critics with 1 star. Only one thing, if you want buy the remaster, so, why do you criticed the sound of the album in a time of bad critics, only saying no SACD. It's absurd.  <br />

This book let me get a peek at the back stage life of the actors, as well as the secrets to the technical aspects.

B000ESSTKQ|4.0|Realmente estoy impresionado por las criticas de varios discos remasterizados de varios artistas, uno de ellos es de Depeche Mode, las quejas son absurdas, como por ejemplo por que no lo editaron en SACD o en CD, deberian hablar sobre la calidad del sonido. Aqui en Chile, los \\"deluxe edition\\" de Depeche Mode, aun no han sido editados debido a que solamente estan en PAL, y en Chile se usa formato NTSC.  Un ejemplo, yo tengo las nuevas ediciones de \\"Beggars banquet\\" y \\"Let it bleed\\" de The Rolling Stones, son solamente ediciones DSD, pero encuentro un gran sonido y limpieza que resulta una belleza que se disfruta mucho mas de las antiguas ediciones. Hay algunos discos que se han editado en SACD y en esos casos, el sonido deja mucho que desear. Sobre Depeche Mode, pronto les hare una opinion sobre estas remasterizaciones, ya que desgraciadamente aun no los obtenido, bueno, en realidad no han llegado a Chile. Como dice Terence Reardon: No counter reviews!!!  P.D.: Las 4 estrellas es por el album.
B0007OASII|5.0|Well, there's not much I can add that others haven't already stated here.  This is an amazing cd. If you're a metal/hard rock fan, this cd won't disappoint.  The production, the playing, the arrangements, the singing (Roy Khan, what a voice; they are all first rate.  There are so many exceptional songs here, it's hard to fit them all in, but 'March of Mephisto', 'Memento Mori' and the title track 'The Black Halo' are my faves.<br /><br />One other thing that deserves mentioning here is the guitar player for this band; Thomas Youngblood.  While he's no Yngwie or EVH, this guy is incredible.  His solo's are never 'over the top', they are always *perfect*, fitting the song just right.  Always tasteful and frequently blazing, but never too much nor too little.  Very impressive stuff from this guy and this band.  Wish I could give it 6 stars.  Amazing stuff.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I have not seen many Steve McQueen movies to date, but I hope to see more now. Frank Keller won an Oscar for editing for \\"Bullitt\\" and I can see why. It's hard to describe what makes great editing, but you know it when you see it. Sometimes a shot will go on a bit longer than you expect it to, and, after viewing the shot, you realize how effective it was. There are several such shots in this movie. \\"Bullitt\\" features one of the most famous car chases in movie history (with McQueen doing his own driving!) and it really is excellent. Jacqueline Bisset's character doesn't add a lot to the plot, but she is nice to look at. I also enjoyed Simon Oakland (who played a recurring character on \\"The Rockford Files\\") as McQueen's boss.
0062502182|5.0|In this day and age it seems we all seek instant and external means for gratification and happiness... whether it be \\"keeping up with the Jones\\" buying bigger and better \\"things\\" then being surrounded by all of these \\"things\\" and the financial burdens of these meaningless objects leave us empty and yearning for the next best \\"thing\\". Some of us look for our happiness in another person and when again we are left empty we move on in search of the ever elusive person who is bound to bring us happiness.  The magic and truth of this book is that all of our dreams can come true if we take the time and do the work to search within ourselves for the true happiness.

B000FIMG68|5.0|Season 2 of Lost was on par, if not a little superior to the first season. I'm not sure why everyone is complaining. If they answered the questions your whineing about, there would be no show. The mystery, and trying to fit the peices together is part of the beauty of Lost. This season advances the plot, in a more mature fashion than the first season; it takes 3 or 4 good episodes to lay the ground work for 1 or 2 episodes that paid off huge. What we learn about the drug plane, hatch, others, Claire, Island's healing powers, how they got there, what Kate did, etc. was great. This is probably the best written show on TV (that isn't Scrubs). I highly recommend this set.
0440214041|4.0|Now this is a good story - I picked up this book at work and started reading on a Saturday morning and didn't stop until I had finished the book. <br /> <br />The author takes Darby Shaw and the reader on a roller coaster of adventure. After reading a book like this it's hard to not be suspicious of any politicians death or unexpected retirement as being part of some dark and unseemly plot.   <br /> <br />You know that character development is good when you are rooting for Darby to not only survive but get to the bottom of the scheme she is uncovering.
0451169514|5.0|IT---5 STARS    Ok, IT is really a GREAT book. The book is monstrous. The first 50 pages were pretty intense, starts off really good. I just want to get this cleared up right now, IT is NOT scary!!!!!  Lot of people say it is scary, but by no means is that true. This book is ALL about character development. There are seven characters in this book, and king emphasizes on each character in much depth. The chapters go back and forth from 1958-1985. He does this effortlessly, in a way where he does not, lose the reader. There were parts of this book, where I was frustrated, bc I was expecting some scary stuff, but after I got over the fact that this book is not like that, I truly enjoyed IT. He makes you feel a connection to each and every character. After the character development, IT heats up....around the 900 page mark; you won't want to put this book down. There are also \\"interludes\\" throughout the book, which describe things that have happened in DERRY throughout the years. The ending of this book is written so well, I couldn't put it down. now, some of the things that happened toward the end I don't agree with, and feel that it got kind of silly, but the way that it is written, is truly a thing of beauty. He keeps you clutching that big book, eager to turn to the next page. The night before i finished this book, I was upset and eager to finish IT. But as I read those last 100 pages I was happy IT was over. IT'S A long read, but its well worth it.     PROS: The writing technique in this book is of sheer perfection. King makes you fall in love with each and every character.    CONS: Some things that happen in the ending, are so ridiculously silly, that it really did not do this book justice.    I have just started THE SHINING..look for my review shortly
1932907009|5.0|In Save The Cat, Blake Snyder has a way of explaining what can be dry and hard to understand information from other screenwriting books as if he's a friend who has written a letter sharing the inside secrets of screenwriting.  <br /> <br />For some reason no matter how many books I read on the 3 act structure, I couldn't completely understand what I needed to put between the act breaks.  On page 69, Mr. Snyder explains when he first learned the 3 act structure he needed \\"more islands, shorter swims.\\"  He seemed to understand exactly what I was having problems with, and he gave concrete instructions to follow to complete my spec script with confidence that I haven't left out anything. <br /> <br />I'm so glad I read this book.  I'm excited about writing again.

B000002B7U|5.0|I've read some pretty harsh reviews of The Ultimate Sin.  I'm pretty dissapointed that Ozzy's own fans would write such negative crapola about this album.   <br /> <br />Look, I've read that even Ozzy isn't crazy about this album, but he's his own worst critic.  As a fan of his work, I extremely love this album because it was my gateway to metal.  I was tired of the other garbage being shoved down my throat by MTV at the time. <br /> <br />Here's my take on it.  It's a solid metal album.  It kicks buttocks from start to finish.  Contrary to other people's opinions, there is nothing \\"eighties\\" about it.  A bit overproduced?  Maybe. glammie? possibly some parts.  However, with all that said, it still craps all over anything else dished out at the time... You want more bass?  Jack up the bass button on your stereo...  <br /> <br />The bottom line is that the song writing is well done, jake's guitar playing rocks and randy's drum fills are like a barrage of canon fire and there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the bass either.  Reign in Blood and Ride the Lightning didn't have that much bass either, you gonna knock those albums too? Many, many people over analyse this album with rubbish like, \\"You can tell they weren't getting along well, that's why the album suffered, blah, blah, blah.\\" What the HELL do you know, where YOU there?  <br /> <br />While every other band was busy making music to score with the chicks and get more groupies, Ozzy was creating metal for everyone to enjoy.  This is one of the few albums I've been able to embrace and not feel embarassed to have played it as a kid.  I would feel pretty stupid if I was listening to Poison or the Crue even.  Sorry, but you just don't look cool, listening to \\"Kick Start My Heart\\" or \\"Unskinny Bop\\" (Thank God for Grunge, man).  I still crank it up, it's Ozzy for Christ sake. <br /> <br />If you haven't heard it, check it out.  If you're an Ozzy fan and don't like it, quit whining about it...
0201721481|3.0|This book starts out well, explaining the topics clearly and without a lot of unnecessary repetition. Unfortunately, the writing style chops and changes throughout the book with the worst written sections being a real chore to plough your way through.<br /><br />Towards the later chapters, it seems as though the authors try to pad out the book as much as possible, repeating points ad nauseam, without adding any new insights. Many of the sentences are structured in unnatural and convoluted ways, severely detracting from the subject content. Most sections of the book could easily be reduced in length by 30%-50% without losing any information, simply by presenting the material concisely and cutting out the repetitive waffle.<br /><br />If you value your time and already have a foundation in C, I suggest the book \\"Thinking in C++\\" by Bruce Eckel.<br /><br />Otherwise the book does serve as quite a good reference.<br /><br />Spelling mistakes and coding errors were fairly minimal, with perhaps only a few every hundred pages or so.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. After watching it for over an hour, I had no idea what the heck was going on. It was so disjointed and the editing so awful that I had trouble following the characters and their motives. Compare this movie with Crash, which also had several apparently unrelated mini-stories within the story, but which was easy to follow and all made sense. I think George's political agenda got the better of him with this, but it at least garnered him an Academy Award.
B0009HKH6Q|3.0|I must admit I wasn't expecting much from this movie. But, once again Steve leaves you stunned. He slips in and out of the picture before you know he's there. Faye Dunaway does a great job as the dective out to catch the thief. The movie opens with a classic bank robbery. From there on the plot thickens. No matter what Dunaway tries, steve maneges to outrank her. And, the cat and mouse game continues. But, will steve get away with his little scheme, or will Faye convince him to turn himself in. I wont tell you the ending, but I can say that it will leave you satisfied. Its no wonder they got P.B. to do the remake. This film definitly deserves a second run. The Thomas Crown affair is fun, and slick entertainment. That is if you can understand what they're saying. But, never the less, you shouldn't miss this one.
0875428940|4.0|If you have pagan leanings, you might enjoy the Robin Wood tarot. I absolutely adore the depiction of the Queen of Swords. I think Robin nailed the Q of S's personality quite well and with more expression and depth than any of the Rider Waite varieties. I also like Wood's Magician better than the more traditional stylings. But I only gave this 4 stars because there are some card depictions that are kind of goofy looking to me such as The Wheel of Fortune and The Chariot (his facial expression struck me recently as goofy). All in all, though, it's a fine deck.
1594200823|5.0|I tend to be very careful about recommending books that deal with food to a wide audience -- being vegeterian I am sensitive about pushing literature that has an angle.    This one, however, is unique to any other food book I have read -- it does not attempt to change the reader's diet, political stance etc, it only makes you think about the choices you make and and wakes you up to how important they really are. It is beautifully written and even information that could be very dry is woven in perfectly. He connects everything seamlessly, so even though there are four seperate parts, they feed of each other.    When I read other reviews that said it is a life changing book I thought, \\"Yeah, ok, sure.\\" I have read up on food, taken sustainable development courses, etc. - I doubted it would change my view of food that much. But it really did alter the way I think about food permanently. Not in an \\"Oh, this and that is so horrible\\" way, but in a really positive one--which is not what most books I have read have done. It is very thoughtful, careful, and thorough, but never overly analytical in a way that would make it a hard read.    Defiently one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read, and the first book ever that made me go back and write a review.
B000002VCU|4.0|Having listened to the majority of albums by THE ALAN PARSON'S PROJECT its impossible to not be aware of the sentimentality and melodrama at the heart of the music. Considering Parson's emerged from engineering duties for amongst others PINK FLOYD one may have expected a little edge to the compositions. But even on potentially atmospheric and dark concept pieces like TALES OF MYSTERY AND IMAGINATION the overall impression is just to bright.  I think TURN OF A FRIENDLY CARD is just about the best synthesis of Parson's production excesses and ERIC WOOLFSON'S syrupy lyrical style. Where things fall down is when the bombast and drama of the music make way for such lyrical ideas. Fortunately on the superb track NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE, Parson's wisely accompanies the wonderful lyrics with a simple acoustic guitar. This track remains for me the finest accomplishment of the Project. Also excellent are the title track (itself a big hit single in the USA) and yet another Edgar Allan Poe effort THE GOLD BUG, which has an atmospheric spaghetti western quality to it. The first four tracks are as one would expect, relatively dull and over-produced, even the epic TIME just doesn't quite satisfy. The Project are on firmer and safer ground with hypnotic instrumentals and minimalist production values. Unfortunately this combination is rare. As for concept, the album is interesting, with outstanding cover artwork. And also listen out for the intro to SNAKE EYES, which is surely a tongue in cheek reference to MONEY.
0671027387|1.0|You are smarter than this, you really are. You'll figure out plot points many pages before they happen, sometimes even chapters before they happen. Oh, you'll hope the author of The DaVinci Code might have an ingenious twist or two up his sleeve in this earlier effort, but  he does not. At least not one that isn't painfully obvious. And the ending... so... bad... ughhhh... it  hurts... oh, dear God... it hurts... so much... please, make it... stop...<br /><br />If you are discerning in the least, take your memories of The DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons and your money and walk away, just walk away, and no one will get hurt.<br /><br />Then again, if you are looking for a literary lobotomy Deception Point may just be the ticket.
B000784WMW|5.0|I had a \\"Jane Eyre-a-thon\\" and watched several versions of this story back to back.  While I feel the very best film of this is the Welles/Fontaine version of the 1940s, I agree wholeheartedly with the glowing ecstatic review of \\"Borovnian Heir.\\"  This is a definitive version of Jane Eyre.  Very thorough and true to the beloved book.<br /><br />I do very much like the tone and the visual stylishness of the Orson Wells/Joan Fontaine version, but I agree that the actress, THIS Jane Eyre, Zelah Clarke is the perfect fit, and because this is a miniseries, we feel as if we are living with her day by day.<br /><br />Orson Wells was a great Rochester - he had a dislikable quality that fits with Rochester as written, and his looks are \\"jolie laide\\" (handsome ugly).  Here, Timothy Dalton succeeds as Rochester in spite of his craggy handsomeness.  James Bond is one of the most handsome men in the world, after all... but if one looks at what was considered handsome in THAT day and age, he was not it.  Handsome men of that time were usually pale and soft.  So he works, and he is spellbinding to watch.  His personal qualities as an actor suit Rochester well.<br /><br />The supporting cast is great, and you'll be surprised to see Judy Cornwall - Daisy from \\"Keeping Up Appearances\\" as a very frustrated and sympathetic Aunt.  This version of the Aunt is perhaps not what Bronte envsioned, but she is very real and nuanced.  This is not an evil woman, but a small minded woman who just doesn't know what to do with children.  The child Jane is very good here, very headstrong and her role progesses nicely to help us see her as both difficult and sympathetic.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke alone makes this one of the best versions, and it is certainly the most comprehensive version, beautifully showcased on this DVD.
B000F5GO0A|5.0|Ovo je album koji obara na prvo slusanje. Nesto najbolje sto se desilo u 2006 pored albuma Rabbit Fur Coat. Amerikanac koji je inspirisan Balkanom, album nastao u Mexicu, a on nastupa pod imenom Beirut... :)Odlicno i uvrnuto! <br />Najbolje novo ime na muzickoj sceni!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|After seeing it, went right out and purchased Firefly, the complete season.  <br /> <br />Both movie and series are incredible works, suspenseful, lots of twists, action, deep themes embedded. What a treat -- did not even know to give the series a look until I saw the movie. <br /> <br />Go view it now. <br /> <br />Only big minus is that after you see the movie and entire first season, you will itch for more Serenity.

B000059Z8J|5.0|This movie about Superman remains one of the, if not the, best comic based movie ever.  It's special effects have been outdone and its dialog is no longer what is said, but its themes are still relevant today.  It set the standard of excellence in this genre and has yet to be outdone.  Great cast with great characters.  Great action.  Great story.  Has both drama and humor.  Great for your collection.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|i am 15 and i listen to death metal, blackend metal, speed metal, and many other types.  but i have now and always will have a place in my heart for the beatles.  as much as i like Behemoth, Megadeth, Children of Bodom i feel that the beatles were the best band ov all time.  so why not own the best of the best.  the beatles are great for any age.  buy it.  you are only hurting yourself.  my pen name is Bo-Bo and i approve this message
B0000UJDLM|4.0|I enjoyed this movie when I was young, so I purchased it so my children could enjoy it too. They absolutely love this movie. It had been awhile since I saw it, and I forgot how much I enjoyed it. Highly recommend for the family.

B00005J8JL|5.0|I love this album, and am so glad to finally see a miniature LP reissue.  The die cut cover will remind you of the Stones' Some Girls and is a 'pocket' that holds the two cardboard sleeves with artwork on both sides.  Each disc has a full color swan song logo.  Expensive, but worth it.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Tool, as you know, is, by all rights, an excellent band, one of the few \\"prog\\"esque bands that happen to be really fun to listen. fun to rock, and fun to be a fan of. It's been 5 years since Lateralus and this album is good enough to keep being absolutely loyal to Tool's work, but I was really waiting for some more crunch on the songs (especially when I read that Tool's members said that, after seeing Mike Patton's Fantomas on stage, thay wanted to make a heavier album than the previous ones). <br /> <br />Member by member speaking, I think Lateralus was Danny Carey's and Justin Chancellor's album. Aenima was Maynard's, and... this is definitely Adam Jone's turn on the bat. Im sure a lot of people think that Jones work doesnt compare to the technical level of Danny and Justin.... until now. Just hear to \\"Jambi\\" and \\"Vicarious\\" and you'll see how great this guy's guitar work can be. This time his work is really, really relevant, more than ever. And we cant deny the fact that, unlike a lot \\"guitar gods\\" over there, Adam Jones has a copy righted \\"touch\\", you can tell hes playing a song since the first second of listening. <br /> <br />Aside of the great presentation of the cd (it comes along with stereoscopical glasses and great cover work),I recommend you to buy this album for the music it has inside. Maybe it doesnt have the diversity and edge of Aenima or the fusion of fury and melody of Lateralus, but its a great cd, considering the fact that we've had to wait so much for this one this time... 5 years, god, this guys are great enough to release a new album every year... but that wouldnt be TOOL at all. I recommend: Jambi, The pot, Vicarious, and why not? Lost Keys.
B000AWYOGE|3.0|When a newly-divorced woman moves into a creepy apartment with her young daughter, she must contend with sinister neighbors, migraine headaches, a stressful custody battle, and, perhaps, a vengeful ghost.  The cast is very good and the atmosphere is creepy, but there just isn't much to this story.  The narrative becomes confused by some plot elements that amount to nothing--why did the lawyer lie about being with his family?  Was the husband really plotting something with the suspicious teenagers?  It's a decent film, but nothing special.
B0000027RL|5.0|This band is pure. They do not deserve to be labelled 'grunge' as so many mediocre rock acts of the same time period were. To me, the whole grunge scene was like Pearl Jam's embarassing mother. This band had more to offer than boring guitar riffs and meaningless lyrics portrayed by half-hearted screaming, and Vedder and co. really shine on the album 'Ten'. The first four tracks are as heavy as this album gets. From the outrageous opener 'Once' to the classic anthem 'Alive', the band really credit themselves with intelligent melodies and powerful delivery right from the off. The album then goes into another dimension altogether. When the fifth track 'Black' fades out towards the end, what more can you do but bow down to this emotional epic. Then, just as you begin to get into the album, 'Jeremy' hits you with a surprise; you're jaw left hurting, dropped wide open. This song is probably one of the most amazing ballads I have ever heard. It opens bluntly in a way that leaves you curious as to why the heartfelt lyrics are being delivered in such a strange manner; almost happy. Then the song breaks down towards the end, and the emotion spills out right from its core. The frantic final passage is almost too quick for you to take in as the song is stopped dead in its tracks by the clean guitar outro and the suspence is over. 'Porch' is another good track, and the incredibly mellow 'Garden' paves the way for the end of this rollercoaster record. The final track 'Release' lets you reflect upon the album, and as Vedder sings 'Release Me' for the last time, I would advise you to release the disc from your CD player very shortly after as the second part to that song (also heard at the beginning of the album) can become very boring.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|\\"Aeon Flux\\" could have been so much that the movie was not, but I wonder if the movie really sucked as bad as some would say. Was it a classic sci-fi in the league of \\"Star Wars\\", \\"The Matrix\\" or others? No. On the other hand, it was not that bad either, to be honest.<br /><br />The premise is that about 99% of all humanity has been wiped out in a great plague and that there is only one city left: Bregna. In Bregna, people live in a healthy, utopian dream and they never venture outside the walls. The city is ruled by one family, the Goodchilds, who rule in benevolent guidance and look after everyone. Or so it seems. The Monicans are the resistance to the Goodchilds and work acts of violence and destruction.<br /><br />This movie has some definite things going for it, besides Charlize Theron in some very revealing clothing. The action sequences are excellent, and they are of the highest quality. On this basis alone, \\"Aeon Flux\\" could hold its own against most other films with fight sequences in them. The action is also fairly high paced, with few periods of dry or dull monotony.<br /><br />The special effects are also excellently executed, and worth a look. The creativity of different weapons and gadgets would satisfy most Trekkies, I think. The advanced technology portrayed was not so different from our own time, with some recognisable items there. However, it was different enough to give you something of the unreal and dreamlike.<br /><br />The striking thing for this viewer was the contrast between the frenetic intensity of the Monicans with their drive to rebel, and the mindless acceptance of everything by the majority of the population. Later in the movie, even this contrast is shattered when Aeon Flux starts to question the mission that she is sent on by the Monican Handler. Black and white/Them and us start to take on a more blurred aspect, complicating a simple dichotomy of friend and foe. The movie succeeds in raising some issues for thought.<br /><br />I thought the ending was a bit simplistic and corny. If I had a criticism of the movie, that would be it. I was left feeling a little less than satisfied with the way that the movie resolved itself. However, taken overall, I would have to say that this is more than counterbalanced by the earlier parts of the movie.<br /><br />In short, be cautious if you are buying it, I would not watch it a lot of times, but it is worth a couple of viewings, at least. I would not be shy on the hiring side of it, and see what you think. It may not be your thing, but I definitely enjoyed it.<br />I thought the ending was a bit simplistic and corny.

B0001XAS1M|5.0|How does one describe Meat Loaf without sounding trite and cliche? To call him original would be mere understatement as there was no one like him before him, and no one like him after him. Meat Loaf does not sing Jim Steinmans' songs he devours them-he swallows them whole and when he releases them what emerges is a primal scream that soars to the heavens then down to the bowels of hell and back again. I always suspected that Mr Loaf is not of this earth but a demonic choirboy from some other galaxy and praise be to however, whoever, or whatever sent him our way so we mere mortals can stand at his altar transfixed and yes even terrified and elevated by his larger than life presence shaking as he performs his music like, like A BAT OUT OF HELL. <br /> <br />Meat Loaf should be considered a National Treasure as well as this CD.
B000E8NQUE|2.0|Well shame on the people involved in this \\"SACD Deluxe Edition\\" project. Oh, maybe that's a little harsh.<br /><br />First off, as another Amazon reviewer noted, the sound has been aggressively compressed, which means, by the time you've reached the later stages of the album, you may experience some ear fatigue. The sound is unrelenting and it changes the original dynamics. I felt like I was hearing a whole new mix. A sign of over compressing. Has the whole music industry gone compression nuts? Or, were the Moody Blues simply worried that their back catalogue (the big 7) was lacking in musical muscle, and super charging it with heavy compression is the answer? Or both?<br /><br />On the EQ front, there's some added EQ to the bass and kick drum, giving me a whole new appreciation for the Moody Blues rhythm section. This \\"intense\\" re-mastering really benefited the \\"Dear Diary\\" thru \\"To Share Our Love\\" section of the album, which is usually, my least favorite part. So it's not all bad. In fairness, their albums always did lack a bit, in the bottom end, but now they don't.<br /><br />One more thing about aggressive compression, this also happened about a year ago when I bought the EMI \\"re-master\\" of Deep Purple's 1973 album \\"Who Do We Think We Are.\\" By the time I got towards the end, my ears were tired. So, recently I bought the gold disc version which avoids over compression, and it not only sounded better, but my ears weren't tired by the end. But, since the Moodies don't play as loud as Purple, it shouldn't be a problem. Now that I got that off my chest...<br /><br />Secondly, the \\"SACD Deluxe Edition\\" bonus track enticement, just ticks me off to no end. Sure, there are some good rare tracks here. The BBC stuff is very nice to hear for the long time fan who only know these songs one way. But, the first five bonus cuts may take away some of  the mystery of the album. It's like when watching \\"the making\\" of a movie, and it just takes away the magic if you will, at least for me.<br /><br />Thirdly, as another Amazon reviewer noted, the great cover artwork has been ruined by the people in charge of reproducing the cover! The cover images have been reproduced way too light so that nearly all the detail has been faded! But, the booklet is really nice, with many color photos, insightful stories and lots of studio information.<br /><br />In conclusion, after hearing a number of these \\"SACD Deluxe Editions,\\" I'll be keeping my old (1997) re-masters, after all, they still look and sound great.

0887308589|3.0|I usually enjoy Dilbert comics from the paper and expected a lot out of this book, but it didn't meet my expectations. Some of the comics are really funny and made me laugh out loud. However as I progressed through the chapters, I found the same basic theme repeating itself over and over again - that managers are idiots with bird sized brains and their only purpose in life is to make their employees miserable. To make things worse, Adams' prose and business advice is quite bad to read through. Maybe I didn't enjoy this book because I work in an office with few people who are all technical - no HR, no marketing and no sales. But I could relate to many situations described.     This book is strictly for office goers.

B0002W18MU|5.0|I think its a tad insulting to insinuate that people give this album five stars out of some kind of obligation to Johnny Cash as opposed to its actual merrit.  I also am a little incenced with critics who say that this album is not a fitting introduction to Johnny Cash as opposed his earlier works.  That Johnny Cash didn't make this album and there is no single album or collection of songs to introduce one to the many men that were Johnny Cash.  Instead of criticisizng this album for what it isn't, critique it for what it is. <br />This is an album about death.  If you live in Austin you might have been lucky enough to catch a 2 hour special about Cash on KGSR in which he spoke with wonder and awe about Jimmie Rodgers recording TB Blues, which was recorded in a session where Rodgers had to lie down between takes because he was so weak.  Anyone who has heard the recordings will understand why Cash remembered them 50 years later and why they have stayed in existance for a country fan like myself to have heard them despite being born 40 years after his death.  This record is Johnny Cash's TB Blues--an often painful, powerful, at times uncomfortable full face foward look at death.  Does he struggle with his voice, occassionally missing notes, yes, but then again he always did and that is part of living when you are dying.   <br />This is not an album for the feint of heart.  There are tracks which will leave you crying and some that will leave you trembling.  Its not an album that is easy to take all at once and is often best enjoyed in small doses.  But it is a fitting legacy of art and honesty to a man who made it his life's work to give us both.

B00097A5I6|3.0|It's hard to hear this album and know that its the same band that brought us \\"Whats the story morning glory\\", because the truth is that oasis has been in a decline since that record. \\"Heathen Chemistry\\", with the exception of \\"Stop crying your heart out\\" was a bad album, and both \\"the masterplan\\" and \\"Standing on the shoulders of giants\\" didn't do anything for me. I was really hoping that this record would be their comeback, but sadly i was disappointed yet again. To be fair, the album is the best thing the band has put out since \\"Be Here Now\\" (which featured the fabulous \\"Stand by me\\") and there are some good songs here. \\"Mucky fingers\\" is the catchiest thing the band has done in a long time, and \\"Lyla\\" is an enjoyable, if unoriginal single, but most of the album is simply boring. \\"love like a bomb\\", \\"the meaning of soul\\", \\"part of the queue\\", and \\"a bell will ring\\" are all forgettable trite, and the good moments such as the opener \\"Turn up the sun\\" are over far too quickly. <br /> <br />\\"The importance of being idle\\" and \\"guess god thinks im abel\\" are decent songs, but the truth is that the old oasis sound is gone. It's been gone since \\"Be here now\\", and the spark the band had throughout the entire \\"Morning glory\\" album is nowhere to be seen. It really feels like the band is only going through the motions, and if thats true then maybe its time Oasis hung it up for good. I may or may not be right in thinking that, and the brilliant closer \\"Let there be love\\" makes me think that the band may still have it in them. The song has Liam and Noel sharing the mic, and the result is the best thing oasis has done in years. <br /> <br />In the end the album is far better than the bands last three releases, but if you're short on cash i would recommend leaving this album on the shelf and perhaps downloading the aforementioned highlights. Hardcore Oasis fans should probably have this, but if you're hoping for the next \\"Morning glory\\" you will surely be disappointed.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I love this show, It is such a sham to see it go. I really hope they bring out the rest of the DVD's i would really like to own them all.  <br />Even if you have never seen this show. I would recamend it. It's that good. You will want to watch it over and over.
B0000542DJ|5.0|This is probably the most disturbing film I have ever seen and I don't mean that in a bad way. On the contrary, JFK is a very powerful & captivating film that ALL Americans should be encouraged to watch.  I won't try to give the particulars of this movie becuz there are other reviewers here who are much better at that than I.  What I will say is that there is alot of info in this movie that you will probably never hear in a history class and for good reason.  It simply makes certain factions of our government look downright evil. Oliver Stone may have taken some liberties with the facts(most of hollywood does), but just like he said in an interview once, if even some of what's portrayed in the movie is true, it would be proof that a conspiracy actually existed and should be a huge wake up call to the nation.  Any clear thinking individual (whether right or left) who sees this movie, should walk away deeply disturbed by the damning accusations that are made towards our government.  If you believe (as I do) that shadowy figures in our intelligence agencies plotted and carried out the assasination of one of the greatest presidents we ever had, you will never again look at your country the same way nor blindly trust your government again. A must watch!
0440237688|5.0|This book is wonderful.I recomend this book to people over 12 because it is intense and it is a tear jerker in many places in the book. I believe Jonas in the book is right in almost everything he says. He is definately right. He is the main character. He can do things that no one else can do. It is a good book.
0517548232|4.0|As Albert Einstein said, everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. Hazlitt makes a cogent argument that overall productivity in macro-markets is maximized by classical economic policies with an emphasis on unregulated markets.  But on let us not get too easily carried away by this author's reduction.   <br /> <br />The global markets of our age are, after all, dominated by the great (and institutionally amoral) transnational corporations we've been effectively forced to know so well.  Despite spectacular public relations, these have in many important way proved themselves untrustworthy as guardians and promoters of our collective interests.   <br /> <br />Robert Kuttner's \\"Everything For Sale,\\" to give one example,  provides excellent and badly needed counterbalance to Hazlitt's argument.  Kuttner gives numerous examples of issues that most of us would consider very important (such as health and the environment) and goes into probing and very revealing detail on why and how so-called free markets simply fail.
B000002C2E|5.0|...Costello that is. Who once said that he thought this was Bob Dylan's best album. Everyone guffawed at Costello's hyperbole at the time. I mean better than 'Blood on the Tracks'? 'Highway 61 Revisited'? 'The Times They Are a Changin'? 'Blonde on Blonde' for God's sake? Well now it's nearly 10 years old and it just gets better and better. It doesn't have the shock factor that those earlier issues had but rather it just seeps into you over repeated listening. It's subtle and quietly profound. It's the best album he ever made.
B00005JOSS|4.0|Alex (Reeves) and Kate (Bullock) are two lonely people.  They each live in a fancy glass house on the shore of Lake Michigan.  The same house, in fact.  He lives there in 2004, she lives there in 2006.  The house's mailbox begins delivering letters through time, and the two are able to communicate, and eventually fall in love.  They just have to figure out how to meet.<br /><br />If you can get over the time traveling mailbox, \\"The Lake House\\" is an enjoyable movie.  Reeves and Bullock are together again for the first time since \\"Speed\\", and one wonders why they have not teamed up again sooner.  They have a chemistry that is believable, and you root for the characters to get together in the end.  I recommend this film.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|In the three years since the release of their last album, AFI have had a considerable amount of time to grow as musicians. Decemberunderground sees the influential west coast band begin to outgrow their punk rock roots in favor of ink black alt-rock with a melodic undercurrent. AFI are as darkly poetic as ever, but this time the emphasis is on mid-tempo gloom rock rather than rapid fire punk anthems.    Singer Davey Havok still screams like a banshee on the album's two full-fledged punk songs (Kill Caustic and Affliction), but through the majority of Decemberunderground he uses his angelic voice to hit notes high enough to make Mariah Carey jealous.    Punctuating the album's infectious choruses and jet black melodies, however, are at least two moments unexpected enough to raise a few eyebrows. The intro, Prelude 12/21, could have passed for an instrumental 50 Cent track, while the album's first single, Miss Murder, is poppy enough to have been on the latest Green Day record. Though unexpected, the songs fit surprisingly well in the context of the album, flowing smoothly and cohesively from start to finish. Though the Depeche Mode inspired 37mm stands out as the album's best track.    Slickly produced and spilling over with rich melodies, Decemberunderground quenches a thirst for instantly gratifying goth pop without losing its luster after repeated listens.
B0002STNQ2|4.0|After reading a Michael Crichton novel I feel like I have an MBA or a degree in Science. Whether it's dinosaurs, business or nanotechnology, Crichton explains and educates in understandable terms that make you feel smarter about a subject when he is done explaining.<br /><br />And the subject in Prey is indeed nanotechnology.<br /><br />Further, Crichton is quite simply an excellent novelist. He's not only the brightest author that I read, he is one of the absolute best at weaving a story that keeps you turning pages at a rapid pace.<br /><br />Prey is the story of what happens when man-made micro organisms get out of control and become self aware...kind of like SkyNet in the Terminator series, but on a much...literally...smaller level. An expert programmer must fix computer code that he developed and was incorporated into micro-organisms. He has 24 hours to get it fixed before a potentially planet-changing event results.<br /><br />If you've read any of Crichton's other fiction stuff you know what you're in for: a suspenseful ride through some kind of intricate system gone wrong. And you also know that you will find it difficult to put the book down.<br /><br />Add it to your cart.
630512762X|5.0|I thought to myself when I first saw this movie. John Travolta? Bad Guy? No thanks. However him taking the role as the \\"father\\" and \\"husband\\" to his characters family, excellent. Nicholas Cage is already a little crazy, so he pulls off his character well. This movie gives the best pickup line ever: \\"If I were to buy you flowers, where would I ... no. If I were to let you suck my tongue, would you be grateful?\\" Classic.
B000GCFO08|4.0|When video games are turned into movies, most of the time the movie turns out to be a bust or has little to do with the video game.  This movie satisfied both fanboys (and girls) and people who had never entered the Silent Hill world. <br />I loved the movie.  Some people thought it was stupid because now-a-days most horror movies are not scary.  I'll admit it was not scary (as I've played every Silent Hill game I could get my hands on), but the story and idea was still amazing.  Every moster represents an image from Alessa's nightmares, which is how the games play, although the movie brought out characters that were unconnected to Alessa's dreams (the Pyramid Head), but did so only because such creatures were popular with fanboys.  Things did get over explained at some parts, taking away from the sense of mystery that always enveloped the game. <br />And did anyone else the connection of Sharon and Rose's names (the Rose of Sharon)? <br />Anyway, those who enjoyed the movie should definitely play the games.  The games are still far better than the movie, though the movie itself was excellent.  I only give it 4 stars because of the obvious flaw of extensive explaination, but in reality it would get a 4.8 stars from me.  Those who enjoy the games should also definitely watch the movie.  I also recommend it for anyone who has a deep interest in the human psyche.
B000089CJI|5.0|When I first heard Give Up I had gone to the record store intent on finding something fresh. I was just about to buy the new Interpol album and the Girl behind the counter tossed this into the stores cd player. I snaged a copy and listened to it on some headphones. At first I thought I was listening to a long lost record of the Pet Shop Boys :-) Give Up is a incredible album that grabs you from track 1 until the end of the album. The District Sleeps Alone Tonight, and Sleeping in are my favorites on this cd that has very few down points.  Heres tp wishing these guys team up again and make another album.
0792164903|4.0|I am a Captain Jack Sparrow fan, so I thought that translated to being a Johnny Depp fan.  After purchasing most of his movies, I found out It really doesn't.  He's an excellent actor, but I must say some of the movies (not necessarily the characters) leave me cold.  This one is one of his more interesting characterizations.  This is one that I can actually watch over.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|The great Das Boot, made definitively in the director's cut, is not improved by the full length T.V. version.  Fans will want this, and it is interesting enough for repeated viewing.  But we are in the realm of a cinematic milestone and masterpiece here, as against -- well -- television.  Maybe it is a television masterpiece, but even so it cannot not stand up to big screen pacing and tension.  And that unbelievable clausterphobic tension was everything to this piece of high realism.<br /><br />Narrative perhaps has disappeared too much overall from movies in recent decades.  But comparing this version and the director's cut makes you remember why.  We simply do not need the reporter's diary and commentary.  That's fine and good for the small screen.  But the magic of movies, when it works, instantly conveys something that Hemingway discussed as the essence of good writing:  to make you hear, see, feel, smell, as if you were there, and the things were happening to you.  Having them happen to the reporter on board is something else again.  It is distancing, and this film -- in its pristine state -- is anything but distanced.  To stretch it out like a Dickens novel complete with voice over is to attack the very essence of what every prior version of this film was.<br /><br />On the plus side, I did like getting to know a few of the major characters better.  But I knew them essentially already by their faces, their gestures and physicality already in this film's shortest version.  One could go through it scene by scene, and it would come down basically to individual taste.  I could never get enough of the raucous, poignant opener of the decadent club scene of doomed and wounded men.  But the counterpoint -- the late scene of the show captain entertaining the crew in the Mediterranean -- was perfection itself in the heavily cut understatement of the original.<br /><br />Of course, all said, it is well nigh impossible to seriously maim Das Boot.  In any version it is one of the truest war films ever made, superbly scripted, directed, and performed.is one of the truest war films ever made, superbly scripted, directed, and performed.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood is a fairytail about a brilliant neurosurgeon who has a brilliant son and moves to a fairy tale Colorado town to live among the pines with his quirky neighbors. Pure escapism, I suppose....but I loved it. Having never seen the first season on TV, being able to buy all 23 episodes and watch them in a marathon one weekend was pure joy. The story is compelling, and the acting very good. The challenges faced by all three family members as they deal with grief and try to integrate into this community, feel right. The writers don't make it easy for any of the characters. Watching them struggle, succeed, fail, and learn, may be what keeps me coming back.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I found this the best Jane Austen movie I've ever seen.  How Keira Knightley didn't win the best actress for her peformance is incomprehensible.  The music is wonderful throughout.  Naturally, liberties have to be taken in shortening a book of that length to a two-hour movie, but as I read through the book, I'm amazed at what a wonderful job the screenwriters did in getting so much of the original dialogue into the movie.  They also kept the spirit of hte story throughout.  It's absolutely delightful!
B000FFJYCU|4.0|I saw \\"Grand Prix\\" when it was first released. I was 17 and, like one of the other reviewers, was totally blown away by the experience. The Cinerama technology was pretty hot stuff in the 60's; the most visually and aurally realistic format of its time. I think I saw it 8 or 9 times and always from the front row. I felt like I was in the car and could almost smell the hot oil and Jessica Walters' perfume.  <br /> <br />John Frankenheimer put together a beautiful film. The cinematography is still wonderful. Several years after seeing \\"Grand Prix\\", I was stationed in Europe. I had a chance to visit many of the tracks and he truly captured the beauty of the landscape. The racing scenes are amazingly realistic, especially considering that he pretty much had to invent the technology as he was filming. I briefly raced open wheel cars of that era and the movie experience was as realistic as you could capture on film. You couldn't get hurt watching the movie, so the fear factor is missing, but the sights and sounds were spot on.  <br /> <br />I bought the VHS version and was disappointed. Big movie, little screen, pretty lame. The DVD on a wide-screen TV with a good home theater sound system will be pretty close to the original experience.  <br /> <br />Being a big Steve McQueen fan, I wish I could say that \\"Le Mans\\" is better, but visually \\"Grand Prix\\" beats it hands down. What the heck, get both! Each has a sappy story wrapped around great racing scenes, but are worth the money.

1594200823|5.0|Loved this book. I heard Mr. Pollan on NPR discussing this book and thought what he had to say in the interview was fascinating. So I picked this up. It didn't dissapoint. I'll never look at the soda aisle (or the entire supermarket for that matter) the same way.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|If, as my wife suggests, the age of the documentary is upon us, then this film heralds the brave new cinematic exploration of a flawed humanity struggling to be better. \\"Metallica: Some Kind of Monster\\" takes us backstage and into the studio to explore the troubled lives of metal music's biggest and most successful stars.<br /><br />When I first heard about this film, and about Metallica seeing a therapist, I had to agree with ex-bassist Jason Newsted---it sounded lame. After all, metal music has always seemed so aggressive, so masculine and muscular, and seeking therapy is still seen as a form of weakness, even by those of us who know better. Yet, as this film reminds us, courage literally means having an open heart; the intensity of the intimacy, vulnerability, and authenticity shown by all the players in this film was a far greater sign of strength and courage than all the muscular riffs and posturing in the world. That the band allowed the audience such unrestricted access to the dark side of Metallica---from James Hetfield facing his history of alcohol abuse to Lars Ulrich meeting with expelled lead guitarist and Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine to the battle for control between Hetfield and Ulrich---says much about how these guys have matured as musicians, but moreso about how they have grown as human beings. Seeing these rock gods discussing psychological tools that they will use to improve their parenting and relationship skills is truly inspiring; it is also helpful to see that, even at the top of their game, the guys in Metallica often consider themselves losers. (If THEY do that, then maybe success, wealth, and fame are not the panaceas that we have been lead to believe.)<br /><br />Some cynics have argued that this film is merely a PR stunt to increase interest in their album St. Anger, and to that I reply, so what? Even if one of the band's goals was to increase exposure, they chose an unnecessarily painful, vulnerable, and naked way to do it. Regardless of the baser intentions the band may have harbored in creating this film, those intentions were evidently transformed into a greater sense of happiness, emotional intelligence, friendship, sobriety, clarity, and maturity on the part of the men of Metallica. As James Hetfield said near the end of the film, this documentary covers \\"the hugest chapter in my life.\\" That they allowed us to partake of this chapter is awesome enough. That they grew, matured, and transformed as we watched is even better. If they hoped to sell me their new CD through this video, then they may have succeeded. And that is ok. They've earned it.ntentions the band may have harbored in creating this film, those intentions were evidently transformed into a greater sense of happiness, emotional intelligence, friendship, sobriety, clarity, and maturity on the part of the men of Metallica.

B00005JNEI|1.0|Moore has taken a lot of footage out of context and drawn some mighty conclusions based on scant and questionable input to make this movie. I highly recommend the rebuttal 'FarenHYPE 911' if you want to see why. The latter accuses Moore, and rightly so I believe, of purposely distorting the facts to make his own personal political statements.    His extensive footage of grieving 911 families and Gulf War amputees as pawns for his political agenda was tasteless; nobody needs to be reminded of how horrific terrorism and war is. It was the cheapest of shots, but not the only cheap shot he took in the film; the film was loaded with them.    Moore definately fails my would-you-buy-a-used-car-from-this-man test.
B00000JY1X|5.0|The Magnetic Fields is a great band (and even greater cuz one of them dudes is Chinese) but the credit goes to the great Stephin Merritt. This guy knows how to write a song. And I bet if you locked him in a room with a comb, a pepper shaker and a paper clip, he could make awesome music out of that crap. Some of the songs on these 3 discs are goofy, some are epic, some are happy, some are sad, some are 5 minutes long, some are 2 minutes long but they all freakin rock.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|If you are a fan of Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris, you will love this CD. From <br />the first song,  Beachcombing with the combination of accoustic and electric guitars <br />coupled with the harmony of Mark and Emmylou, it just doesn't get any better. The <br />arranements are stripped down yet have impact. This Is Us screams to be released as a single. It provides great guitar work by Mark along with terrific harmony. The entire feel of the CD is laid back with suttle punches here and there. The use of the piano, fiddle and guitar makes this a stellar effort. The combination of Mark and Emmylou makes this effort a CD that you want in your collection. Great production whereby Mark serves as co-producer. Emmylou has never sounded better.  Mark and Emmylou hit a homerun with this one. Love and Happiness showcases the great talent of Emmylou. It is my favorite song on the CD and should also be released as <br />a single.Belle Starr is the closest song on the CD that reminds you of Dire Straits <br />with great harmony. Sidebar: Mark sounds as good as ever. His voice improves with age. The CD culminates with three great songs: Beyond My Wildest Dreams, All The <br />Roadrunning and the majestic If This Is Goodbye. Let's just hope this is just the beginning of a Knopfler/Harris team that produces more great CDs.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I discovered this show after watching Serenity the movie. I then rented the TV series and immediately bought it. I can't believe I missed out on this when it was originally aired. It's a real shame that a show this good was cancelled.
B000FVQYYK|3.0|I do like this album a lot, dont get me wrong, but I fear it doesnt quite get up there with Absolution and others. I think Muse's choice of 'Supermassive Black Holes' as one of their singles was a mistake coz i think its one of the worst on the album. There are so many other tracks on this album that are far superior. I do like the song but dont love it. Overall this is a good album tho and if you are a MUSE fan then you have to have it. You wont be dissappointed with tracks like 'Starlight', 'Map of the Problematique', 'Exo-Politics' and 'Knights of Cydonia'.
B000006TRV|5.0|I was given this album by my uncle in 1980 when i was in the 9th grade.  At the time i was listening to country (gasp!) music.  Needless to say, i never looked back.  In a time when vinyl was king, i played the grooves off two copies.  All hail the CD.  RIP Syd Barrett.
B000E41MS6|3.0|I won't bother to review the show. It's good. Watch it, in any manner you can. I will say this: the 'Dr Who: Confidential' episodes that ran after each episode in the UK are really quite good. They give a great sense of the huge task of bringing Dr. Who back to modern television. I'm rather dissappointed to hear that these great shows have been cut down to less than half their length so that they can be shoved onto the last disc in this set. That is really a shame. I think anyone who enjoys the show would weant to see these documentaries in their entirety. At this rather steep price, I'm suprised that the Box set cuts this material down. They don't even admit it on the box!
B000784WMW|5.0|I watched this adaptation as a teenager when it was first shown on the BBC in the 1980s and remember eagerly waiting each week for the next episode.  I loved it.  Now I am delighted it is out on DVD.  It is such a fantastic story and I have read the book many times.  Dalton and Clarke are just wonderful in the leading roles.  Dalton does a fantastic job as the tortured, lonely, despairing Rochester.  It really does do justice to the book.  I'm sure Charlotte Bronte would approve, if only we could know!
B00003CXXP|2.0|It is possible to pinpoint the precise moment that AI loses its mind. Like its main character--a robot boy abandoned in the woods--this film with great promise is left to wander aimlessly.<br /><br />AI starts off as a compelling tale of a grief-stricken family whose young son is in an apparently irreversible coma. While medical science seems incapable of helping him, robotic science comes to the rescue. Hoping to pull his wife Monica out of her grief, husband Henry brings home one of his company's creations - a \\"mecha\\" or robotic boy (the ever-wonderful Haley Joel Osment) built to love its owner. But a robot is not a boy, and soon things get out of control as the mecha expresses emotions like clinginess and jealousy.<br /><br />This whole first hour of the movie is gripping and real. It's less of a question of \\"Can a robot express love\\" than of \\"Can human beings love a machine, knowing that it is just a machine?\\" The dramatic possibilities were endless. How *real* do the parents want their new son to be? Will they love him? Treat him as a pet? Include him in family pictures? Or just stand him in the corner when it's convenient?<br /><br />But let us recall that there is another semi-human influence at work: Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />As soon as the movie gets almost unbearably interesting, it pops its clutch. Suddenly parallels to the Pinocchio story abound and the film becomes a monstrosity in its own right. There are sex-mechas and helicopter chases and a garish amusement park and frozen oceans and advanced robots from the future--an entire top drawer of colorful, useless junk and half-witted ideas strewn across the screen. The entire premise of human-robot interaction is completely dropped in favor of high-tech lachrymosity. It's as if someone spliced an hour of a magnificent Merchant-Ivory drama with the back end of Mad Max movie and overlaid all with a maudlin soundtrack.<br /><br />If you love visuals, this movie has them in spades. Robot faces split apart and come together; mechas attracted to a pile of junk replace their own worn parts; a \\"super-toy\\" bear walks around quite realistically; coastal cities are inundated or buried in ice. But if you're looking for a film that takes ideas seriously, you've come to the wrong place.a pile of junk replace their own worn parts; a \\"super-toy\\" bear walks around quite realistically; coastal cities are inundated or buried in ice.

B000FFJ85I|2.0|I am usually not one to call a band a sell out, or talk about their glory days before they made it big. But I have to admit AFI's second major label album is another let down. As soon as I heard Miss Murder on my XM Radio I knew the band was going once again for the MTV audience. Then came the \\"Fred Durst like\\" growl/yell thing Davie did at the end of the song. The rest of the album has its ups and downs but all together if they make a great video it might warrant them a VMA. I just wonder what happened to the AFI from the \\"Art of Drowning\\" days and before, where their music was straight up power-punk, and truly intoxicating. This stuff is fluff, and yes the MTV crowd will buy it and make them good money. But that's a fickle crowd, I hope they don't let the rest of us forget how good they can be.
0099477319|5.0|War, for all its glory, gore, bloodshed, tragedy and horror, in the end is often one continuous story of insanity and inanity.  People find themselves in circumstances that to the outsider, might seem quite funny.  So goes this book; Catch-22, by Joseph Heller.  Probably one of the great 20th century classics in war literature along with \\"Farewell to Arms\\" and \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", this is the ultimate tragi-comedy of WW2.  Based on the life of a group of bomber pilots based in Italy; the story focuses on Yosarian, and his group of buddies who do their best to survive the war, execute their missions, avoid their commanding officers, lay with hot nurses and escape vengeful widows of slain comrades.  As the war progresses and their comrades are killed in bunches and spurts, the remainder find various ways to cope with the emotional loss and the inevitable sense of doom.  They all want to go home alive; but the only way to go home alive is to fly a required number of bombing runs.  But each bombing run exposes you to death from enemy fire.  So here is the catch; fly your runs as quick as possible, hope you survive each one, so you can go home after the last one.  Or, try to postpone each flight you have to take knowing that you will live longer in the short run, but also knowing that you eventually will have to fly them.  The risk with the latter is that you might also get killed in other ways on the ground; example is Yosarian's friend - Hungry Joe who suffocates to death in his sleep because a cat slept on his face.  In between the author shows in funny detail the life of soldiers, and those civilians who have to put up with them.  The loss of life throughout the book keeps the tears flowing after you stop crying from the absurd comedy.  This book is quite a classic of 20th century English literature, though it is probably not appropriate for anyone under high school.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Just when I was about to give up on popular music as a whole, along comes Gnarls Barkley to restore the faith. \\"Crazy\\", the first single off the album made the record books here in the UK by being the first single to make it to number one without the single actually being available in the shops. It got to the top of the charts by download sales alone. The album also promptly shot to number one on the album charts upon its release and one listen will tell you why. I just can't stop playing it!<br /><br />The producer known as Danger Mouse and the singer known as Cee-Lo have put together a magical concoction of soul, rhythm and blues, gospel, hip hop and whatever else takes their fancy, and the end product is just damn good music, pure and simple. This is not for the fainthearted nor the listener with narrow-minded stereotypical expectations of what music should be. This is daring adventurous stuff and thank goodness for that. Someone once told me that Cee-Lo is of the same mindset (musically and artistically) as Andre Benjamin from Outkast. I didn't see it then but I see it now. If you're into the uniqueness of Outkast, you'll love this.<br /><br />It's impossible for me to choose favourite songs here, which I'm still trying to wrap my brain round (What? A 2006 album where I like ALL the songs?!) but please, check out these lyrics on the song \\"Who Cares?\\": \\"You see everybody is somebody, But nobody wants to be themselves; And if I ever wanted to understand me, I have to talk to someone else...\\"<br /><br />Now THAT is how a lyric should be written. The kind of stuff that makes you stop and think.<br /><br />Observers are already asking whether Gnarls Barkley could possibly be the saviour of an ailing music industry? If their success encourages more music makers to have the courage of their convictions, step outside of the box and dare to be different and original, I very much believe they could. My only complaint? I agree with most of the other reviewers of this album - it's all over way too soon!f this album - it's all over way too soon!
B000002WU9|5.0|This is my second favorite rap record of all time. The production on this record is maybe the best ever heard. The beats & lyrics are flawless. RZA was at his best and you can hear it. The whole sounds like a perfect soundtrack of some heated gangster movie. This record is neccessary in any record collection and a testimony of how exciting and dope hiphop still sounded in the early 90's.
B000002UA0|5.0|If you're expecting this album to be ANYTHING like DSotM, WYWH, The Wall, and especially The Final Cut, you're going to have to change your expectations drastically, because the band who made those albums is not the same band who put out \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\".<br /><br />You won't find any huge concept about a rock star who isolates himself and builds a \\"wall\\" here, instead you'll find Syd Barrett talking about his clan of gingerbread men and mice who don't have homes. Weird, huh? Yes. Brilliant? Most definitely. This is the epitome of 60's psychedelia, and only one of the great psychedelic rock albums released in '67 (the others being \\"Are You Experienced?\\", \\"Disraeli Gears\\", \\"Satanic Majesty\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"Forever Changes\\", \\"The Doors\\" and \\"VU and Nico\\").<br /><br />Syd seemed to like childhood ditties, but since this album is filtered through LSD-induced lyrics, it makes them seem a bit...nightmarish. This is NOTHING, I repeat, NOTHING, like later Floyd, and it's not supposed to be. My favorite songs on this album include \\"Astronomy Domine\\", \\"Matilda Mother\\", \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\", and \\"Bike\\". The only weak songs on here are \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\" and the second half of \\"Pow R. Toch\\".<br /><br />The band never recaptured what they had with this album; the band's next album, \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\", was stellar but not nearly as brilliant as \\"Piper\\".
B000301YY8|1.0|I used to not care about James Blunt one way or another; in other words, I thought he was OK. But then \\"You're Beautiful\\" and \\"High\\" started to be played on EVERY radio station EVERY day, and his voice now sounds like the equivalent to a cat in heat screeching into a fan with its tail being pullled REALLY hard to me. And the lyrics? Please. Aaron Carter (who I also hate) could write better stuff than this slop. Basically, the songs' premises are like this:<br /><br />My girlfriend left me, and a gorgeous woman winked at me, but she was dating somebody else. I am sad. I will now sing about it while proceeding to take my shirt off in a snowstorm.<br /><br />Lyrical genius? I think not. The Bee Gees he ain't. They had falsettos, but they were pleasant. His is whiny and annoying. They also had differences in the lyrics of their love songs. My advice: skip it. Try one of these:<br /><br />Confessions on a Dancefloor by Madonna<br /><br />Life'll Kill Ya by Warren Zevon<br /><br />Boys for Pele by Tori Amos<br /><br />It's perfect: You can dance to Madonna, and revel in songwriting greatness with Warren Zevon and Tori Amos.<br /><br />l8r
0399132635|3.0|The focus of the story consists of the Francis Project, in which genetic engineers tampered with, and enforced their knowledge upon numerous specimens. The outcome of the experimentation resulted in two successes - with an IQ-level similar to that of humans! The first success takes the form of a dog and the other takes the form of a beast. When one escapes from the secretive Banodyne Laboratories, the other follows. . . <br /> <br />Simply put, the dog is good; The Outsider (which is the beast) is bad. The dog injects warmth and love into the lives of those who encounters it; The Outsider causes death and trauma. The dog is the prey and, oh yes, The Outsider is the predator. <br /> <br />Entwined with the focus of Watchers are the lives of various people, including Travis Cornell, the man who unknowingly rescued the dog from the beast that pursues it; Nora Devon, a beautiful young lady who has been raped of her life by her deceased aunt. There's Vincent Nasco, a hit man who believes he absorbs the life-force of those he brutally murders and is also on the quest for . . .IMMORTALITY. And, finally, there's Lemuel Johnson, an agent of the National Security Agency, who is fully aware of the danger that lurks out there - and he must stop it, even if it means calling in squads from the Marine Intelligence. <br /> <br />The dog almost immediately got on my nerves when it started showing Travis how clever it was, but as the book progressed, I became captivated by it. Not only does the dog have the ability to be taught how to do certain things (like communicating with humans) but it also has a great sense of humour, which often had me laughing. What I disliked about Watchers was the lack of the presence of The Outsider; this, in turn, decreases the horror and gory scenes which I expected from the book. The pace was also a bit too slow for me, but I will definitely read another one of Mr Koontz's books - and it'll be very soon.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|When I rip a CD, I determine whether the CD is good by how many songs I don't rip.  That said, with this CD I left off only 2 songs.  I won't belabor each song.  But the first track, Prelude 12/21, though extremely short clocking in at less than 2 minutes, is a song I wish could have gone longer.  Beautiful, dark, and well-arranged.  Miss Murder is the single of the moment with a great video marketing it to death.  The song is pretty good, epic like an anthem, but I think the best track on this disc is The Missing Frame which was a complete surprise.  Brilliantly arranged, great backing vocals, lush in scope, and I defy you not to want to sing along or put this track on permanent repeat.  I am not a long-standing AFI fan.  In fact, I hesitated picking up this CD for the longest time.  I previewed every track on Amazon and thought it really wasn't any great shakes.  Don't judge it by those snippets.  This boys are well-produced, slick, and know how to do an intro that will suck you right into a song.
B000002572|5.0|A mainstay of classic rock radio stations everywhere with \\"More Than a Feeling,\\" \\"Foreplay/Longtime,\\" and \\"Rock -n- Roll Band,\\" Boston introduced the concept of the \\"Wall of Sound.\\"  Besides the layers of awesome guitar sound, these studio rock masterpieces feature catchy lyrics and great hooks which keep you coming back for more.  This is a fantastic Rock -n- Roll album which I highly recommend.  For me, this is the true sound of the 70s (along with Styx and Kansas) that keeps on rocking when the disco hits so popular at the time are mouldering on top of the garbage heaps of history they so richly deserve.  This a must have Rock ablum.
0553573411|5.0|Fitz is having fits - and the kingdom seems to be seeing the start of entire rupture.  He must choose to either stay with his King as a King's man or go on his own - but truly - does he have a choice?<br /><br />Hobb certainly has a way of bringing light to things - there but just not seen by a reader. This book has everything - a love story, hatred, revenge, loyalty, political intrige, honor, and working for the better of a people.<br /><br />A great lesson can be learned by seeing the dedication some will take to see out that others can live better.  Hobb does a great job of seeing through hardships and comming out the otherend - beat and broken, but knowing what one must do.<br /><br />Fitz is only getting better , as a character, every book I read.  Do yourself a favor and read The Farseer Trilogy.
B000A59PMO|5.0|When I first heard the basic plot of Veronica Mars, I was not interested.  It sounded mediocre with little possibility for lasting much past Veronica solving her friend's murder mystery.  Then, someone convinced me to watch the 1st disc in the DVD season 1 series.  The show had been wrapping up season two.  The first episode did not impress me.  It almost felt like I was stepping into the show mid season because the character development, plot basics, and expected introduction of characters were missing.  Everything seemed assumed and Veronica was solving a mystery unrelated to her friend's murder.   <br /> <br />By the end of that first disc, though, I wanted to know more and could not wait to see disc 2.  Veronica is not just a sassy teenager, with an extraordinary knack for solving mysteries that some seasoned detectives may have trouble with, she is the epitome of female strength.  She is strong, confident, fragile in some spots, but always persevering.  It is her character that drew me in.  I think any female from 14 to 40 could definitely fall in love and in awe of Veronica Mars' character.   <br /> <br />By the end of the second disc, I developed characters I liked almost as much as Veronica and I was hooked!  The characters take some time to get to know and they are very real with many dimensions.  One character, Logan Echols, surprised me.  Early in, I despised him, now I love him.  There are just so many aspects of Veronica Mars that make this series worth getting hooked on and make it very easy to identify with: the strength and beauty of being female, the love and awesome relationship between father and daughter, the dysfunction of families, the dynamics of upper and lower class, the mysteries that beg to be unraveled, the raw contradictions of love and relationships, the struggle to find oneself while dealing with growing up, and much, much more.  <br /> <br />I strongly recommend buying this DVD set.  Be prepared to watch a disc or two before you really love the show and be patient with getting to know the characters.  I think if I had watched the first episode when it was originally aired, I may not have been hooked.  It took sitting through those first two or three episodes back to back to really get into it.  Now, this is my favorite show!  I cannot wait until season 2 comes out next month!!!!  Veronica Mars truly is surprisingly addictive. <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|The DVD is superb!  The production values of this concert performance are visually outstanding and, as I said for the CD's, young Irish women who sing like angels and play musical instruments beautifully have created an enduring treasure for lovers of celtic music. <br /> <br />I especially enjoyed the \\"cutaways\\" of the Dublin audience - young and old -  as they thrilled to the performance.
B0000024YL|5.0|This is one of the soundtracks to my life. This great compilation has been with me since I first heard it coming from my parents speakers 30+ years ago. I wore out my LP copy in my late twenties and snatched up a CD copy shortly thereafter...it remains close to me and my player to this day. Melancholy, somber, jubilant, hopeful, happy...these are just a few words to describe this album and the emotions it evokes while listening to it. Many great reviews have been posted on this wonderful Hits package and its obvious that it has almost \\"universal\\" appeal. Most of the reviews here resonate with the same tone---\\"this album is so much a part of my life\\". Without going into individual songs, I'll say that I enjoy every song from start to finish. This is really timeless music that will continue to reach new generations of listeners and will remain very special to me for decades to come....enjoy this(your not likely to find the 'Magic' these two gentlemen had in today's artists).
B000F7CMRM|4.0|Frankly, the blatherings of many of the stars of this movie put me off seeing it, but I am now glad that I did.  It is a pretty darn good flick, as long as you don't take it too seriously.  I mean if you think that \\"Marathon Man\\" is a serious treatment of the Cold War, McCarthyism, Nazi Hunters, and the life and times of Josef Mengele after the war, well, then you might be forgiven for thinking that this movie has much to do with how the present world actually works.  However, as a fiction, it holds one's attention pretty well.<br /><br />Part of the way it draws us in is the way it starts with a bunch of clearly disconnected parts that we don't even understand.  Slowly, the film draws these pieces together and we wonder how they will come together.  Will it be a nice fit or will it be a collision of sorts?  There are plenty of side plots and sub plots to keep us trying to find the best angle into the plot.  If you want your stories told in a simple narrative, you will not enjoy this movie at all.  But if you like to puzzle things out as you watch, this one is a lot of fun.<br /><br />Be warned, however, that if you don't want to see a world full of bad guys, I mean everywhere; this is not a film you will enjoy.  It is LeCarre dark towards the U.S., Big Business, Terrorists (although they are treated as responding to the oppression of the West - yeah, right), and even dynastic passage.  Of course, history teaches us that brothers vying for their father's throne will sometime go quite far.  Even those around them who would stand to benefit will go that far or farther to make sure they get a seat at the new table.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed it.  There is one scene of viciousness that is quite unsettling, but otherwise is not very bloody.  This is one of those films with lots and lots of stars that you know.  They all do a good job and the quality of the acting is sufficiently strong that you notice how well it is done.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is the best album I've heard in over a year, without QUESTION. And, know this -- I'm a piece of crap who, prior to hearing 10,000 Days, thought only of pretentious adolescent scrubby wubby's when 'Tool' somehow found its way into conversation. Thankfully -- oh God thank this blessed lemming -- a friend of mine (an avid Tool fan whose taste in music I actually respect) burnt me a copy of 10,000 Days. Quite honestly, the primary reason that I gave it a chance is because the album's cover promised some sort of epic, existential trip of brooding, mystical madness. Oh, the sweetness of not having disposable album art.    OK. Let's see. Whew. Hmmmm. Why is this music so utterly, compellingly fantastic? Second; let me think... For starters, these songs, from what I can tell, are some of the most intricately constructed I've ever heard. 'Vicarious' is so pathetically beyond 99% of 'singles' released on mainstream radio today that I am quite stunned it even made its way on the air. The first four songs sound like classically composed opuses. What they do with melody and timing is precious. Beautifully, 10,000 days contains such an ecstatic sound with often stunningly simple instrumentation; who in God's name could imagine such haunting music could be created with but guitar, bass, and vocal? Sorry, brothers, but we don't have the hip mentality of 'ugh, our music is completely half baked at this moment right here -- wait, I know... THROW IN STRINGS TO FILL ALL THE GAPS! TUBULAR.' While the guitars ultimately prove to be quite static and undeniably repetitive, each song here still manages to soar at varying heights. Maynard's vocal melodies are superb, often harmonizing with the calculated guitars to sublime effect. One qualm I (ignorantly) seemed to apply to Tool before hearing this was that the music seemed to be too edgy, lacking drive. Too static; a river flows, and what I'd heard appeared to be the antithesis -- rigid, deadlocked. 10,000 Days b*tch slapped me and showed me who's going to be on the receiving end at the end of the night.    OK let me get this off my chest. You can't listen to this album three mother FSDIO:J@!*( times. Could you take in a Rachmaninoff symphony in such a sitting? The comparison might seem psychotic to some, but I wouldn't present it if it were indeed so. This is the most complete production of music that I've heard within as much time as I can recall; when these guys penned the album... performed the album... they knew they were creating something special... something difficult... something remarkable on several levels. And you, you stupid pompous jackal, think that you have the brain capacity to absorb and (FAN:#Y*)!@Y%*)!!!!) critique it after 'THREE' listens?!?J!?! Like I said -- INSANE.    The first two songs on the album are intellectual, cathartic \\"rockers\\" (demeaning as that word may sound) that NEVER outstay their welcome, both clocking in at over seven minutes. And, despite their amazingly sophisticated arrangements, both songs possess alluring, accessible choruses which hit the right spot sans analysis. While I'm not particularly familiar with music of this kind -- and perhaps there is very little in modern music to compare it to anyway -- I cannot think of a piece of recent rock that can even stare '10,000' Days in the face without burgeoning shame. I am almost always a fan of gracious, powerful melody over everything else. Because of this, most of my favorite rock usually possesses some degree of pop sentiment, unsurprisingly. I love so many rock bands of recent -- from indie to metal -- but quite simply -- and again, I love these bands with my bloody heart -- none of them could write anything close to the material on here. Probably couldn't even begin to conceptualize it, let alone pull it off. They're still excellent, but they don't cross that line to utter, shining brilliance. They just don't. And how could they? Most of us aren't born with the genes to pump out such magnificence, nomatter how much work's put into it. What I'm trying to say is that this, among the vast number of albums released this side of the 21st century, is a bonified work of ART -- a masterpiece -- that heralds devotion and craft to the umpteenth degree.    I don't write reviews this long and I apologize to any suckers reading this -- sincerely. But I have to express my thoughts and adoration of the album, because it makes that vein who lives within my forehead break out to the surface in all its disgusting glory when it sees the juvenile reviews of so many 'music fans' here on the site. Yeah, one star, you stupid APE. If I could piss on your face, I would -- because you are a maggot; surely I would feel pity for if I weren't so neurotic. And I'll say this honestly -- bigot that I am -- anyone who dismisses 'Wings for Marie (Pt 1)' and '10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2) as filler doesn't deserve to be heard. Simple as that. I won't even go on about the tracks -- it insults me to have to attempt to overcome such derelict's opinions with an overwrought paragraph of dissection. Combined -- these two tracks, which total something like 18 minutes -- are more worthy than most albums you'll touch in their entirety. I am rarely hostile following disagreements in music, you see, especially when someone is cool, collected, reasonable, honest and convincing about their thoughts. But when something so mind-bogglingly good can be thrown at it two incomplete sentences with foolish, rash, childish reasons (i.e. often no reason at all), it sort of, how do I say it... Diminishes my hope in Humanity.    Truthfully, following the initial half hour, 10,000 Days can't keep up. It still remains stupendous, but inevitably is cranked down one notch. 'The Pot' is seductive, 'Rosetta Stoned' is overlong but generally intoxicating, and 'Right in Two' is an awesomely catchy, lyrically arresting, glum wonder of a song. But even so, these songs don't seem to possess that divine spirit, creativity, or sheer complexity of the first four. That being said, I am not complaining in the least.    And all of this I pen, I do it only in respect to the music. I haven't even attempted to really get in the state of mind to feel the album's pulse... it's thoughts, themes... it's experience. I'm sure I will soon, possibly after finding some mushrooms out on the grass nearby. It's obviously an intense experience if one opens to it, but again, I have yet to really do so. So, sure, this is a premature review. What, wanna fight about it?    I'm tired of writing, and you're tired of reading, if you are, in fact, reading, this, writing. Getting, delirious. So... late. Conclusion? Need I write one? F*@# no.     This is, for the most part, divine. DIVINE.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This album always gets reviews based on the guitar work, this is simply a great band recorded at their peak. The guitar work is awesome, but the keyboard are too, as is the singing, and...If you like 70's Metal, you have to have this album.  On my top ten list since it came out!
B000002KHF|4.0|A very relaxing album from Van, with plenty of great songs. Example? Try the opening one-two punch of And It Stoned Me and the title track, two of Van's most popular songs. But wait! Don't go away yet. There's also Caravan, a song that SHOULD be a classic but  isn't quite, as well as Crazy Love and Into the Mystic, two songs I like but not as much as the first two and Caravan. It really is a shame about side two, since one song rises above the average level:  Brand New Day, with a joyful chorus.<br /><br />Oh well. Even if you have the best-of, it's still worth it for Caravan, Crazy Love and Into the Mystic.
0895260131|5.0|After a through reading of the book, and a careful review of the over eighty wars around the globe with more than 98% of them involving Muslims. The proof is in, Islam is a religion that has a desire and a bent toward making the world or at least a desire to see the world under Islamic rule. A must read for everyone who loves freedom and does not believe this is a war that has to be won, or freedom as we know it will no longer exist. Dare you to read this book! A great read
B00008BXJG|5.0|This is justly the most famous of the Bon Scott-era AC/DC records. The title track is the resident anthem, arguably the most-famous AC/DC song. It's got everything an AC/DC classic needs: powerful vocals, an unforgettable riff and a shout-along chorus. Girls Got Rhythm is more classic stuff, again I love Bon Scott's vocals and Angus Young's non-stop riffs. Walk All Over You has an interesting touch musically: the chorus slows the tempo down a tiny bit, speeding back up for the verses. Again, very nice touch.<br /><br />But there are a few good songs you might not be familiar with. For instance, If You Want Blood (You've Got It), which actually reminds me of the Doors' Peace Frog with all of those references to blood in the streets. Too bad it's been forgotten. Shot Down in Flames is a funny song about a loser who keeps getting turned down by women - in other words, shot down in flames. And Night Prowler is loaded with menace, not the Midnight Rambler ripoff people say it is at all.<br /><br />one of AC/DC's best albums.
B000002OVJ|4.0|this was a memorable concert...waiting for a DVd of it now. <br /> <br />I have only seen it on VHS back in 1988 and i still remember it fully. <br /> <br />pls pls pls get it out on DVD 5.1 +  remastered if possible
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|That moron who said their music hasent changed is so dumb and obviousley not a true SOAD fan. Ive been a SOAD fan since they were just a small band with loads of potential. SOAD was a great album and Toxicity was sweet and Steal This Album was really a great musical adventure but this album just isnt SOAD at all. Ok in all fairness if I was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully. But compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it, their older stuff was way way better then this crap. And Daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and Serj is much better.
1594200823|5.0|This is a book to savor. As I learned reading Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan sees from many points of view while retaining a distinct voice and sensibility. His candor and erudition are equally delightful. Like a fascinating dinner guest, he tells well-honed stories and makes it seem that he's discovering something new even as the old story unfolds. The basic dilemma we omnivores face - what to eat when it's possible to eat anything - is such a daily experience that it makes the book seem part of \\"real life.\\" My diet shifted throughout the week that I read this book. I've long been wary of factory-farmed meat and fish, but after reading \\"Corn\\" I've looked askance at those shining yellow and white kernels of petroleum in the market as well. I was particularly struck by the fact that ethanol, which pollutes the air, is a less efficient way of using oil than simply pouring gas into the tank. After reading Pollan's description of the monocultural corn industry and its dependence on oil, I understood why Detroit has turned its back on hybrids in favor of ethanol burning cars: we're being encouraged to use more oil than ever! The McDonald's meal in the car that concludes the first section of The Omnivore's Dilemma was classic. Suffice it to say that I haven't eaten any fast food since reading it. The idyllic section on grass provides a clean contrast with \\"Corn,\\" yet the revelations about the industrial nature of enlightened businesses like Whole Foods keeps the structure from being too predictable. There are compromises at each level of the food chain. I initially thought I'd skim the third section about hunting and foraging since I'm not likely to do either one, but Pollan had so many interesting things to say about mushrooms, pigs, hunters, limits, and cooking that I read the ending with a sense of wonder and appreciation. At the final dinner, he shies away from a formulaic or sententious grace before the meal, preferring a toast to everyone who brought it to the table. The book itself, however, is an act of thanks and grace. It's been about three weeks since I finished The Omnivore's Dilemma and it sticks to the ribs. I'll read it again in a year or two.

0525457585|5.0|The Neverending Story by Michael Ende is a book that I've been intending to read for years. I picked up a used copy a few months back, and decided that it was a perfect book to take on my recent vacation. The paperback edition that I have is nice and dense, and thus excellent for travel.<br /><br />The Neverending Story is about a boy named Bastian Balthazar Bux. Bastian is a bit of a loser, the kind of boy other kids pick on because he's whiny, and he's not very good at sports, and he's somewhat pudgy. He lives with his father, who has been very distant ever since the death of Bastian's mother. What Bastian does have going for him, however, is his love for books. I was completely won over by The Neverending Story on page 10, when Bastian steals a book called \\"The Neverending Story.\\" The description goes like this:<br /><br />\\"... In short, there are as many different passions as their are people. Bastian Balthazar Bux's passion was books.<br /><br />If you have never spent whole afternoons with burning ears and rumpled hair, forgetting the world around you over a book, forgetting cold and hunger --<br /><br />If you have never read secretly under the bedclothes with a flashlight, because your father or mother or some other well-meaning person has switched off the lamp on the plausible ground that it was time to sleep because you had to get up so early --<br /><br />If you have never wept bitter tears because a wonderful story has come to an end and you must take your leave of the characters with whom you have shared so many adventures, whom you have loved and admired, for whom you have hoped and feared, and without whose company life seems empty and meaningless --<br /><br />If such things have not been part of your own experience, you probably won't understand what Bastian did next.\\" (He steals the oh-so-enticing book.)<br /><br />The next part of the book describes Bastian, huddled in an attic at his school, reading his stolen book. Glimpses of Bastian in the attic are interspersed with chapters of The Neverending Story, an epic adventure of a boy named Atreyu, sent on a quest to find out what is destroying his home, Fantastica. Soon reality starts to blur, however, as Bastian finds himself and his responses appearing within the book. And after that, things really get interesting.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down. The adventures are exciting, the characters are well-developed and unique, and the linkages between Fantastica and the real world are fascinating. The Neverending Story is a bit like Peter Pan, in this latter point. Does what we believe in make a difference, in some alternate fantasy world? Is it possible to leave our mundane world, and visit a land of epic quests? Do people who love stories, and have the ability to tell stories, make a positive difference in the world?<br /><br />Here's how much I liked this book. I was reading it while on a Caribbean vacation, with close friends and the love of my life. My friends would call to me to go to the beach, or our for drinks, or to watch the sunset. My response would be: \\"yes, just a minute, I just have to finish this chapter.\\" Enough said. If you love books, you should read The Neverending Story. If you enjoy fantasy at all (Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, J. K. Rowling, J. M. Barrie), you should read The Neverending Story. If you like poetry, and careful use of language, again, you should read The Neverending Story. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />This book review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on July 13, 2006.stian in the attic are interspersed with chapters of The Neverending Story, an epic adventure of a boy named Atreyu, sent on a quest to find out what is destroying his home, Fantastica.

Is it possible to leave our mundane world, and visit a land of epic quests? Do people who love stories, and have the ability to tell stories, make a positive difference in the world?  <br /> <br />Here's how much I liked this book. I was reading it while on a Caribbean vacation, with close friends and the love of my life. My friends would call to me to go to the beach, or our for drinks, or to watch the sunset. My response would be: \\"yes, just a minute, I just have to finish this chapter.\\" Enough said. If you love books, you should read The Neverending Story. If you enjoy fantasy at all (Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, J. K. Rowling, J. M. Barrie), you should read The Neverending Story. If you like poetry, and careful use of language, again, you should read The Neverending Story. You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />This book review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on July 13, 2006.

For example  > Remove duplicated code  > Write smaller classes \\"Do one thing and do it well\\"  > Only expose methods that need to be exposed  > re-write complicated expressions by introducing temporary variables with names that explain the purpose  and so many others. Particularly great for those left maintaining code written by someone else who thought a class containing 2,500 lines of code is fine.
B00004Z459|4.0|I really like this album. Most of the songs are good. There is only one or two that I don't like. In the End, Cure For The Itch, With You, Paper Cut, Crawling, Runaway, and others are my favorites. I think track two is the only one I don't like. I also don't like the fact that thais is a short cd. Just over thirty-eight minutes I think. Also, some of the songs do sound similar to one another but it's nowhere near as bad as Meteora. One last thing, Linkin Park is considered a metal band. That's not so. They aren't heavy enough to be considered as metal. Instead, along with other bands such as Pillar, P.O.D., early Project 86, and one of the crappiest bands of all time, Limp Bizcit, this is what you call rapcore. Now you know.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|I really, really, really liked Team America. Yeah, it's rude, vulgar, uses the F word as both a noun and a verb and it has a sex scene that made me cringe and change the channel for a few mintues but it's also funny. The  songs, especially Montage, America .. Yeah, and I'm So Ronery were brilliant. The mockery of our smug, self important little celebrites  and political correctness was great and the scene where the team destroys half of Egypt, with the best of intentions was a gut buster.  <br /> <br />So it's not up there with \\"On the Waterfront\\" but neither is anything else in the theaters today. Team America may be mindless but it sure is fun. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go sing America... Yeah for the 50th time.
B00005JOQS|2.0|The Movie Making Machine that is Hollywood has always been, and will forever be, fueled artistically by the tinder of formula. Year after year, especially, although not exclusively, in the summer, audiences are subjected to the same array of remakes, sequels, prequels, literary adaptations, television spin-offs, etc. that provide safe and simple movies for audiences, and assured box-office hits for the studios. Genre lines especially dictate these formulas, and recently the fixation of Hollywood has been predominantly either cheap horror films, or big-budget superhero movies. Every year since the successes of \\"X-Men\\" and \\"Spiderman\\" Hollywood has turned out a new must-see-movie-of-the-summer superhero extravaganza. This year's offering is a (gasp) sequel to the Superman series of movies, which was last seen in 1987 with the fourth installment. \\"Superman Returns\\" revives the series and is reportedly one of the most expensive movies made to date, which makes one wonder why perhaps they could not have afforded some half-decent actors, a script that makes sense, and a director who knows how to make an entertaining movie.<br /><br />One of the first problems with the film is that the story seems almost painfully forced and, at times, even incoherent. Once past the surprisingly good opening title sequence, we learn that Superman has returned after a five year search for his home planet. What Superman found or learned on this little hiatus is never made especially clear, but what is clear is that now that he has returned, the situation and setting familiar to all Superman fans will be immediately restored. To further tie this movie to the originals, Marlon Brando's speech from the first film is resurrected here and replayed ad nauseam as a reminder of the previously established roots and morals that drive Superman. With all this character development now out of the way, thanks to one broken-record speech from twenty-five years ago, Bryan Singer can now focus on the ludicrous contemporary plot of Lex Luthor using crystals from Superman's Fortress of Solitude to create new land. How these crystals do this is unknown to me, as is how Luther was aware that they do this, but one thing is for sure, the megalomaniacal insanity of Luthor seems somewhat diminished when his evil plans for world domination come in the form of real estate development schemes. In the post-9/11, terrorism filled world we live in you would think the writers could find a perhaps more relevant and contemporary (if only by implication) scheme, but this, sadly, was not attempted. Throw in a terribly dry, does-she-love-him-or-not subplot with Lois Lane that we have seen multiple times before, and you've got the Superman of today.<br /><br />The only problem is that it is not a Superman for today at all. The film is nostalgia of the worst kind and offers nothing more, and perhaps considerably less, than we have seen dragged out of the Superman story time and time again. Superman is not one of the most interesting superheroes to begin with, so when an uninspired movie like this takes the story and does no more than rehash it, the result is tedium. Sure there are some exciting sequences and some impressive special effects, but these can do little for a film with characters so dry and a plot so plain that little, if any, interest can be vested in them. Singer tries to add depth through a Christ-like reading of Superman, achieved through some hit-over-the-head religious imagery, but given all the ingredients of the film this seems forced at best. Singer would do better to concentrate on entertainment first and stimulating metaphor second with a film such as this.<br /><br />One of the main things I took away from \\"Superman Returns\\" was a realization of how little interested I am in most of the young actors of Hollywood these days. Five to ten years ago the possibilities seemed fantastic as actors such as Edward Norton, Giovanni Ribisi, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and, yes, evenKevin Spacey were taking over the screens and forcing audiences to take notice of their intense, exhilarating performances. Some great actors start out hot, only to fizzle out later in their careers (Robert DeNiro anyone?), but actors now seem to start out dull from the go. As unimpressive a crew of actors I have seen stroll through the reels of \\"Superman Returns\\" and bring absolutely nothing to the admittedly poor material they are given. Brandon Routh may be physically impressive and easily likened to Reeves but it must be remembered here that a two-inch chin does not an actor make. Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane seemed to in fact be present and delivering her lines, but beyond that her presence is barely notable. Even Kevin Spacey, who was so brilliantly villainous in Singer's own \\"The Usual Suspects\\", is shockingly dull as the possibly exuberant and entertaining Luthor. Spacey could have easily stolen the movie, but apart from one playful moment (\\"Say it just once for me please...\\") does nothing but stare blankly and occasionally role his eyes, perhaps at his own dialogue. The story is poor, but whereas some actors may have brought some life to it, this troupe sucks away any that may have remained out.<br /><br />Formula rules Hollywood and right now the superhero movie dominates. Like all repeatable genres, its popularity comes from some truly great films such as \\"Spiderman 2\\" and \\"Batman Begins\\" (movies I hate to love, see first paragraph), but \\"Superman Returns\\" is far from the cream of the crop. Watch it for Routh doing his best Reeves impression, watch it for the opening titles, watch it for the special effects, or don't watch it for all the other reasons I have given. It is one of those summer movies that could so easily have been good but instead falls flat. In fact, the more I write about it the more my disdain for it grows. It is losing stars by the sentence, so I'll quit and save what little is salvageable.even Kevin Spacey were taking over the screens and forcing audiences to take notice of their intense, exhilarating performances.

0451528956|4.0|Published in 1886, THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE was an instant sensation and had a tremendous impact on later generations; it would not be an exaggeration to say that there have been hundreds of stage and film productions drawn either directly or indirectly from the original Robert Louis Stevenson story.  Readers who come to the story from these adaptations, however, will very likely be surprised: few of them do more than borrow Stevenson's central concept.<br /><br />Unlike the numerous stage and film adaptations, Dr. Jekyll is not a young or remarkably handsome man, nor the book does not contain any of the romantic subplots to which its adaptations are prone.  At approximately one hundred pages, the story is very direct and extremely well suited to Stevenson's very precise style, which is very clean yet extremely evocative and very readable.<br /><br />That said, modern readers are unlikely to be shocked by the book.  For one thing, the story is too well known; for another, it contains very little of the graphic horror typical of current horror stories.  But more than anything else, DR. JEKYLL is very distinctly a novel that draws from the Victorian era, and much of its impact was due to that society's remarkable hypocrisy; it was a world in which appearances were everything and a double life \\"acceptable\\" as long as you were not caught at it.<br /><br />The same concept arises in two other novels from the same era, Bram Stoker's DRACULA and Oscar Wilde's THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, albeit in distinctly different forms.  But whereas the Stoker and Wilde novels transcend their era, Stevenson's tale does not, and with the passing of Victorian attitudes the work has lost a great deal of its power to shock.  Even so, Stevenson does touch a nerve with his chemically-induced transformation; then as now, drug abuse was a scourge, and in addition to this the work is somewhat similar to Mary Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN in the sense that it anticipates a host of ethical concerns that have become more and more pressing with the passage of time.<br /><br />Although it has not held up as well as the other titles named, DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE is nonetheless unavoidable for any one who has an interest in gothic or horror literature because it had--and continues to have--such a tremendous influence on later works.  Stevenson's prose is elegant, it is \\"an easy read,\\" and I think most contemporary readers will enjoy it if they make the effort to see it within the context of its era.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerof ethical concerns that have become more and more pressing with the passage of time. <br /> <br />Although it has not held up as well as the other titles named, DR.

0201633612|4.0|Like many of the typical Computer Science classical texts, you've got to read it, if only to say you read it :-)     True, the book is C++ focused (it will be somewhat tough for those who only know Java / C#) and it has quite a level of sophistication (probably aimed at those in a Computer Science degree or master's programs). But, that said, it really started a big part of the revolution in OO - open source gave us reusable code, but design patterns gave us reusable solutions to design problems; and this was the book that really \\"lit the fire\\" for patterns.    If you read this then you don't need to read too many more design pattern books as most of them are just regurgitations on the themes outlined here. I've learned so many great solutions from this which I use and re-use in my software development year after year.    I didn't give it 5 stars simply as it's a tough read at times and sometimes you need to re-read a paragraph / section just to make sure you understood what was said.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Even though I don't like most nu-metal or rapcore, there are some bands out there that break the mediocre molds of both of these genres and catches my attention; Linkin Park is one of them. After listening to their debut album, Hybrid Theory, I soon became a fan of the band. About a year a later, Meteroa came out and I was ecstatic. A month or so later, I finally got a chance to listen to it and was soon disappointed. A gave it a few more tries but they didn't help much. The reason being is the lack of good individual songs. Many of the songs on here sound the same, or just no good. I think there was only four songs on the entire album that I liked compared to most of the tracks of their debut (I believe there was only one track I didn't like on it). Even so, I haven't totally given up on Linkin Park, as I really like their new cd, Minutes to Midnight. This cd just makes me sad because I know these guys can do better. Favorite tracks: Somewhere I Belong, Faint, Breaking The Habit, and Numb. That's it.
B00005JOX6|3.0|This movie is kind of cute in its own Adam Sandler goofy-immature-kind of way.  The ending may even have you in tears?  Its worth seeing, but maybe wait til its out on DVD.....
B000FBGBPC|3.0|On their first album, Three Days Grace sounded angry. They had it all, thrashing guitars, pounding drums, screaming vocals, and terrible lyrics. Four qualities for a great hard rock/metal band (okay, the lyrics were actually decent). <br /> <br />But on TDG's new album, they sound like a cross between Sum 41 and Good Charlotte. That's not necessarily bad, except they don't pull it off too well. They mostly sound like a Does This Look Infected?-era Sum 41, which by the way is a great album, but they're a little sappier. As an fan of both GC and Sum 41, I know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br />This would be great if it were TDG's first album. But with the sound they produced on their self-titled debut, and the stuff they produce on this just does not match up. I am a fan of change, and by now you probably hate me enough to not believe me, but this change is in the wrong direction. Metal bands should not become punk bands. It doesn't work. <br /> <br />If you've got twenty bucks and nothing else to spend it on, God forbid, get it. It won't make you want to claw your ears off. But don't expect something like their first album, and don't set your expectations too high. <br /> <br />This review is much too long.
B00005JOQS|4.0|When I first saw the previews for \\"Superman Returns,\\" I got really nostalgic for the \\"Superman\\" I remember seeing while I grew up, Christopher Reeve.  I even went out and bought first the Reeve flick just so I could refresh myself on that movie and introduce my daughter to Reeve's version of the hero.  I knew that director Bryan Singer and his crew would have a tough row to hoe considering how loved Reeve has been since donning the red cape and blue tights.  I was even hoping at one point to be let down by this new vision of one of the world's most famous superheroes.<br /><br />Instead, I saw a film that pays homage not only to Christopher Reeve's \\"Superman,\\" but also to the old serial starring George Reeves that most of my generation and definitely these young kids today haven't seen or heard of.  Singer takes great care of forming newcomer Brandon Routh's version of Superman into a completely new being with a consistent nostalgic nod to those in the role before him.  Granted, some liberties are taken with the character, but they don't take away from the mythos of the original comic hero.<br /><br />The story goes like this:  Superman, after finding out that astronomers think they have located his home planet of Kryptonite, heads off to see it for himself.  He returns five years later and empty-handed, not finding what he is looking for.  Almost immediately, he begins doing what he always did:  fight for truth, justice, and the American way.  Some quibble over a line delivered in the film that refers to \\"truth, justice, and all that stuff\\" as being unpatriotic, but I felt that the line was rendered in a fashion that didn't take away from the \\"American way.\\"  Besides, real fans of Superman know that he is definitely for the American way, no matter who tries to make him politically correct.  Anyway, while saving the planet as usual, Supe's old foe, Lex Luthor, is once again planning to take over the world, Lois Lane is engaged and has a young son, and Jimmy Olsen is still full of giddy, childlike innocence and ignorance.<br /><br />Routh was perfectly cast as the Man of Steel.  He has a look that harkens back to Christopher Reeve, but manages to make the character his own.  Kate Bosworth has received a lot of flack for being cast as Lois Lane, but she, much like everyone else in this flick, had some very big shoes to fill.  I miss Margot Kidder's raspy, sassy Lois, but Bosworth does a wonderful job no less.  I also longed to see Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, but Kevin Spacey is sinisterly devious in his execution of the role.  Much like in the older \\"Superman\\" flicks, Luthor delivers some of the funniest lines and relishes in his wickedness.  Sam Huntington is game as Jimmy Olsen, though his role is considerably smaller than everybody else's in this flick.  Frank Langella and James Marsden play father and son, Perry and Richard White.  Richard is engaged to Lois, and although Superman is a little miffed about this, he doesn't linger on it long once he realizes that Richard is a decent and caring man.  Parker Posey plays Kitty Kowalski.  She's no Valerie Perrine, but she has enough goofy charm to steal plenty of thunder from Spacey's Luthor during the film.  There will never be another Otis, performed originally by Ned Beatty, but Kal Penn (Harold and Kumar Go To Whitecastle) is the only recognizable member of a gaggle of thugs that Luthor keeps with him.  Few words are spoken amongst the group, but they have a very intense sequence in the film when they meet up with Superman.<br /><br />Singer was careful not to offend fans of the older versions of \\"Superman,\\" maintaining the goofy charm of Clark Kent and the \\"big boy scout\\" quips by Superman such as nagging Lois about smoking.  He spent a lot of time allowing us to see Superman in flight, giving the audience a healthy dose of trips into outerspace, skimming the ocean with Lois, and catching falling victims in mid-air.  He also pumped up Supe's eye beams, putting them to frequent, and visually fun, use.  We get to check out the X-ray vision, outrunning speeding bullets, stopping speeding bullets, and even a cool flight through fire.<br /><br />Much like Sam Raimi with the \\"Spiderman\\" films, I feel that Bryan Singer was truly the best choice for taking command of a project like \\"Superman Returns.\\"  He obviously loves the character, and respects the old TV shows, movies, and the comics.  This movie was much better than I ever expected and looks to be a very solid beginning to a new series of \\"Superman\\" flicks.  Hopefully Singer will be able to make more of these films and give them the treatment they deserve.  He managed to make a superhero flick with heart, and that's a hard thing to do these days considering the ease of CGI use.  Most directors, as did Brett Ratner with the latest \\"X-Men\\" installment, dump storyline for action sequences.  Singer serves up plenty of both in this latest entry into the comic movie world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a great story, light humor, and plenty of action.  Also, for all of you Christopher Reeve fans out there who think you shouldn't tamper with perfection, just know that \\"Superman Returns\\" realizes where it came from and does justice to the past.frequent, and visually fun, use.

0321127420|5.0|Martin Fowler is making a name for himself as a luminary in the area of Software Development. He writes very practical books that have a wonderful blend of theory (e.g. design patterns, UML, refactoring etc.) with experience as you can tell he has applied many if not all of these patterns in real-life projects. This book is an exposition into architectural building blocks that will help every architect and tech lead / senior developer build code that is more extensible and easily maintained (among other things). I found the chapters on O/R structural and behavioral patterns particularly enlightening. By reading this book your \\"toolbox\\" of solutions rapidly expands and you get to focus more on the business problem at hand rather than infrastructural \\"plumbing\\" things (e.g. how do I build my objects when my data is in a relational table). Very highly recommended - and definitely one of the top 5 software books I have *EVER* had the pleasure to read.

This book proved that all classics aren't boring. I would definitely say that if this is on your high school reading list, read it, because it's a lot better than Anna Karenina and you can get hooked on it. There aren't a lot of big words that require a dictionary either.. the only thing that is a little bit difficult is the way the author writes dialogue. It would be best to read it out loud, because sometimes you can miss stuff if you just skim it. All in all, it's a great book, and you should read it.

Deception Point takes us on a terrifying and unpredictable adventure uncovering political conspiracies, dirty and scandelous politicians, and innocent people who are in grave danger because of their knowledge of something that doesn't seems to be.  Read this book and you will be wisked away from this world and be thrown into the turbulant world along with Rachel Sexton (the daughter of a senator), Mike Tolland (a Jaques Custeau type TV star), and other unforgettable characters.  Oh, just pick up the book and you'll see what I am blabbing about.

The mystery is wonderfully done and keeps you guessing until the end.  <br /> <br />Sam and Jane definitely draw you in to their worlds as things go awry and they find each other despite the danger. He might not be the \\"perfect man\\" or her the \\"perfect woman\\" but they are without a doubt a perfect match. It is their story that makes this book my all time favorite, and the fact that it is topped with an intriguing \\"who dun it\\" is just entertaining iceing.

B000EHQ57Q|5.0|The Moody Blues albums have always been famous for their sophisticated production and engeneering (in the vinyl era at least)but the CD transfers up ' til now were absolutely disastrous sounding.<br /><br /> These SACD re-issues finally seem to make things right.<br /><br /> I have only listened to \\"Question\\" but was amazed at the clarity and power of this remastering.<br /><br /> I have not heard the 5.1 suround mix because although i have a Sony dvd player with SACD capability you also have to have a receiver with the proper connections wich is not the usual optical one used for getting surround from movies and such.<br /><br /> Anyway,the stereo remastering has been supervised by Justin Hayward and it shows in the care that was put in this project.<br /><br /> Truly beautiful sound that finally matches the quality of the original recording and does justice to a great album.<br /><br />Ah yes ! It sounds very good on an ordinary cd player too.
B000FVQYYK|2.0|Muse thrives on a cult following that eagerly awaited this fourth album. Poised to reverse the rotation of earth itself, instead, `Black Holes and Revelations' has managed to stagnate all things beautiful. After an engrossing voyage to new space frontiers, Muse have hit a dense cloud with this one. At the pinnacle of their careers they have essentially abandoned posts. Is it irony that this feels like the black hole at the end of what could only be described, a supernova. Yes, the anticlimax is overwhelming and I'm saddened to feel empty listening to it. <br /> <br />The momentum in a frictionless space carries what is essentially a band without fuel. Unbeknownst to fans, pilot, Matt Bellamy has jumped ship. The technical mastery that bore the rocket fuel is missing. If you could imagine a space ship, no doubt this one is covered in advertising stickers and commercials. No siree, this wasn't the way it was suppose to be.  <br /> <br />Lets just replay some of the moments that bring about this catastrophe. <br /> <br />Lack of instrumentation <br />Where are the acrobatics, technical flair, eccentrics. Exo-Politics and Assassin fall short of epic rock anthems. Solo efforts are few and far between and riffs are paper thin.  <br /> <br />Abandoning a sound <br />Without the piano guitar combination feeding off each other, Muse has lost much of their identity. They have completely abandoned a building block to their creative abilities, and less expansive for it. <br /> <br />Lyrics <br />It has always been iffy, but on this album its completely horrid. The acne ridden, self indulgent, cheesy verses of Invincible are quite simply torturous, \\"Stand up for what you believe in, together we are invincible\\". <br /> <br />Looping <br />Map of the Problematique and Starlight are stuck in a Verse Chorus Verse structure. The songs flatline, as they insist on repeating themselves. Even the way the same lyrics are sung from one verse to another. They used to re-inject songs with instrumental, melodic and pace changes which revitalized tracks midway. Even Knights of Cydonia, for all its punches still conforms to rules of conduct. Looping the chorus in the final third. <br /> <br />Sampling <br />Their lackluster experimenting has left an album with no direction at all. It delves lightly into a few genres but ends up giving us bite size samples. They don't really rip into any particular sound. Just spoon dipping. Super Massive Blackhole for one is a very generic dance funk song. <br /> <br />Glossy Pop <br />There is a very menacing pop sound to some of the songs, almost commercial friendly. Sitting back as if, Warner Brothers had something to say. Its got a very SONY sound. The volume levels are normalized, and bottled up. <br /> <br />Lack of cohesion <br />The songs are disjointed for the most part. There is no running theme, or underlying feel to the album. Only towards the latter does a particular direction emerge. A futuristic spaghetti western, flamenco sound. And it works well in a comic book sort of way. City of Delusion is inspiring and the Calxico style trumpet solo is very well incorporated. Hoodoo continues the charade with a very engaging Cowboyish stand off. Actually feeding off City of Delusion. Whilst Knights of Cydonia ends the short saga with galloping horses and `Ennio Morricone' credits. That cohesion unfortunately comes too late and too short.
B000EULJLU|4.0|10,000 Days, it seems like I've been waiting 10,000 Days for this album to come out. The album is good but, falls in many places. The album gives you a spacey feel, like Lateralus before it. There is WAY too much production on this album and some of the tracks are no good. The tracks \\"Lost Keys\\", \\"Rosetta Stoned\\", \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" and the final track don't live up the rest of the CD. Aside from all the negative things on the album, Tool does deliver 7 wonderful tracks of spacey, thoughtful music. The album really relaxes me and makes me think a lot about who I am and my role on this Earth. The two key tracks are the epic \\"Wings For Marie\\" and \\"10,000 Days\\". The tracks form one idea and they are indeed the best tracks on the album. The lyrics on the album are done very well, as expected of Tool. Overall, I very enjoyed most of the album but, it's not Tool's best work.  <br />
B000001ESF|3.0|Rush is a very talented and creative progressive band, but <br />one of the main reasons for these 3 stars is Mr. Geddy Lee's vocals here. His trebles were ugly here and sometimes distuned.  <br /> <br />If you think I'm telling an absurd , listen to Permanent Waves or Moving Pictures to see what I mean and share the differences. I'm not telling Geddy is a bad singer , but he didn't control  the high-pitched voice here correctly in my opinion. <br />The side-long track has good instrumentation and cool bass lines as in many Rush's albums, some intelligent guitar parts in the first half. However,is far from being as embracing as Cygnus X-1 book II/ Hemispheres. <br />A Passage to Bangkok has a congenial riff , but it's only ok. <br />I don't like Something for Nothing very much because of the repetitive melody which sometimes tires me. <br />The best song here is the ballad Tears. Beautiful and decent, Mr. Lee sung better here. <br />I listened Moving Pictures, Hemispheres and Permanent waves too. <br />2112 was the recording that I liked least. If you're new to this <br />excellent prog band , try any of the three albuns I mentioned . It's better.
B000002H33|5.0|METALLICA IN MY OPINION IS ONE OF THE BEST BANDS, THESE BANDS ARE <br />WORTH A LISTEN WHO ARE BRILLIANT, AND ROCK HARD SUCH AS METALLICA, DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, NIRVANA, AND GUNS N' ROSES. <br />THIS IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE BLACK ALBUM WHICH HAS A GREAT INSTRUMENTAL SONG ORION. I'VE LISTENED TO THAT ABOUT 8 TIMES TODAY AND THOUGHT, THIS TRACK IS GREAT. AND TO THE BEATLES, WELL <br />THEIR MUSIC IS LAME AND NEVER MADE ANYTHING DECENT. METALLICA ARE GREAT, GO GET THIS WITH THE BLACK ALBUM AND ALBUMS FROM DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, NIRVANA, & GNR AND STAY AWAY FROM CRAPPY BANDS LIKE THE BEATLES, ROLLING STONES, LED ZEPPELIN, GREEN DAY, <br />QUEEN, BOSTON, STEVE MILLER, AC/DC, AND AEROSMITH WHO SUCK. <br />LARS ULRICH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DRUMMERS, PERIOD! <br />
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Muse.  I think the boys have always done a great job.  Not until did i hear th is album was i proven wrong.  I believe that this is the best album put out by Muse.  I love the feel to it.  I'm preety stingy on music, and get often worried about new cd's by bands, but i was absolutely amazed at this album. Way To Go!
B0001AP12G|2.0|NOTE: I bought this CD a while ago, the tunes were mediocre. Then again I'm probably biased because I don't really like rap a whole lot.  <br /> <br />Buuuut, what made me throw away this album you ask? <br /> <br />The guy is a racist, who uses this record as a soap box to talk about how evil white people are, and how they're out to screw him over at every turn. Seriously, listen closely, and I counted at least the first 4 to five tracks are sprinkled with racist lyrics. I despise bigots who may have had one or two bad experiences and then turn around and see fit to spit rhymes about how white people are keeping everyone down. I don't care what race you are, don't be hating on races just because you have a selfish, racist streak in you.  <br /> <br /> <br />In \\"Jesus Walks\\" he talks about how we need to defeat racism...well he keeps harking on it. But he won't stop whining. I agree with him, racism does exist and it is a very real problem. However people like him play victim and make millions of dollars off it. I shouldn't have to listen to an album and feel bad about being white, or black, or any other race. Such themes litter the album and take away from its supposed originality.  <br /> <br />Additionally, why does he even think that he is worthy to call upon Jesus? The track following \\"Jesus Walks\\" he talks about getting falacio (I'm trying to be PC, not that it matters). I'm no prude...most of the music i listen is laden with \\"foul language\\". The guy is a hypocrite to an insane degree.  <br /> <br />He raps about the same stuff. And its not different then most other rappers out there. He's really not original at all. Over and over and over again: Look at me I'm important, feel sorry for me. Its like the emo of rap, the Linkin Park of rap.  <br /> <br /> <br />The guy is a megalomaniac, narcissist, self absorbed racist, and I won't be buying anymore of his music. <br /> <br /> <br />SUMMARY: Musically its ok, nothing really orignial. Just Ok if you like rap (agenre I'm still trying to get into). The guy is talented I'll give him that.  <br /> <br />Lyrically its a joke. He's a fake. If that stuff matters to you. But if it dosn't, then ignore this review....or ignore it because you don't like my opinion.
0316172324|1.0|Starts off very interesting as if there was some grand scheme that was about to be revealed.  However, as the book progressed I was left wondering where all these examples were leading.  I finished the book and hadn't learned anything new and was thoroughly disappointed.  Don't waste your time or money.
0930289528|1.0|This is a review for the paperback version of Alan Moore's graphic novel \\"V for Vendetta\\", purchased in April 2006. <br /> <br />I am a comic book fan and have copies of Alan Moore's other works, in both comic and graphic novel format, all of which I would highly recommend, but I have to say that I was very disappointed in the production quality of \\"V for Vendetta\\" graphic novel in paperback.  The paper used in the book is newsprint quality (or something very close to it), and as a result the artwork reproduces terribly.  All the images are faded and washed out...from the dialogue bubbles to the characters expressions to the backgrounds.  There is no richness in the colors at all.  It makes for a very disappointing read, all the more so since Moore is so detailed in his writing, you can't see any of these nuances in the bleached out artwork. <br /> <br />I'm surprised that DC would charge so much for something that is produced so poorly.  Especially since they have done a perfectly fine job with his other works. <br /> <br />Anyone looking to read this work would be far better off i) finding a copy at a local public library, ii) buying the hardcover version (which reproduces the artwork much more faithfully), or iii) getting the orginal comic book series off an auction website.  But stay away from this paperback graphic novel - even at the discounted Amazon price, it is a waste of money.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Wow!!! You need to listen to this, this is the greatest rock and roll song of all time in Heavy Fuel. Don't give my favorite songs a 1 star, they are brillant and rock. The Beatles are for <br />babies. Huh!! You got to get this with Metallica, Foreigner, Nirvana, and GNR as they are all great bands. Beatles Stones and Zeppelin all suck. Don't recommend me back in black or the wall <br />as they suck. get this.
0385336691|3.0|Too much hubris and self satisfaction on Reacher's part. The action and suspense is good
B00092ZMDY|5.0|We watched the concert on tv in high def and immediately afterward went to the internet to see where we could go and watch this amazing show IN PERSON. <br /> <br />We found a show at the MGM in Las Vegas and booked the trip and bought concert tix the next day, we ended up in the 4th row!!   <br /> <br />The dvd is almost exactly what their live show is, amazing!  We watch this over and over again and never get tired of it.  Its a great mix of their old stuff, solo songs and some new songs too.
B000002BYD|5.0|This is my favorite Pearl Jam cd.  But I will say that 10, vs, and Yield are all pretty close.  All 3 should be in the top 30 cd list of all time.  That is saying alot! <br /> <br />Every song on here is so cool.  There are so many different styles rolled into one jamming cd. <br /> <br />Vs. is the best hard rocker of the 3 cd's and 10 has a good mix of hard and kinda epic songs such as Black, etc.  But Yield is overall the best.
B00005JP4U|5.0|A terrific even though frightening film.  Al Gore has it right.  It seems he should have been a teacher instead of a politican though.  I thought he gave an excellent lecture and used graphics in the best possible way.  Everyone should see this film.
0684857219|5.0|This a Very nice book for a serious bodybuilder,... but you have to read to much to get the information you want. More than half of the book is filled with anecdotes, stories, and photographs of bodybuilders, but not as much coverage of the actual exercises.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, this is Still a good book if you are an Arnold's Fan and you want to spend some time reading. As a matter of fact I bought it, but don't use it that much after reading it. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a more comprehensive, concise and straight to the point reference on exercises, principles of training, programs, and nutrition, you may want to check \\"Ultimate Bodybuilding\\" by Joe Weider and Bill Reynolds.
B000002UAO|5.0|John's peak and his best set of songs. The torch will soon be passed over to Paul...   <br />Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),Nowhere Man,The Word, Girl, In My Life ,  Run For Your Life are among his best ever, period. <br /> <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|Are the Beatles overrated?  No <br /> <br />Is Abby Road overrated?  NO <br /> <br />This is the best most complete album the Beatles recorded!  Top 10 ever!!!! <br /> <br />Sgt. Peppers is overrated though.  It's good, groundbreaking, and influential.  But it is not near as good as Abby Road. <br /> <br />I think the White Album had more great songs, but it also had many weak songs.  Hey, use the ipod for the songs you want off of the White Album.  I have almost all the songs off Abby on ipod, but it's still good to listen to the entire cd.
B0000019PA|5.0|There are no words that can do the weight and emotional intensity of this album justice.  Just listen for yourself and hear what WE ALL mean.
B00000JPYD|3.0|Original comments:  Trower has got to be the biggest clone in history.  I'm sorry that he likes to play that way, but HENDRIX ALREADY DID ALL OF THIS, and he did it much better. Why do it again?  Everything about Trower---his tone, songs, lyrics, note choice---it's all a Hendrix ripoff.  Ugghhh ... It's disgusting.  I'm embarassed for the guy.  Edit (February 2012):  I wanted to apologize for my original review. Though I still feel that Trower's music sounds incredibly similar to Hendrix's, it's not my way anymore to spread negativity like that. If he enjoys playing that way and it brings joy to his life (and others enjoy listening to it), then that's all that matters. I apologize if I upset anyone with my words.  Misha: I am a guitar player too, and I still feel as though Trower's playing is quite derivative. But like I said, this is just my opinion, and everyone is entitled to that.  Anyway, I know that Trower has brought a lot of joy to people's lives, and that's the important thing. Again, I apologize.
0743455967|4.0|Reading ON WRITING is a little like having a barbecue and a beer, with a guy who burps and swears and tells you all the stories no one else will. You may turn the pages thinking, \\"Oh, my heavens, how could he?\\" But, you won't be bored. And you will learn a great deal about story telling, more by osmosis than direct how-to advice.<br /><br />Overall, this colorful book is not for the faint of heart or the delicate of ear (I could have done without the foul language.) However, it's worth the read if you want...<br /><br />...to discover that even a best-selling author collects enough rejection slips to wallpaper his entire house, inside and out (or apartment, as the case may be...seeing as creative writing rarely makes anyone a respectable buck--King being a major exception)<br /><br />...to read a very entertaining, though not always polite, story about one writer's circuitous journey<br /><br />...to get inside a writer's head (a scary place, no doubt, but in King's case an awfully humorous space. Also, a bit surprising, as when King reveals that he believes in God.)<br /><br />...to find a little happily-ever-after in the mysterious realm of the publishing world.<br /><br />You don't have to be a King fan, or a barbecue lover, or an alcohol imbiber (I'm not) to enjoy this \\"memoir of the craft.\\" You just need to be a writing wonk who is open to advice from any corner (yes, of course, I am).
B000003BF1|5.0|Let it Bleed should be near the top of any rock cd list.  Sticky Fingers is close behind. <br /> <br />Monkey Man is so crazy cool <br />Midnight Rambler <br />Gimme Shelter <br />Can't Always Get What You Want <br />Live With Me is also crazy cool <br /> <br />Amazing!  Something else that is amazing is how fast they went down hill in the late 70's.  There were a few good songs here and there after the mid 70's, but nothing compared to the era of late 60's and very early 70's. <br /> <br />By the way, I think Exile is a solid album with a cool vibe, but it's not in the same ballpark as Let It Bleed.  How Exile gets put on the top 10 list ever is a joke.  It's good, but not that good.   <br /> <br />Anyway, LET IT BLEED rocks & should be in the top 10 ever.
B000002LQR|5.0|I remember 1991 as a year when the compact disc began to gain serious popularity over the cassette tape as the musical medium of choice.  More importantly though, 1991 laid the foundation  for the next decade of what was to come musically, and was arguably one of the most important and influential years in music in the past 15 years.      Nevermind, Ten, Achtung Baby, Use Your Illusion I & II, Metalica's Black Album, BSSM...      It blows my mind to think that these albums--each monumental in their own respect and the definitive albums in the careers of their makers--were realeased in a single year, let alone in a span of two months (August and September, 1991)  But this review isnt about 1991 or what Pearl Jam, Nirvana and the RHCP were doing in late August; it's about the most monstrous effort of all...an album that would transcend generations since its inception and leave a stamp on the lives of many of us now in our 20's and early 30's.    Blood Sugar Sex Magik is OUR album.  You know who you are.  It oozes sex and radiates with an energy that I can only describe as that.  Its funk is ridiculous, and its power dictates our bodies when we listen to it...like a puppetmaster.  Simply put, there's something that I can only describe as Magikal happening in this album.  I can't put my finger on it, but those of you who own this album probably know what I'm getting at.  It approaches the full 74 minute capacity of a CD, all along consistently maintaining its flow of energy and never once lets up.    For me, this is hands down THE definitive album of the last 15 years of my life.  The other albums I've listed above are brilliant but BSSM covers more ground, is heavier, more powerful, deeper, and has more prescence.  It left its mark on me long ago and continues to evolve with me.  It's part of my essence.    I'd consider myself to have a diverse and extensive taste in and collection of music, and although I can't tell you exactly why, of all the music I have ever owned, this one cd has gotten the most spins and never tires on me.     BSSM barely managed to stay out of the mainstream and never got overplayed on the radio.  Maybe it had soemthing to do with the other activity that year in music.  Who knows.  The result though is that this album has attained what I would describe as almost a cult-like following in that those of us who have owned it from the start have become part of it and simply \\"get it\\".  It's a guy's album.   Whether 15 and just listening to it for the first time, or 35 and had it since its release, there are a lot of guys out there with an intense passion for this album.       If you own this album and havent thought about it or listened to it recently, this is a friendly reminder to get it going again.  If you don't own this album...well...that's too bad, but I guess its never too late to pick it up and experience the hype for yourself.    Cheers.
0790740443|5.0|I really loved this story! Each actor played his role perfectly and the filming and special effects were outstanding.
6304698623|5.0|THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE WITH A LOT OF HEART IN IT. GREAT AS A PRESENT FOR A GIRL AT ANY TIME.
B000000W5N|5.0|Sticky Fingers And Let It Bleed are top notch Stones. <br /> <br />Sticky Fingers <br /> <br />Can't You Here Me Knocking & Bitch alone are worth the price. <br /> <br />A great album with different styles.  I love the hard Stones and the very mellow cool Stones.  Sticky Fingers has some of both. <br /> <br />I do like Let It Bleed better though.  It's harder! <br /> <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|It scares me to see less then 5 stars all round for this album, but hey ho, every song is pure genius! <br /> <br />people who dont get it wont change, so leave them listening to some cheap fluff.
0767812166|5.0|Starman ranks up there with my all time favorites.  The movie is very well done from the story to directing to casting and to presentation and special effects.  I love it.
B000046PVN|5.0|I have the previous edition, and the notes that came with it were nestled next to the CD in a thick booklet (with a cover of Reeve in front of an American flag) that was large enough for the slipcase cover, but too big to fit into the CD case front.  Otherwise, the one-sheet cover that came with your soundtrack is identical to the slipcase version.
B0002W18MU|4.0|This is growing on me. I have been listening to Cash since I was born. That would be the early 60's.  I'm sure I heard it while in my mom's womb.  My entire family loves Johnny Cash.    It took me longer to get into AHH then it did a couple of other American Cash recordings.    No matter what songs had been on AHH, I would have bought it.  But when I heard that IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND LOVE was going to be on AHH I was so excited.  Gordan Lightfoot's version is one of the most beautiful songs ever.  I was a little dissapointed at first with Cash's version but I'm getting used to the frail version Cash has done.  It is very moving.    AHH is becoming more enjoyable with each listen and it is touching. All the songs seem good at this point.    My favorites at this point are:    HELP ME  GOD'S GONNA CUT YOU DOWN  LIKE THE 309  FURTHER ON UP THE ROAD  ON THE EVENING TRAIN  LOVES BEEN GOOD TO ME    The following songs are some of the most moving songs ever that came from other American recordings (including Unearthed).    WICHITA LINEMAN  FATHER & SON  POCAHONTAS  BIRD ON A WIRE  DRIVE ON  DARK AS A DUNGEAN  HURT  IN MY LIFE  SINGER OF SONGS  FIRST TIME EVER I SAW YOUR FACE  BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER  CARETAKER    THERE ARE OTHERS BUT THAT IS A START.  Listen to these songs on a good system with the lights down low in some peace and be moved for the rest of your days. If you haven't given this list of songs a good chance yet, I suggest you try it.
0937381888|5.0|Covers eveything the beginner needs to know.  After reading this book I brewed a competition beer using a receipe that I changed from the book Titled Beer Captured.
B00008OE4W|5.0|This is such a good movie.  It has great acting, comedy, action, seriousness and story.  It is hard for me to find a movie this good now a days or when this came out.  I am only 21 so I like finding good movies from before I was born and from when I was a child.  Anyway this movie is easly enjoyable for anyone who likes anything.  The comedy will keep you laughing and the action will keep you needing to see what happens next.  This is a fantastic movie and I wish they made new movies or even more older movies as good as this one is.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This is honestly one of the best films that I've ever seen in my entire life.  Actually it is so good, I am compelled to write a review....... something that I've never done before. <br /> <br />I first saw this movie at home on cable. When I started watching it, I really didn't think much about it (almost expected it to be mediocre actually) because I hadn't once heard anything good (or bad).  I figured a movie as profound as I found out it was should have AT LEAST created some sort of stir among someone I knew... <br /> <br />I haven't gone through all of the reviews, so I don't know if this was mentioned prior to me mentioning it here, but what REALLY struck a chord with me(and actually what the movie teaches you in general) is that EVERYTHING that happens in your life effects you.  It affects how you look at things in the future, it affects your confidence, it affects your attitude, etc. Okay, maybe this of course is a given but the bigger meaning is that seeing this movie really opens your eyes to seeing what is always said is REALLY true!! Especially when you see it in front of you like that. Seeing it in your face really goes to show how an individual's attitude towards events in their live's can go either one way or another.  And in the end, the life that you live can go one way or another too ;) <br /> <br />Basically, everything that occurs to us... WE have control how we react and therefore HOW it affects our future.  The event does not control us; rather we control how the event affects us after it occurs.  Very quantum theory/kabbalahistic/spiritual I would say.  I actually plan on watching this movie from time to time (along with \\"What the Bleep Do We Know) in order to keep this important point in the forefront of my mind :) <br />
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|This is Plant's 2nd best cd.  Fate Of Nations is the best.  I would actually give MR a 4.75. <br /> <br />Four Winds <br />Takamba <br />Freedom Fries <br /> <br />Those are my 3 favs. on MR. <br /> <br />Shine It All Around is actually my least favorite. <br /> <br />For those that were somewhat dissapointed with most of Plant's albums in the 80's, I'm right there with you.  Even the more popular Now & Zen is so hard to listen to now.  It is so dated sounding unlike the mighty ZEP.  And Plant is my favorite singer. <br /> <br />Bottom line: This has a great sound. But it doesn't have an epic great song such as Great Spirit, Memory Song, Carry Me Down To The Sea, Come Into My Life, and Greatest Gift (all of of Fate Of Nations). That's the difference.  But it is still great.  <br />Fate Of Nations just happens to be at least a top 5 ever. So it's hard to beat FON.
1401302378|5.0|Anderson takes a simple concept and uses it to bring order to the often chaotic world of the internet and information exchange more generally.  If you're interested in business, economics, or self-expression--I recommend this book! <br /> <br />I'd also recommend Surowiecki's \\"The Wisdom of Crowds\\" as a nice complementary read.
B0000042MY|5.0|The movie is great, the soundtrack transcends space and time.  There is absolutely no equal.  Epic movies deserve epic soundtracks, and oh boy is this one.  Simply a goosebump producing, bone-chilling, emotional lightning storm of greatness.  If you don't feel like a glowing ball of energy after this one, well...........
B00062RCBW|5.0|The complete sries of Star trek the Next Generation is awesome as it contains everything a true Trek fan would want from the new cast of Roddenberry's classic series.  In this series we meet new friends and enemies such as The Borg.  Worth the money and a great gift for any Star trek fan.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This collection is not only for those who love the Bealtes, but for those who love seeing the best live music played right in your home.  The concerts and recording sessions only give you a taste of how amazing it was to be in the same vicinity with these guys.  \\"Hey jude\\" is performed live as well as \\"Let it be\\" and many more.  Their ability to write music, and peform music will inspire musicians for years to come.  So regardless of what you know or don't know about the Bealtes, the anthology is a great time.
B0000026DJ|5.0|Somewhere in a back corner of my mind, I foster an ambition in my next life of being Peter Garrett's runt sibling (I mean, I'd have to be a runt, wouldn't I? He's bigger than almost anybody I've ever seen on stage doing rock and roll) and the drummer in the band. That's how involved I get with Midnight Oil's music when I hear it. \\"Diesel And Dust\\", probably their most media-friendly album - even if, as an American, you don't get some of the political references (and make no mistake; Midnight Oil's music is not love songs or mundane angst; almost without reserve, it is ALL political) is also pretty much their most tuneful. That said, Peter cannot be said to be singing as much as pushing, growling, and wailing the songs out, albeit in a more or less agreeably melodic way. I could be accused of being not very picky, but personally I prefer voices like that, with genuine emotion and pure guts coming from every note. Pretty, trained singing is really fairly lifeless to me. This is the real deal, raw, angry, demanding your attention. I lived in Australia for a while - where I became acquainted with this music - and got to know the politics behind the songs. Down Under, you have a political opinion and you espouse it, sometimes loudly, but never do you hide your candle under a basket - everybody has a personal view and they're not afraid to let you know what it is.  Midnight Oil, along with a lot of Aussie bands, uses their music as a forum, as shown when they set up an ad hoc outdoor performance in front of the Exxon headquarters in New York some time ago. (Wish I'd been there.) \\"Diesel And Dust\\" is rife with topical references, which still play well, nearly 20 years on; the genocide over generations of the Aboriginal people - did you know they were used in biological experiments, a lot of them quite deadly, until fairly recently? - ecological suicide, pollution, almost any hot-button topic is not beyond the reach of the Oils. And yet the music is so singable and danceable that they're able to get you thinking about the content before you even know you are. It's hard to pick a favourite on the album - the only song I'm not crazy about, and even then I usually don't skip over it ,is \\"Whoah\\" because it's a little draggy. \\"Bullroarer\\", \\"The Dead Heart\\", \\"Warakurna\\" and \\"Sell My Soul\\" are probably what I would list as favourites, for the sake of argument and discussion; all of them get my blood moving, and the instrumentation does not take a backseat to Peter's insistent yowls and vocal crescendos. Everything that comes from instrument or throat complements the other. This is probably my favourite Midnight Oil album, because it was my introduction to the band, but it is by no means the only one in my collection. I would have to recommend it highly to anyone who wants to expand their musical inventory - and get a little commentary on the side that is perhaps new to them. And next life, Peter.

B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best version I've seen! It is the closest to the book. While it may seem a little long to some people, it really is the best version, even compared to the newest one. The actors did an excellent job of portraying the characters, and the clothing is true to the time period. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Jane Austen's works.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is an inspirational story about a man stricken with ALS pouring his heart out to his long lost student (Mitch Albom). The old professor realizes that he doesn't have much time left, as does the student, and the pair meets once a week to discuss as aspects of life. Instead of sulking in self pity for his last few weeks on earth Morrie sees a golden opportunity to express things to the ones he loved, to say good bye before he is gone forever. The thing about life is that we rarely know when it's going to end, Morrie was given the chance to say goodbye to everyone he loved while conveying his message to millions that tuned into his three appearances on `Nightline.'<br /><br />Reading this book taught me a lot of things about myself and about life. Many people, including myself, take each day for granted, assuming we deserve to wake up. Our days on this earth are certainly numbered but the time is truly sufficient to lead a rewarding life. There is specific way to go through life but Morrie does set out a blueprint to show how to handle every aspect or roadblock encountered, while leading a fulfilling life. Money is the lone factor that motivates some people, the thing that will grant them `happiness.' The truth is that all the money on the world cannot buy time; it can not let you go back in the past or alter the events of your future. While we are on this earth many will live in the past or the future rather than the present, sulking in what they should have done and fretting as to what they will do.  After my time has come to an end on earth, I want to be able, as Morrie was, to look at my self in the mirror and be happy with the way that I spent my days on this earth. I am so glad that I was given the opportunity to read such a book at a young age (20) and have plenty of time implement Morrie's words of wisdom, to live my life to the fullest.<br /><br />Rest in Peace Morrie Schwartz,<br /><br />Brian Bowen
B000001C6M|4.0|I've been searching for this item everywhere!!  I found it on Amazon.com and I was delighted to see it.  This album is Slayers first, and it is one of the best!!  If you like fast riffs, killer solos and just pure insanity, then you should definitely pick up your own copy today!!!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I never saw the theatrical version after hearing rumors of how much meat was taken out it. I am glad to see this version is here. Honestly, after viewing the director's cut, I see no flab at all that would have made the movie better if it had stayed on the cutting room floor. Essentially, Ridley drops us into an astonishing world, gives us a mostly fictional protagonist to guide us through it and tells a damn good story along the way. Much has been said of historical inaccuracies and what not. But really, if I want a dissertation on history, I will watch a documentary! The central theme is what is important here, which is pretty much the same as in Gladiator. Can an honorable man keep his honor in a dishonorable world? The answer is yes...but for a price. I've watched it several times and have loaned it to a friend. I find I can't wait for him to give it back to me so I can see it again! I was bothered at first by the choice of Orlando in the leading role, simply because I thought he looked too young to play a world weary blacksmith. After the second viewing I saw that I was mistaken. Watch how his face twitches when Godfrey tells him that \\"Everything that made this place your home is dead.\\" Yes, there is some fudging with history to make the story play out more dramatically. Yes, many of the characters have anachronistic attitudes about their religion, but these dramatic decisions were essential in connecting the past to the present and to a history which is still playing out. <br /> <br />A thousand years or so isn't that long.
B00005JKGK|4.0|This movie is a beautiful story about four Chinese women and their four American-born daughters. The stories deal with identity, survival, sacrifice, love, respect, pride, and forgiveness. I cried at the end of this film because this movie stresses the importance of mother and daughter relationship. We carry the spirits of our fore mothers and it dictates what we do with our lives.  <br /> <br /> I have one negative comment to make and it involves the image of Asian men. After drying my tears from watching this movie, something struck me hard because I felt this movie made Asian men look bad. Yes, there were two positive Asian male characters in this movie. There was the stereotypical Asian father who played June's father (one of the daughters). Then there was Lena's second husband, but he came across as a token. It felt like the producers threw him in to keep the Asian community from getting upset, because there was no story development about him and Lena's life and their love, but you knew EXACTLY what happened with Waverly, Rose, and their white husbands.  <br /> <br />The one character that really bugged me was Rose. Her husband cheated on her because she was too much of an Asian wife. She put her husband's needs before hers and as a result, he wanted to leave her, which she tries to stop. It is not until she learned the story of her grandmother that she understands her \\"worth\\". After learning her worth, she and her husband stays together. The movie is blaming HER and her culture for why her husband cheated, but blames Asian men when they do the same thing (am I the only one that sees this?).   <br /> <br />I am a black female (how odd for a black woman to be defending Asian men) and I have studied the Asia culture, so I know this movie is bias. What strikes me as wrong is this movie is often compared to \\"The Color Purple\\". At least the black men (like Mister) are allowed to change to become better men and the women did not rely on men (of any race) for their happiness as this movie does. There is nothing wrong with finding happiness with a man (I am a traditionalist in that perspective), but Rose needs to dig deeper to find out why she is so needy. If you want a more balanced portrayal of Asian women and men, check out the movies from Asia. However, this movie is still a MUST SEE! <br />
B000B8QEYC|5.0|What can I say but that this album is yet another tour de force by the multi-talented singer, Enya.  Each song included on the disk is further evidence of the artist's unique understanding of what her fans want and will ultimately cue up at their favorite record store to purchase.  Let's face the reality here, shall we?  Enya fans worldwide may not necessarily want to hear her \\"branching out\\" into other musical genre, as so many artists have done recently, and that's not such a bad thing.  It seems to work for Enya, after all, and how can you argue with success?  As the old adage goes, \\"if it ain't broke.....\\"   <br /> <br />All in all, a worthy album to compliment her others, and Enya's fans will undoubtedly embrace it with open arms.  Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommendable as well!
B000HT386M|3.0|I love many of Adam Sandler's movies.  I think they are funny and hilarious!  I have noticed a definite change in maturity of Adam Sandler's movies as time has gone by, for the better.  I am a big fan of Saturday Night Live, as well, though I haven't watched it on a regular basis for the past 10 years.  And I'm also a big fan of many other Saturday Night Alum, seeing their successful transfer to Hollywood Movies.<br /><br />Therefore, based on my past experience I had high hopes for this one.  And the way they marketed it in the advertising, you would have thought it was a classic family American comedy.  In fact, when I rented it, I brought it home, and almost immediately put it on, in our living room in front of my whole family!<br /><br />For the most part, it is a very good movie.  I would give it four stars for sure.  However, it seems Adam is still falling back on his old tricks.  Some of which are inappropriate for this type of movie, even rated PG-13.  I'm talking about these samples:<br /><br />1) Young children using 4 letter words, in very inappropriate situations, without expected reactions from adults; sorry but if I said something that bad, at the dinner table with my grandparents, I'd be asked to leave the table and grounded for a week,  It would have also been accompanied by a spanking.<br /><br />2) The life-size duck and dog joke went on about 5 times too many.  Maybe just a reference, and no visual would have been more effective<br /><br />3) I don't think I've ever seen a shadow image of sex, but watching Mr. Sandler's purported back-side in up and down motion, multiple times,  is not my idea of family PG-13 humor.<br /><br />4) If I see somebody farting in somebody's face in a movie, and you expect my respect, I better be viewing a diaper changing scene of a newborn, or other similar event.  Sorry, I don't care how much of a jerk the guy/gal receiving the facial beef taco is, its still vulgar and not funny.  It barely worked in \\"Bench-Warmers,\\" it doesn't work here!<br /><br />5) How old is Adam?  41 to 45, at the beginning?  And we're supposed to believe his confusion over remote controls?  Come on, he was 4 when he saw his father and mother keep walking up to the television without a remote, and changing the channel.  He's virtually lived his whole life with remote controls.  And since when does somebody keep a garage remote in a house.  Wouldn't you more than likely keep it uhh, in your car, so when you drive up, you can open the garage door?  Stupid!  I think most morons know the difference between a garage remote and a television remote.<br /><br />6) Sorry, Adam just doesn't pull it off as an executive.  Maybe a low level office staff person?  But an executive?  Come on!<br /><br />7) A secretary asking to use the bathroom?  What planet am I on?  Whacky characters don't work in quite normal situations.  I think the secretary asking permission to use a bathroom would have worked if the other characters around her were stranger than she.  As it was, it was just dumb.<br /><br />I did think the story-line was unique, in that it brought the old \\"Christmas tale\\" or even the old Jimmy Stewart classic Christmas story, up to modern times.  I thought it was fine, and I saw it has a homage, not a rip off of prior similar stories.  But given my above complaints, I have to dock it one less star.<br /><br />3 Stars (could have easily been 4 stars!)<br /><br />MC White said: I would pass, unless you're ready for family fun mixed with raunchy humor.41 to 45, at the beginning?

B00005N7Z1|5.0|robocop is one of those films that is somewhat of a genre unto itself...somehow the extremity of the violence lends it a horror vein...the technology becomes science fiction...the sets somehow become almost gothic...alienated...the theme is overtly tragic...the humor is at times ridiculous almost slapstick... at others pointedly black...i love this film...it resonates as much today as it did in it's first screening...it is at once thrilling and unsettling...there is little luxury or dependance on extensive special effects here instead the director relies on the narrative...on the tragedy and the quest for understanding the unimaginable in one man...on the sense of loss and the need for balance...there is much evil in this film much bloodshed and excess but to marginalize robocop for these undercurrents would be unjust...this is a tragedy and without the dark we would never comprehend the light...this film exemplifies this duality perfectly...watch it and you will see...
0002247437|4.0|As many Martin Fans, I couldn't wait for this book to come out and actually bought the hard copy.... But then I started reading and couldn't really get into it. I missed my favorite characters (Daenerys, Arya and Jon), and couldn't quite get acquainted with some of the new ones.... So, for months it was lying on my bed stand, waiting to be finished. <br /> <br />When I finally got over this disappointment and took the time, however, I fast changed my mind. Sure, there are new characters (maybe even a bit too many), but once you get into their stories, they turn out to be fascinating! Moreover, it turned out that I was wrong about the less favorite characters from previous books: Sansa is growing up and becoming less annoyingly girlish as the pages fly by. And Jaime is actually becoming sympathetic! I can't wait to follow their stories in the next books. <br /> <br />So why no 5 stars, but only 4? Brienne's journey (with her varying company of numerous knights and paiges) was too long, and too many pages were spent on Cersei's underhanded dealings with the court's different lords and ladies. And even though I know it's an editing choice and all will hopefully be well when the next volume comes out, I still think the book would have been better balanced when all characters would have been there... It's exacyly the dynamic between different contingent storylines that make the first books so awesome.  <br /> <br />Still, I will definitely run to the book store again as soon as Dance With Dragons comes out... and hope that Martin keeps his word and finishes in seven books (as I hate these series that just go on... and on.... and on). I want to know how it ends!
0316172324|4.0|Gladwell has a tendency to write about obvious ideas and concepts as if they were his own ground-breaking insights, but it's easy to forgive him for doing so because he is such an engaging and easy-to-read writer.     He culls heavily from major psychological studies, and illustrates points with anecdotal profiles of different people and events, disseminating all this information in an easily digestible and thought-provoking way. He is a gifted storyteller, even though he is not writing a story per se.     In short, his theories aren't always cohesive and the evidence he provides is a little shaky at times, but as a writer, Gladwell doesn't fail to entertain.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Having been in love with the VHS version of things for the last 8 or so years since I've had it and waiting eagerly for the DVD version for quite some time now, I put in an order for Pulse in Amazon UK right the day it was released and received it after an interminable wait of 4 days. Popped it in my laptop, and... <br /> <br />I guess I was a wee bit disappointed. If you're like me and were expecting a frame-by-frame copy of your battered and faithful VHS, then sorry to say you're not gonna get it. I wonder why anybody would want to re-edit things when things are already perfect? But they've gone and done it and it will take some time for me to get used to the new version. I guess I will still treasure the \\"normal\\" version of things and not throw away my precious VHS copy!! <br /> <br />The DVD video quality is \\"clearly fuzzy\\" on my laptop where I watched it and understand Gilmour when he muses that it should've been shot on film. I guess it wouldn't be noticeable on a TV screen. <br /> <br />I haven't watched the whole DVD yet, so I cant comment on the extras or 5.1 sound or anything else and I cant commit the sacrilege of rating the show anything less than 5 stars for the re-edits!

0062502182|5.0|I purchased this book by sheer coincidence. It had caught my eye several times at the book store, and I am ashamed to admit I primarily enjoyed the picture on the cover. Much to my surprise, however, I was caught up in the story by the end of the first chapter. Immediately, I identified with the main character's plight and found his search for hidden treasure much like my own search for a deeper meaning in life.<br /><br />In the novel, a young shepherd named Santiago trades his sheep for an adventure- searching for his \\"personal legend\\". As the story develops, the adventure becomes a search for his inner self. Santiago learns the wisdom of Alchemy, the power of love, and the strength of his will. By constantly sacrificing everything he owns and daring to live a life of chance, Santiago grows closer to his personal legend. He listens to the wisdom of a beggar king, a young scientist/alchemist want-to-be, a beautiful gypsy girl, and a master alchemist. His journey through the deserts of Egypt gives him insights on the significance of every living creature and element. As a previous reviewer stated, \\"life is in the journey, not the destination\\"; this is the major thrust of the novel, which ironically makes itself known at the conclusion of Santiago's search.<br /><br />Paulo Coelho's simple writing makes the 176 page novel seem like a walk in the park, but every single word has a hidden message. And if you often find yourself highlighting worthwhile sentences for latter use, I recommend you buy two highlighters- this novel is PACKED! Every aspect of the journey is told in vivid detail and symbolism.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading The Alchemist before a major transition in your life- it could be at any age. This novel is an optimistic island in a sea of pessimism... and to miss it is to ignore a strand of hope. I, personally, have changed the way I view life and accept change after reading this novel. I now, like Santiago, pay attention to the little omens life presents to me and value every moment, person, and creature in existence.<br /><br />I hope this book provides you with the same epiphany it has given to many readerss life presents to me and value every moment, person, and creature in existence.  <br /> <br />I hope this book provides you with the same epiphany it has given to many readers
1594200823|5.0|This work of Michael Pollan's is provocative and beautifully written - one of the best works of non-fiction that I have read.  He takes some very dry material and not only presents it cleverly but makes it very easy to read.  It flows and he makes you laugh.  This is a book that should be read by anyone who eats, and you don't have to be a scientist, nutritionist or politician to understand it.  Pollan turns out to be a very likeable \\"character\\" in the book, introduces us to some very interesting people, cites a wide variety of thinkers, authors and sources, and gives us hope for the future of our health and our planet.  A must-read!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I thought Underworld was the best vampire movie ever made. They picked the perfect cast for this film, especially Kate Beckinsale, she is perfect in these types of films. The action was top notch with a few good special effects. The storyline was confusing the first 10 times you watch, but after you watch it about 20 times, the story makes perfect sense and after I got what it was all about, I thought the storyline was great. I'm also glad it wasn't just about vampires going around sucking everyone's blood, instead, it was mainly focused on the story and history of what happened a long time ago. I was very impressed with this film and I loved it. <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|I have been in love with this \\"album\\" since I was 9 years old.  I've listened to it backwards, forwards, slow and most importantly very loud!  I've had it on an LP, cassette, and CD.  I recently re-purchased it because my 19-year-old daughter was in a car crash, and Abbey Road was what she and her friends were listening to.  Fortunately my daughter was okay, but the CD was ruined.  I have made several copies of the new CD, and no one is allowed to take the orignal out of the house.  Abbey Road is the last Beatles album recorded, even though it was the next to last released.  Abbey Road is the end of the Beatles, but it is amazing.  It deserves to be in everyone's collection, and listened to regularly.  When I find my self in times of trouble...oops that's another album, but Abbey Road has always been there for me.
B00005JOVH|3.0|X-Men 3 was one of the best films of this year. It had great action and CGI and alot of new characters were brought in and they were very cool. The only disappointments were that it definetly was not long enough. It was only 1 hour and 45 minutes long when, for a final film, it should have been 2 and a half hours. It was also to bad Bryan Singer didn't direct this one, I think leaving the last one for someone else, especially Brett Ratner, was a mistake. He is directing Superman Returns though, so at least he left the X-Men series to work on another comic film. The last problem with this one was that a few characters I was really looking forward to seeing was Beast and Angel. Beast got alot of screen time, but Angel barely had any. That was disappointing. But other than ALL of that, it was a good movie.
B0002O7XWC|5.0|It is an awesome movie and i loved that it was an anniversary edition, it had a sound track disk in it.
B00005JOE8|2.0|V For Vendetta is very thought provoking, has great action scenes, and everyone played their part well. The only problem with it, for me, was that I didn't feel all that entertained. The message that it sent really made you think and it had a great story, but for the entertainment part I felt it was lacking. But I have a feeling alot of people will like it.
B000002U9W|5.0|This review is directed towards anyone who has listened to Dark Side of The Moon, or Wish You Were Here, or even The Wall, and found some true beauty, albeit music which was surrounded by the music-industry hype/hit machine, and possibly somewhat contaminated by it.  <br /> <br />Did you ever wonder what Pink Floyd would sound like before the huge success of Dark Side of the Moon, at a time when, although Sid Barrett was gone, the band was creating beautiful music, the simplicity and sound that made them famous was there? Here it is in Atom Heart Mother.  <br /> <br />Words are always insufficient to describe an album, or to put names on the creative force behind the creation of the album. You have to hear it and judge for yourself.  <br /> <br />But it isn't much of a risk, because this is very nice to listen to, and refreshing, because it isn't laced with hits that many are burned-out on, but it has an innocence that may be lost in some of the later albums.  <br /> <br />It has all of the beauty, and none of the baggage.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Armageddon is one of my most favorite movies of all time and it is Michael Bay's best film ever. This movie makes me laugh and cry everytime I watch it. The effects are amazing still to this day. The cast did an amazing job with their characters. This film had a very good storyline to it as well. Not many people liked this film, but I absolutely love it to bits. <br />
0425163407|3.0|This was a slow start for me that became a page turner.  I can't say it was my favorite Scarpetta book - but likeable.  I really like how Cornwell has created Scarpetta to be a real person and she really shows emotion in this book - caring for one that I haven't seemed to find in others.  Caring for Wingo, the innocent mans mother ( don't want to give anything away), and after the virus breaks out - the state.  I also like how Cornwell has finally let Kay be at peace with Mark's death, and how she enveloped Benton into it. <br /> <br />All in all, good read
B00005JOYA|4.0|Silent Hill is now the best video game turned film yet. I haven't seen a film with such a great atmosphere and creepiness throughout a WHOLE movie since The Ring. The effects were so realistic it was unbelieveable. The story and effects deffinetly made up for the poor acting. I love Sean Bean though, he is a very good actor. I think Radha Mitchell(Rose) is a good actress, but she is not very good in the horror department. I didn't have very high hopes going to see this film, but I was surprised at how good it was. I highly recommend seeing this film.
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|If you're looking for an easy listening CD this one has your name on it.  After hearing \\"Winter\\" on a Scrubs episode I was blown away by the heart Joshua put into his song (I think it also had to do with a perfectly matched song for the episode it was in [Season 3 - My Screwup]).  All the songs play well but particular standouts are \\"Winter\\" and \\"Closer\\".  Take a listen to the samples or make your way to JoshuaRadin.com for more of a listen.
B00005JOWF|2.0|Ultraviolet is filled with stunning visuals and amazing action. But it doesn`t make up for the terrible script with an OK plot. Milla Jovovich is not a very good actress and the rest of the actors in the film weren`t very good either. I wouldn`t recommend this film at all. One of the worst movies so far for 2006.
B000009HF2|5.0|This is without a doubt, the GREATEST LIVE album EVER on the planet earth!!  A total classic even 30 years later. What a great summer '76 was!
B00005JOQS|4.0|Superman Returns is one of the best films of the year. The story, acting, and effects were great. Brandon Routh`s portrayal of Superman was superb, especially for this being his film debut. This was definetly Kate Bosworth`s best film and Kevin Spacey was excellent as Lex Luther. There really wasn`t anything wrong with the movie at all. But for future Superman films, I would love to see some villians with some kind of superpowers for Superman to take on. I`m really glad Bryan Singer did this movie. He did a really good job directing this and the first two X-Men films. This film was heart-stopping, funny, and fantastic.
B000FGGE68|2.0|Ultraviolet starts out decent, but with chase scene after chase scene it grows old quickly.  I like the idea behind the story, but I didn't feel like it was utilized in ways that it could have been.  I guess I will keep this short and simple.  The movie had some pretty good fight sequences, Jovovich plays the part of a \\"death dealer with a heart\\" well, and the futuristic look of the film keeps you interested to a point, but the rest of the movie just seems cumbersome and drawn out.  It reminds of Underworld meets Resident Evil in a way.  Ultraviolet is ok for one viewing, so I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is into sci-fi and action to check out or if you are a fan of Milla Jovovich.  So, with the exception of Milla and the couple action sequences I feel that this movie is disappointing and falls flat.  That's just one man's opinion, so judge for yourself.
B000BTJDG2|3.0|The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a powerful and captivating film. It grabs your attention from the moment it starts, `till the minute it ends. Jennifer Carpenter gives a powerhouse performance, other than her previous work such as White Chicks. This film is based on a true story, which makes it even more scary just thinking about how this can happen to anyone. This is a very intense and emotional film. <br />
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I've listened to Muse's new album, Black Holes and Revelations, their 4th studio effort, several times (so have the neighbors).  I still find myself at a loss to describe it.  Over the previous three albums, Muse has established themselves as a band that fits comfortable in the niche of straight ahead modern Brit rock, similar to bands like Blur and Oasis, though with a slightly more electronic feel and better musicianship.  Matthew Bellamy's voice, upon first listen, immediately evoked Thom Yorke, and though they are nowhere near as esoteric as Radiohead, the comparisons were inevitable. <br /> <br />Black Holes is different, but the same.  If there is such a thing as galactic space rock, Muse has achieved their apotheosis in the genre.  It's tempting to think that this swirly maelstrom of symphonic genius is a radical departure, but the musical underpinnings for Black Holes were carefully laid in all of Muse's previous work, particularly in the operatic musings of Origin of Symmetry.  The opening track, \\"Take a Bow\\", builds layer upon layer of tension by raising pitch, volume, and intensity throughout the song until it achieves liftoff with Bellamy screaming \\"you'll burn in hell for your sins\\" against a backdrop of tympanic drums and swirling static.  This is followed by \\"Starlight\\" a bouncy love song awash with pretty keyboard flourishes, fuzzy guitar, and electronic sprinkalia: the soundtrack to a space dance.  Many of the songs on the album are dance hall material.  This is definitely a rock album, but there's no way you can listen to it sitting still.  \\"Map of the Problematique\\" and \\"Assassin\\" feature a heavy drumline enough psychotic bass that even Dick Cheney would pogo to them.  That sound you hear is sweat hitting the floor.  And that's not all, \\"City of Delusion\\" features a soulful, Mexican sounding trumpet solo, and the strings and pounding piano of \\"Hoodoo\\" are bracketed by breathy flamenco guitar. <br /> <br />This album is also, by far, Muse's most political album.  \\"Take a Bow\\" is a scathing critique of the \\"Bush/Blair\\" fiasco, \\"Corrupt, you corrupt & bring corruption to all that you touch / Hold and you'll behold and beholden for all that you've done / Spell, cast a spell, cast a spell on the country you run.\\"  In \\"Soldier's Poem\\", Bellamy asks, \\"How could you send us so far away from home / when you know damn well that this is wrong?\\"  And in \\"Knights of Cydonia\\", \\"I'll show you a god who falls asleep on the job / how can we win when fools can be king?\\" <br /> <br />For some reason, listening to the falsetto swoops of the first single, \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\", something jarred loose in my mind.  I could no longer hear Thom Yorke lurking behind Bellamy's voice.  Instead, and throughout the whole album, I now hear the voice of Freddy Mercury.  The melodrama, symphonic theatrics, and dance oriented rock of this album all echo Queen and Bellamy's education in classical piano makes the comparison to Mercury obvious.  And that comparison feels right.  The arena sound that Queen cultivated fits well with what Muse is doing here, and has been leading up to for the last 7 years. <br /> <br />With Black Holes, Muse hasn't released the best album of their career, just the best one so far.  The huge talent and epochal potential of these musicians is on display here.  Don't miss it.  In \\"Hoodoo\\", Bellamy whispers \\"I had recurring nightmares that I was loved for who I am / and missed the opportunity to be a better man.\\"  I won't tell him if you won't.  The next stop for Muse is beyond the edge of the galaxy.
B000E97Y6A|5.0|King Kong is the best film of 2005. Peter Jackson has re-invented Kong in a way in which we will never forget. The effects were astounding, breathtaking, and the best I have seen in a film since The Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson has taken us through an emotional and heartbreaking story of the true beauty and the beast. You will laugh, you will cry, and it will have an everlasting effect on you. The actors did an amazing job and Naomi Watts is at her best. Peter Jackson is the best filmmaker of our time and has created a glorious masterpiece.
1878424165|5.0|I had listened to the cassette a few years ago when it was edited. I had liked it all right. Then, finding it in my car's glove compartment recently, I listened to it again. One of my friends was going through a painful separation, and it dawned on me how wise this little guide was, I gave it to my friend, and bought it again for myself. I can only heartily recommend it...
B00005JOTV|3.0|Just My Luck may not be Lindsay Lohan's best film to date, but it was still really cute. I think teenage girls would like it more than adults or guys. If you want to see this film, I would recommend seeing it on DVD or if you just want a girls night out, then I'd recommend seeing it in the theater. I'd have to say that it was certainly better than Herbie: Fully Loaded, that was not a good movie. It looks like after this film she will be turning towards more mature roles in A Prairie Home Companion and Chapter 21. I can't wait to see the more \\"mature\\" side of Lohan.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|This is one of those titles that DVD fans have hungered for since the technology's first introduction.  Why?  Probably because many of us saw the film originally in the 1966 roadshow release in Cinerama and have vivid memories of that mind-bending experience.  Plus, GRAND PRIX is hands down the best car-race film ever to come from Hollywood.  The soap opera elements of the story are pure 1960s movie melodrama, but they work because they are bracketed by the most breathtaking, visceral race footage ever seen.  On an 80' curved Cinerama screen, the races were staggeringly real, and GRAND PRIX exemplifies one of the best uses of the 70mm Super Cinerama technology in the 1960s, along with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  The fact that very little process photogrpahy was used at all makes the film even more realistic, especially in some of those dizzying shots where the camera turns from the driver toward the road ahead and you're placed in the front seat of a rocket banking the turns at Monza.  Spec-tac-u-lar!  Superb restoration from 65mm negative elements and great re-mix of the six-track mag stereo into digital 5.1.  Terrific film, and thank you Warner Home Video, for taking the usual care to include the overture and intermission tracks that were part of the roadshow experience.  Excellent supplementary extras complete the package.  Well worth the wait for this DVD.
B000F6IOBQ|4.0|Underworld Evolution is packed with awesome visuals, action, and a great story. I liked the first one better though. I just loved the storyline and getting to know the characters. The Underworld series is the best vampire films ever made in my opinion. Tony Curran was excellent as Marcus, I was extremely impressed by his prescence on-screen. If you really liked Underworld, you'll like Underworld Evolution. I can`t wait for the third one... <br />
B0006PV5US|5.0|RCA is leading the way in releasing hybrid SACDs at mid-price, after a decade when we were asked to pay a hefty premium for the new technology. They have selected choice itmes from the Living Stereo catalog, and as a result RCA's reisues are at the forefront of the industry. Munch's famous collection of Ravel and Debussy from the Fifties has always been an audiophile favorite, but its SACD incarnation, even if you listen through two-channel stereo instead of surround sound, is impeccable for spaciousness and detail<br /><br />Munch's interpretations are self-recommending. Boulez and Karajan surpass these readings in finesse and precision, but Munch brought excitment to French music without undue sophistication and fussiness. The wind solos in Bolero, for example, aren't self-conscoiusly nuanced; they are played for direct, sometimes brash impact and the thrill of Ravel's orchestral magic. The same holds true for everything else here.

B000001F5A|4.0|THIS ALBUM KICKS MAJOR BUTT IN THE PURE MOODS DEPARTMENT AND THE OPENING TRACK IS THE BEST ON THE ALBUM, I HAD THE VANGELIS ALBUM TITILED \\"PORTRAITS\\" AND THE VERSION OF ANTARCTICA THERE WAS ONLY 4 MINUTES LONG, I DIDNT KNOW THAT THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF ANTARCTICA WAS 7 MINUTES OF PURE HEAVEN,THE 4 MINUTE VERSION ON PORTRAITS ONLY PLAYS THE FIRST DECENT HALF, THE OTHER 3 MINUTES OF THE SONG NEAR THE END ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST PERIOD !!! IM SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM TO KNOW THAT ANTARCTICA WAS EVEN BETTER THAN I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT :)
B000EOTAM6|5.0|I really liked the \\"future\\" filmed in Aeon Flux. I loved the costumes, effects, stunts etc.<br /><br />A must for any sci-fi and/or action fan.

0671027344|2.0|I first read this book when I was 13 and LOVED it. If I had written this review back then, it would have gotten 5 stars. But now it's years later, and I've grown up a bit. I re-read this book and found it almost unreadable, and at certain parts, well, just plain pathetic. Charlies personality is at times blatantly annoying and not at all believable. It seems like he spends the whole book literally crying over nothing, which might be okay, but it's not written in a way that inspires sympathy or empathy in a reader over the age of 14, it's written in a way that kind of makes you just want to slap him in the face a few times. There's also a slight underlying arrogance and self-importance to a lot of the book. As if the author was desperate to seem and be profound or ironic. When I was younger and read this book I felt like I could easily relate to Charlie and was basically deluted to all the inexcusable flaws this book is filled with. Like the fact that there are certain things that could easily just be said, but are annoyingly tiptoed around to the point where you forget what the hell he's even talking about. Like the fact that he was molested by his Aunt Helen. I remember I had to read the book 3 times before I even found the sentence that SORT OF implied this. And I've talked to other people who have read this and they had no clue that that's what happend. But yet they claim that this is such a great book!? I think the author had good intentions with Charlie, but he just really went overboard with a lot of things. But like I said, pre-teens and young teens in general will eat this right up and think it's the greatest book in the history of time. The more mature reader will probably analyse it too much and be unable to enjoy it because of how truly ridiculous the majority of this book is.

0316743003|4.0|Skunk Works is a splendid demonstration of the power of ingenuity and power of a group of dedicated professionals unfettered by bureaucrats. He details the development of the F-117, the U-2, and the magnificent SR-71 and how his organization and his larger than life boss, Clarence \\"Kelly\\" Johnson, built extraordinarily capable planes---sometimes in spite of the politicians and the Pentagon. Mr. Rich details \\"Kelly's Rules\\" for the Skunk Works and toward the end of the book (written in the early 90's) offers some reflections on potential solutions to our crumbling military industrial complex infrastructure (crumbling in the sense that  we're loosing good people faster than they can be replaced). In particular, Mr. Rich takes issue with the cumbersome rules and regulations imposed on contractors that drive the overhead costs of most projects through the roof, and the wrong-headed (and seemingly) perpetual \\"annual\\" defense budget vice multi-year budgets. More than once, a contractor has been left in the cold when a new administration/new general/admiral comes in and cancels a program over another favorite---annual budgeting puts significant risk on the contractor (and the contractors shareholders)----and risk almost always translates to higher costs. <br />This is very good book, and I gave it four stars only because the author seemed to skip about and included some \\"Other Viewpoint\\" pieces (from various generals, pilots, politicians) that didn't add value to book. <br />That said, this book demonstrates how the US Gov't should buy large-ticket items. Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed.
B00000099Y|5.0|The combination of the brilliance of Maynard's lyrics and the instrumentals of the exceptional band memebers is nothing short of EPIC.  All the elements of this record melt together so perfectly, it's almost as if it was meant to be.  From the eerie calmness to the rage generated in the vocals, to the perfectly placed pounding of the drums, the intense riffage and bass will completely devour your ever-wanted attention and tear into your soul and will not let up until that 78 minutes of well speant life is over.....and just when you thought you were content, TOOL provides more comprehend.
B0002W18MU|4.0|Okay, firstly I'm not going to give it 5 stars.  I'm not going to lower it to the level of a \\"Formulaic production\\" either.  Yes, some of the criticisms of the album are valid.  There are some weak spots.  There's nothing quite to the level of Hurt (from The Man Comes Around).  But I dare you to listen to \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" without getting a lump in your throat.<br /><br />I think it's a fitting ending.  He sounds as if he knows that the end is near, and he is reluctantly accepting that.  I know that I am better for having heard the entire American Recordings series, and I thank Mr. Rubin releasing this epilogue.
1400032717|5.0|After a friend lending me this book, I purchased two as gifts.  The book is written from the perspective of an autistic boy, and it gives one a different view of the world.  Many times it seemed that he had the situation \\"right\\", and we are looking at things the wrong way.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B000001E3V|5.0|This is a great, great live album.  The Dominos, Eric Clapton, all-world guitarist, Jim Gordon, all-world drummer, Carl Radle, tremendously talented and experienced bassist, and Bobby Whitlock, singer and keyboardist with another world of experience, rocked the Fillmore for two days and four shows, and got captured on tape.  Thank goodness.    The band lacks Duane Allman from the Layla sessions, a guitarist to equal Clapton, so the stunning and unique guitar interplay featured on that album is, sadly, missing.  As far as we know, Duane appeared onstage with the Dominos twice.  One appearance was not effective, drugs usually given as the reason.  Another appearance was recorded by at least two sources in the audience, and is available as a bootleg entitled \\"Twin Flames Soul Mates\\".  The recordings are very muddy, still listenable, but it is very plain, again, that the two brought out the best in each other.  They go at it with a vengeance, offering amazing virtuosity and musicianship for the evening.  That, however, is a different band than the one on this CD.    The Dominos sans Allman is more of a smooth and polished unit, not as fiery or emotional, offering songs that get into grooves, the rhythm section backing Clapton in an amazingly smooth and seamless manner, whilst Eric wails.  And I mean wails.  Some fantastic soloing pours out of his guitar, blistering the audience for long minutes at a time.  Jim Gordon adds a frantic drum solo that never slows to allow us to appreciate the cool rhythms, it just goes faster and faster.      Professional, poised, and having fun.  The band plays songs that date to their time as Eric's band on his first solo album, with Delaney and Bonnie, and backing George Harrison on \\"All Things Must Pass\\".  They had actually been together for awhile, and sound like it.  The only non-Dominos songs on this album are \\"Presence of the Lord\\", a Blind Faith tune, and \\"Crossroads\\", which is an Eric Clapton concert staple dating from Cream's \\"Wheels of Fire\\" live side.  \\"Bottle of Red Wine\\" and several others are from Clapton's first studio album, \\"Eric Clapton\\", and Whitlock, Radle and Gordon were playing with him then.     There are several bootleg copies of this concert available, most with superb sound, some offering the complete concerts from all 4 shows on these two dates, but where one would go to find that in Arkansas, well, I don't know. I bought this instead, and have a record of the Dominos in concert, and it is worth it.  A great band, great evenings, great setting, and great, great playing.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|My Dad picked this up and brought it home for the family to watch. He's in his late 70's but has been a Floyd fan for years. Overall, I really enjoyed this DVD. The light show and Video show are amazing. Gilmour is fantastic. I think his vocals and guitar on this sound better than on the studio versions. \\"Shine on...\\" almost brought tears to my eyes. The only critique I would offer is that towards the end of disk ONE, it all started sounding the same to me; tempos do not vary much and it all seems to drag on a bit too long... We skipped the end of this disk and put on disk two. Disk TWO is my favourite perhaps because I am more familiar with this material. I've never seen Floyd in concert but I imagine this is as about as good as it gets with out actually being there. I would recommend this to anyone who is or has been a Pink Floyd fan. Well worth the price of admission.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Awesome concert. The genius behind doing the complete DSOTM album as sort of an encore still blows me away.    David Gilmour had a hand in the audio mix and a fine job he did. The 6-channel sound really shines on a good full range 5.1 system.    The down side (come on there's always something) is the videography.  While a Floyd concert has lots to show the mixer did not edit it for musicians for sure. He rarely stays on one scene for any length of time. Like 5 to 15 seconds, especially on disc 2.   I'm refering to like when Daivd is burning his solo on \\"Comfortably Numb\\" we see a total of maybe 15 seconds of his fingerwork. Instead we get crowd shots, the back of the drummer's head, anything but David.  I think of David as on of my top three favorite guitar players and rarely get to see him play on this DVD.  I guess if you're not a guitar player or one that likes to watch the members actually play their respected solos, just go ahead and click \\"not helpful\\" and release your anger that someome found a minor fault to his own liking. Musicians will know what I mean.  But this seems to be the case with most every concert DVD or VHS I own. Maybe one day this will change and a video producer will actually like the music as much as his own interpretation of his \\"artistic\\" view of the way it should be.    Overall others have expressed my opinions tastefully and it is truly an amazing concert from one of the few legends of music.  I truly believe whether you are a fan of Floyd or not you will enjoy this masterpiece.     Enjoy the experience.    Now, can David please get to work on releasing \\"The Delicate Sound Of Thunder\\" on a 5.1 DVD! I have the Laser Disc but would love a 5.1 DVD. I think the band had fun doing Delicate Sound and the women did a much better job on \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\" on Delicate. Just a though for his next project.    RIP Sid.

B0000524CY|5.0|when i first saw The Exorcist, i was scared beyond belief. i was so terrified i slept with my parents cause everytime i closed my eyes i would see the horrible things from the movie. in fact i almost have to force myself to watch it becuase its so scary. so what is it that makes The Exorcist so scary? its because of the images it shows you that disturbs you so deeply. even today, The Exorcist has been called the scariest movie ever made and one of the greatest american films ever and it lives up to that excpectation. when it was realesed in theaters back in 73, it caused mass histaria. people fainted, screamed, ran out of the theater, and some even suffered heart attacks with paramedics being rushed to the theater making it one of the most controversial films ever. the film tells of an actress who calls upon two priest to save her daughter who is possessed by the devil. every performance in this film is flawless but the true star is Linda Blair as the possessed girl, she brought so much force to a demanding role and she did it so well she has made Regan McNeal one of the biggest baddies in history. i also think she would have won the oscar had she not been competing against Tatum O'Neal and that whole controversy over the actress who did the demon voice. Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller also give some great performances to boast this film that if it wasent up against The Sting it definantly would have won the oscar for best picture. The Exorcist is one of my all time favorite films and i have recomended it to everyone who hasent seen it. so if you want to be scared out of your pants, see the film that is The Exorcist.

B0008ISM40|4.0|On my usual trip to Borders, I usually pick up a few comics (usually in subsequent volumes) and a CD (depending on how much I can afford).  Well, my decision was either between Metallica's \\"Ride the Lightning\\" or Nine Inch Nails' \\"With Teeth\\"; it was almost time to leave the store and I was deciding over the two albums until I'd come to a conclusion where I'd buy \\"With Teeth, so I purchased it (the UK version, for some odd reason, they didn't carry the US version, lucky for me, this version didn't have an \\"EXPLICIT CONTENT\\" sticker, so I wouldn't get slapped on the wrist for buying it)  I sat down at home popped the CD into the CD player and sat playing my PS2, really not noticing anything.  Two days later, in fact, I had to leave on a family trip by car (Northeast Ohio to Ocean City takes 10 hrs minimum), so I took only two CDs (this is when my music taste was quite \\"premature\\", so I didn't have what you would consider a CD collection--the albums were With Teeth and typically, American Idiot, an album that EVERY AMERICAN 12 YEAR OLD OWNS) and sat in the car for 10 hours listening to ONLY With Teeth.  Why?  Being 12 years old, obviously I wasn't able to take in the tracks beside \\"Hand that Feeds\\"--taking all of that time listening, I came up with ONLY 5 tracks that I liked--\\"Hand that Feeds\\", \\"You Know What You Are\\", \\"The Collector\\", \\"Getting Smaller\\" and I'd occasionally listen to \\"Home\\" (which was a B-side to HtF exclusively on the UK version).  The rest of the tracks were what I considered \\"boring\\"--maybe I was too young to understand the rest, I was too busy watching MTV to even bother with picking up my CD player and listening to With Teeth again. <br /> <br />Now, fast-forward about 11 months, I've gone through the transition of going from Elementary School to Junior High, from going to a school where I had friends to a school where I knew nobody and was rejected, from being social to being isolated to being social, and the list goes on; I guess you could sayWith Teeth grew on me as I went through more and was able to relate with the music--the lyrics matter more to me now than they did when I was a 12 year old seeking quick and catchy songs.   <br /> <br />The first track, \\"All the Love in the World\\", isn't really a good song to kick off the album--it's slow and repetitive, though the instrumentals have a darkwave and a Closer-esque sound.  \\"You Know What You Are?\\" is a sharp contrast from the beginning track, where [....] is said nearly twenty times, the lyrics, meaningless and dull, but the beat is quick which makes up for the lyrical nonsense that sounds like Eminem doing a Slipknot cover.  \\"The Collector\\" is easily one of my favorite songs on the album, angsty yet perseverant, the bass pounds out as the drummer beats the march beat--the piano drizzles out the last notes as the storm ends.  \\"Hand that Feeds\\" is once again, a more bass-oriented song, so obviously, it's more \\"dancy\\" with the quick pace--though it doesn't compare to the other songs.  \\"Love is not enough\\" is a bit whiny, but as always, Trent tells it as it is even if it's ugly, much like this track.  \\"Everyday Is Exactly the Same\\" is the most accessible song on the album, U2-esque?  Wow, that's different for industrial-metal.  The lyrics describe boredom of boredom, you can love, hate, or keep it the same.  \\"With Teeth\\" seems to tell the story of a drug that you love (which apparently is a woman), but its 'teeth' kill you and change you--WITH-UH TEETH-UH, was laughable.  \\"Only\\" is a narcissistic theme song, suitable for today's teenage generation and population that simply repeats \\"THERE IS NO YOU THERE IS ONLY ME, THERE IS NO [....]ing YOU THERE IS ONLY ME\\", yet a catchy song.  \\"Getting Smaller\\" was formerly my favorite song on With Teeth, I used to want nu-metal on it and this was what I wanted, thumbing bass, Trent's merciless yells and lyrics, it all flows quickly through this speed tunnel.  \\"Line Begins To Blur\\" has a heavier industrial edge than the other songs, repent for sins, yet the sins lead to consequence; the background blares in your ears as Trent's screams of repent drown.  \\"Beside You In Time\\", a great and ambient song, and you don't know what you're being led into next, a heavy and angry song (like \\"You Know What You Are) or a more quiet and at rest song such as \\"Everyday Is Exactly the Same\\".  Eventually we get a more quiet rest to conclusion the album, \\"Right Where It Belongs\\", where the main character finds his place, hell or heaven, his place has been found, and the lyrics are brilliant--\\"What if everything around you isn't quite as it seems, What if all the world around you is an elaborate dream?\\" speculation of reality.  The finally track, and a GREAT finish is \\"Home\\", where everything seems to unite once when it is where it belongs--drums pound throughout the song, and Trent sings until it comes to an end.   <br /> <br />Key songs: <br />*The Collector <br />*Hand that Feeds <br />*Everyday Is Exactly the Same <br />*Only <br />*Getting Smaller <br />*Beside You In Time <br />*Right Where It Belongs <br />*Home  <br /> <br />TO PEOPLE WHO ARE/WERE NEW TO NIN, SUCH AS I: <br />After the first few listens, if you find that this album is not worth listening to, listen alittle more, then put it away for awhile.  Pick it up, and listen to it again, you might come to appreciate it more as time goes by.  Plus, I highly reccomend buying the imported version of With Teeth that has \\"Home\\" on it, you won't be disappointed and you don't know what you're missing. <br /> <br />TO NIN FANS FROM THE PRETTY HATE MACHINE OR DOWNWARD SPIRAL DAYS: <br />I'm sure you guys won't like this album, there aren't many songs that sound similar to the heavier and angrier earlier albums, and it sounds more like a rock album than an industrial metal album.
0679720200|4.0|Although not strictly an existentialist novel, \\"The Stranger\\" delves into the philosophies of life and meaning, concluding that there is no rhyme or reason or higher plan for human life.  Indeed, the chilling realization that life serves no higher purpose directly contradicts the most precious of human ideals - that one's life serves a higher purpose. <br /> <br />Camus tells the story of Meursault , a French colonial living in Algeria.  An otherwise unremarkable individual, Meursault  lives life for the moment, and does not dwell on the past for future.  His mother's death is a non-event, as he views it as an irksome distraction.  However, he is not cold-hearted or immoral, but he is merely an indifferent, apathetic man who sees no purpose to life.  Thus, if there is no purpose to life, then his mother's passing has no greater meaning than the daily routine of one's job.  It is just an event to partake of. <br /> <br />Throughout the novel, Meursault  espouses Camus's \\"absurdist\\" philosophy.  That is, that human existence is absurd in that there is no higher meaning or moral value to it.  It is this lack of morality and meaning that makes Meursault  alienated from the society he lives in.  Without any moral compass, Meursault  is gloriously indifferent to his fellow beings.  Friendship, marriage, and even murder have no higher meaning for Meursault .   <br /> <br />Although his murder of an Arab has no meaning for himself, his adversaries and friends attempt to assign meaning to his actions at his trial.  Meursault  loses when the Prosecutor attempts to assign a rational meaning to his actions, subject to the accepted rules of society.  Indeed, it would appear that Meursault  is a cold-blooded criminal, one who didn't even shed a tear for his departed mother.  Yet, if one were to understand Meursault , he is no cold-blooded killer, although that certainly doesn't justify his actions.  His final self-realization is that society loathes him and his actions.  Althoughhe cannot change society's views, he becomes comfortable in his own views and looks forward to the day that onlookers will applaud his execution.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is one of the best transfers of a film to DVD that I've ever seen.  I was astounded at how clear and vivid the images were on a 65\\" screen.  The transfer was obviously done with great care, much to the joy of this film and race fan. <br /> <br />I don't have much to add to what has already been said about the film itself.

B00005JP42|5.0|If someone were to storm into my office, throw down a heavy leather bag filled with millions of dollars, and demand a movie out of me, I'd probably make something along the lines of Brick.<br /><br /> A film not only masterful for its stylistic directing, but for a production that rivals anything to have come out in quite some time. Brick is sure to please the smaller group of moviegoers, meaning those that can accept the film for what it is: different.<br /><br /> This is a film with an imperfect blend. There is the cultist's favorite noir, the gritty suburban life of today, and the impasse teen flick that for some reason is stunningly original on a level not seen before.<br /><br /> The story, while complex in form, is at the core a simple mystery. Brendan Frye (Levitt) is a loner at a high school mixed with problems from the inner street. After happening upon a message from his ex-girlfriend, Frye follows the murky leads to help her out. Unfortunately, what Frye stumbles upon is a loose string of problems that seemingly bring him nonlinearly from one point to another. With each discovery is another step away from the truth and one more reminder that this may be a bad idea.<br /><br /> Having overstayed his welcome in teenage filler, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (3rd Rock From The Sun, Ten Things I Hate About You) graduates with flying colors and accentuates into what might be regarded as the modern day Serpico. Levitt not only steals the film, but nails the character right smack into the skull. He takes the source material and goes the extra mile creating one of the better anti-heroes this century has seen thus far.<br /><br /> Everything works here. From bar none the most eccentric dialogue since 1971's A Clockwork Orange to a chilling and fitting soundtrack by composer Nathan Johnson, who takes hints from the late Bernard Herrmann. There is a mood to this film that is neither claustrophobic nor horrifying yet glides dangerously around those lines at all times.<br /><br /> Inarguably one of the most exciting and refreshing pictures since 2004's experimental Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Director Rian Johnson much like Michael Gondry paints a modern classic that is sure to have people spinning in and out of their seats. This is a story that follows you home with characters that might be your friends.<br /><br /> It is a relief to have a breath of fresh air in an industry so heavily polluted with either the same thing or something less spectacular. If the year's previous films are a testament to the building blocks of American cinema, Brick is a pillar to modern film making and one not to be missed.times.  <br /> <br /> Inarguably one of the most exciting and refreshing pictures since 2004's experimental Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

B00006D295|5.0|Rocky Horror has been one of my favorite movies since my roommate in college and I went to see it on campus one night. It's a great movie, but definately not if you just perfer mainstream movies. The music is incredible, the dances are fun, and it's just an all around good movie.

B000002UEB|5.0|I rediscovered this email after a few years and bought it again... without hesitation.. for my music collection. So much of the metal and/or other genres this album and Queensryche gets sadly pigeonholed into sounds so dated and weak, but Queensryche are so much more than \\"metal\\" or \\"hard rock\\" or categories at least for Operation Mindcrime. The music is merely a vehicle for a story, and what a story!<br /><br />The story of disillusionment with the government transcends, though written under the oppression, government lies and corruption, that was the Reagan years, this album's themes are equally at home under the current Bush regime where the leaders lie, and innocents die, and anyone with half a brain feels numb and helpless.<br /><br />This album shines on all levels, the musicians are all at the tops of their games, nary a note is wasted, and as others have comments Geoff Tate's voice is a wonder, right behind Freddy Mercury in range and power, ability to carry and convey every single song, note, mood, and emotion with conviction. Both he and this album are so sadly underrated it's quite heartening to see all the five star reviews here of so many that get and appreciate this album's utter brilliance.<br /><br />For those who don't believe in timeless metal? Buy this album. Those who like hard hard rock? Buy this album. Those who even like heavy rock theatre, again, buy this album. It's appeal is tremendous, it's music sheer power, and it's scope transcending so many music genres genius.
B000002TQV|5.0|The first Radiohead album I listened to was OK Computer, one of the most brilliant records I've ever heard and the best from the Radiohead album catalogue. By now, I know that Radiohead is not a rock band that will live up to its expectations from nobody, not even their most loyal fans. Their latest material is experimental, relying more on electronic beats and crackly, glitchy sounds than on sweeping guitars. And that's okay. The Bends, just like OK Computer, is their most accessible and enjoyable albums. The music moves me, the lyrics are simple and yet so deep. There's not a single song that I do not like. I recommend this album, OK Computer, and Hail to the Thief for essential Radiohead listeners.
1401206905|5.0|This is the story that i wanted to see in the 'batman begins' movie.  It was written at a time that Frank Miller was literally on a roll.  He had just written \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" and soon after would write \\"Give Me Liberty\\" and \\"Sin City\\".  This is quite posibly the best origin story of Batman available, and makes a fantastic entry point to the other graphic novels.  (Great ones include The Killing Joke and Arkham Asylum)
B00005JMAH|2.0|The first time I went to see this in theatres, I was anxiously awaiting another wonderful interpretation of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, possibly even more excited for this one than the others because this book has always been one of my favorites. However, I was severely disappointed.        It's almost as if the people involved in this movie hadn't ever read the book and had only been given a brief synopsis before making the film. Many plot points were either spun off in a different direction or eliminated completely and I felt cheated. I do understand that including the whole book would probably have made for a movie of unendurable (for most people) length, but so much didn't have to be sacrificed.        For one thing, the characters of the trio were skewered violently. Harry himself becomes too emotional at certain points (he doesn't run off and cry in the book), and Hermione is portrayed quite differently than she is in the books. Just to clarify, I love her character in the books, but in the movie they make her extremely annoying and arrogant (\\"Ronald!\\"), not to mention giving her Ron's lines. And Ron himself? In this movie, Ron was made to be more of a joke than anything--he doesn't have any of his shining moments from the book (particularly at the end, where Hermione says \\"You'll have to kill us too!\\" instead of Ron, who just sits there on the bed like a coward...in the book, he forces himself to stand up on a broken leg and says it)...not to mention Dumbledore. In this movie and the following one, Michael Gambon plays the role of Hogwarts' brilliant, eccentric headmaster rather poorly. True, it would be difficult for anyone to follow the late, great Richard Harris' portrayal of Dumbledore in the first two films, but he makes the Headmaster seem out of whack and rather ignorant.        Another thing that was disturbing was the atmosphere of Hogwarts. Before, it looked warm and inviting, as though you'd want to go there. In this movie, however, it was dark,  frightening, and falling into disrepair. Another disappointment was that a lot of the uniqueness of the wizarding world is lost in that the students so often wear Muggle clothing.         Also, for me one of the most poignant moments of the book was Gryffindor finally winning the Quidditch cup after trying so hard for two years. I particularly loved the image of such normally dignified and upright characters such as Professor McGonagall and Percy Weasley sobbing and jumping for joy. There was only one little bit of the sport in the movie: the first match where Harry falls off and in the movie, he never gets the chance to redeem himself. And of course, the scene inside the Shrieking Shack was stunted considerably--the movie never mentions the Marauders' true identities.        All in all, the time spent on the Knight Bus with that ridiculous shrunken head, the Whomping Willow (which didn't resemble a willow tree) or with the Fat Lady (portrayed by Dawn French, whose other work I love, but who's not necessary in this movie) being forced to be what I'm sure they thought was funny could have been used much more wisely in keeping true to the book.

B00000889Y|5.0|This CD has all the early singles, many crazy covers and is very good sound quality. Includes booklet with early pictures and album covers. I like it!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|The first time that I heard supermassive black holes I was extremely skeptical of the new album, but after hearing it I'm reminded why i should have never doubted muse.  I'm a huge Muse fan, and in my mind Absolution is the best album ever made with Oos not far behind.  After purchasing the cd ive found that its right on par with Oos and Absolution.  Heres the track by track breakdown...    1.Take a Bow 8/10  Its a good opener with a synth style piano with builds into a bombastic finish.  Typical Muse...    2.Starlight 10/10  This is an amazing song with a great chorus.  This is the obvious choice for their single.    3.Supermassive Black Holes 6/10  Definitely my least favorite song on the album.  Don't judge the album by this song because it is the only song of its style on the record.  It kind of sounds like a electronic type prince song.    4.Map of the Problematique 10/10  Great song with a driving piano melody and pounding drums.  This is my favorite song on the album.    5.Soldiers Poem 7/10  This song is the second weakest behind supermassive.  It is sort of an interlude which makes a nice transition to a slower song in invicible.    6.Invicible 10/10  This song has a very catchy guitar riff and wonderful lyrics.  The military sounding drums also add a nice touch.    7.Assasins 8/10  Definitely the hardest song on the album.  This song is the Stockholm Syndrome of Absolution.    8.Exo-Politics 8/10  This song is a very politically driven song(hints the name), and it is actually a remake of burning bandits which was just a b-side from the showbiz/oos era.    9.City of Delusion 10/10  This song has a spanish feel to it which they pull off really well.  Horns are also blended into this song very well.  Probably the most unique song on this album, which really demonstrates what talented musicians muse are.    10.Hoodoo 9/10  This song also has a spaghetti western feel to it.  I didnt like this song the first time I heard it, but it has really grown on me.  Mattdoes and amazing job on the piano in this one.    11.Knights of Cydonia 10/10  KoC is the perfect ending for this album.  It summarizes everything this album is about much like Ruled by Secrecy did in Absolution.      All in all this album is a great one that shows how Muse have evolved as musicians.  They never cease to amaze me and this is just another masterpiece to add to their collection.
B000FBGBPC|3.0|The first album had so many memorable powerful songs while this one as another reviewer put it, has a lot more \\"rock-by-the numbers\\" feel to it. There are no amazing efforts like \\"drown\\" \\"wake me up\\" or \\"home\\" Instead we get a lot of dulled efforts that have glimpses of brilliance but don't quite make it. It's kind of like if you were given basic samples from their last album and got to make a song out of those samples. The core sound is their but the emotion and melodies are kind of missing on this album. The slower tempoed songs don't seem to work nearly as well as they did on the last album which i would rate about a 4.5 out of 5.  <br /> <br />The problem is there are a lot of songs that seem half fufilled which led me to skipping most of them or having them not really be memorable.   <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Animal I have Become\\" One of the only songs that has the quality of thier first album. Pretty much the only song where the verses and choruses are both strong.  <br /> <br />\\"Never Too Late\\" Another great song. A nice slow melodic verse where the mellow vocals work. The chorus isn't outstanding but good enough.  <br /> <br />\\"Let it Die\\" This song is a pretty big departure from TDG's last album. It seems more made for the TRL crowd. A typical break-up song. It's not even that good but its one of the better ones which is sad.   <br /> <br />\\"Time of Dying\\" This is the song that comes closest to the ron-radio tracks from there first album in the vein of \\"Drown\\" <br /> <br />Overall a decent effort but I don't think I can justify buying this CD after borrowing it and listening to it. It is OK but again there isn't just that much that is memorable. It's too bad considering how good their first album was.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|This may sound like the review of a blathering idiot. But for some reason, when I watch the DVD, \\"Dido Live\\" it seems to really speak to me. Sounds crazy...right? I mean it's a concert video for goodness sake! A piece of entertainment! Yet, there are some nights, where I just can't sleep. In the dark of the early AM, it seems like the whole world is in bed..sound asleep. On those nights, I'll put this DVD on and it seems to lull me into a twilight trance, all to the magnificent sounds and confessions of singer/songwriter, Dido Armstrong. For anyone who's ever heard Dido's music, you know she is a singer, who gets personal. Dido has a pop/rock sound, augmented with laid back, electonica back-beats. This is all in support of her amazing voice. It's a voice that  seems to just go up and down your spine, causing those little hairs on the back of your neck to stand up. Dido's songs are about her life, love and emotional hurt. This is one performer, who is not afraid to open her life up to you and bares herself emotionally naked. (O.K., I'm definitely in blathering idiot mode!) In this concert DVD, she performs live in front of a couple thousand cheering fans at London's Brixton Academy. But even though she's in front of a large crowd, she seems to engage the viewer personally with her friendly, song introductions, her confessional, tell-all song lyrics and a lively musical performance, backed by an excellent group of musicians. Dido is just one of those performers, who really reaches down somewhere in herself and puts it all out there in her performance. The DVD includes many of her hits from the two CDs in her discography, including \\"White Flag\\", \\"Life For Rent\\", Don't Leave Home\\", \\"Sand in My Shoes\\" and \\"Thank You\\". The sound and picture on this DVD is wonderfully remastered. The DVD package also includes a shortened audio CD. But between the two, the DVD is the way to really experience this concert. I love this DVD and I'm sure I'll spend more sleepless nights experiencing it! Highly recommended!encing it! Highly recommended!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|It took Pink Floyd 10 years to put this out on DVD, but it was worth the wait.  I own the original VHS, and the video quality on this is excellent, nicely enhanced from the original video tapes.  The sound mixing is awsome coming through a 5.1 system  The packaging is very slick, with a promo post-card for David Gilmore's solo album \\"on an island\\" and then a very intricate map of the menus of the DVD.  Sure it is odd that they split up the concert onto 2 dvd's, but the continuity to the original 2 cd set is a neat concept, because they added bonus features to both discs to compliment them.  Overall, the original concert footage is 145 minutes, the total runtime is about 4 hours of footage and Concert. Too bad they chose to shoot this in a 4:3 aspect instead of widescreen film when they did it orignially.  Say Goodbye to Life as We know it is a neat feature, and the \\"Wish You Were Here\\" with Billy Corgan is also interesting.  There are also promo videos for \\"take it back\\" and \\"learning to fly\\" tucked away on the discs, and a \\"bootlegging the bootleggers\\" section.  Just a well done set of discs, and currently going at a great value from 12-16 dollars at different places.  Get it while the getting is good.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Enthralling and heartfelt, Superman Returns is possibly the first comic book superhero film where I actually cared about what happens to the characters. The film is full of razzle dazzle special effects and action sequences, to be sure, but it's rooted in old-fashioned morals and ideas that for a while didn't seem to be hip or relevant in today's film world. <br />    As much as I love the Batman and X-Men films, the heroes in those films tended to be angst-ridden and self-piteous.(The woe-is-me syndrome) It was a conceit that was wearing very thin, especially when carried over into other superhero films like Spiderman and the inexcusable Fantastic Four. The difference here is that while the Man Of Steel is all too aware of his being an outsider, he puts it aside to do a greater good. In other words, he gets over himself for the sake of what he loves and holds dear and has sworn to protect. Yes, he does feel put-upon at times, but his belief in the goodness of others overshadows any doubts he has about his place in the world. <br />     Now, on to the good stuff. The acting is first-rate. Brandon Routh, a virtual unknown, does the impossible and makes the character of Superman his own. The inevitable comparisons to Christopher Reeve aside, Routh makes you believe he IS Superman and his Clark Kent, while sadly underutilized, is warmly endearing. I was very impressed by him altogether. When I heard that Kate Bosworth was going to play Lois Lane, I was nervous. Not because of her acting abilities, but because of her extreme youth. On a normal day she could probably pass for a high-schooler. So I was very surprised by the depth and emotion she brought to the role, and was equally surprised that I completely bought it. She was terrific and had wonderful chemistry with Routh. James Marden is good if a bit bland, but Frank Langella as Perry White was amazing. It was also a treat to see the legendary Eva Marie Saint onscreen as Clark Kent's mother, although her sceen time was severly limited, a likely causalty of trimming the film down.   <br />     On the villain side, Kevin Spacey brought a fun balance of camp and menace to Lex Luthor, but was overshadowed ever so slightly by the scene-stealing Parker Posey, as Lex's moll. She had some of the film's best lines and brought much humor to the sometimes dark proceedings.  <br />     On that note, a word of warning to parents who might want to bring very young children to this. There a few scenes that might be too disturbing for kids, one during the early plane scene where passengers are literally being thrown around, and the other one towards the end where Superman is being beaten up by a bunch of Lex's thugs. It's not particularly violent, but it does come as a bit of a shock and there were many gasps from the audience when I went to see it. That's really the only complaint I can think of. I absolutely loved the film and highly recommend it, not just for the thrills but for the heart that was brought to a genre that too often forgets to include it.
6304415346|4.0|Those terrifying adversaries the Borg return to menace the crew of the Enterprise and the world in this exciting Star Trek film.  The Borg, led by a creepy queen (the same actress who played the White Witch in the 2005 Chronicles of Narnia), seek to assimilate the entire population of Earth by traveling back in time to stop the first launch of the warp drive.  Will, Deanna, and Geordi travel to Earth to assist the scientist in his launch.  But the scientist is a drunk, and very turned off by the adoration and idolization proferred by the folks from the future.  He runs away.  Meanwhile, the Borg Queen is hard at work trying to figure out how to assimilate Data (Brent Spiner).<br /><br />Great action from the moment the movie begins to the very end.  The only thing I didn't like were the new hairstyles of Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis).  Blehh!  They look very bland as Deanna has straight brunette hair and Crusher has a shorter blond style.
B00005YUPO|5.0|So far, this is the only Baby Einstein video/DVD we own. My son has absolutely LOVED it from the age of 6 weeks. The images change frequently enough to hold his attention and the music is wonderful. I have found myself enjoying this even though I thought I would tire of it quickly. <br /> <br />The two little girls are cute, but do take away from the overall video. It almost feels like someone just wanted a platform to show off their beautiful children! Which is slightly understandable, I love to show off my little one too, but their popping up interrupts the flow of the show. <br /> <br />I can't wait to get more Baby Einstein DVDs for my son!
1881273156|3.0|The book was enlightening to say the least.  It was easy to read and comprehend.  I do think this book would be more helpful to someone in an ailing relationship. You get a better understanding of our differences which allows for more tolerance.
0451191153|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the pace of this book. After reading \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" I expected a book that was a slow starter and that would be difficult (but worth it) to finish. But \\"The Fountainhead\\" became interesting in the first few pages, and stayed that way with few exceptions, throughout the book. <br /> <br />The thing I like most about Ayn Rand's books is that you can read them at several different levels, and correspondingly, get out what you put in.  If you want entertainment, it's there in \\"The Fountainhead.\\" It's a very good story.  If you want philosphy or intellectualism, you can read about the characters and think about or discuss the symbolism - good vs. evil, capitalism vs. socialism, individualism vs. collectivism, etc. Or you can read the book from a historical perspective, comparing Ms. Rand's philosophy with the prevaling views of the times and get a better sense on what the world was like back then. <br /> <br />At times it's still a difficult read. But when you finish the book, you feel as though you've accomplished something, learned something, and are proud of yourself.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|I think it's great that he is finally releasing the original theater versions of Episodes IV, V, VI.  I don't understand why people are complaining.  If I'm not mistaken it's the same price as a single dvd, so if you don't want the \\"new\\" versions, just toss them and keep the others!  Of course he's going to keep re-packaging and re-selling them, thats what they all do.  If you want it bad enough, you'll buy it!  I myself didn't mind the changes/updates he made, but I would still like to have the original releases.  I want it, so I'm buying it, no complaints.

1400079179|5.0|Dan Brown has cornered the market when it comes to creating spins on what society has regarded as the truth for eons. He takes facts and conspiracy theories and molds the two together to create a fascinating read that will leave the reader considering the possibilities for years to come. It is no wonder that this novel was made for film. Although I have not seen the movie yet, I can not see how it can possibly compare to the extensive details and explanations that this author conveys in his storyline. It simply must be read.<br /><br />Is it worth buying?<br /><br />Without a doubt. I am so glad I purchased this book and read it before seeing the film.

B00008438V|3.0|Well, this is another movie in the \\"losers win\\" genre of screenplays. Sometimes, these movies really are funny and nicely done (Nerds, In The Army Now, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and especially The Breakfast Club).  Other times, they try to be successful by hitting you between the eyes with a two by four.<br /><br />My head hurts.<br /><br />\\"This is too weird!\\" is what a teenager told me.  I agree.  This was my view, entirely.  Weird Science had a weak, weak, plot.  It seems as if the goal was to allow teenage boys the opportunity to consider... what?  Fantasy?  Pretty weak.  Heroism?  Pretty lame.  How to get a date?  Not on this planet.  The race dichotomy is very troubling.<br /><br />Now this movie did have its funny segments.  The exit comments of the bikers were pretty funny.  I just expected more, a LOT more.  Like Encino Man, Weird Science will not go done as a comedy classic.

B000002LQR|5.0|Ok, the Chili Peppers are currently rocking the charts with Dani California and Tell Me Baby, but think before that to a time when they first became famous. In my opinion, they're earlier years are better then than now. Such classics such as True Men Don't Kill Coyotes, Out in L.A., Hollywood, Fight Like a Brave, and the excellent cover of Stevie Wonder's Higher Ground. Plus, Hillel Slovack was an awesome guitar player, and some people won't agree with me, but he also had a better sound then John Frusciante. But, on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Frusciante has great sound of songs like The Power of Eqaulity, Suck My Kiss, and Under the Bridge. He also use a Wah Pedal for an intro in a few songs: Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Sir Psycho Sexy. With the Wah, he gets this really cool sound. Of course, Flea is always awesome with his \\"funky a** Flea bass\\" as Anthoney Kiedis says in If You Have to Ask. Speaking of Kiedis, his voice is in top form. I love his voice in Breaking the Girl and I Could Have Lied. But, as many people disagree with me, I think Give it Away is totally overrated. It is not as good a song as people think, and definatly not the best on the cd. A really cool song to listen to is They're Red Hot. That is a Robert Johnson cover and I think it is really good, but nothing could beat Johnson's version of it. Chad Smith's drum is incredible in this, with the perfect sound. Kind of what it sounds like on Stadium Arcadium, but that's only true because they were both recorded at the same place. If you wanna see the making of this album, buy Funky Monks, the DVD of this. If you like this, check out Mother's Milk or Californication.
1573223085|5.0|There is a wisdom in knowing when it is time to move and what you need to take with you! The Information Age will never ultimately leave us as technology is always on the move and will provide resources for us to develop; however, the Conceptual Age is a worthy partner and the \\"senses\\" necessary to effectively navigate through it are wonderfully laid out for us in this book with fantastic practices to develop what we need to be successful. Daniel Pink has done a masterful job in creating a recipe for the future age. Although he speaks to the coming age; perhaps his biggest gift is his insight for years beyond the coming age. He challenges us to develop as whole people. Using every part of who we are to do what we do is what is explored in this book and I give credit to Mr. Pink for his pioneering effort. Granted, all of his writing is not brand new insight for us; however, how he analyzes and gives perspective is masterful. I love the front half of the book where he lays out the land where we dwell while casting images of how we got here and what exactly is moving us forward to the new age - abundance, automation, and Asia. The back portion is so very practical and user friendly. I have tried a number of his ideas and found them very helpful. No doubt, the transition won't be easily accomplished without an openness to growth and a commitment to see things differently with a \\"Whole New Mind.\\" What we have here is a gift and an opportunity to travel into the future with a handy guide and a compass for direction. I can't put it down; even after I've completed it. Make sure you leave time to ponder. This is a book that will never grow old.
0375703861|4.0|In the past, I have shunned \\"popular books\\" because quite often they are just fluff, they lack substance.  White Teeth, however, is a popular book with substance.  It was published in June of 2001, three months before 9/11 and four years before the London subway bombings on 7/7/5.  It is quite possible that the main substance of the novel, the struggles of Muslim immigrants in London and their complex multi-generational assimilation into European society, is more pertinent today than even Zadie Smith could have ever imagined.  Or perhaps, this novel proves that at least one person, the author herself, could see the writing on the wall.  Immigrant assimilation, however, is not the sole focus of the book; it is simply the central one.  Friendship, ageing, struggle, and love also get their due, but it is in her exploration of the complex reality of immigrants and their children that Zadie Smith proves herself as writer.  It is in that plot line that she demonstrates that she is capable of developing a plot, creating compelling characters, and being funny.  And it is in that plot line that she proves that when she puts pen to paper she aims higher than simple entertainment.  However, the one weakness in this novel is that she tries to do too much.  Because of that, the novel sometimes looses trick of itself, it loses focus.  That is not to say that those parts of the book are not enjoyable to read, they are, they just cloud what I believe to be this novels primary message.  That criticism aside, White Teeth is a novel I recommend.  It is a popular novel with substance, substance worth the time it takes to read.    On a side note:  I finished this book on July 4th of all days and upon putting it down I wondered about two things.  Would my review of this book have been different if I had read it in its first month of release?  Would Zadie Smith have written it differently if she wrote it today?

B000BTC5LW|4.0|Lots of griping going on about the quality of this release...from a technical standpoint, this performance was shot on videotape during 1994.  Just prior to the advent of high-definition recording, the maximum horizontal resolution for professional videotape was four hundred lines.  Whereas if the show had been shot on film, and the master print carefully preserved, it might easily have yielded one thousand lines or more.  Regardless of digital technology, they can only work so many miracles with a limited source tape!  For what it's worth to avid Pink Floyd fans, we hardcore ELP fanatics had to wait over three decades for the legitimate release of Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \\"holy grail\\" California Jam footage  ( and only one third of the set survived the ABC-TV editing block ).  Further, we only have that recording because an ABC employee made a copy of the broadcast master prior to the network erasing the tapes...said copy being made on the then industry workhorse VCR, a U-matic videocassette.  Our former pristine footage has been reduced to somewhere between 260-280 line resolution  ( slightly better than VHS quality ).  Unless future technology is able to coax eight hundred line resolution out of a four hundred line source, the DVD release of \\"Pulse\\" will remain about as good as it can get.  Count your blessings, Floyd fans...at least you have all of the stellar show!
B000FVQYYK|4.0|With early Muse records being heavily compared to Radiohead because of the obvious influences Muse have ever since made conscious efforts to distance themselves from 'The Bends thru OK Computer'-era Radiohead.  After 'Showbiz' (with 'Origin of Symmetry') they showed their potential as a innovative and exceptionally talented act creating not just a couple modern rock masterpieces well beyond the Radiohead envelope.  With Absolution their sound became more rich and they experimented with many new elements, with string sections, some disco/electronica, and Rachmaninov indulgances.  The current album was somewhat differently conceived without the restraints of the previous ones as Muse had no tour booked, no studio schedule dictating the kind of songs to be performed.  Indeed, songs constructed that could easily be transposed to the live stage were a thing of the past.  In 'Black Holes and Revelations' Muse departs dramatically from its standard prog-rock-esque space opera-ish formula and uses many of the elements of the expanding envelope of sounds developed in Absolution and then jumps into new directions.  I'd like to say there is a single direction in this album but there isn't, the influences are diverse in style and highly politically charged in focus, a catapult into a Matrix meets Clint Eastwood style parallel universe from where it jumps from idea to idea.  Many of the songs are a far cry from the Muse of OOS, perhaps their most impressive effort before 'Black Holes...', and they develop sounds which are not the standards Muse fans have all heard and loved.  What they have done is basically homogenize some of their sound, mainstreaming many elements of it in catchy synth/electronic music, dance grooves,  middle eastern textures, and...oh yeah...spagetti western riffs and spanish horns and thereby creating some very impressive songs.   <br /> <br />After one listen I was taken aback with three songs, the  Absolution-esque/Apocalypse Now II 'Take a bow', the techno romp 'map of a problematique', and the current U.S. single 'Knights of Cydonia'.  'Supermassive Black Hole' wasn't to my Muse taste, and 'Starlight' was a bit too happy and had to many major chords to really fit into the Muse box in my mind.  It sounded more Keane and Coldplay than Muse.  'Invincible' was a march that developed into an anthem but the lyrics were too simplistic...'together we're invincible'...?--I could almost not bare.  This is an age old problem for Muse as they have always focused on the music rather than the lyrics.  'City of Delusion' was very interesting and Assassin and Exo-Politics were ok too.  But that was just my first listen...after a couple of listens I have to say Starlight is excellent and City of Delusion is absolutely amazing, the songs I thought mediocre at first felt a lot different after a few listens Exo politics and Assassin were quite catchy, even Hoodoo had something to offer in Muse melodramatics.   <br /> <br />I have to give this album 4.5 stars, because of the poor lyrics of some of their songs.  But overall, in my humble opinion, this ablum ranks heads and shoulders over much of contemporary music in the U.S. and is Muse's most impressive effort to date.
630460288X|5.0|Demolition Man takes a pointed poke at the dangers of an utterly passive, politically-correct future.  Great special effects and excellent cinematography.  The fight scenes between Stallone and Snipes are riveting -- kinda like Godzilla vs. King Kong but with more testosterone.  And Sandra Bullock provides some much-needed comic relief as a malaprop-spouting rebellious cop of the future.  When this was released, who would've thought that President Schwartzenegger was even a drug-induced possibility?!  Lots of laughs and cool fight scenes -- the perfect guy film.

GET THIS THRU YOUR HEAD..GREEN DAY IS NOT PUNK PEOPLE! Green Day is alternative rock or pop/punk....whatever the hell you want to call it. I dont know about the band being overrated, but they need to learn to play their instruments a little better. I mean it sounds alrite, but its way too easy to play. I could play American Idiot, Jesus Of Suburbia, Holiday and most of these songs on guitar in my sleep....and im not even a guitarist! i sing!....anyway thats what i gotta say....peace    P.S seeing how your a huge Green Day fan roxii (i can tell lol) u would know this. Green Day has admitted and said several times in interviews that they are not punk. so where the hell do u come up with the conclusion that they are?

0385720920|3.0|When reading Choke, don't be surprised, but the first chapter is a warning from the main character, telling you to prepare yourself for the graphic nature and content of this book. In a way, you can see it as the main character and the Author giving you pre-warning.<br /><br />Chuck Palinuk,  Author of Fight Club, really stresses his style on this one. It sort of has a flicker of the ole Tyler durden personality to it. But, mind you, this is a very different character you will get to meet in this book. This man's name is Victor Mancinni.<br /><br />Chuck Palinuik doesn't let up a moment with the gritty-edgy-razor-sharp wit of the narrator. Victor isn't just any old joe schmoe though; he's a sex-addict. In the story, his mother is stuck in the hospital dying. Now, with his buddy/co-worker/partner in crime, he sets out to research his roots, figure out why he's so messed up, have a couple of sexual encounters, and be sarcastic all the way.<br /><br />He also has a seperate lifestyle of scams releated to choking in public.<br /><br />You could say that this book is sort of like Catcher In The Rye . . . Only 100 times more graphic with no holding back.<br /><br />As always, Palinuik finds a way for the audience to find humor in the somewhat questionable topics that are depicted.<br /><br />I'd say that this book has a lot of shocks and, to tell you honestly, you'll find yourself putting the book down a number of times just so that you can let the shock set in. It's that blunt.<br /><br />But, I'd have to say that Chuck really did outdo himself with this one because it is MEANT to shock you. And I was. I liked it though how Victor and Denny were sort of like two bumbling buddies. One is always sarcastic, the other is always realistic. It really sparks the humor off the page.<br /><br />There are some topics in here that might not be suitable for squeamish readers.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book because it hit me with something different. The only real problem I have is the ending of the book. Other than that, it is sure to be said that \\"Choke\\" coughs up a good one.ke\\" coughs up a good one.
034544678X|5.0|I like the first hand experiences related in the book. The suggestions are helpful.
B000FGGE5Y|4.0|This movie was kind of Matrixy. The special effects were great, but I wish they would have left out the comic book style textures. Also when a window is shot from the outside the glass isn't suppose to shatter outward. There was alot of that type of \\"well it looks good, who cares about physics\\" mentality in the making. The graphics of the gravity manipulation device were top notch but brief. The story revovles around a vampire or \\"Hemophage\\" as they call them in the movie. The world is without all diseases save one; the hemophage virus. It is a virus that for some reason people don't want to catch, even though it gives the \\"sick\\" person super strength, speed and agility. I'll never understand some of the underlying character relationships and I don't think anyone will unless they read the comic or investigate the pre-movie story. The characters are likable but not well developed. The main character, Ultraviolet, is very likable and very hot played by Milla Jovovich. There is a new cure discovered and Ultraviolet tries to steal it before it can be used. I thought it was a good movie, border-line great even, but the characters aren't developed and the story seemed to take a back seat to the fighting/action sequences. All in all a good sci-fi flick. Check it out, you might like it way more than I did. My friend Shawn loved it. He said it was better than the Matrix, but he also didn't like Fight Club either so... Anyway it's at least worth a peek.
B00006I53S|5.0|I'm a high school student and this lens is a little pricey, but I have found that this lens was totally worth the money. Based on the amount of time it spends on my camera alone, this lens was worth the money, but when you factor in the image quality, the good focal lengths, and the image stabilization, it becomes apparent that this lens was more than well worth the money. All focal lengths are sharp, and the zoom range is perfect. 28 is wide angle enough for most situations, and except for when you're shooting sports or wildlife etc., 135 is plenty of telephoto. Along with this, I have the 70-300mm IS (without diffractive optics) lens (which was another $400ish) and that covers almost the entire range one might need. This lens lives on my camera (VERY VERY VERY rarely comes off) and is terrific. If you don't have $1500 to spend on a lens, this is a high quality lens, for a moderate price and is highly recommended.
B0006SSOHC|2.0|This is a movie about a cereal killer with a voyeristic [...] The movie was a great idea, but the story wasn't thought out very well. There are holes in the plot you could drive a Semi-truck through. The antagonist is a very good actor, but the other actors are deffinitly lacking. Poor lighting, aparently designed to be \\"spooky\\", makes some scenes unbearable to watch. I don't know what movie some other reviewers were watching, but it seems we watched diffrent films. I think people were sucked in because the plot and or mystery was not predictable, but a mystery that doesn't make any sense is no mystery, it's a confusing story that shouldn't be told. For a really good mystery the viewer should be given the chance of figuring out the mystery as the story developes. Saw did none of that. There was no way to figure out what was going on or who was doing it while the story was unfolding. Stay away from this movie (a series now that Saw2 is out). If you want an excellent mystery/plot-twister try The Usual Suspects or The Sixth Sense or even the 80's flick Clue was better than this theatrical roadkill of a movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that I believe very few movies have absolutly no entertainment value. Saw did have some decent gore/bloody scenes worth checking out. If you must buy this film at least show some brains and buy it from Amazon.
B000FDECGA|3.0|This rating is soley based on the remastering, which was nicely done, accept that there are a couple scenes that are not restored at all (it actually says on the screen \\"unrestored footage\\").  Personally I f***ing hated this.  For what reason this was done, it was a bad choice.  Of course this movie is awesome, but i recommend getting the whole Lone Wolf and Cub series.  The only downfall for getting the series is you'll be missing the CLASSIC english dub (Gza's Liquid Swords).

B000000H5J|5.0|Fear Factory is essentially what you get if Nine Inch Nails, Slayer, and Morbid Angel fused together into one.<br /><br />Onto the album, the machine gun double bass, the crushing guitar riffs, and Burton C. Bells growls are the main points of this album. The drums are so fast it sounds like automatic weaponry is going off in your speakers. The bassist is largely inaudible, but he is the main guitarist from Archetype and Transgression, so I know he can handle his instrument well.<br /><br />My favorite songs: Demanufacture, Hunter-Killer, Pisschrist, New Breed, and Self Bias Resistor.<br /><br />Also get Soul of a New Machine, Obsolete, Archetype, and Transgression for amazing Fear Factory.

I highly recommend it to anyone - and particularly to anyone whose son or daughter is reading it at school.
B000002UUX|5.0|This album is without a doubt Megadeths finest hour. Dave Mustaines masterpiece Rust in Piece is agreed upon by many fans that this when Megadeth surpassed Metallica in greatness. Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Five Magics, Lucretia, Rust in Peace...Polaris, all down right amazing songs that prove that Megadeth are a force to be reckoned with. Although Peace Sells.....but Whos Buying was Deth's breakthrough album, this is their surprise attack in a year when Metallica reigned supreme and started to get rich out of their a**es (although I still like them).<br /><br />The afforementioned songs are my favorite, but their isnt any filler on this album. While Metallica sold out and dissapointed their fans beyond belief; with the exception of Risk, Megadeth always brings us classics.
0452282152|5.0|I want to read more by Tracy Chevalier.  She did a wonderful job of getting inside the character Griet's head, and her descriptions truly brought the art studio of Vermeer to life.  I know little about art, yet was fascinated by the layering of paint and the use of light, and have this urge to visit an art museum.  When Chevalier was portraying Griet's sitting for the painting \\"The Girl with the Pearl Earring,\\" I couldn't help flipping from the printed page to the cover, back and forth.  Just marvelous!
B000000H3W|5.0|The only band that can give thrash greats Megadeth and Slayer a run for their money, its unfortunate that they are never mentioned alot, even though they were just as important to the thrash genre as Kreator, Pantera, and the Big Four of thrash. My complaint aside, this album is by far one of the greatest metal albums of 1991 and by far Sepultura's greatest ever. While Metallica was slowing down their speed and simplifying their riffs, Sepultura was doing the exact opposite. This CD is so blazingly fast, it nearly topples Slayer's Reign in Blood in overall headbanging madness and crazy solos.<br /><br />Songs Arise, Dead Embryonic Cells, Desperate Cry, and Infected Voice are my favorites, but there are no weak spots in this classic. Also worth checking out are Kreators Pleasure to Kill, Sepulturas Beneath the Remains, Slayers Seasons in the Abyss, and Megadeths Countdown to Extinction for some thrashy goodness.
B000244FDW|3.0|Even though the production value for this version is a bit poor, it still remains one of my favorites. I remembered when it first aired and was very excited. It was fun watching it again.
B000009QPG|5.0|When people mention Slayer, Reign in Blood is always mentioned as their most creative. However, my favorite by far is Seasons in the Abyss, rivaling Megadeths Rust in Peace, Sepulturas Arise, and Panteras Vulgar Display of Power as the greatest thrash album of all time. As soon as you hit the play button, a wall of noise immediately blasts your ears to down to the 7th layers of Hell during War Ensemble, not stopping the chaos until the closer Seasons in the Abyss. Unlike alot of my CDs, I can actually say I never skipped a single track. Every song has as much depth as Hell itself, and every song is heavy and speedy enough to enrage the listener in a headbanging and air guitarring frenzy.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: War Ensemble, Spirit in Black, Expendable Youth, Dead Skin Mask, Hallowed Point, and Seasons in the Abyss, although all of them are great.<br /><br />Other CDs recomended are Lamb of Gods As the Palaces Burn, Iced Earths Burnt Offerings, and Dimmu Borgirs Death Cult Armaggedon.
1594200823|5.0|Through one plant, Corn, Michal Pollen shows me, how everything, not just food, I encounter on a daily basis is `connected'. It dawns on me the `true' cost of a 99-cent burger made from corn-fed steers and high fructose corn syrup: <br /> <br />A bushel or 56 lb of corns is trading at less than $2 right now because there is SO much corn. High productivity indeed thanks to LOTS of commercial fertilizers (from fossil fuel); and Water, not an unlimited natural resource; and commercial farming equipments that drink gasoline (fossil fuel) and can work much bigger fields in less time. <br /> <br />All these are things that farmers have to pay for. With cost so high, corn price so low, that's why they need farm subsidy which comes from the tax money that I pay every April. Chin-Chin! Excess fertilizer creates runoff which contaminates water supply that we drink or need to spend more processing power (fossil fuel) to get it drinkable. On the other hand, cows are not used to eating so much corn in so short of a time (they graze on grass by nature's design), so they are now sick. Since people are drinking contaminated water and eating sick animals, health care cost goes up. Who now pays for higher health insurance premium every month? Chin-Chin! Food made from corn derivatives are now so cheap (soda, corn-fed beef/chickens/pigs) so we eat more and more often, that's why I need an expensive gym membership to burn all the excess calories and maybe join Jenny Craig which Nestle just bought btw. Chin-Chin again! Finally, when processed foods are my main diet then I practically am eating just one plant, Corn, so that's why I need and am buying all those super-sized bottles of vitamin pills. More Chin-Chin! <br /> <br />No corporation will tell us to drive Less, to spend money building convenient public transportation system, instead they will spend money to promote Ethanol. They want us to believe that it is `better' and different than fossil fuel. But have we forgotten that it isa law of physics that energy can only be Converted and can NOT be Created? Any agriculturally-derived fuel like Ethanol, needs electricity (which needs coal to generate) to process, and in order to meet the level of our energy consumption, we need a hell lot of it which can only be coerced out of nature with lots of fertilizer which again comes from fossil fuel. <br /> <br />Michael Pollen made us see the excess of corns is deliberate. It is Required to feed and grow our habit of Consumption because only with that habit, the big conglomerates can make lots of money, and make us believe that that cost of 99-cent burger to us is just 99 cents. <br /> <br />Yes, whole foods or organic foods are more expensive. Safeway's antibiotic-ridden corn-fed beef is less than $3/lb while the grass-fed ones at Whole Foods are over $10. So consume less! Make it like the good old days when eating meats is a special occasion thing. It will be better for your body, and your soul, knowing that you are paying the true price. <br />
B00006J3T4|4.0|I have to admit that during the 80's I was listening to the likes of Ivie Anderson w/ Duke Ellington and Sidney Bechet, so I'm still asking myself \\"Just who is Dire Straits?\\"  Someone gave me a cd and I recognized some tunes from the radio, which I've stopped listening to long ago, and I'm just not real impressed with DS.  I can't take tv or radio anymore.    Now discovering MK is like discovering in-door plumbing -- I never knew life life could be so sweet.  I've got to 'learn' Sailing to Philadelphia but I've taken to Golden Heart more than my friends have.  I have to laugh when I slip a cut on a mix of music and they ask \\"wow, that's great, what album is that from?\\"    I first discovered Notting Hillbillies and I was hooked -- still am on that album.  So far Ragpicker is the only one that has come close.  I like the acoustic side of life but I can tell this is far from a simple piece of work.  The man is amazing; I've come to appreciate guitar more -- I really like Neck to Neck if anything for Thatian Skies.    Keep your DS, I'll take MK on the rocks and keep exploring his other albums.      The only other guy I've taken this much interest in has been Richard Thompson.    I don't get Coyote yet -- I'll have to get back to some of you on that one.    PS -- I saw one review by another who thought MK purposedly downplayed the release of this cd -- black/white photo, bare notes in the cover -- but still gave it positive reviews.  I think MK has the heart of the coyote at play here.    I went in search of the lyrics -- the man is really accomplised at writing.  After several listens I'm amazed at how sparse the production is compared to STP -- the bare necessities are here for an incredible piece of work.  I think MK wanted the cd to stand on it's own and if you're hooked on it; fine, YOU do the homework and YOU investigate.      My appreciation has increased tenfold. \\"A Place Where Where We Use to Live\\" is near perfect in the past we are painfully aware of but \\"HillFarmer's Blues\\" is a sucker punch in comparison.    I'm amazed at how well Brits are better at nailing the American formula for writing traditional country (Paul Kennerly comes to mind and I know they're associates).  But hey, more power to the men.      This is music for a mature audience and no American Idol noise where the only thing that sticks out is the veins in their neck while they wail to over produced, amped, star solo vehicle material.    Clearly MK likes to play with other musicans and I think I dearly love Guy Fletcher, that mysterious, busy man in the background.    Yes, Coyote is growing on me -- hasn't overtaken me yet.
B000002U82|5.0|This is an album that almost anyone who knows anything about music knows about, and for good reason; this is undeniably one of the greatest albums of all time. Since it's initial release, generation after generation of music lovers have embraced this album, and it has only gained more appeal over the years, and that statement is coming from a sixteen year old kid. That being said, this album MUST be listened to all the way through in order to get the full effect. Once you do, you'll probably listen to this album for the rest of the your life. Recommended to everyone.
B000FFJ81W|5.0|Among the JAMC Dual Discs, I really noticed a BIG sound improvement on this CD in particular.  Haven't listened to the DVD side through big speakers yet, but I'm sure it is even better!!  The videos are all really good, especially April Skies, with Jim Reid hanging on a cross, armed with a handgun!<br /><br />ALL of the JAMC Dual Discs are essential for JAMC fans!!<br /><br />Oh yeah, and they include extensive, newly written liner notes, too!
B0002PZVH0|5.0|This is one of the very best ambient works ever made. Arguably the Godfather of Ambience, Eno created music that was complex and deeply moving, while at the same time keeping everything withing a minimalist context. This is NOT New Age / Muzak kitch, which has been passed of as ambience more than once. On the contrary, this ambience is real, legitimate music and should be considered as a genre worthy of the highest respect.<br /><br />I have listened to this many times at airports, and this work has captured the multitude of emotions and conceptions that occur in airports everyday, with sincerity and poignant observation.
B000FFJ82G|5.0|Of the 5 JAMC Dual Discs I bought, this one is probably the least essential, because the sound improvement was not quite as noticeable as it was on the other 4, and the videos are the most MTV-like (in other words, the least exciting) yet if you are a fan of the JAMC, it IS essential!!  I certainly am KEEPING IT!!!<br /><br />The sound IS an improvement - on BOTH the CD and DVD sides, and well worth buying!!  I just do NOT understand why RHINO did not release the 1988 collection of singles and B-sides, BARBED WIRE KISSES!!  It is a BIG HOLE in the Dual Disc collection, and they could have easily included it, with a video of Sidewalking and a bonus video of Some Candy Talking!!  I hope they will consider releasing it!!
B000002KIE|5.0|The Pistols weren't the epitomy of punk. At all. <br /> <br /> <br />In my eyes, they just wanted to play trashy rock 'n' roll. And they did that astoundingly well. <br /> <br /> <br />If you wanna hear some seriously punk stuff, get Arise! by Amebix or Why by Discharge. <br /> <br />If you wanna party and listen to the best New York Dolls ripoff ever, get this album.
0743454537|4.0|This was a tricky book to write - it is difficult to fully create sympathy for many of the characters in this book, based on its almost sci-fi plotline.  However, Picoult is able to do it credibly and the rest of the book is carried along by the amazing storyline (which has been well document in these reviews). <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a thoughtful look at the nature of family and sacrifice.
B00005JOVH|4.0|It is downright eerie to see how interconnected the seemingly autonomous projects, Superman Returns and X-Men: The Last Stand, are with each other. For example, Brett Ratner, director of the third and possibly final installment in the X-Men series, was originally attached to resurrect the once venerable DC Comic superhero film franchise, which, in light of both the exasperating Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, unquestionably the worst installment in the series, was in serious need of revival, with Superman Returns now helmed by Bryan Singer, director of the first two X-Men movies. Creative differences with Warner Brother executives however forced Ratner from the project. Ratner was then replaced with McG, director of the fortuitously unfunny Charlie's Angels film series, who reportedly was hired as a ploy to lure Michael Bay to the project. It ultimately failed when Bay asked for too much in back-end deals. In accepting the position of director for Superman Returns, Singer made live-long enemies with studio executives at 20th Century Fox. Not only did he dump the third X-Men movie with little if any advance notice to the studio, he brought along with him cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, composer/editor John Ottman, production designer Guy Dyas, and writers Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty, all of whom collaborated with Singer on the X2: X-Men United, draining the 20th Century Fox of some creative talent for the next installment at an inopportune time, the studio having just stacked out a claim for a Memorial Day release in 2006. <br /> <br />The story for X-Men: The Last Stand is easily the least memorable in the comic book trilogy. In addition it is far less consistent in terms of flow then the previous two entries. But then again given how Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, two of the three screenwriters for X2: X-Men United, bailed on this project in order to work on director Bryan Singer's Superman project over at Warner Brothers it does notcome as a complete surprise. The two screenwriters who replaced them lacked sufficient credentials to fill the void Harris and Dougherty left behind. Simon Kinberg wrote the screenplay for the embarrassing follow-up to the Vin Diesel blockbuster, xXx2: State of the Union, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith while Zak Penn's sole writing credit was for Elektra. Fans of both the comic book as well as the cartoon series the X-Men films were based on will be sorely disappointed with how the Phoenix saga is portrayed onscreen particularly after the anticipation that was built up following the titillating conclusion to the first sequel in which an image of a fiery Phoenix can be barely made out from below the waters. The two variant plot lines - the mutant cure (based on Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men storyline) and the Phoenix saga - do not gel well together, belittling rather then complimenting each other. Also there are specific plot elements in the script that simply do not work at all. For example, the subplot between Angel, the boy with the bird-like wings, and his father, Warren Worthington, the man behind the mutant `cure', is a complete waste. Nothing is done in term of advancing the plot. In fact the character of Angel itself makes only three appearances throughout the movie, none of which are of any significance with the only exception being at the very end. And what is the point of hinting at a supposed love triangle between Kitty Pryde, Iceman, and Rogue when nothing comes about of it? Outside of being a close friend nothing occurs between Kitty and Iceman that would suggest an impending romantic relationship. Rogue is barely seen as it is in the film so her transformation from having powers to being `cured' of her mutant powers which have been nothing but a curse to her has no emotional impact on the audience. <br /> <br />Hugh Jackman returns in top action form as was to be expected in the role of Wolverine. However unlike the previous installments no advancement is made in terms of Wolverine's character development. The audience gains no further insight into his past or the depth of his mind. This is a disappointment to say the least but had more time been devoted toward the script then something may have developed in some form or another. This will likely be expanded upon however in the subsequent spin-off soon to follow. Regretfully Academy Award-winner (it was handed to her because the NAACP complained) Halle Berry returns as Storm. Her role was expanded significantly (or else she would not have reprised the role in the third installment in the film series) but her vapid performance as the newly appointed leader of the X-Men leaves something greatly to be desired. Her character's mutant powers are used to their full potential but besides that it was a critical mistake for Brett Ratner to have expanded her role in the film. Berry could have easily been replaced and no one would have noticed or complained. And while no comic book character truly dies (something both Superman and Elektra for example can attest to) certain send-offs in this film, Cyclops's off-screen expulsion in particular, were a tad dispiriting. <br /> <br />Sir Ian McKellen who earlier this summer appeared alongside Tom Hanks in the Ron Howard drama The Da Vinci Code returns to the role of Magneto/Eric Lehnsherr in top form which frankly is hardly a surprise given his experienced acting career. It is the final climatic scene in the film in which Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants and the X-Men face off on Alcatraz Island that fully demonstrates the cruel irony of Magneto's development in the X-Men film series. Standing high above the masses of `pawns' he sends in first against the humans guarding Alcatraz Island, relentlessly cut-down with guns loaded with the `cure', Magneto has become the very thing he hated most, as tyrannical a dictator as Adolf Hitler ever was. And while the film's conclusion in which a now cured Magneto is seen in the park playing a game of chess alone is a tad precipitous and headlong, it fits perfectly with the X-Men mythology. In the comic book series Magneto and his immediate family were persecuted for their Jewish heritage by the Nazis, shot and then buried in a mass grave. He alone survived because he unconsciously used his magnetic powers to prevent the bullet from killing him. While it is unlikely we will know the definitive answer to whether Magneto was `cured' of his mutant powers or not, it is certainly not out the question that he indeed used his magnetic powers, consciously or not, to prevent the needle from delivering the cure into his body. <br /> <br />Kelsey Grammer perfectly translates the mutant character Beast from the comic book and cartoon series to the silver screen, from his appearance to his mannerisms and even down to his famous tagline, \\"My stars and garters\\". Fans will be pleased to say the least about it. <br /> <br />There was so much potential, at least from a fanboy aspect, for Kitty Pryde (one of the few prominent Jewish superheroes not to mention her extraordinary high IQ) that even her translation from a mere background character to a supporting role is a bit of a disappointment. Ellen Page's performance however is delightful regardless the irrelevant love-triangle the writers involve her in. <br /> <br />As for Juggernaut, played by British football player-turned actor Vinnie Jones, nothing is mention in the way of his character being related to Professor Charles Xavier. In the comic book series he was the stepbrother of Professor X and his helmet which is dramatically different from the one he wears in the film was created to block out telekenetic powers such as his stepbrother's so noone could read his mind or manipulate him. The only highlight may be the cheap one-liner he throws at Kitty Pyrde near the end of the film, \\"Don't you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!\\" This of course is a passing reference to the internet short film `The Juggernaut Bitch' but unless you aware of what they are referring to, it just comes off as being awkward and unnecessary. <br /> <br />And while it may be a mystery for some, the absence of Nightcrawler from the picture should not come as a surprise to audience members who have played the X-Men: The Last Stand companion video game. <br /> <br />Overall, the third and quite conceivably the final chapter in the epic X-Men saga (spin-off projects however are being developed by 20th Century Fox for individual mutants including Wolverine, Magneto, and even Mystique) was not the best we could have hope for but neither was it as cataclysmic a disaster as some hardcore fans predicted it would be. Firmly lacking the quintessential elements of continuity and profundity in the areas of character development and story enhancement, X3 never really rises above the measure of a pure adrenaline-fueled action popcorn flick which needless to say is precisely what the domestic box office needs more of. It won't please everyone but neither is it meant to. Sure, it goes a little over the top at times and it is noticeable that more forethought was placed into carefully orchestrating particular action sequences (for example, the Golden Gate Bridge sequence) then crucial elements of the script which were more worthy of attention. That said however the action sequences are where the film and more importantly director Brett Ratner truly shine. The battle scene near the beginning of the film, the one in which fans get to briefly see the Danger Room as well as a quick shot of a Sentinel, and the one at the end seem to mirror each other perfectly, creating a sort of symmetry which works to great effect. There's the brilliantly choreographed fight sequence between Wolverine and other mutants through a forest, moments with the Phoenix, and so much more that to further elaborate would be to spoil it. Beyond that X3's dilemmas are staggering. This is not however director Brett Ratner's fault mind you. Let's face it, X2: X-Men United with the exception of the rather haphazard subtitle is one of the best comic book feature film adaptations in recent memory, if not of all time, albeit far behind the genius of Spider-Man 2. X2 was a tremendously difficult act to follow whether it was Brett Ratner or even if Bryan Singer himself had returned to the helm. Like Return of the Jedi after the Empire Strikes Back, the second film had received such critical and public acclaim that expectations were set ridiculously high for the follow up. In other words someone was bound to be disappointed no matter who directed it. In addition kudos should be given to director Brett Ratner for putting together a practically acceptable if not often inconsistent superhero film in the short amount of time, far less then any other director in the same situation at a different production studio. Singer's absence is noticeable, no doubt about it. The first two films were far more sincere in nature while Ratner's is more off-balanced. But rather then attempt to duplicate Singer's directorial style Ratner instead chose to put his own spin on the X-Men franchise which whether you agree with it or not is true to his filmmaking abilities. While X-Men: The Last Stand marks a significant step backward for the superhero film franchise, it is at least a half-way decent action flick, something of which American movie audiences have been deprived of for some time now. Had director Brett Ratner been given more time in which to put together the production, he could have easily produced a stirring final chapter in the X-Men saga but sadly it does not happen this time around.
B00000I07R|4.0|Bon Jovi is a band that may not be the best one (the best one's were Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd), but their record-sales say otherwise. There is perhaps a grain of truth in the notion that half of their audience were teenagers and women and their sucess was soemwhat overrated, as well as that they went big on Jon Bon Jovi's coiffeur and outlook, though.  <br />        Nonetheless, I think they truly deserved their overwhealming breakthrough from the 80's offering people catchy, competent and well-ctrafted pop-rock-metal tunes played on and on by the MTV. All in all, that's how metal sounded in the mid-80's (just take Whitesnake or Def Leppard). Personally, I have always been an advocate of this band, turning a blind eye on what other narrow-minded people kept saying about it. Yes, Bon Jovi has made couple of cheesy songs (\\"Always\\") and some both cheesy and too commercial as well (\\"It's my life\\"). \\"It's my life\\" was a cheap trial to break to the pop-charts, but, if there are any open-minded music passionates there, you will notice that other bands had it as well (Van Halen had \\"Jump\\", KISS had \\"I was made for loving you\\").  <br />One has to take the band as a whole, and simply can't deny the skillful and well-crafted musicanship of albums like \\"New Jersey\\" or \\"Keep the faith\\". So, if you are too narrow-minded to rate this, you simply have no right to proclaim yourself a music-passionate or music-knower. <br />        Before \\"KTF\\" was released Bon Jovi came into the studio  <br />very motivated and full of energy after a well-deserved 4-year- break that immediately followed the incredible \\"New Jersey\\" tour. They had sold out stadiums, giving over 200 concerts all around the world and the tour itself consolidated their position on the music market and confirmed how well they do on-stage. But unfortunately it also put on the brink their common career as a band. \\"Five different guys took five different planes to five different places. There were no goodbyes\\" - JBJ once used to say.  <br />        No wonder \\"Keep the faith\\" was the ultimate, long-awiated album in the 90's and this waiting had 2 major purposes: 1)to finally write off the larger-than-life 80's survivor as a mere, temporary, fashion-yielding hair-band 2)or to prove people that Jon & Richie were in fact much more than \\"Living on a prayer\\" and were capable of adopting to the changable 90's music scene (with grunge at the forefront). <br />        For the first group of critics, like the above-underwritten Amazon reviewer Andrew Mueller being sic and tired of Bon Jovi's recent expansion, the very album - no matter how good it might turn out to be - was a blessing so much awaited to prey on, that he boldly, blatantly and with a smirk on his face dismissed even such masterpieces like \\"Dry county\\"; and that doing this with a mere wave of a hand, claiming it's \\"pointless\\" or \\"longish\\". Pathetic indeed, but it shows how much stirr there was once the album has been released. <br />        Fortunately, the CD speaks for itself and proves again that if BJ's star was ever to be thwarted for good - then it should have been done much earlier, namely right after their second \\"7800 fahrenheit\\". Ironically enough, their debut album was received very well on both sides of the ocean, and most of the critics that hated \\"Slippery when wet\\" (see acclaimed British music magazine \\"Kerrang\\") showed much warmth and sympathy towards it. <br />        As far as the second group of people - they once again got a longplay that fully satisfied their crave for tuneful, melodic rock; yet not an ordinary hair-metal this time. Jon knew it well and it wasn't only for his change of haircut. The singalong choruses remained the same, the peculiar BJ-flow that makes people tapping their fingers as well; yet  <br />the album is much more than that, being a lot more mature in terms of lyrics, diversity and overall coherence. If the title song was to become the new \\"Living on a prayer\\" and \\"Bed of roses\\" a new \\"I'll be there for you\\", then OK - it would indicate that a new era for the band has just begun. But if someone ever bought \\"Slippery when wet\\" just for 2 songs dismissing the rest, then he/she is not going to do this this time, with this album, I'm telling you.  <br />        The epic \\"Dry county\\" was reviewed and summarized many times so far, but I don't know if it abides any summary in fact; since this is one of the songs you must hear and relish in it every single time, peruse every single tune, from the very beginning, climaxing with Richie's solo, and fading away with Dave's keyboards. I was on a concert in Germany a month ago (\\"Have a nice day\\" tour) and you can't imagine what a surprise it was for me when they played this one at the very end of the show! Whooah, this is one of the moments I will remeber until the end of my life. With tears in your eyes, you live for such moments. \\"Dry county\\" is also undoubtedly the most accomplished, advanced and ambitious band's effort, looking at the entire 20-some-years-career.  It is a class for itself, compare this epic to \\"Stairway to heaven\\", \\"Shine on you crazy diamond\\" or GunsNRoses' \\"November rain\\". I wont't exaggerate at all if I say this album is worth having just for this single track, since it is one of the most important songs that have ever been recorded. Let people like Andrew Mueller - with full respect towards his work and criticism - long live they in their blissful oblivion dismissing \\"Dry county\\" as \\"pointless\\". <br />         But \\"Keep the faith\\" is a lot more than \\"Dry county\\", I tell you. \\"If I was your mother\\", which is my second favourite track here, is a huge bow towards grunge music; \\"Fear\\" as well. It clearly shows that guys took into account changing fashions and wrote these two almost-heavy-metal <br />tracks. The \\"Mother's\\" riff is incredible, merging Pearl Jam, Nirvana and Guns N Roses. \\"In these arms\\" and \\"I'll sleep when I'm dead\\" are happy-rockers that can be hummed any time on a party, somewhat reminescent of the recent albums, like \\"99 in the shade\\" or something !  \\"Little bit of soul\\" and \\"Blame it on the love of rock n roll\\" are two very good tracks - yet again in another mood - that close this marvelous album and, merging soul and blues, make a final statement about the incredible diversity \\"Keep the faith\\" offers. Of course \\"Bed of roses\\" was a huge hit and is arguably their best ballad ever, whereas the title track - being the first single at the same time - made it into the US Top20, is very heavy with incredible Sambora's guitar-solo, and it also smacks somewhat of grunge.  <br />          Overall, this is an incredibly miscellanous and diverse record that you won't get bored of... never! The only reason why I'm not giving full 5 stars (but 4,5) is because I've got acquainted with the take-off material from those sessions, and it stirrs the entity for me, I don't know why but somehow it does. It gets my goat that the band not always makes the right choice when it eventually goes to make the final song-selection. Tracks that appeared recently on the jubille \\"100,000,000 million fans can't be wrong\\", like \\"The fire inside\\", \\"Sympathy\\" or \\"Temptation\\" really should have made this great album.  Had these great songs been included istead of cheesy ballad \\"I want you\\" or mediocre \\"Woman in love\\", it could have been one of the greatest and most diverse albums in music history. Probably other Bon Jovi-fans agree with me. <br />        Anyway, this is an incredible album, almost as good as \\"New Jersey\\". Only \\"NJ\\" didn't have 2 less strong songs, it was almost perfect... well just kidding, OK it had terrible \\"Bad medicine\\" ;-)) <br /> <br />This is a MUST-HAVE. <br />           <br />           <br /> <br />
B00005JOQS|4.0|Does the world need a Superman? That is precisely the very question executives at Warner Brothers studios and X-Men director Bryan Singer are trying to answer this summer with the release of the highly-anticipated Superman Returns which they hope will be received with a resounding `Yes' from the American public. Fans of the `Man of Steel' have for years clamored for the world's greatest superhero to make a triumphant return to the silver screen in light of the shameful Superman IV: The Quest for Peace which was both a critical as well as a public failure for Warner Brothers. And although producer Alexander Salkind diligently tried in vain to resurrect the film franchise with Superman: The New Movie, using the Superboy television series to get the proposal off the ground, nothing came to fruition. Warner Brothers spent fifty-million dollars in pre-production alone and went through as many as three directors including Batman director Tim Burton, Charlie's Angels director McG and Rush Hour director Brett Ratner. Ironically enough it was Ratner who departed the Superman Returns project to take up X-Men: The Last Stand, a sequel to the successful X-Men film franchise Bryan Singer abandoned for Superman Returns. Among the nine writers tapped to pen the screenplay for the fifth installment in the Superman series, Clerks director Kevin Smith who used `The Death and Life of Superman' storyline for his screenplay and Alias and Lost creator/producer J.J. Abrams who despite a preemptive drubbing of his screenplay by Ain't Cool News' a movie gossip website, is responsible for suggesting that critical elements of the Superman mythology be reintroduced to a new generation, not to mention whose screenplay cancelled out the disastrous Batman v. Superman project, are the better known ones. With an astronomical production budget of over two-hundred million dollars (this figure has since been greatly disputed by numerous sources and more likely the actual figure stands at an estimatedone-hundred and fifty million dollars), a lot of pressure has been placed on the shoulders of Bryan Singer, more even then what was placed on him for the X-Men franchise, to make Superman Returns a success. <br /> <br />The story for Superman Returns is unequivocally the most intricate aspect of this movie to pinpoint and thoroughly analyze. First off, it is far from what some, namely aging movie critic Roger Ebert, would describe as being a complete and utter disaster. At the same time however the script does fail to invoke the sense of enthusiasm and grandeur seventeen years of bent up fan anticipation and/or frustration, not to mention the prodigious marketing force behind the project, would lead us to believe. It may be that it relies too heavily on the principal elements of the original Superman movie. This is not however necessarily a bad thing as it was writer/producer J.J. Abrams who intended to revisit these exact components in his draft of the Superman screenplay so that they might be reintroduced to a new generation unfamiliar with the entire Superman mythology. Warner Brothers' marketing team did too good of a job promoting Superman Returns, creating exorbitant expectations that could never realistically be met, at least as far as the first film is concerned. Superman Returns, in the same vein as the original Spider-Man and X-Men films, is merely the stepping stone which sets the stage for its characters and future storylines they'll follow. At the very least it can be described as disappointing. <br /> <br />It is unfair to compare Brandon Routh's performance as the `Man of Steel' to the late-actor Christopher Reeve. Even before his untimely death due to a heart attack his performance as Superman in the 1978 original was viewed as iconic in cinematic history, a far cry to be sure from the Batman franchise with the sole exception being Michael Keaton which would still be a matter of some debate. Routh succeeds in making the role his own and not relying too heavily on Reeve's example to affect his performance onscreen. Routh has charm and charisma that's for sure but it felt as though the audience was left a little short changed when it came to Superman himself. <br /> <br />Kate Bosworth is easily the greatest miscast of the film in the role of Superman's love interest Lois Lane. The astringent lack of credentials in her relatively short filmmaking career work against her in this pivotal role. The sole exception of course being Beyond the Sea directed by co-star Kevin Spacey who recommended the young actress to director Bryan Singer when he was cast as Lex Luthor. It is difficult to put a finger on the problem precisely but there is just something about her that doesn't quite feel right. In addition to her hair color, her whole performance comes off as artificial. <br /> <br />Kevin Spacey is exquisitely sadistic yet still charming as Superman's arch-nemesis Lex Luthor. He truly appears as though he had a lot of fun in this role. This works to both the benefit of Spacey's overall performance and the audience's viewing experience. For example, when Lois Lane argues with Lex Luthor that his plan to use the crystals from Superman's lair to create an entirely new continent and in the process destroy all of North America will kill millions of people, Luthor callously interjects, \\"Billions! Once again, the press underestimates me\\". This is one of the rare instances in which Superman Returns surpasses the expectations laid down by the original Superman movie. Spacey brings to the role of Lex Luthor a level of enthusiasm that vastly exceeds Gene Hackman's performance thirty years ago. <br /> <br />Kal Penn, best remembered for his comedic performances in National Lampoon's Van Wilder and Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, is highly underutilized in this film as Stanford, one of Lex Luthor's goons. He's easily recognizable among teenagers and young adults so his one-line performance which is said off-screen seems a tad off.<br /> <br />Overall, Superman Returns, while not the movie of the year, let alone of the summer season, as all the fan boy hype and studio marketing power made it out to be, marks a brilliant and long overdue reemergence for this once faltering franchise. If nothing else director Bryan Singer should be credited for that. That said however it does have its shortcomings. There are lapses in conventional logic as with any comic book movie but nothing to be finicky about. What is rather difficult for anyone, let alone a hardcore comic book `geek', to swallow is the idea of Superman leaving Earth for five years, saying goodbye to Lois Lane or not, and all because some group of scientists claimed they found remnants of a planet called Krypton, the Man of Steel's home planet. If Superman knows that his planet was destroyed, why investigate? And why did it take him five years? It has been seventeen years since the last Superman movie. Furthermore, considering Alias creator/producer J.J. Abrams original draft for the fifth Superman project was rejected by Bryan Singer on the basis that it was too controversial among fans of the comic book series, it is therefore a bit perplexing to say the least that there has been so little fan uproar over the concept of Superman and Lois Lane having a son. With Superman seen as a Christ-like figure it is essentially sacrilege (a page taken from The Da Vinci Code controversy) for him to have a child. Even if this is the extreme in describing the scenario it at least shouldn't sit right with fans. And while the flashback of a young Clark Kent discovering his abnormal abilities (lightening fast speed, flying, etc.) is a joy to behold, it does nothing to advance the plot and would have been better spent left on the cutting room floor. One-hundred and fifty-four minutes is to say the least a tad excessive even when resurrecting a superhero franchise but according to sources (a current roommate who is friends with the Man of Steel Brandon Routh) a lot was cut from the film so it could have been a lot longer. Regardless, there is very little to complain about. The computer-generated special effects are simply astonishing, most of all the remarkable Boeing 747 sequence, with none of them feeling out of place or incomplete. While Metropolis may be a fictional place set within the confines of the DC comic book universe, director Bryan Singer successfully brings it to life, projecting a sense of realism onto the audience and yet still keeping it staunchly within the realm of romanticism and grandeur. But most importantly of all the sequences of dialogue, manipulated by computer-effects wizards behind the scenes, with the late-actor Marlon Brando, scenes that were shot originally for Superman II, are what make this movie great. As you are watching the movie you begin to ask yourself, with Superman as Earth's disposal so to speak, why do we still have to worry about Osama Bin Laden, North Korea, or Iran? As Jor-El explains as we see Superman hovering above the Earth, floating in space, Kal-El (Superman) can be a savior for man kind but he can't do everything. There are issues such as Islamic terrorism, international conflicts, geopolitical disasters etc. that humanity itself has to deal with on its own. While it would be easier for a Superman to resolve it for us, we as a collective would not gain anything from that. At the core of humanity there is the capacity to do good, we only lack the light now and then to show us the way. That is Superman's true purpose. On the surface Superman Returns is an often long-winded, heavily character driven superhero drama, but given time beyond the first film, remember - Spider-Man and X-Men were the same when they first started out, it can be capable of great things.
B000025SL5|5.0|I first heard this music while watching a demonstration of Luzitania horses in Portugal this spring.  The horses really seemed to be \\"into\\" the music and performed wonderfully. I too, loved the music and searched for it high and low.  No one had it in stock and finally found it at Amazon.  Now when I listen to this soundtrack I have vivid recollections of the beautiful horses in Portugal.  All of my friends also enjoy the music. <br />This sound track is highly recommended.
B000002UA0|5.0|If you like Pink Floyd or any psychadelic rock period you MUST OWN THIS ALBUM. From the solid drumming of Mason to the amazing bass of Waters to the trippy keyboards and effects of Wright to the pure genius on every level of Syd Barrett this is a masterpiece. It is true that Pink Floyd has released more true masterpieces than any other band, but this stands out as the most original and maybe even the strangest of them. Just imagine what would have happened if Syd had stayed with the band for a few more years, been there for all of A Saucerful of Secrets and the subsequent albums, how different, but still amazing they would have been.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|I really can't believe so many people are totally blown away by this album. Is it cos for all of them the name RHCP means so much? Or cos of the inability to distinguish something outstanding from mediocre? I suppose both. I wish the band hadnt released anything at all and remained one of the greatest bands in the history of rock than realeased this album. It's too secondary in comparison with the previous 4 albums. Absolutely nothing new, the same melodies, the same harmonies. Yes, the sound is great, but no creativity whatever. A huge disappointment...
B000022TSW|5.0|this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. if u like the show you will LOVE this movie. buy it today!!!!!!!
B000A5044C|5.0|This film is amazing, and the acting doesn't seem like acting, it is so real.  <br /> <br />So..great and so sad! <br /> <br />It is about a mother who abandons her kids, and the oldest one has to take over. <br /> <br />The ending disapointed me, but it is an overall great film.
B00000J6AG|5.0|\\"Play\\" is an excellent piece of work and a turning point for Moby as it introduces us to his ambient side.  Certainly one of the best electronica albums in recent memory. The CD begins with a bang but the 2nd half flows to a mellow chillout state of mind.... Lately, there has been a great crop of electronic ambient releases, among them: Amethystium, Blank & Jones and Digital Moodz --all are highly recommended
B0000009SI|5.0|The lyrics, totally out there. But the instrumentation and arrangement is spectacular, as is evident in track 7. It is my understanding, thanks to a certain undisclosed source that Zappa did NOT in fact do drugs, which makes him a million times cooler as a musician. If you like this album, definitly pick up Joe's Garage.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|This is an intense portrayal of an intense retribution. Very well paced and the way the story is told allows you to watch the progression of emotions felt by the protagonist. It also shows that those who do suffer while those who plan don't.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|My five year old grand-daughter can't watch this enough times...it's a wonderful \\"memory\\" in itself. She knows most of the songs and sings them often as well as dances too.  This has now replace \\" Phantom of the Opera \\" which she also loves...one might think she will one day become a wee actress herself. <br />     This is a wonderful production and would urge one and all to buy and enjoy a fanciful story with great music and dancing. <br />
0790744295|5.0|If you are a fan of horror movies, the old EC comic books, Stephen King, or just fun movies in general, than look no further than this 1982 classic!<br /><br />=================================================<br />THE MOVIE (5/5):<br />\\"Creepshow\\" is an anthology of scary stories-- five of them-- that is bridged together by a sixth tale of a boy who loves horror comics and his abusive dad who hates them. The movie features pitch-perfect performances by an all-star 80's cast that seems to be having a lot of fun being in this scream of a movie. The stories are as follow:<br /><br />1. \\"FATHER'S DAY\\" (4.5/5)<br />Stars Carrie Nye, Ed Harris, and Viveca Lindfors.<br />Easily the cheesiest of the five stories (but still a lot of fun), Father's Day tells the tale of a family reunion from hell when a long-dead dad rises from the grave for his \\"caaaaaaakkeeeee\\" (and for a little good old fashioned zombie revenge).<br /><br />2. \\"THE LONESOME DEATH OF JORDY VERRILL\\" (4/5)<br />Stars Stephen King.<br />Although its easily the weakest of the stories, it's probably also the most original, so keep your finger off the fast-forward button. Stephen King (!) gives a nutty and throughly enjoyable performance as a country bumpkin who battles alien plantlife from a meteroite that touches down in his backyard. Sounds weird? You don't know the half of it.<br /><br />3. \\"SOMETHING TO TIDE YOU OVER\\" (5/5)<br />Stars Leslie Nielsen, Ted Danson, and Gaylen Ross.<br />This segment is legendary. Leslie Nielsen gives the performance of his life as a psychotically jealous husband who takes a notion to bury his wife and her lover neck-deep in sand before the tide rolls in. Needless to say, love is more powerful than death, as our antihero soon finds himself neck deep in terrifying troubles of his own.<br /><br />4. \\"THE CRATE\\" (5/5)<br />Stars Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, and Fritz Weaver.<br />Hands down the best tale of terror, it's no wonder that the three main actors of this single storyalso receive top billing in the picture's opening credits. This epic blood-soaked tale of insanity, fear, and fidelity is a timeless classic with excellent performances all around, and an unforgettable monkey-like demon from special effects master Tom Savini. The longest segment of the film, \\"The Crate\\" tells the story of Henry (Holbrook), a college professor with an unbelievably obnoxious and domineering wife (a brilliant performance by Barbeau). When Henry's colleague Dexter Stanley (Weaver) discovers a flesh-eating monster under the stairway under the stairs of the college and informs Henry, the henpecked husband makes plans to use the monster to his own domestic advantage. This out-of-this-world premise carries very real themes of love and death, friends and family, and moral responsibility versus personal hapiness. With subtle undertones that just hint at the depth of this brilliantly written horror masterpiece, Stephen King has never been more entertaining than with this perfectly crafted tale.<br /><br />5. \\"THEY'RE CREEPING UP ON YOU\\" (4.5/5)<br />Stars E.G. Marshall.<br />Bringing us back down for a soft landing, Romero and King conclude their horror anthology with this wonderfully bizarre tale of a millionaire hypochondriac whose allegedly germ-proof apartment is overwhelmed with an army of cockroaches. This one goes way over the top, but it all keeps with the tempo of the movie. If you know somebody who is deathly afraid of bugs, try showing them the final scene of this segment, then sit back and enjoy their screams of bewilderment.<br /><br />All in all, I'd have to say Creepshow is one of the top three horror films ever made. Rent it or buy it today!<br /><br />=================================================<br />THE DISC (1/5):<br />Unfortunately, the \\"geniuses\\" over at Warner Bros. have insulted this fine film and its fans by offering up a very lame disc. The picture quality is only passable, the letterbox formatting is kind of funky, and there areabsolutely no extras, save for a trailer, which I don't really count as a real feature. The only good thing I can possibly say about the disc is that it's got 41 chapters, but only 21 of those are accesible with the disc.<br /><br />While we'll have to wait for \\"Creepshow\\" to get the same Special Edition treatment as its inferior sequel, this bare bones disc only goes to show the strength of the film in the fact that even with no bonuses at all, \\"Creepshow\\" is still one of the most rewatchable and indispensable horror movies on the market.
B00005JGCQ|4.0|Se7en is definitely some of Brad Pitt's best work as an actor (though that's not saying much, and Morgan Freeman is really good as Somerset in this movie. The plot is based on a psychopath who is killing people who have committed one of the \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\" and the ending is superb. This movie has some gross parts, so if you have a weak stomach, you may want to avoid it. However, the gore is not over-the-top and is actually almost essential to the plot. Blood& Guts aside, this movie is really, really good.
B000BTC5LW|2.0|Guys, I don't know what system you guys are listening to this DVD on. I pre-ordered my copy from amazon.com since last year. It finally came. Much as I like Pink Floyd,  <br />I am disappointed with the sound quality on this dvd. Now, I can understand why David Gilmore was holding back on the release of this dvd. I will admit my system is not that great, but if I can hear all the flaws with a cheap system, I wonder what I would have heard on an expensive system. <br />Just in case you wonder, my system consists of Sony STR-DE 697 receiver, Bose Acoustimass 6 Series 111 and a Cyberhome dvd recoder/player. On a serious note, I am keeping this dvd because I am PF fan, want to have it for keep sake and too lazy to put it back in the box and mail it back to amazon.com. Above all it was cheap. Other than that, I am happy I have the Laser Disc version and I AM KEEPING IT! This dvd gives 5.1 a bad name, for real. <br />P/S: The flaws I am talking about are the constant drop of the audio level. It started right on the first song and it had discourage me from watching the second disc. This is something I have never heard on the laser disc version. Don't believe the hype!!!
B00005JOQS|4.0|If you liked Christopher Reeve as Superman, then chances are that you won't mind Brandon Routh. His acting is in the same style of Reeve, and he resembles him too. Though he may not be as good an actor as Reeve was, he gets the job done. Kate Bosworth gets the job done as Lois Lane, and the story has some interesting plot twists. Kevin Spacy is an almost perfect Lex Luthor.
B00005JP4U|1.0|Isn't this the guy who said he invented the internet? Nobody ever seems to question the \\"truths\\" these idiots come up with.

B0007ZEO4G|5.0|When DP released In Rock there was such a rush of energy, a pure adrenaline flow, in the recordings it was no surprise to learn that the band had changed two members and were eager to explore new ideas. Over the next three studio albums that sound and energy would culminate in Machine Head and trickle over to Who Do We Think We Are. But by then tensions between members and a general feeling of creative stagnation were giving everyone the impression that a change was needed. Two band members out and two new members in, once again DP have changed their approach, their sound, their style, and sound like everyone just got a shot of jumpy juice. The album rocks with rejuevination. The old members (Blackmore, Lord and Paice) contribute with heightened enthusiasm and the new members (Coverdale and Hughes) are phenomenal, giving DP a more funky, bluesy feel. Sail Away is an awesome cross between hard rock and funk. Burn practically burns the speakers. Lay Down Stay Down and Might Just Take Your Life are among the best tracks with Coverdale and Hughes. Blackmore gets credit for soul on Mistreated and Coverdale introduces his breathy bedroom inhales and sighs before and after belting out the words. Paice is charged to the max with creativity on Burn and You Fool No One. Blackmore sounds enthused throughout the album. The combination of Coverdale's and Hughes's vocals is amazing. Lord still contributes with classic-inspired solos. This is one brilliant album!
1594200823|5.0|I had no idea what I was getting into when I bought his book. Rest assured you'll lose your stomach within the first 100 pages. Saddness is overwheming when you realize not only corprate america doesn't care what we eat, but neither does our government, all in the name of making cheap and unhealthy food. The ramifications are horrible enough if they just ended with our health, but they spill over into the enviorment, and how we are going to mutate the very animals we depend on. I am ready to hop off this crazy train and feel anyone who reads this will follow suit. As Pollan says we need to vote with our spending dollars.
B000002L1L|4.0|First there was Perfect Strangers, the monstrous return of Mark II in the 80s and a very impressive piece of work. Then came the more commercial sounding House of Blue Light. Gillan was out and Joe Lynn Turner in for the even more commercial sounding Slaves and Masters. Was Deep Purple trying to cash in on the 80s synth-pop hard rock? Gillan returned for the last album Mark II would do. What was the album going to be like?    Surprisingly, this album rocks. It should have been the follow-up to Perfect Strangers. The album not only leans more towards good ol' hard rock with a modern sound (not to be confused with overly produced commercial sound), but it occassionally dips into really heavy metal. The opening of the title track could have come from a European metal band easily, and some parts of A Twist in the Tale sound like speed metal. Gillan's screaming is incredible. At first, I picked up on three tracks that I liked but now I am enjoying most of the album. Only Solitaire and One Man's Meat have failed to grab me so far. As a heavy metal album or hard rock album it's alright (with rising intonation); as a Deep Purple album it is rather impressive. Bravo to Mark II for their grand finish.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|It is discouraging to read some of these reviews because they miss the point of PJ entirely. Knowing and apperciating PJ is discovering the body of their work. For many their music is a journey that is personal and takes time to discover. Each album has gems that connect on a personal level, lyrics that touch the soul, and tell a story. PJs music is about ourselves, our culture, our religion, our politics, our struggles and truths. Many times those connections are revealed after hearing a song several times or maybe the very first time. It is no lie that many times a single line has brought me to tears or caught in the back of my throat and those lines are found throughout their work. This album, Pearl Jam is a continuation of their story. It is powerful and should not be missed. It gives individuals, like me a voice and sense of connection to the bigger picture--That is the magic of Pearl Jam.
B000009PNY|4.0|Various Artists For The Masses <br /> <br />I just bought this album in San Francisco (July 2006) some 8 years after it first came out.  <br />As a long time fan of Depeche Mode who has admittedly not paid them very much attention in recent years I can honestly say that I have been reminded why I used to love them so much. Depeche Mode are bl**dy fantastic and this collection of tributes while not being universally wonderful is well worth a listen. As many people will not have heard this release I really wanted to review it. There are some turkeys and some Xmas crackers and be warned that I get a bit cross about the turkeys.  Afterall, this is Depeche Mode we are talking about! <br /> <br />The album kicks off with Never Let Me Down Again by the Smashing Pumpkins. If you asked most fans what their 3 favourite DM tunes were, chances are that this is one of them. It's a defining anthem and it truly rocks. The fans know how good it is. We've all been to the concerts and we've all sung our hearts out.  Well.... Wait till you hear what the `Smashing F**kwits' have done to it. It is hard to find the words to describe how wide of the mark they are in trying to capture the essence of NLMDA. I mean if you were going to try and do it any justice at all you might have a stab at keeping some of the power, emotional intensity and sheer b*ll**ks of the original. But no....    I don't know anything about the Smashing Turnips or their own music but it is my best guess from this effort that they basically get stoned, jam for a bit in an ineffectual way, put some p**s weak whiny vocals down, pop to the all night garage for some more skins, finish off the Stellas, and call it a day. I now know why I have never noticed anything the Smashing Numpties have ever done. (0 out of 10) Lets move on, as it gets a lot better from here. <br /> <br />Next up, Fly on the Windscreen cruises into town with laid back funky beats and some interesting vocal harmonies which present the tension in the song in a new way. You can nod your head to this more than the original and the dark undercurrents are maintined behind the slick groove. The vocals are more musical than DGs and they really work. It's cool and different.  A big thumbs up to God Lives Underwater.  There's nothing wrong with taking a song in a different direction, as long as you have one. (Smashing Wasters take note) (8 out of 10) <br /> <br />Enjoy The Silence by Failure doesn't deviate too much from DMs' first version apart from in the obvious, in that the guitars are in and the synths are largely out. The intro is delicate, the chorus thumps and the voice of Failures' singer (whose name I am shamefully ignorant of) resonates nicely while lacking DGs power. They've messed a bit with some of the melody in an acceptably pleasing way and it is quite ... well, enjoyable, without capturing the heartfelt passion of the original. So.. a modest success. (7 out of 10) <br /> <br />Now the Cure have got their work cut out here, as World In My Eyes is a bit of a personal favourite. The consumate Kraftwerk feel is gone but Robert Smith maintains the angst and delivers a very listenable performance. They've been a bit lazy on the drum programming, just using one loop with no real variation but the guitar riffs and howls are good which I guess is their forte. It's quite catchy and if anything a bit more accessible than the original. Rather lost its edge but overall not a bad effort. (7 out of 10) <br /> <br />Enter Dishwalla, who grind out a full throttle take on Policy Of Truth with a certain amount of welly and lots of guitar. It builds nicely throughout and ends with all guns blazing. The vocals are great and the finale sees a very musical deviation that powers it's way up to a blistering climax. How cool?.... Very. For me this is way better than the original, which I always used to find a bit dull. Can't wait to put this on in the car.  Go Dishwalla!  <br />(10 out of 10) <br /> <br />Somebody is presented byVeruca Salt and it gets a passionate workout here. The rhodes piano and cello really work, vocals are very genuine and you can get lost in this version the same way you get lost when Martin sings it.  A beautifully constructed copy of one of DMs best ballads. (8 out of 10) <br /> <br />Everything Counts by Meat Beat Manifesto is a bit of let down. It's a little hard to see where the creativity went.  It didn't go into the drum programming which while being marginally better than the Cures' is a bit pedestrian. Aside from trotting out the main melody, they don't really offer anything on the melodic front either which kind of just leaves noises. I didn't like their noises. Oh yes .. the vocals. A bit pants as well. (1 out of 10) <br /> <br />Shake The Disease has a really sparse electronic feel to it with silky vocals, both courtesy of Hooverphonic. It's a very simple cover but astoundingly beautiful and totally captures the repetitive hypnotic drive of DMs version. Go Hooverphonic! (9 out of 10) <br />    <br />Locust's Master And Servant has a surreal The Devine Comedy meets light jazz feel to it which puts it just above elevator muzak. This makes it slightly interesting. (2 out of 10) <br /> <br />I guess Shame is a surprise choice for a cover but hey why not. Selfs' version is quite catchy, in yer face and fun. Not worthy of great praise but neither was the original. (5 out of 10)  <br /> <br />With Black Celebration we are back in anthem territory. Monster Magnet throw a lot of energy into this and I really wish they hadn't. If you are going to mess with people's melody you better do it good. i.e Compliment the original. Draw it out and reframe it. Add something. Bring something to the party goddamnit! Or as MM see it... crash the party, nick the beer, p**s all over the place and do a runner.  (0 out of 10)  <br /> <br />Waiting For The Night To Fall by Rabbit In The Moon starts with sparse beats that pick up into light drum and bass (without the bass). The vocalis a bit karaoke and the whole thing goes on for way too long. (7 minutes 34 seconds too long) (1 out of 10) <br /> <br /> Appollo 440 take on I Feel You and the result appears to be a draw. The vocals don't really stand up to DGs but there is an energentic feel to the proceedings with some lively samples thrown in to the mix. It's OK (5 out of 10) <br /> <br />Gus Gus cover Monument which is an interesting choice. It's been given a far more up to date feel here while maintaining the sparse simplicity and brooding atmosphere  of the original. The production is nice but the vocals are a little bit too bronski beat for my liking.  Not a turkey and not a craker. (6 out of 10) <br /> <br />Deftones crank it up for To Have And To Hold and make a reasonable fist of it. The vocals don't quite reach the same sharp edged menace that DG gives it but the rest is all there. Screaching guitar solos and smash it all up finale. Pretty good (7 out of 10) <br /> <br />Finally we have Rammstein's Stripped which is completely awful. But let let's leave that to one side for a moment and deal with something else. It's funny as f**k. The vocal comes across as Rocky Horror Show meets Lordi (of recent EuroVision fame). This is all backed up by wannabe death metal come eurobeat. Whether they approached this cover seriously or not I don't know. I am confused and amused by it. Which is a shame  as I'd really like to hear somebody have a proper crack at it. (no idea what mark out of 10 this gets ... probably about 4 for being weird) <br /> <br />For fans who want to hear a different take on their favourite band I thoroughly recommend this collection. Half of it is indeed rubbish but that's what CD rippers and MP3 players are for. If you haven't listened to your old DM albums in a while, this will ensure that you rediscover them. While you're at it get the remastered CDs in 5.1 surround sound. They're great. <br /> <br />Chris Danson. Ashford. Middlesex
B00026WU82|5.0|I may only be a stupid 14-year-old but still I think that 'Highway 61 Revis..' is the best record in the history of music. As soon as i heard the first notes of 'Like A Rolling Stone' I knew that I'd entered a new poetical, passionate, inspirational world..a world that basically no one I knew personally had entered.. and a world that maybe I shouldnt be in. Perhaps thats one of the reasons I love Dylan so much; cos all of my friends are killing themselves with enthusiasm over some Greenday/Panic!At The Disco/My Chemical Romance album and I just stand there and think: ''You stupid, stupid children. You dont know the meaning of the word music. You haven't danced around your room in your underwear to 'From a buick 6' you haven't felt the passion drip off Dylan's beautifully disorted voice in 'Ballad of a Thin Man' (or read all of F.Scott Fitzgerald's books, just to see what the fuss is about)and you certainly havent memorised and thought about the lyrics in 'Tombstone Blues' Basically you havent lived' <br />BUY 'HIGHWAY 61 REVIS..' NOW!!! I really can't talk about it enough, it has every feeling and emotion and sound and beat and lyric you could ever wish for in an album. I probably listen to bits of it every day, and it never gets boring or old or tired, in fact, it probably gets better, because Dylan was such an abnormally good poet that all his songs cut deep and leave a mark..  <br /> <br />A bit too deep if you ask me, I had trouble sleeping the night I first heard 'Desolation Row'

B000BTC5LW|5.0|This totally blows the Wall Deluxe Edition out of the \\"water.\\"  I attended the show in San Antonio at the Alamodome.  Most PF fans would have paid anything just for the concert.  The extras such as different versions of the background video just blew me away.  This is what concert DVDs should be.  I bought mine at Best Buy and got one of those free lithograms.  I really wish I bought 2 (to get another lithogram).  I will get another copy of the DVD to keep in mint condition.............just running low on $$.

B000A59PMO|1.0|Based on an over-whelming number of reviews (185 amazon.com members gave this show a 5 star rating) I decided to buy the box set since how could such a majority fail to recognize that this show is bad. <br /> <br />Imagine how disappointed I was to discover that as the title of my review states the majority is not always right (I wouldn't want to go into the political implications of such an argument especially in democracies but the concept is very well known and accepted). <br /> <br />The show has an interesting beginning showing how the life of a girl was turned upside down because of her father's actions (against a very influential person) and how she was abandon by her surrounding best friends just because she supported her parent. <br /> <br />This concept interested me until the 4th episode that is when I discovered that the plot is unbelievably predictable going through a formula that has been done so many times by many older (and better) shows and as a result all twists can be seen a light year away (this reflected badly on the main and supporting characters since what is the fun in watching a mystery that one figures out half way through the episode). <br /> <br />This failure both in plot and script were a sign that I should stop watching and I have learned from previous experiences to follow these signs because once a show fails to grip its audience (through unpredictable and yet reasonable twists and turns) it ends up being a waste of ones time. <br /> <br />To sum things-up; <br /> <br />Those of you looking for a good mystery look else-where, but for those of you looking for teen drama then this show might be a good choice although there are many better alternatives out there.
1577314808|2.0|At the encouragement of someone who has in the past shown interest in Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand, I read The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.  While I did not consider the reading a complete waste of time, I did consider the author so profoundly wrong about so many things that I cannot honestly recommend the book.  His thesis that \\"mind identification\\" serves as the source for all strife in the world stands squarely at odds with reason as man's only means of knowing and his method of survival. <br /> <br />When I kindly informed my acquaintance of this, he replied that he agreed with Tolle's thesis of \\"mind identification\\" as the source of all evil.  He shared that he considers Objectivism and any other philosophy that assigns labels to experiences as violent because labels truncate and compartmentalize the experience of the whole, thus violating that whole into parts.  I kindly responded that in that case, I no longer had interest in conversing with him.  I added him to my block list in the chat program we used and have not talked to him since that time. <br /> <br />Much of Tolle's material draws on the teachings of the Buddha. <br /> <br />The only nice comments I can make about the book regard the author's challenge to the reader to remain focused on the present moment rather than obsess with a fictional salvation in the future.  When a person says, \\"When I do _____, I will be happy,\\" it interferes with his enjoyment of the now.  This does not mean a fall into whim worship.  It does mean sharpening the conscious awareness of the now so that you can gain full enjoyment of it before it becomes then.

B00005J6T1|4.0|This is Madonna's first album released way back in 1983, before she became the Queen of pop music. It contained 3 huge pop hits, and was certified platinum by the end of 1984. It eventually became an amazing 5x platinum. If you like cute dance pop music, this is an album for you, but don't expect anything really thought-provoking on this record. You will see with her next record the musical icon she became. <br />Lucky Star- This was a huge hit going to #4 on the Billboard hot 100. However, the lyrics are very cheesey and truthfully the song goes on for way too long. But it is fun to dance to. <br />Borderline- Madonna's first song to hit the top 10 on the hot 100 and rightfully so. This song is incredibly fun and true classic.  <br />Burning Up- Madonna's second single which had somewhat of a rocky edge. This is a great and fun song. It's one of this album's best. <br />I know It- This song is rather annoying to me and didn't age well at all. <br />Holiday- The immortal song. It was Madonna's first song to hit the hot 100, reaching #16. It is an amazing song which hasn't dated one bit since 1983. It is one of my all-time favorite songs. I don't know what it is. No matter how simple the song is, there's something about it you can't help but love. <br />Think of Me- This is a good dance track and it's fun to hear Madge demmand \\"You better think of me!\\" <br />Physical Attraction- I don't really like it. The lyrics are repetative and annoying. Like \\"I know It\\", it did not age well. It always runs on for far too long. <br />Everybody- Madonna's first single from 1982. It's very fun to listen to and was Madge's introduction to the world. My favorite part of the song is the little techno noises played throughout.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is a decent album, but something about seems.. incomplete. Her next album, Like A Virgin was much better in my opinion.
B000002JKA|4.0|<br />I wish I could give this 4.5 stars.  While not quite the juggernaut that I&W was, Awake is still an awesome slab of progressive metal/rock.  The brilliant 'Innocence Faded', the epic 'Voices', the heavy as hell 'The Mirror', the beautiful 'Lifting Shadows off a Dream' and the wierdly haunting 'Space Dye Vest' are the highlights here and are among DT's best music. <br /> <br />About the only track that doesn't do much for me is '6:00'.  Odd that this would be the first track, but when the rest of the record is as amazing as it is, it's easily overlooked.  Petrucci and Portnoy continue to amaze throughout and James is in fine voice as well.
0743243315|4.0|BRICK LANE by Monica Ali <br />July 15, 2006 <br /> <br />Rating ****   <br /> <br />Short-listed for the Booker Award, BRICK LANE is the story of a woman originally from Bangladesh, who is sent to London to marry an older man. Her younger sister had just ran away with a man not approved by her parents. A love match is what they call it, but Nazneen is the good daughter, not as beautiful as her sister Hasina, and she feels it is her good fortune to be matched with a man such as Chanu.  <br /> <br />Chanu is her new husband, older by about twenty years. He's not handsome, but he's a good man and treats her kindly. As time passes, Nazneen reflects on her life, her current role as wife and mother as well as her childhood in Bangladesh. She's not really happy, but she does what is expected of her.  <br /> <br />The people she meets in her new homeland are varied. There is her soon-to-be new best friend Razia, who is very butch and aggressive, but it is being away from their homeland that makes her this way, one is apt to believe. There's Mrs. Islam, a very large woman who intimidates many.  <br /> <br />And then there is Dr Azad, who becomes a regular guest at their home for dinner. Nazneen can't figure out why her husband (a man who seems to think he knows it all, but doesn't seem to be able to hold down a job despite all his certificates and degrees) and this doctor are even friends, and what do they see in each other? This becomes a running theme in the novel, as she watches the two of them \\"talk\\" and interact with one another throughout the years.  <br /> <br />Then she meets Karim, who brings her work (sewing) as well as his world as he sees it, into her life and opens up Nazneen's eyes and heart and passions, as she's never felt before.  <br /> <br />I wasn't sure what to think of BRICK LANE. Monica Ali does a great job with telling her tale, and she is very descriptive and lyrical in her writing. The book is filled with a lot of reflection, although the story isconstantly moving, with Nazneen's memories from the past, letters from Hasina, and action in the present. I think my problem was I did not quite bond with the characters, and I always felt I was more of an observer than a participant. It is definitely a book that did deserve all the accolades it received when it came out a few years ago. However, as a whole, the book didn't touch me the way I had hoped it would.
B000002JPA|5.0|<br />Images and Words by Dream Theater; easily the best record of the 1990's and undoubtedly DT's finest moment.  Strong songs, terrific production, phenomenal musicianship and singing, Images and Words rates up there with the best metal/rock records ever.  Not exagerating one bit.  If you're a rock fan give this a listen, you'll see what all the fuss is about.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Wow.  Both discs are good from start to finish, and show a range of music.
B000E0W24S|3.0|These performances are justly famous for the fervor of the playing and conducting.  They are riveting on a certain level.  They are considered to be examples of an authentically Russian style of Tchaikovsky interpretation. But what I hear is the aural equivalent of 1960's Soviet militarism.  True, a nearly hysterical dynamism can be considered an element of Tchaikovsky's music.  But he was also criticized by Russian critics for being too \\"European\\" and effete.  The lyrical and dance-oriented elements of these symphonies are totally neglected in these performances.  The beautiful melodies and waltzes go for nothing here.  An aggressive and propulsive approach dominates. Yet these performances are considered landmarks in the history of recorded Tchaikovsky and should be heard.<br /><br />But for more musically sophisticated and yet dramatic performances of these symphonies, I recommend Monteux, Haitink, Rostropovich and strangely enough, Klemperer.
1932907009|5.0|Not only is this book an enjoyable read, it is also incredibly informative and helpful to screenwriters of all types.  Mr. Snyder has had great success in Hollywood and has chosen to pass on what he has learned to the rest of us. The techniques described in Save the Cat! will make any writer see what works and what doesn't in his/her story and (hopefully) get them that much closer to a sale.  This book is a must-have on your shelf.
0060512806|3.0|Three strands of plot across time and space progress in parallel - I presume they meet up somewhere down the road.  Don't know since I gave it up at around page 200.    Too bad, seems like there is a good story in there, but couldn't wade through all the nerdiness - the stylized narrative, the tech/math trivia, verbose descriptives.    The book was published in '99, and perhaps it's a reflection of the time - the crest of dot com excess on the eve of bust.  It feels adolescent and overambitious.      Still, you may enjoy the book if you are into the genre and have the requisite patience.
0679735909|5.0|This book is one-of-kind: fiercely intelligent, playfully readable, uncompromisingly intellectual, technically dazzling and more. Byatt succedes in being able to so deftly straddle that razor-sharp boundary between writing a good book and making great literature that it almost makes me feel sorry for most other writers. The language snaps, the story strides confidently along, the characters develop in such a way that they seem to bloom organically rather than to be creations of a sing(u)le/ar mind and the plot has just enough twists, turns and surprises to make it an unlikely page-turner. Extra praise should be lain for Byatt's ability to perfectly summon Victorian poetic and epistolic forms and make them unite seamlessly with the book's wider, Postmodernist tone and philosophy. Of course, no book is without its faults, and this one probably has more than I would like to admit, but generally I found this to be an amazing book that I would recommend without hesitation.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First off let me just say that I am NOT an avid fan of Sci Fi whatsoever but Firefly is different! Its rich mix of characters is infused with the perfect amount of comedy, drama and action to allow me CONFIDENTLY say \\"You will LOVE this series!\\" Every person I have shown just one episode of the DVD to has become hooked! AND the great news is that the Sci Fi channel will now be playing the Firefly episodes so even if you HATE science fiction I seriously urge you to at least watch just one of the episodes on Sci Fi and I swear you will love it!  <br /> <br />What makes Firefly so unique from other Sci Fi shows, for example Star Trek, is that Firefly is very down to earth and relatable. The characters are engaging and you offer a sincere connection with the audience because the problems they face can easily be connected to life in our world today. Unlike other Sci Fi shows, where the talk is very robotic and all about quantum physics and aliens - Firefly created this show where a group of characteres from all walks of like are thrown together and the focus is on their interactions (which are generally hilarious!) and the struggles they face on a daily basis - such as fighting against a  controlling regime and just trying to go their own, find work and make a living, by their own terms and no one elses. I must say, this is my favorite show of all time! <br /> <br />I must also comment on how APPALLED I am at Fox! The network OBVIOUSLY threw a ton of money into the creation and production of the show - apparent by the outstanding graphics that match today's standards - but canceled the show after not even airing the whole season! I am angry with Fox not solely because they canceled the show but because it is their own fault Firefly wasn't more of an intial success...before I saw Serenity (the movie based on the episodes of Firefly) I had never even heard of Firefly and apparently hardly anyone else had either! This is because Fox stupidly threw tons of money into the creation of a PHENOMENAL show but failed to advertise it whatsoever! This is what upsets me but enough of my rant!  <br /> <br />Bottom line: I guarantee you will love Firefly and after you see it PLEASE help in the crusade to bring the show alive again by contributing to the FireFly online fanbase! Show your support and help BRING FIREFLY BACK TO LIFE!!  <br /> <br />ENJOY!!
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I have to say this movie was one of my favorites. The courtroom drama made it really interesting and i liked the fact how it flashed back to what happened with Emily. This movie reminded me a lot of \\"The Exorcist\\" only it was more intense i thought. It gives you goosebumps especially knowing it was based on a true story. When i saw this movie i liked it so much that i bought it on DVD! My whole family watched it and they agreed it was one of the best they've seen. I have to say this movie would be scary to watch right before bed alone! If you liked \\"the Exorcist\\" and \\"Dominion\\", you'll like this!
B00005BJ2O|1.0|I loved the movie; I hate the CD. Sadly, the music without the movie just doesn't cut it. Some of the songs don't even sound the same and there are some extra songs added in. I have wanted to order this CD forever and finally got around to doing it recently. I just lisetened to it for the first and last time. It will go out at my next garage sale. What a waste of money.
B00070Q8DQ|3.0|Behemoth is a very talented band that is a great example of melodic death metal. Even though I believe most fans of the genere will like this album, there are two things that get on my nerves. First off, the overlapping of the vocals. You can tell that the vocals are run through some sort of harmonizer or they were mixed together as overlapped. This is actually really irriatating, because it makes the vocals sound \\"fake\\" and actually seems to drown out the music. The second problem I have is that in some parts behemoth tend to get a bit sloppy, sometimes to sloppy, and that seems to cramp their style of melody, so to speak. I think if they they lose the edge or whatever they are doing on vocal, behemoth will be so much better. ENJOY
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This show has a set of amazingly intense actors.  They are 100% believable.  The story arcs are ingenious and the plots within the plot bring new spins with every episode.  The relationship between the brothers is challenged and strengthened as one episode goes to another.  The urban legends explored in each show are entertaining and brings new life to old stories.  They have many legends that people have never heard of before, and some legends that are infamous.  This mix keeps the show interesting and addictive.
0312199066|5.0|Haveing read all of the books written by the hero's themselves, I was reluctant to purchase \\"Last Man on the Moon\\". Read one ...read 'em all. Certainly not so. This book totally captured me and brought me way beyond my understanding of space flight, space walks, and everything it really takes to be a human being of this caliber. Commander Cernan's captivating descriptions of being in space and on the moon as well as being inches away from death, puts you as close as you can be to the real thing. Dont expect anything sugar coated. Gene Cernan has lived the dream we all dream of, paying with great personal sacrifice. He is a true leader of \\"mankind\\". His book conveys the asonishing piercing of the basic \\"fabric of life\\", a disease that he or his fellow moon walkers have \\"never been able to repair.\\" Life changing read!! <br />Dont miss this one!!!
B000002UA0|5.0|In 1967, two albums changed the face of rock forever.  Both psychedelic records, one of them of course was The Beatles', Sgt Pepper, and the other was Pink Floyd's debut, The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.  Though they both were the highpoints of the psychedelic era, they differed as much as night and day as far as their content.  A far more underground and avant-garde album \\"Piper\\" was also considerably more dark and bizarre than Sgt Pepper.  More whimsical and ultimately more druggy, \\"Piper\\" rocked harder and was enticed more by classical and jazz influences. In fact it was one of the official starting points for the Progressive rock genre. <br /> <br />Then frontman Syd Barret, who as of July 7, 2006 is no longer with us, pioneered avant-garde techniques on the electric guitar which included massive distortion and reverb and other tricks such as sliding steel balls up and down the strings.  Keyboardist Rick Wright was also a major factor in the line up; producing eerie keyboard licks and out of this world texures with his instrument.  The songwriting was vastly different from latter day Pink Floyd.  Most of the songs had a very noticeable British whimsical flavor to them.  Many of the songs were pure nonsense stories about space travel, fairy tale creatures, as well as everyday things processed through the machine of an LSD trip.  There's Progressive Pop/Rock such as \\"Astronomy Domine\\", psychedelic folk such as \\"The Gnome\\", and intrumental freak-out jams such as the infamous \\"Interstellar overdrive\\" which goes on for nine minutes with the band members making every possible noise with their instruments. <br /> <br />Syd Barret wrote or at least co-wrote almost every composition here.  Bassist Roger Waters wrote one song but it's in the same league as the Barret songs.  After the album was released Barret, through a combination of mental illness and heavy LSD use broke down and was forced to leave the band.  He released two solo albums before withdrawing from the world altogether.  Spending decades in recluse he eventually died of a diabetes illness in 2006, just a couple days before this review was written.  After he had left the group, David Gilmour, a really good but more traditional guitarist, entered the line up.  Many of Pink Floyd's later albums such as, Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here, explicitly reference mental illness.  Many sources in fact explain that, Wish You Were Here and The Wall, were complete tributes To Barret.  <br /> <br />The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, was a turning point in rock-n-roll just as much as Sgt. Pepper was.  It allowed the classical and jazz influences as well as the extended lengh compositions of Progressive Rock to florish in the next decade.  Though psychedelic rock died, its memories and, of course, its music did not.  Albums like this proved once and for all that rock was an art form and not just juvenile noise.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Concert DVDs are truly wonderful. For about the same price as a CD, you get the audio and video from a concert for a mere fraction of what a ticket to the show would have cost you. All concert DVDs are not created equal, and \\"Pulse\\" is far from the best or the worst one that I've seen. It is, however, the worst one that I've seen from a band of Pink Floyd's stature. There has been a lot of talk about the fact that the concert was videotaped, and this is certainly a problem. Even on my 36-inch television, the poor quality is evident. The video quality is better than a VHS tape, but not as good as the videotape material from, say, the Led Zepplin DVD, which was taped over 15 years earlier. The sound on \\"Pulse\\" is better than the video, but it is not \\"state of the art,\\" at least not at the 480 bps bit rate. There is a higher quality sound option on the menu; the 640 bps bit rate is new to me. I've never seen it before and it didn't work on my 4 year-old Pioneer 47A DVD player.(There is a disclaimer where no guarantee is made that the feature will work on \\"earlier\\" machines.) There is no DTS sound, which, in my experience, usually works well with music and sounds better than Dolby Digital. I'd be curious to hear from anyone who was able to listen to the concert at the higher resolution.    \\"Pompeii,\\" a Pink Floyd concert film released 22 years before the \\"Pulse\\" performance, is a better overall experience than \\"Pulse.\\"  For that matter, so is David Gilmour's DVD. So is Roger Waters' DVD. Sure, Pink Floyd is great, and the performance of Dark Side of the Moon live is well worth the purchase price of \\"Pulse.\\" But compared to other Floyd material available on DVD, it is incredibly mediocre, and that is just a shame. I can recommend this DVD, but only if your expectations are not too high. Otherwise, you will be disappointed.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|Being a huge \\"Everwood\\" fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this set. I had not seen all of the early episodes. That is what prompted the purchase. The extras were great!

B00008973A|1.0|A Chorus Line as mis-directed by Richard Attenborough is such a rotten movie the stench actually permeated throughout the movie theater. Who in all that's holy ever thought this stuffed shirt had even a scintilla of comprehension and knowledge about musical theater and the \\"gypsies\\" who troll through audition after audition hoping for a chance to be part of the dancing chorus of a Broadway show? And these same geniuses hired Michael Douglas to play a choreographer. Pee-Wee Herman would even have been a better choice than Douglas who spent his scenes at a table looking either bored or constipated.    The musical numbers weren't even thought through so that's why one number \\"I Can Do That\\" starts then cuts to Cassie riding to the audition in a cab-a couple more seconds of the ongoing number, then Cassie in the cab again-another quick cut to the number, Cassie at the stage door, then back to the stage for the last three notes of the routine. I can just imagine the actor performing that number must have blubbered like a baby when he saw the finished movie.    And what happened to \\"What I Did For Love\\" was loathsome and appalling and Mr Attenborough never never never had an idea what the song was about or what it meant and actually filmed it as a love song and had the actress who tried to play Cassie and Douglas making goo-goo eyes at each other in flashbacks.    the finale \\"One\\" with about 50 chorus boys and girls in the gold lame suits at least looked great and is the sole reason for the one-star rating.
0060934913|2.0|Bourdain thinks he's a bad*ss because he did a lot of drugs and eventually succeeded as a chef. He's not. This Vassar-educated \\"rebel\\" comes off as a loudmouthed jerk a lot of the time--which makes for entertaining reading...except when he makes one of his numerous homophobic remarks. He claims to have no trouble with gays, even writes nicely about some gay owners he used to work for, but he also seems to have discomfort with \\"sensitive\\" types he has known and rips on a gay waiter who dared to sue him--making a disgusting remark about microbes related to what he assumes to be the waiter's personal practices.  <br /> <br />Doth the man protest too much?
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|This is a wonderful CD, particularly for new Moms looking for music that celebrates and focuses on their new little one. I nurse and rock my baby to it regularly.

0451169514|5.0|The novel It by Stephen King took my mind back to days of youth gone by on a living nightmare roller coaster. On this ride, I was actually taken back to my own Private Idaho; smells, dirt, rocks, rain, friends, and hanging out late at night are just a few things he describes in such a way that I truly could vision me as a character. No book ever taken me on a trip as such, but this book will live on in me as one of the best books ever written. I first read the book in high school; and found it very hard to put down. I have read It many times since then and every time the journey just gets better and again...i am taken back just like before. Not many books have that kind of effect on a reader. The best It reading session was when a group of friends would gather out on the sidewalk of my street late at night and I would read out loud the book and we would let our imaginations run and actually anticipate the next night and the next chapter. This is definately one novel i say not only holds a readers mind hostage; it defines fear and the minds ability to play tricks but tricks aren't just for kids anymore. The mind realized long ago that the kid never truly dies no matter how hard the kid may try to be hid in an adult form; stephen king enters your mind thru it ..and Tag...your it and trust me, there is no tag backs.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|What a great DVD set. Especially considering that it was recorded in 1994 when the audio/visual technology was still far from the high def/digital audio available today. The picture quality is crystal clear, and the audio has been enhanced to provide you with two Dolby 5.1 choices (448kbps & 640kbps). The sound is incredible, especially with the 640 option. A stereo option is also available if you don't have a Surround system.<br /><br />Enough of the technicalities...the performance was spectacular. David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright were all perfect. 8 others joined the band, including Guy Pratt who filled in the gaping duet hole for Roger Waters in Run Like Hell.<br /><br />Disk one, or should I say Pulse One, features Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Learning to Fly, High Hopes, Take It Back, Coming Back to Life, Sorrow, Keep Talking, Another Brick in the Wall (part 2), and One of These Days.<br /><br />Pulse Two is The Dark Side of the Moon disk. You get: Speak to Me, Breathe in the Air, On the Run, Time, The Great Gig in the Sky, Money, Us and Them, Any Colour You Like, Brain Damage, Eclipse, Wish You Were Here, Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell.<br /><br />There are tons of bonuses that include screen films, Bootlegging the Bootleggers and other shorts...2 hours of bonus material in total.<br /><br />Everything is here that a Pink Floyd fan could want...except Roger Waters. What a shame that whole thing is. How I wish...how I wish you were here.<br /><br />But rest assured that this is an absolutely amazing and fulfilling show. No expense was spared on the theatrics either. Very cool lights, video and stage. And everything from the performance to the stage show is captured expertly...especially the performance. The video never jumps around before you have a chance to take the shot in; you feel like you're sitting in the front row...not watching a DVD.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest Pink Floyd fan out there. I don't have all their albums; I have the studio versions of the recordings that any rock fan has. But let me just say that I was blown away by this DVD release.<br /><br />It goes without saying that true Pink Floyd fans don't need to be told to add this upgrade to DVD from video to their collection.

B00003CXB4|5.0|The greatest disney movie ever! (from most guys point of view)
B000AYEL6U|4.0|Very interesting story with good characters. Good subject matter.  The voice of the mother was sometimes too quiet and it was difficult to understand her at times but, all in all, not enough to take away from the stories interest and enjoyment. This story was interesting to me from a historical stand point (men able to earn their wealth through industry), and from a social standpoint (the vast differences between southern and northern culture).  Very believable acting for the most part.
B00005JLZN|4.0|Don't read this if you haven't seen yet! <br /> <br />My summary is that it seems the plan of our three anti death penalty protagonists' (Spacey, Linney, and Craven) was this: <br /> <br />To create a situation where the CP system is discredited by sending an innocent man (Spacey) to death row, and using the neutral character (Winslet), along with some carefully released videotapes, to exonerate him at the last moment. I do not believe it was his intention to die for the cause, it's just that the darn car broke down!  <br /> <br />The way the film unfolds is that until the very end, we think the cowboy (Craven) did it, Spacey was incorrectly put to death, and the film is anti CP. Ah, now the surprise ending, Spacey was involved, so the system worked...pro CP, right? Not really...this was more of a mercy killing due to Linney's illness, not first degree murder. <br /> <br />The truth is that the film is neither, it is merely illustrating that this is not a black and white issue, and that each case has it's own set of unique circumstances. I think it's a great film which has a unique story, great performances, holds your interest, and makes you think. It is a little unbelievable as many have said, but what movie isn't? <br /> <br />I suppose 'Pirates of the Caribbean' is more believable!
B00005JOQS|4.0|Overall, I loved this movie. I took away a 1/2 star because of the uncharacteristic Superman plot elements. (I don't want to spoil the plot and thus I won't share them). I took away another 1/2 star because I didn't like how Superman/Lois's relationship came off. Lois was a bit too frigid/standoffish, while Superman was a little too accepting of it.  <br /> <br />(1) I love the musical score. It still gives me chills. <br />(2) I love the special effects and I am not a videophile. <br />(3) I loved the story as a whole and thought the pacing was perfect. <br />(4) I loved Routh as Superman/Clark. I am a huge Superman fan and was apprehensive about him filling Reeve's shoes, but he did a great job.  <br /> <br />I've seen this movie twice and plan on seeing it at least a third. So far the second time was even better than the first. I look forward to the sequel.
B00009WNVV|5.0|This is a fantastic musical. From the beautifully designed sets, to the period costumes, to the show-stopping song and dance numbers, it will simply razzle-dazzle the viewer. The director and his singing and dancing troupe of stars simply pull out all the stops in this brilliantly executed musical.<br /><br />The film, which provides a cynical and satirical look at fame and fortune, centers in nineteen twenties Chicago around two murderesses, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger). Velma, who together with her sister, was a dance hall success, killed her husband and her sister when she caught them together en flagrante delicto. True to the maxim, however, that the show must go on, she goes on stage immediately after dispatching the two lovers, where she is promptly arrested.<br /><br />Roxie Hart, an admirer of Velma Kelly, is married to Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), a good-hearted, regular Joe, but she longs for tabloid fame and fortune. She begins to have an affair with a man who promises that he could get her a stage gig only to find that he lied just to get her in bed. So, she ends up killing him. Her long suffering husband stands by his little woman as she is trundled off to jail to await trial. There, she meets her idol, Velma Kelly, who finds her hero-worship annoying.<br /><br />In the jail, Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton (Queen Latifah) reigns supreme over the inmates, accepting bribes for favors. Velma Kelly, represented by star defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), is in tabloid heaven. Roxie Hart, longing to be in tabloid heaven as well, gets her husband to retain Billy Flynn on her behalf. Before she knows it, she, too, is in tabloid heaven, playing the media like a violin.<br /><br />The legal profession also gets a cynical slap in the guise of the slimy, fast talking Billy Flynn, who looks for the best selling point rather than for the truth. He understands the thirst of the media for the perfect sound-bite and he gives it to them. Guilty or not guilty, it doesn't matter. What matters to him, as a hired mouthpiece, is the media mileage he can get for his client, as well as for himself. To that end, he is the ventriloquist, and his client is no more than his dummy.<br /><br />The razzle-dazzle musical numbers move the story along. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrific, looking impossibly beautiful and showing off her musical theatre background to great advantage with \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"Cell Block Tango\\". Queen Latifah is outstanding as the sly and voracious Mama Morton, who goes whichever way the wind is blowing. She also has a show-stopping musical number, \\"When You're Good To Mama\\" that is simply memorable. Renee Zellweger, though not a professional singer or dancer, shows that she can sing and dance with the best of them.<br /><br />The men also shine in this musical. John C. Reilly, as Roxie's long-suffering husband, also has a terrific number, \\"Mister Cellophane\\", that is truly heart rending and poignant, as well as metaphoric. Richard Gere gamely rises to the occasion in his first musical, making the slick Billy Flynn character an integral part of the film with his \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" number and his tap dancing.<br /><br />I love this top notch, clever film, finding it hugely entertaining. It deserves every one of its six Academy Awards, including that for \\"Best Picture\\". Director Rob Marshall deserves kudos for this brilliantly directed, seamlessly edited, musical masterpiece. While it is a fairly faithful screen adaptation of Bob Fosse's Broadway musical, it has Rob Marshall's contemporary imprimatur on it. It is a film of which he can be justly proud. Bravo!hem.

1400049628|5.0|I bought every word of this. For about two weeks after I finished the book, I went around telling my friends and family members about how we should stack up on food, burn our stairs, and travel by bicycle, and all this many, many years from age twelve...<br /><br />The Zombie Survival Guide was incredible. It was arresting and, if not taken at all seriously, hilarious. There was some genuinely good advice and Brooks's tone is so persuasive that, like I said, I was purchased, hook, line, and sinker. I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever preferred, been fascinated by, or wanted to know more about the other, other dead meat.
6305327084|3.0|Giving this movie three stars may be overrating it a bit.  It is pretty interesting but the conclusions are deadly.  We are left with the moral that a young man has to give up his dreams, give up on love, and settle for someone he rates a seven and a half, and that is what it means to grow up and be a man.<br /><br />One character falls for a 13 year old girl, but ends up giving her up and returning to his lukewarm buddy, who he is definitely not in love with.  The 13 year old girl is a darling, played by Natalie Portman.  She is the star of this movie as far as I'm concerned.  Some 13 year old girls are very advanced for their age.  She is the only interesting girl in the entire movie.<br /><br />Another character, an absolute moron, has a girlfriend who has been waiting years for him to propose, but instead he dreams of supermodels and undervalues the girl he has.<br /><br />Another guy is having an affair with his married ex-sweetheart but has a different girl as his girlfriend, one who is in love with him.<br /><br />In all three cases, the guys end up with the girls they aren't wild about, and give up on their dreams.  I suppose there is something very realistic in all that.  Doesn't that happen to a lot of us?  Still, it's a downer to see.  You get the impression that all these people would be better off dead.  The guys will never be happy settling for a life that doesn't really interest them, and the girls will eventually get bored and start cheating, because they aren't loved, and so what if they were, they'd still get bored and start cheating.<br /><br />There are no happy couples in this movie, and the portrait it paints of American couples is a depressing one.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The first Matrix Movie is my favorite movie of all time. So I was highly anticipating the sequels, which were delayed numerous times and just kept getting stalled. When i finally started watching The Matrix Reloaded after the first 15 minutes i new something was different. For some reason everything was more asian influenced. Instead of numbers, asian symbols, instead of leather jackets on Neo, asian robe/jacket, and instead of hard gritty fighting, it was more of a soft and slow style. I didnt really care for the changes but as long as the movie was decent i wouldnt mind. It was around the what seemed long an hour long dance scene i realized that this movie was nothing like its predecessor and i was extremely dissapointed. After Watching that movie I still wanted to see the next one, Matrix Revolutions, because i had already scene the first two and nothing could possibly be worse than this sequal.Five months later....i was proven wrong
B00002SWEM|5.0|I rented this movie on DVD having little knowlege about the subject matter other than it was an award winning documentary. Essentially, for me, it was an introduction to a new type of music. Many years ago in junior high school in a small town in the Rockies my Spanish teacher was a newly arrived Cuban immigrant. He was an excellent teacher and that memory made me curious about this movie. This gathering of semi-retired musicians still has so much soul and if you don't get goose bumps at least once you are probably tone deaf. Unfortunately, I have seen only the Japanese edition here in Japan which has no English subtitles for my Spanish which has grown rusty. Although I can read Japanese subtitles I would prefer English ones for the lyrics.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|After watching this movie i wasn't as dissapointed as i when i saw the Matrix Reloaded, because i wasn't expecting much better. I was surprised that this movie is actually a little worse than the one before it. To me their wasn't even much fighting in this movie. To me there was just guys in robot suits, screaming, shooting aimlessly upwards. When watching the two sequeals to the Matrix we forget how great a movie the first one was. It was groundbreaking and very entertaining. Somehow the sequels turned into something that belongs on the Sci Fi channel and not on the big screen. The two sequeals contained nothing but cheap acting that was overdramatic and it seemed like everyone was trying to hard. Some parts of these sequals I thought I was watching Star Trek. After watching these sequals i think it is better if we pretend that these were never created or were not realated in any way to the first Matrix. Seeing how terrible the sequals are, that should not be a hard task.
B000FVBLEI|4.0|All That Remains' second release, 2004's \\"This Darkened Heart,\\" should have been their breakthrough. But it wasn't. So, perhaps in an attempt to cross over into the mainstream finally, the band added a substantial amount of more melody to their follow up, \\"The Fall Of Ideals.\\" But, even though it's up for debate whether All That Remains wanted to expand their fanbase or just expand their sound (and not make a \\"This Darkened Heart\\" rehash), there's almost no denying that \\"The Fall Of Ideals\\" is a changed sound.<br /><br />There are positive and negative aspects of this newfound melody. On the plus side, there are quite a few more catchy, memorable, and infectious choruses. But, since about every song has a cleanly sung refrain, ATR now sound quite a bit less identifiable and more like an Atreyu, Caliban, or Killswitch Engage clone (it's only a coincidence that KsE guitarist Adam D. produced this disc, though.) But there are ample aggressive guitar riffs and raging yells on here to prevent All That Remains from completely redefining their sound. And, to their credit, this band is capable of adding melody to their metal without having to haul out the acoustic guitars for a cliche interlude or album closer.<br /><br />\\"This Calling\\" is a good example of these songs' structure: a heavy intro with long, almost emo-like screams leading into the verses (consisting of rapid, punching riffs, hard-hitting drums and throaty yells), segueing into a soft, gentle chorus with limpid singing, and concluding with a mini guitar solo. This is a good song which comes together well, and the pleasant-sounding chorus serves as a nice break from the throaty yells. But after listening to this formula again for another five--or so--tracks, the listener longs for something to break up the repetition, because the songs have become kind of predictable. But, fortunately, there are a few songs which are completely heavy: the fast, pounding \\"We Stand,\\" the scorchers \\"Six\\" and \\"Become The Catalyst\\" (which have fiery, chug and churn, dual guitar leads and almost thunderous rhythms), and the quick, bruising tenth track, \\"Empty Inside,\\" are all full-on metal assaults without any vocal pleasantries. And there's a lot of heavy stuff to go around, here, so no song ever has too much melody. Plus, the whole album is less than forty minutes long, so it doesn't overstay its welcome and/or become repetitious to the point of being intolerable.<br /><br />So you could call this disc somewhat formulaic, but if you take every song individually, the formula works very well, so why tamper with it? All in all, \\"The Fall Of Ideals\\" does stick out in this band's discography, but it isn't very identifiable in this genre. But even though it won't go down in history as a modern metal landmark which knocks down any walls, and it won't be heralded as the album which put All That Remains in the same league as, say, Shadows Fall, any metalcore fan (or ATR fan) would tell you it still makes for a good, mostly satisfying listen.st\\" (which have fiery, chug and churn, dual guitar leads and almost thunderous rhythms), and the quick, bruising tenth track, \\"Empty Inside,\\" are all full-on metal assaults without any vocal pleasantries.

B00003CXXP|1.0|This film was a disappointment to me! <br /> <br />A I. Artificial Intelligence is the story of a robot boy named David who loves his human mother so much that he wants to be turned into a human boy like Pinocchio.  Both Haley Joel Osment (David) and Jude Law (Gigolo Joe) gave excellent performances. It's not their fault that the story was not worth the work that they put into their roles. The other character that I should mention was \\"Teddy\\" a robot bear who seemed smarter and more compassionate than the humans in the story. I thought that the so called \\"humans\\" were a miserable group who had lost their humanity.  <br /> <br />This movie was like a bad nightmare and I can hardly believe that Spielberg made this film.  <br /> <br /> <br />

B000058983|5.0|I have little to add to what's already been written about this incredible record. At a time when \\"concept albums\\" were at a premium Love recorded what I consider the ultimate. It's flows seamlessly, with haunting and evocative songs and instrumentation. Nothin has dated over the years. Back then a line like \\"the snot has caked against my pants it has turned into crystal\\" was mindblowing. Still pretty darn visual now. I had the good fortune of seeing Arthur Lee and Love play live last year in NYC at Town Hall, a pretty small venue. Imagine my surprise when Arthur Lee was downstairs signing CDs. He was extremely gracious as I blithered thanks for his music. The shaman onstage, who seemed no older than 30 and more energetic than half that, is in fact a petite, slender, somewhat frail man. Onstage, he is a lion. Given his recent bout with leukemia, he needs our prayers and good wishes. If you are reading these 100+ plus reviews, and are debating whether or not to buy \\"Forever Changes\\" all I can say is: what's stopping you? \\"Forever Changes\\" is timeless.
B0009QZ4CE|4.0|. . . and other contexts, also, but this is largely the contemplative side of Hammill & Co., kind of picking up the pieces after the manic excesses that brought them to their peak on _Pawn Hearts_ (which would constitute anyones peak!).  There are no real schizophrenic meltdowns like on their previous masterpiece, more a slow existential burn, that taken on its own virtues is very satisfying.  It's just nowhere near as good as _Pawn Hearts_.<br /><br />\\"Scorched Earth\\" exemplifies the plusses of this album perfectly.  Featuring a slow pre-grunge chromatic riff as its centerpiece, it builds in segments like the best of VDGG, until they've spun considerable tension by the end of ten minutes.  Every musician is on here, especially David Jackson and the formidable Guy Evans on drums.<br /><br />\\"Arrow\\"--quite the memorable song, if not only for Hammill's shrill falsetto emanations after starting out in his lower registers--exemplifies both the plusses and (comparatively few) minusses of this album.  Like every other song here, this is a slow-burner.  It builds in its own time, like the best of VDGG (and the best of wines), but the recording is sub-par and Hammill sounds like he's singing under the sea (again, not in a good way like on _Pawn Hearts_'s \\"Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\").  His falsetto does get annoying (doth he protest too much?), like I said before.  The difference between his falsetto here and on _Pawn Hearts_ is that every instrument screeches when Hammill does and your lost in the Echoplex of your corpus callosum.  On \\"Arrow\\" it's Hammill screeching over a by-and-large restrained supporting cast.  Somehow the balance just seems off here.<br /><br />In short, buy this album after you've had a proper introduction to the band (_Pawn Hearts_ and the earlier works like _H for He . . ._ and _The Least We Could Do is Wave . . ._).  I think to start on this one might scare you off to the abundant joys of VDGG (if indeed disequilibrium is a joy to you).  If you go through those and get to this one, you'll be able to appreciate it for what it is.  A slightly flawed document of a master lyricist and his supporting musicians' journey upward from hell.  They are still in hell here, but they are reflecting on it as they ascend, hence all the fascinating things they do with the slow burn.you go through those and get to this one, you'll be able to appreciate it for what it is.

1565117875|3.0|I enjoyed this audio presentation a great deal more than the book.  Much of the book had little bearing on the story, only on the philosaphy it represents. This audio left those secions out, keeping the story moving. <br />
0345347951|5.0|Though I have never agreed with Clarke's bloated, academic, Sagan-like hostility towards current real-world paranormal issues (ie.

Yet, the book was written in 1953 - the very definition of a timeless classic. Could we be so bold as to say that Childhood's End serves as another example of Extraterrestrial Downloading via the Artist's creative outlet?<br /><br />Regardless, here we are more than half a century later and, if history repeats itself, Childhood's End will receive the much deserved, vigorously renewed interest of a brand new generation in the 21st Century, much the same way as Walt Whitman's Leaves Of Grass did half a century ago.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Wish You Were Here debuted in 1975 - as a teenager at that time I could only begin to understand how truly special, talented, and timeless the music of Pink Floyd would be. <br /> <br />Today, over thirty years later, I loaded Disc One of this DVD, selected Dolby 5.1 Surround, and hit play . . . as the haunting and familiar sound of \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" filled the room, my skin tightened and I was mesmerized. There is nothing like the experience of Pink Floyd and there never will be. Of course, if Roger Waters was present, it would have been a bonus, but David Gilmour and his excellent voice, guitar, and mastery of the music is just fine. <br /> <br />We are fortunate that this performance is available to the young and old. The sound mix is flawless and meticulously done. You have to see it. The best $15.00 I ever spent.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Wolfmother is kind of like a combination of White Stripes guitar and Mars Volta vocals, and since I really like both of those bands I enjoyed this CD extremely. Relatively simple but incredibly catchy guitar riffs are featured in each song, and when these jamming chord progressions meet noisy vocals and drumming there emerges a genuine sense of rock. This album has plenty of excellent tracks on it, my three favorites being \\"Dimension\\", \\"Apple Tree\\", and \\"Love Train\\" (the hit \\"Woman\\" is also really good). \\"Dimension\\" starts the album out solidly with a couple of the best riffs on the CD and a great vocal rhythm on top of them, probably being one of the loudest pieces. The song \\"Apple Tree\\" on here is definitely the most similar to The White Stripes, and I'd likely call it the best on the album too. This track has a lot of variety in it, starting off with the vocalist gasping out lyrics in between single guitar notes and then driving into a riff ideal for any headbangers out there, as well as the catchiest chord progressions of the CD. Then there is the song \\"Love Train\\", which is featured at the end of the music video for \\"Woman\\". This track has some neat use of percussion and alternates at first between lyrics and a sprightly guitar pattern like in \\"Apple Tree\\" before having them going on at the same time in a very rockin' jam. Overall I'd say this album is close to perfect and would give it five stars. I highly recommend it to fans of hard rock and/or The White Stripes.
0679422714|1.0|I had to put this book down after a couple hundred pages. I am not sympathetic to the left in any way, but this book is very weak. There are no footnotes. As another reviewer said, the authors lay into Mao on page one and don't stop. Could your point of view be a little more transparent please? <br /> <br />Essentially, they argue that Mao is an opportunistic, incompetent, sadist. He wanted to have power in order to be cruel, but it he came to power despite himself and his bumbling actions. <br /> <br />So what is their agenda? What does it prove if Mao was not a true believer, contrary to all the evidence? Would the famines have been better if Mao \\"really\\" believed what he said? <br /> <br />Don't buy this confused, amateurish pop-history book.
0385336691|4.0|This is a good read from start to finish.  You can't help but enjoy it unless you're dead.  Hollywood keeps making remakes of old movies.  It would be nice if they would use this book for a movie.  Of course, who would they use for Jack Reacher who is tall enough, Tom Cruise?  That's a joke I hope you know.
B0002F6AZC|4.0|Considering how this seems to be one of the lesser-appreciated films from the 1980s, I find it a pleasent surprise that they would go back and make a special-edition disk with some nice special features, a making-of mini-documentary and a filmmakers commentary, both of which I had a lot of fun watching and listening to. Other lesser-known films from the 1980s that got some really cool special feats on their DVD disks are: CAT'S EYE, CHOPPING MALL, CHEERLEADER CAMP, THE STUFF, DOLLS, SOCIETY, ROCK & RULE, FIRE & ICE and TIME RIDER.     I do have a few disapointments with this movie, both of which have to do with the fact that they were working on a limited budget back when they made this movie. The first is, as most know, the fact that this film has only three tales, while the first had five. The other thing is that the first film had lots of comic book touches throughout, such as pages turning across the screen, narritive captions shown on screen, weird comic book lighting in the backrounds at certain climative parts, even scenes shown in seperate panels at certain moments. Well, this film has none of that, the stories are just shown in the same way you'd show a regular movie.    Still, the stories are great for what they are. I'd say they're as good as the ones shown in the first film, and I'm glad to own this disk. The stories are:    OLD CHEIF WOODENHEAD: Three young punks in a decrepit desert town rob and kill two elderly store owners, only to have their wooden cigar indean come to life and exact revenge. The fact that it's the wooden indean that avenges the couple and not the people themselves who come back from the dead, as would normally be the case in this type of story, earns this tale at least a few originality points.    THE RAFT: Based on an earlier Stephen King story found in the Skeleton Crew short story collection. Four college students spend a day on a raft in the middle of a remote lake, only to find themselves preyed upon by a black blob lurking inthe water that likes human flesh and can slip through the cracks between the boards. In my opinion the best of the three.    THE HITCHHIKER: The story that is probably the most like the classic E.C. comic horror tales. A woman driving home late at night accidentally runs over a hitchhiker. Unfortunately for her, the guy comes back and wants revenge, and she can never seem to get away from him no matter how far she drives. It's like this one episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE turned pure horror as opposed to subtle suspense.    If you're a horror fan, check this one out.

This album is not for you thats why some people may be like this boring or whatever. No, you just dont do not understand true lirycist or true underground hip-hop...This is true underground hip hop with the best beats and lirycs i've ever heard and its even for me ? Better then 36 chambers which 36 is my fav album but im sry this albums tops it. Listing to the dark, grimy, raw, lay back feeling and even out shines mobb deep's the infamous, nas's illmatic... Its better then those classic albums. Dont agree ? Just listing to it this over & over. Genius's \\"liquid swords\\"  is pure hip hop and sadly his other albums after this one ? Was pretty terrible.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I had to listen to this album a few times before I started to like it a lot, but as of now I'd say it's a very well put-together CD. The Strokes are a fairly unique band it seems, often having distinctive traits like a subtle effect applied to the vocals, electronic drum beats, and making their guitars sound like they do in the beginning of \\"Someday\\" (no other band that I know of has guitars that sound like that). Although I'm much fonder of The Strokes' work on \\"First Impressions of Earth\\", this album as well as \\"Room On Fire\\" both have an admirably mild intensity of rock which allows one to enjoy the simple components of the melodies as you cruise from song to song. It's certainly not mild enough to be called peaceful, however, since many of the tracks have loud vocals, prominent guitars, and the occasional swear word, but is good for when you're not in the mood for headbanging types of CDs. The Strokes are a great alternative band with plenty of good jams to offer, and this album will likely show you that if thou givest it a chance. I would give Is This It four stars and would highly recommend the songs on here \\"Hard to Explain\\", and \\"Trying Your Luck\\".
B000FVQYYK|4.0|This album is not as good as Absoultion, it's different, but not in a bad way.  Musicians will inevitably change sounds from album to album, that's just part of the creative process.  No band can make all of its fans happy all the time.

The main characters seem to be able to get out of every situation, surviving life-threatening encounters so often that you start to believe them to be untouchable rather than smart-thinking.<br /><br />The concept of a secret code is based on the gnostic gospels, and the book characterizes Catholicism in a less-than-favorable light, glorifying Langdon and Neveu, the investigators and protagonists, as heroes. Because of this, it can be seen as offensive. However, with such a fictional style as this, it is hard to take Brown wholly seriously in his claims.<br /><br />An easy and enjoyable read; an interesting concept but one that I would only explore with imagination.
