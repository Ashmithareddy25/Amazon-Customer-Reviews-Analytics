B0050DIWFC|4.0|It was a real page turner. The beginning was a little slow but it picked up quickly and had  a great ending.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This season does not let viewers down . Dexter has a twist with this season. It will be interesting to see how the next season unfolds.
0770437400|5.0|Absolutely riveting.  I loved it, and I think anyone who enjoys the &#34;zombie&#34; genre (if there is such) will definitely love it too.
0425252868|5.0|Would make a great movie but without computer assist. I read this book in two days. It's a book that you can't put down once you start.It shows the human side of combat and the soldiers that fought it. My grandchildren even read this book and that's saying something today! Please make a movie of this great book.

B004Q3UL2O|5.0|It was a really good movie, slightly expected but the two of them really seem to make the film different.
B002GNDXY4|5.0|Simply amazing! An epic journey in to the world of a teenage Kal-El. Leaves you wanting more! I would recommend for teenagers 15 years old thru adults 120 :)
B0039NCJFO|4.0|It was very funny & unexpected.  The characters were casted perfectly.  It is timeless.  I watch it even though I've seen it numerous times.
6305428050|3.0|I'm going to question this being a \\"family\\" movie.  I know with rating movies G,PG,PG-13,R, there are certain standards that cannot be crossed, for instance, PG-13 movies are allowed one use of the F word. Well, than this would have to fall into the \\"R\\" category.  I know, anyone who has watched this movie will say that this comment is stupid, but please hear me out.  Since becoming a father, I've become more conscious of words and actions of what I watch and what I do, personally, I like this movie, I thought it was a funny movie and good for a few laughs with enough suspense to keep kids entertained.  When this movie came out, I was 7 or 8 years old, I didn't find out about it until a friend of mine told me about it and my mom and I went out and rented it, I was probably 10 when this happened. I had much more leeway with show's and movies than I allow now for my child.  This movie has at least 2 things that I don't want my daughter asking or hearing or seeing.<br />First one:  The Playboy magazine.  I know they don't show much of anything but still, it isn't something that I want my 6 year old seeing and asking what is that, why is she dressed like that?<br />Second:  I can quote this, on the subway, the street gang \\"Lords of Hell\\" if I remember right, when they confronted Elizabeth Shue's character and the kids, and the love struck teenager tries to man up to them, a knife gets taken out and snapped into the kids foot.  Then followed up by, \\"Don't F*** with the Lords of Hell!\\" Elizabeth Shue pulls out the knife and holds it to the gang leaders face and says, \\"Don't F*** with the babysitter!\\"  Now, 2 F words, and this is in the family movie category? I need to say I don't think this should be.  Whatever any parents decides, that's your prerogative, I myself, really want to keep my kid away from the f words as long as I can.  I started saying it in 4th grade, and it became a regular word for me in high school every where but home, once I graduated until I had my daughter, it was apart of most sentences when talking to friends or family.  Anyway, that's my two cents....ghter, it was apart of most sentences when talking to friends or family.  Anyway, that's my two cents....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|good game.  like 100floors but easier to follow the clues and escape.  Cant wait for more levels.  id even pay for.it!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I'm a fan of Captain America comics way from the \\"Silver Age ' when Kirby drew him , an again 40 yrs later when Brubaker created some of the best revamps in comic history . This movie was great , Joe Johnson knows how to create \\"comic book movies such as THE Phantom \\". Chris Evans does a fantastic job as Steve Rogers ,and how He becomes Captain America an fights the Red Skull and Hydra . The movie clocks in just under 2 hours an moves though quite quickly . Though they show 'The Howlers\\" , such as Dum-Dum and Gabe , they are just soldiers in this movie . I liked the costome they chose for Captain America , its just like the Brubaker comics in WW2. The helmet with a loose fitting outfit . I liked this a lot better than the one He wore in The Avengers . This is the better made super hero movies made so far . I cant wait for Captain America : Winter Soldier , when Bucky returns brain washed by the Russians as  a killer  along with The Falcon and Crossbones an perhaps the Red Skulls daughter Sin .  Enjoy watching the movie as much as I did .
B002JXK5VU|5.0|If you don't get a chance to watch the first episode, just do an internet search for Eureka Section 5. It will explain things and you will be ready to jump in on any episode.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The writer is fun and puts things in perspective that it's not that serious. I read the whole book first,which probably wasn't the Intention of the writer, but I was enjoying the reading. I am going back now to do the experiments.
1781162646|5.0|The cover artwork is great! Remains me of the artwork from the graphic or lurid novels of the 50's.  King's vision of a good story, quality packaging & publishing is a homage to the crime stories of Hammett and Chandler. I applaud Mr. King for putting out an amazing work deserving of paper--not an e version. You need to see and hold this one on your hands.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It is very light and feel very good in your hands. Love it. Get it. !!!!<br />skinny and less room take up.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|There was much to like about this book... but &#60;spoiler alert&#62;<br /><br />Seriously - a (previously driven Type A)  West Point Grad Uber-Soldier (MP Major?? seriously??) turned aimless drifter just happens to decide to get off a bus from Miami to Atlanta at a nameless highway interchange 200 miles short of his destination where it just so happens his only brother - a high level Treasury Department Exec - has just been brutally murdered... please.  Can you spell &#34;beyond belief&#34;??<br /><br />But other than that 'minor' plot issue, the book was enjoyable.  What can I say - I went to USMA, so any book that has a former cadet as the star works for me. Even one written by a Brit :-).
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|This is a great movie that our children loved and now our 3 year old granddaughter loves it.  It is just to fun to watch today as when it first came out.  Julia as Tinker Belle was the wrong choice but we have learned to live with her.
B008220BLG|4.0|I see 80% of the zombie flicks that come out or are already on DVD. I did not know the main actor who plays R. But the trailer was funny. I know the female lead from \\"I am Number Four\\". R digests the brains of a young man he kills as that is the only way of life left to the zombies. Seeing the dead young man's life flash before him in R's mind, R sees and remembers humanity. His journey begins to regain his heart and soul and rejoin humanity. I saw this film twice at the theater and now have my own copy. The soundtrack is fantastic.
B004EPZ03O|3.0|I enjoyed the movie so I bought it from Amazon it was a previously owned DVD. I received the DVD in a timely fashion but when I went to watch the movie  it was not repackaged it was open as if someone just took it off their shelf and put it in the box to ship. I was ok with that but as I  watched  the movie several times it got stuck where I would have to try to fast forward past that spot by doing that it would get it moving again but I would miss some parts of the movie. My word of wisdom beware of the items that are previously owned.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is a very nice calculator program.  I don't know why I chose this one but I did.  The best thing about it is that a it is free! I always appreciate and give a whole lot of credit to others who is willing to share their work with me and everyone else.  I thank you.  The best thing I like about this computer program is that it is large and very easy to use.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|My kids (9 and 12) loved it and I enjoyed it as well.  Well done for a Lego movie.  We may even purchase the DVD.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|It's a pleasant enough movie, but filled with stereotypical characters: the naughty old guy, the sweet forgetful cute old lady everybody watches out for, the rather stiff gentleman who's been wronged, and the faded cranky superstar with regrets. And that's just the quartet. It was probably a lot of fun for Dustin Hoffman in his first directorial role, and for the former opera and theater stars who provide the background to get together and do this project, but there's not a lot of depth to it.
B003G4W49C|3.0|So I recall starting to read this in my younger years, but never finished. So with the movie coming up I thought I'd give it another chance. It was a good read but somehow I never quite embraced the main character. The author put in a lot of time to develop Ender, but when it came down to it Ender just never seemed attached to his own body. A unique premise and generally a good read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is  great game hard but not so that you just give up. Challenge the mind And play this game.
006178480X|4.0|THE EYE OF GOD delivers a one-two punch as your beloved characters find themselves at a crossroads in life, as they race against the clock and find themselves outgunned at times. The author does an amazing job in keeping you glued to the pages and I felt a bit let down by the ending though I have to admit, it was an ending I sure didn't see coming. James Rollins is one of those auto-read authors I have that whenever I find he has a new release coming; I count the days until it is out just to get my fix. Though I do caution you, this is a story that is best read in sequence of the series as you get more out of it and THE EYE OF GOD answers some questions left after the last Sigma Force novel, Bloodline, left unanswered. This is definitely one book I need to read again soon....especially after re-reading the Sigma Force books again before I pick this one up again. Run-don't walk-to grab this intriguing book and settle in for an afternoon of madcap theories, edge of the seat thrills and more when you pick up a Sigma Force Series novel. Now the question is, can James Rollins top his newest story?
B00005JLEU|5.0|I'm not a good critic of movies nor do I have a unique opinion.  Ghibli movies are generally considered good movies that can be enjoyed by the whole family and I agree.  I enjoyed this movie enough to see it several times and purchase it, so that hopefully says something.
B0053KWDES|4.0|I bought this to increase the volume of my movies while i travel via plane for work.  It works great.  The only thing holding it back from 5 stars is the amount it increases the volume.  I know this can be a combination of my headphones and my movie but that is my opinion.<br /><br />Seriously, if you are on the fence about this item just pull the trigger.  I am not an music junkie, but it makes things sound better(i think) and louder for sure.<br /><br />I would buy it again.

B005BZQVJ8|3.0|There are spoilers in this one. Alert.<br /><br />Two friends take a trip to the states. One is a graphic novelist and the other, his 'co-hort' draws the pics. After visiting comic con, they decide to drive through the West's best alien-related sites where they meet \\"Paul\\".<br /><br />Is it funny? The two headliners are your gaurantee. But is it \\"funny\\"? If you aren't into philosophy, reason or realism... or if you can put your intellectual scruples to bed for the duration of the film, you might laugh out loud.<br /><br />The action/comedy bent was mild and somewhat predictable in what would have once been an easy-going family flick. The story plays off the interests of the average goofy alien movie-goer, with a trip to Comic Con, awkward accidents, love at first sight, parental oppression/co-dependency, unrequited professional admiration and liberation through a one-off adventure.<br /><br />However, As someone who was raised around writers, comedians and other creatives, the thing that leaps out to me about this film is the lurking platform, couched in reactive atheistic comedy. In fact, it read like a creative production of one's fantasy \\"you're an idiot\\" rant. Typically, when one feels this way, all points are one sided.<br /><br />The alien's character is gregarious, solid and unapologetically rude when the espoused ideology is deemed primitive by the writer's estimation. He slams the head (much like Who would) and imparts a self-survey of the evolutionary beginnings of all things, complete with powerpoint and dizziness.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, \\"Paul\\" uses Silva mind control to diagnose and cure an ailment, attributing this ability to evolution. Silva is older than I am and anyone can learn the spiritualistic method. Can one evolve through practice?<br /><br />Do aliens exist? Here's one thing on which the little prototypical alien and I agree. Sure they do. Why wouldn't they? After all, the Bible writes about life pre-Earth like it's a given. What are gaurdian angels? Fallen angels? God? According to the Bible (which is supposed to guide a Christian) there are things out there inhabiting other universes (who, by the way Paul, were never said to be 'made in His image') that know all about the Creator.<br /><br />The fun thing about a film like this is that humanity get's an opportunity to build castles and tell jokes while tickling each other's imagination and tumbling around in the sandbox. The really serious thing about a film like this is most people who watch it will enjoy it without the burden of critical thinking.<br /><br />Hmm... Here's the thing about \\"Paul\\"...somebody made him up.gaurdian angels? Fallen angels? God?

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|JUST STARTED.  NEED TO CATCH UP!  I love this series and have missed watching it.  I can't wait until I finished season3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOVE this series, and it's not my usual &#34;type&#34; of show. Sure, it's a little melodramatic and at times predictable, but it well overcomes those things. I think it's so great partly because of the melodrama. I recommend it to anyone who wants to take a voyeuristic journey into the lives of the preposterously wealthy and their trusted servants.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Its a very fun game, now that you have added some of the iphone features it makes it even better.I wish I could get the spell shop and the trading post.

B008JFUPLC|4.0|Pixar created a storytelling trend that previously had little place in animation: the struggles of being a father.  Whether he was struggling with his identity after starting a family (\\"The Incredibles\\"), raising a son on his own (\\"Finding Nemo\\"), or looking for more out of his life than just his job (\\"Monsters, Inc.\\"), Pixar's tales are family fun that secretly speak to the dads in the audience.  \\"Monsters University\\" goes back in time when those dads were unsure of themselves in college to determine what makes the man.<br /><br />And what really does make the man?  Is it his social status?  His appearance?  His degree?  His family lineage? The self-possessed, relentlessly cheerful Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) of \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is an uncertain young adult here, struggling to be the best Scarer he can be but fighting an uphill battle 'cause he's just so darn cute. James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is a disaffected jock sailing through college by trading on his family's good name. Sure, we know they were best friends in \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" but here they are competitors, with differing ethos that guarantee they're not going to like each other at first.<br /><br />Each character defines his success differently.  Mike studies hard; Sully parties hard.  The fraternities they join reflect their backgrounds, and soon it becomes clear that class isn't the only place to compete -- there's also the Scare Games, a series of physical challenges with the winning fraternity or sorority named the scariest on campus. Sully and Mike eventually become unwilling allies in and out of class, all the while pursued by Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren), determined to have them expelled, until...<br /><br />Wait a minute.  Is this an animated version of \\"Animal House?\\"<br /><br />It doesn't matter.  Just when you think \\"Monsters University\\" is over, it isn't, and that's when the writers unspool truths that will go way over the heads of little ones, but are worthy lessons nonetheless: compete with honor, tell the truth, play to your strengths, choose your friends wisely and work hard. At times \\"Monsters University\\" is a little more frightening than it should be (there's no Boo to remind us see the monsters world is essentially talking stuffed animals) and when its proselytizes the little ones were fidgeting in the theater.<br /><br />What \\"Monsters University\\" lacks in subtlety it makes up for with earnestness.  It's a fine film with a great message -- but it's more generic tale of being true to yourself doesn't quite live up to the father-appealing dynamic of \\"Monsters, Inc.\\"with honor, tell the truth, play to your strengths, choose your friends wisely and work hard.

B00CWY76CC|3.0|I downloaded this game an hour ago and already got to the end of all 10 levels.  I was really bummed to see this is as far as they've developed.  Or maybe there's a paid version out there with many more levels, who knows.  Ads are relatively unobtrusive which is rare for a free game. I love the graphics and the puzzle/ logic but was disappointed there aren't more levels.  Others may not breeze by as fast but still there isn't much to look forward to if you've only got 10 levels.  If they add more I'll re-download to my Kindle Fire but until then it can sit and wait for me on the cloud server.
B00155GDXC|4.0|I read the novel after seeing the film, which I thought was excellent. The author's format, a one-sided monologue by the young Pakistani, is different from what I expected. And it works. I think students in screenplay writing and film in general could use this novel as a text to study how a novel is adapted to the screen, in this case successfully.
B00BP4ZNFM|3.0|This film, which was very popular when it came out, shows its age.  It is still OK for youth audiences, and has little profanity/violence.

B006WXW098|4.0|Rachmaninoff is definitely my favorite Classical Pianist and Composer. Very difficult stuff to play. This young Pianist  is technically awesome, but lacks the maturity of Pianists like John Lill, or Vladimir Ashkenazy. She had some interesting changes and interpretations to some of these pieces. Having played some of these pieces, she did an excellent job with some very difficult material, but only 4/5 stars.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Probably deserves a 3, but I was so disappointed by the poor dialog, &#34;shaky&#34; camera (friggen HATE the shaky camera!!!) to cover poor action sequences, bad pacing, irritating filters and general lack of saturation that kept me out of the movie mentally and emotionally, and all kind of other cliches and general lameness . . . . I was just so disappointed.  Talk about trashing a really great series of movies.  Wow. . . . wow.
0062255657|5.0|This book reminded me much more of \\"Coraline\\" and Patrick Ness' \\"A Monster Calls\\" (which I also loved) than something like the sprawling, epic \\"American Gods\\", though the language, magic and beauty is still pure Gaiman. Partly based on something that happened in his own childhood that he had no knowledge of until he was older, and with a narrator the author describes as quite similar to his own self as a child, \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" is a bittersweet, personal and subtly profound tale of innocence lost and the meaning of true friendship.<br /><br />Our unnamed narrator returns to his hometown for a funeral of an unspecified relative, gives a eulogy and then wanders down memory lane, both metaphorically and literally has he happens across the red barn at the end of the lane, where something life-changing happened to him when he was seven years old. He sits by the pond and remembers Lettie Hempstock, the 11-year-old girl (who had been 11 for a very long time) who took him under her wing after a lodger at his house killed himself in his father's car. The man's death seems to set off a chain of events that begin with people getting the things they wish for, but turns into something much more sinister for our narrator.<br /><br />When the perfectly coiffed and beautiful Ursula Monkton shows up to be the boy and his little sister's new nanny/housekeeper, the door between the real and the magical opens further, as she seeks to drive a wedge between him - one of the very few who knows the truth - and his family, who of course don't believe the silly little boy when he tries to tell them of his new nanny's true evils. His only hope is Lettie and her mother and grandmother, who are quite encased in the magical realm and who help him fend off Ursula's attempted takeover.<br /><br />The book can certainly be described as a dark fairy tale for adults (there's enough disturbing imagery both of the real and magical kind to warrant the adult label), but I found it closely resembled YA as well, with our narrator's perhaps more mundane growing pains and loss of innocence manifesting itself as a great mystical struggle between good and evil. The pain Ursula manages to inflict on him and his family, whether real or imagined, is very real and something that clearly he has carried to adulthood. And while he can barely remember specifics about Lettie in the years since he grew up and moved away, it's clear her genuine kindness and care for him at a time in his life when everything else was falling apart saved him even more than he realized. And that had nothing to do with her ability to do magic.

0062255657|5.0|Hate to say too much other than it was a beautiful book. Deceptively simple on the surface and initial chapters. I hadn't intended to read it right off but opened the cover and discovered I was three chapters in before I knew it. The story went to places that I found intriguing... it danced around metaphysical concepts I've been pondering about and provided more questions than answers. Very satisfying.<br /><br />Not written for children. I'm not saying this so much because of the sexual content. Though the central character is a child, the storytelling is more of a memory of an adult of when he was a child. There are some adult behaviors witnessed by the child who does not know exactly what he is seeing- so though there are sexual moments in the story between adults, it is not described in any way that a real child would understand what is going on. The adult content is less about being inappropriate for children and more about larger philosophical ideas that will go over their head. Bright adolescent children might do well with it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Take any 15 minutes from this musical film and compare it to any entire film or Broadway adaption of Les Miserables and this musical blows them all away! I had the pleasure of comparing the Broadway CD (I picked up recently at goodwill) and these performances are leagues above the broadway production. There may be better singing voices in the Broadway performances, but they are too artificial and polished. What this musical does in spades is grab you with so much heartfelt emotion. Many songs the performers do while they are crying! They pause and get choked up while the music waits for them! I personally have never seen so much drama in a musical. Annne Hathway's song has to be the most dramatic song in musical history. Those gut wrenching 4 minutes gave her an academy award. Jackman and Hathway both lost their weight and hair just for their roles! This cast is amazing!<br /><br />The production, photography and basically everything are excellent! My only complaint is as a follower of Jesus, I am uncomfortable watching the foulness during the song by Sacha Bara Coen. I skip that part for it does nothing to advance the story anyways.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|I thought that Noomi's acting, as always, was great.  The story line was a little hard to follow, but it was clear enough to enjoy the movie.  The future sci-fi technology portrayed in the film was very good as well.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Jeeze. Plage Inc. may very well be my new addiction. It's fun, it's short, it's not too difficult- it's everything you'd really want in a tablet game. The premise of the game is that you're a disease attempting to eradicate humanity. However, the game is versitle enough, and you are given enough options that you really won't have to play the same way twice.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A lovely book about a marriage and the man and woman who after many years of traveling in different directions were forced to assess and move in a common direction. Simple in plot but beautifully written with sensitivity and like the main character a softness and at times anguish. Thoroughly recommend it !!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|My second favorite tv series. right up there with the X-files. Dr Bishop is fantastic and unique in his role. Sorry the series ended, but i will continue to watch the series on Amazon.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I could not put this book down. Gillian Flynn is a gifted writer.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense and good writing.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I love when younger people and older people interact. One is just beginning life experiences, the other has lived them. This was so true in this novel.
B00520R146|5.0|Really good movie. Was in perfect condition for being used. Got it fast and watched instantly. Never saw movie till now but was a good movie to own.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I've been waiting and waiting for this to get in to a $5 bin and never find it.  Well I took the leap, told my husband it could be for my birthday....watched it as soon as we got it....didn't realize I had gotten one with additional scenes. thanks
B00CLD671A|5.0|As the third in a very successful series, this continues the mesmerizing story.  Still holds your interest in the characters and makes you anticipate the next of the series.
B000I2JKFG|5.0|it really shows you whats going on (or what could happen) if the people dont speak up before its too late. dont ever forget to stand up for your rights!
B001FOR5XU|3.0|The book was ok, I like the movie so much that I bought it in Blue Ray as well. I still have the book I may have to read it again.
B00003CXS4|5.0|this is just a crazy, fantastic movie. UK films are kind of chaotic (in a good way)! they're just so wild hahaha, but they're good! and his one has brad pitt as an irish traveller so its pretty good to watch, and i like the music that plays during the dog/hare race also LOL
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Never has so much been covered in one season! The final episode of this season must have at least 10 plots coming to critical points.
B000AARKOO|5.0|i just never get tired of this movie i swear! plus on the main dvd (with the movie on it) has a section called &#34;the pilgrim's guide&#34; and it plays the movie normally, except at the bottom of the screen it shows little facts and tidbits of information to explain historical stuff in the movie and that was great! i learned so much!!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This app works great for my kindle fire HD!  I haven't had any problems with it so far and doesn't freeze up like other apps I've used.

1607066017|5.0|Definitely a new idea in comics as usual for Brian K. Vaughn. Another superior outside the box type of graphic novel from the master. I couldn't put it down, the entire volume and I was WORKING a comic convention table where people needed my attention. I just ordered volume 2 as it just came out.<br /><br />Buy this now.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|not enough tatum and wife was ugly didn't make sense bad writing of movie she cant act expected more out of the other characters
B00BYISRC0|4.0|This album is pretty great. I love listening to it at anytime and \\"Heavenfaced\\" is one of my favorite songs this year. I can't wait to see them when they are in town and I'm a relatively new listener.<br /><br />The only issue I have is with the vinyl LP. This 180 gram style they're doing these days are really unnecessary. Having to start up the turn table as I flip the album multiple times to listen to under 15 tracks seems like a pain.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so addictive and fun that my mom yelled at me to get off my kindle fire and get outside! But take my advice and listen to her. I bought this game on Amazon and you should to. You may love this game like I do, but you can't be a couch potato all the time. Thanks for making this game (whoever made it) but you got to make it less addicting!
1409140288|3.0|Attorney Mickey Haller of Lincoln Lawyer fame is desperate for work and hustling clients who have been served foreclosure notices on their homes. Unexpectedly, a female school teacher who he is defending in a foreclosure case is accused of murdering an executive with the bank foreclosing on her house.<br /><br />The plot is interesting but this is mostly a courtroom procedural with a minor secondary love story involving Mickey Haller and his former wife. Michael Connelly does a good job of maintaining suspense but the ending is contrived and similar to a TV movie. I suggest you first read or listen to the Lincoln Lawyer because main character Mickey Haller is much different in this story than in the Lincoln Lawyer.<br /><br />I enjoyed listening to the audio CDs but was disappointed by the ending. I gave this three stars because Michael Connelly has written other better stories and I expect nothing less than excellent from him.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Absolutely brilliant - it's our bookclub book of the month and I got through it in a week. I giggled and cried. Written well and I like the way it wrote from the different characters point of view enough but not overdone. All our book club loved it and I'd like to read more of Jojo Moyes.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Like reading poetry. I loved it. Hard to believe English is not the authors' native language. It came vividly alive
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|LOVE love love this game.  I am not a gamer at all but I find myself playing this game for hours and hours.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Such a good way to relive earlier TV series. With almost no good programs being produced anymore, it is a relief to sit around and watch shows that were so dear to us in TV's heyday.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Was not what I expected.  Too short. Should get more levels.  Rated 3stars.  Nothing more to say for now unless you change the game.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I was riveted for the entire 3 hours. Shocks and surprises all throughout. Also fun to figure out what character was portrayed by what actor.

B00C7KYXHW|5.0|There was really not a bad episode in the season. A great watch, especially to marathon, which I did. Great buy!
B00BOXZAG6|2.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br /><br />All the inconsistencies drove me nuts watching it.  Anything from one world touching anything from the other causes fire.  And yet ***spoiler alert!!*** she gets pregnant?<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />Explanations are so vague as to be mere head scratchers.  Ending is also a head scratcher.  Only reason it got two stars is that I like to look at KIrsten Dunst.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|It is awesome to be able to watch any YouTube video you want to on the Fire, but the home screen seems small and it is not the same as watching on your computer. But you can search and watch anything you're looking for.

B00CWY76CC|2.0|It is not much of a challenge, there aren't that many things to do to get out of each room so it is kind of boring.
0061122416|5.0|I read this book years ago and find myself coming back to it repeatedly...every time, I get something different out of it. It may be a simple story, but I always enjoy reading Paulo Coelho's work - this is no exception. Highly recommend.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|This is, without a doubt, John Wayne's best movie. In this film he plays such a darker role. From beginning to end you are captured by this film. And unlike today's movies, which describes someone as being sad and angry by having them mope throughout the entire film. The Searchers has John Wayne's character laugh and make jokes at times. But you can see into his anger and hatred even then. This gives his character reality, makes you truly believe and understand his pain. Without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of all time.
B007THA4FI|5.0|The subject matter of this book is fairly intense - Rowling really gets into the seamy underbelly of life and doesn't pull any punches when it comes to describing secrets that are hidden behind closed doors. As a fan of her writing in the past, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect with this...and I was very pleasantly surprised. I particularly appreciate the author's ability to really make you feel like you're there, in the middle of the experience - touching, tasting, smelling, feeling, hearing - yet her words never feel overworked. Some authors need to write long, run-on sentences with lots of adjectives...and you're usually still left wanting more. I feel like Rowling puts you there in a situation, forces you to respond, to think, and to wonder...what would I do if that were me? How would I feel? Realistic enough to be disturbing, but still make you hungry to read the next page. I loved it.
B009ME47H2|5.0|I love this ap. I can record anything, even me singing to music on the same device. Very much worth the price.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Heard about this series way back but only got around to watching it recently. There are so many original ideas in the first season it is hard to keep track. This is great TV.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game. Sometimes the details are lacking but overall a good game. Could use better graphics but then you'dhave to pay for it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is the best white noise app that I have found for Android.  Love the Rain on Canvas Tent.  Can't sleep without it.
B001LF347E|5.0|I started watching this series rather recently and had never heard of it before.  I was a little reluctant to start watching this show (thinking it would be too amateur and childish) but have since become a fan!  The series started off a little rocky and I remember rolling my eyes at some of the more sillier aspects of the story and characters (Uther Pendragon's rather foolish and irritating ways for example), however as the series as progressed the stories have become better, the characters and acting more settled.  I love the fact that very minimal computer CG effects have been utilized, Camelot for instance actually does exist!  You can visit the castle in France!  I remember being quite surprised when I discovered that fact.  Those elements give this series an authenticity that is lacking in other fantasy shows.  The actors who play the leads are quite entertaining and brilliantly cast.  Arthur and Merlin (Bradly James and Colin Morgan) are a perfect blend and play off each other rather well; Bradley being your quintessential medieval prince both in looks and demeanor (even down to his voice), and Colin the bumbling, goofy looking side kick who never quite gets the credit he deserves.  The two leads are supported by a host of other well respected actors who bring their A game to the series.  \\"Merlin\\" is filmed well enough for a TV series and the sets, props and costumes are minimalistic yet well designed.<br /><br />This show is a carefree and fun ride that I think most people will enjoy and has turned this critic into a loyal subject! :)
B009NY43NY|4.0|I felt that Sookie had been moving in this direction from the beginning, but especially in the last few books.  I thought that it ties everything up so well.  I know many were disappointed in her romantic life, I was happy with the end.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This one was worth downloading. you have to think and that keeps your mind sharp. I'm actually looking forward to the new levels. so hurry up MobiGrow.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|It was a little entertaining, but it could have been better. I liked the storyline, but they never give solid explanations. The reason why everyone turned into zombies was glossed over with one or two sentences. Why or how the zombies started turning back to human was never addressed, you were left to make the connection on your own...and it was very flimsy.<br /><br />In all, it's a movie I would have on in the background while I cleaned house, but nothing I would intentionally sit down and watch again.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|This is a fun & cute idea & my 5 yr old likes it. But on the free app there are only 2 girls available. So she does what she can & is done pretty quick. She always moves on to another game. It would be nice to have at least one more free option.  I think it would be fun to have a boy option!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I guess I am getting tired and bored with the same old thing - sex.  It was okay but not terrific.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 5 yr old daughter loves this game. She is an animal lover & likes playing doctor & caring for all the cute pets. She really enjoyed the free app. I don't usually buy the full versions but it was cheap & she liked it soooo much it was really worth it.

B00BC24NT4|2.0|I know le Carre is a highly respected writer.  I tried THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD years ago and gave up on it.  This one had the same result for me.  It starts with one story then wanders into some convoluted, complex thing with all kinds of characters who are impossible to distinguish and I couldn't find a connection with any of them or what was happening.<br /><br />I rarely quit a novel.  I won't be trying another le Carre work.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Very touching relationship between the writer and a wise old professor.  Morrie shared his wisdom in their Tuesday meetings for many years. His thoughts about death were very practical and accepting. Morrie's wisdom and courage were aired on TV as he was interviewed by Ted Koppel in a three part presentation.  Even though it was about the dying process and the winding down of life, it was not morbid. I found it strengthening. I am very glad I read it.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I really hate when you read a book and enjoy it enough that you want to find out what happens, but you get to the end and are like, &#34;I wasted my time on this for that ending!!&#34;  I really didn't like the main characters too much by the end either. The author wrote the story in a way that made you think this was the way the story was going, but would then just decide to throw a whole monkey wrench into the plot. The twists felt forced. Not sure why everyone gave this such good ratings. I also have to say that one of the main characters last name was so annoying and used so frequently that I got really annoyed because it was so distracting. It actually would break the flow of reading. Try saying Logiudice three times fast!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it can be hard at times but its really fun. it is kind of addicting. it is good because you don't have to pay for barely anything.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a fun way to keep your mind alert. But, there needs to be more levels<br />added. So sad that I reached the final level.
B00B780TAK|5.0|This series has me fascinated, and enthralled with all the characters.<br />I love the English way of life, because it is so tasteful and charming!<br />There is beauty and grace displayed in each episode, and so much feeling<br />invoked. The acting is superb!! I have enjoyed all the series, and the<br />Christmas special too. I am so excited to see Season 4!!

B008JFUPLC|5.0|***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />  Like \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", \\"Monsters University\\" (MU) won't win any recognition for its originality.  Relating the tale of the first encounter between all-eye green cyclops Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and blue, hulking, bear-like James \\"Sully\\" Sullivan (John Goodman) at the titular institute of higher \\"scare\\" learning, MU cribs all over the place.  As other posters have noticed, MU borrows fragments of other college-themed movies like \\"Animal House\\", the Harry Potter movie heptology (seven films), and even a smidgen of \\"Back to School\\".  Most tellingly, however, MU is heavily in debt to \\"The Hunger Games\\", since the meets held to determine which monster fraternities will be eliminated from the prestigious \\"scare curriculum\\" and even from the university take up the bulk of the film.  MU robustly and hilariously satirizes the aspects of college and frat life you would expect, but later reveals unexpected insights about the limits of desire, determination, and knowledge, and learning what your true place in the world is.<br /><br />  \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" focused largely on Sully.  This time, in MU, Mike is mostly in the spotlight.  We first see him as an appealing schoolkid (voiced by Noah Johnston) with huge aspirations to become a top scarer at the scare factory.  Little Mike is sharp enough, and studious enough in...\\"scareology\\"... I guess to earn a place at the university.  However, he faces two tough obstacles. One, although Mike may have nailed the cerebral, technical aspects of scaring, he may not really be inherently scary.  Two, the imperious and disdainful Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren), a cross between a dragon, a praying mantis, and a centipede, candidly and harshly tells Mike he is not a scarer.<br /><br />  There may be a third obstacle.  Sully is also attending the university, but he is literally a goof-off party animal because he thinks his family \\"scaring\\" pedigree will get him through.  So obviously, and perhaps predictably, Mike and Sully aren't friends at first sight.  At first, they're not even dorm mates (at least that clich&eacute; is avoided for a while); Mike is first paired with Randall \\"Randy\\" Boggs, the later reptilian invisible monster in \\"Monsters, Inc.\\"  That soon changes as an assembly mishap involving a cherished scare canister forces the irate Dean to eject Mike and Sully from the \\"scare curriculum\\" and pair them off as opposite roommates at the unpopular Oozma Kappa (OK) fraternity.<br /><br />  OKs members are middle-aged squid-like former salesmonster Don (Joel Murry), the bickering two-headed Terri/Terry (Sean Hayes/Dave Foley), the five-eyed Flounder-like Scott (Peter Sohn), and ex-con elbow-macaroni shaped Art (Charlie Day). Even though OK is kinda nerdy and non-scary, Mike convinces the Dean to allow the OK frat to compete in the \\"Scare Games\\"; if they survive the games, all of OKs members stay in the scare curriculum; if they don't survive, Mike, and perhaps Sully will be sent packing.  Will OK be OK enough to do it?  Will Mike and Sully realize their \\"scare dreams\\"?<br /><br />  Again, on the surface, MU plays with the framework of the college/fraternity movie and seems to be going where you think it's going.  But MU is somewhat surprisingly subtler and deeper than that.  It suggests that drive, persistence, hard work and book knowledge are good things to have, but do not necessarily take you where you want to go.  Sometimes serendipity intervenes and shows you your true path in life (it's a \\"Mr. Holland's Opus\\" thing). Also, those same qualities alone may not predict success; additional qualities such as cunning, cleverness, and \\"misdirection\\" can come in handy. MU also suggests that even the most outwardly self-assured people hide reservoirs of self-doubt and fear.  However, teamwork and mental focus can overcome those fears and perform amazing feats than no one person can hope to achieve. Most importantly, MU demonstrates that failure can be the steppingstones to ultimate triumph.  We know from \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" that Mike and Sully succeeded in getting jobs at the \\"scare\\" factory. MU shows the surprising steppingstones they took to get there.the steppingstones to ultimate triumph.

B008IBPMZG|5.0|The first World War is the main focus of this season and how it involves the people living or connected to Downton Abbey.  The story becomes more entertaining as we see people, including the servants, making choices that affect their own lives and the lives of others.  The war scenes are reenacted quite well and the acting remains top notch.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada by Damian Stevenson gripped me by the scruff of the neck and dragged me kicking and screaming, dropping me off breathless at the last incredible page of this brilliant spy thriller set in France WWII. I was immediately reminded of Alistair MacLean's awesome work and this book more than matches those great novels. I grew up on The Guns of Navarone, Where Eagles Dare and Ice Station Zebra and now as a grown up I have been thoroughly treated to this great spy novel depicting the early war career of Ian Fleming.<br />With the Germans invasion of France, the British get wind of Operation Sealion, Hitler's plans to invade Britain. The beleaguered French Fleet would make a handy addition to the Kriegsmarine dooming Britain. Ian Fleming is dropped into France with enough gold to purchase the fleet, but when he enlists the French Resistance he is aware of a traitor. He is also ruthlessly hunted by General Bock, a vicious sadist. With its wonderful descriptions, use of military hardware, uniforms, insignia, this book concocts a thriller of FIVE STAR proportions.<br />This reader cannot wait for book two or the movie.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|Everything about this collection seems simple and clear, but the raw power of it is untouchable.  This is the most remarkable and moving music I have heard in many years.  If you left mainstream commercial music way behind and are looking for something new and different and crazy good, you will be glad you listened to this artist.
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|As an app this works fine for its purpose. I don't like that it doesn't let you tilt the tablet to \\"portfolio\\" view and like most games it makes you view it as \\"landscape\\" which can make it a little uncomfortable to use while the Kindle is charging. But overall it works fine. It's better than using the Internet for me, because when I use the Internet on my Kindle, my Skype constantly logs me out when I don't want it to. So I like this app for that purpose. I'm surprised there aren't more Gmail apps; I'd be interested to see more.

B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Although it 2as a good movie, great special effects and story line. It wasnt qhat I was expecting. I was hoping for a little more.  But I cant rate it to bad on that. Still recommended it to family and friends

B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love these types of games and this one has been one of my favorites.  It makes you think of what to do next.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Nothing more then the title is needed! But since I have a word minimum I will say that I was sad it ended!
B001PB3RU8|4.0|there's something good and rowdy and enchanting about this music so we play when we're in the mood for this.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|This album still has the feel of the &#34;old&#34; Paramore, but with an eclectic mix of songs that are fresh and redefine the new Paramore. You'll definitely enjoy the ukulele interludes by Hayley. :)
1781162646|5.0|Great! I always appreciate getting lost in a book to the extent that the book ends before I am ready for it to be over, yet not disappointed with the ending!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Crazy how my 9 year old had to help me a little. I look forward to more levels and more games like this one.
140053271X|5.0|I was looking for a cheap reader and wow I'm amazed with this item. The item looks like new and it it arrived in perfect condition. The seller made sure it was well protected
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This app does not install on the kindle fire properly.  It fills up your data storage without actually installing the app.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Near perfection.  The headset fits snugly against the bottom of the case, which is a soft rubberized material.  Two LEDs indicate the charging status when you insert the headset or press a small button on the outside of the case (flush).  The flip-top cover on mine is actually a smokey-gray translucent plastic, which is different from the product picture (a good thing -- you can see the LED's while it's closed).  The outside of the case is a hard plastic.  I wouldn't guess the case would be very tolerant of impacts; it feels like a medium-velocity impact would do damage.  That said, the slim size of the case is perfect for carrying your headset in your pocket or purse while not in use.  That it also recharges your headset is a bonus.<br /><br />Charging the case was quick; I've been using a single charge for 2 weeks to keep the headset topped off (usually 1 hour of talk time used between insertions into the case).  The case is just now saying it has 50% charge left.<br /><br />A very worthwhile purchase.  Treat yourself.
044024367X|5.0|Book in good condition, a little warped, but not a problem.  Can always count on Blue Cloud to provide a great product.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This will make it easier to carry my Kindle to Sunday School and Church instead of my heavier Bible, and I can take notes on my Kindle.
0440243688|5.0|Book in good condition.  Can always rely on Blue Cloud to provide a great product.  Have already read and it was a great read.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Why is it when EXTRA money is required for viewing there is not a problem.  When the PAID streaming viewing comes along, WHOOPS, the story is STOPPED and the viewer is lost in the link, so to speak.
0440246016|5.0|Book in good condition.  Can always count on Blue Cloud to provide a great product.  Now just need to find the time to read it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Ordered all the books from Amazon except the last one which I received as a Birthday present from my daughter. Finished reading the books and just had to see the show.  I have watched the first season and have stared the second season. These are such a fun watch. I don't have HBO so I wouldn't have been able to see the show unless I bought it. I am really enjoying them and so is my husband. This is a great way to watch a series because you don't have to sit through all the commercials and you can watch anytime you want.  I'll buy the third season as soon as it's available.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Very insightful, helps me to understand why some decide to become vegetarians. Well rounded on all the issues. Good read!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Loving it.  Great fun. Have one and two and will order three shortly.<br />This is a really convenient way to watch a series.
B00340LM8C|5.0|With Cary Grant, Grace Kelly and Alfred Hitchcock how can you go wrong. Still Great. Would recommend it to anyone who loves movies.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't stop watching this. It's so addicting. Every time I finish one episode, I can't wait to start the next.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is great show!  I watched it on a whim and fell in love with it. It is a smart and funny show!  Not full of nudity or cursing but just great writing and a wonderful cast.  I wish there were more episodes!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|that was a really fun game, I promise you'll have lots of fun give it a try you're really like
B008133MDK|5.0|Perfect cast for Sherlock and Watson!  I love shows that are smart, witty and fun and this is that and so much more.  Watch it!!! More episodes please!!!!
B005DJREJS|3.0|I guess times have changed drastically. The show begins with a fifteen year old having sex, I don't think it's appropriate behavior.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Best season since Olivia and Peter are getting together! Can't wait till I start watching season four with the observers observers in the plot. Best J.J. Abrams series that I love so far.
1451627297|5.0|I have always liked Stephen King, but I enjoyed this book as much as &#34;The Stand&#34;. Couldn't put it down!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|finally knowing the meaning of the flowers, makes this book  all the more memorable.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A definite page turner. Hit a little close to home with all the marital problems-really turned my stomach.  I have a new favorite author!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love mystery's and this book was a mystery until the very end, very exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging game and lots of fun.  looking forward to more rooms!  takes a while to get the hang of it
B00BI73CVI|3.0|The musical is gritty, sad, and a little sweet. The supporting actors were more accomplished musicians (e.g., the young rebels) than the leads. That being said, Anne Hathaway's performance stood out. Her acting was amazing!  The other leads were fine actors and well cast for their parts...their musical performances were a little rough.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|I rented this because of the critical acclaim.  I find that when I rent something because Hollywood types like it I usually  don't.  I was hoping different for this one, but I was disappointed. I paid 4.99 to rent the thing and ended up not even watching the entire movie because it was so dark and discouraging.<br /><br />I hope something good happened at the end , because what I saw of it was not that great.  Have to wait for more of the Hunger Games.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|Definately a Man's movie but funny and touching. It gave me an interesting perspective on how men view things. My daughters and I watched the French version with English subtitles. We noticed that they left out translations for one of the more &#34;politically sensitive&#34; comments made during the shaving scene at the end of the movie. That was disappointing, because it was one of the most irreverant and funny statements in the whole movie.  Also, if you watch this, substitute the translation of &#34;mop head&#34; into &#34;poodle,&#34; and it will be more funny and accurate, LOL...you will know where to do this when you see the movie, LOL!
0811876373|5.0|great for the artistic baker in all of us. Bought as part of a present and worked out great.<br />I even get to reap the rewards
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|The movie had some interesting moments...but honestly it reminded me of 90% of the cold-war action movies I saw in the 80s. I could predict every plot line and twist. Live Free or Die Hard was significantly better than this one.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|What can I say I love Supernatural! It is in my opinion the best show ever made! I will get every seson on DVD and this one was priced so low at the time that I couldn't pass it up!
B004DM0UII|5.0|This is one of my two favorite radio streaming apps. It works great and never crashes on me and u use it every day. It does a great job of keeping the stream playing.
B00COO2D6O|2.0|I tried the free version and had a blast but didn't want to have to buy the extra stuff with real money. So thinking the paid version wouldn't be this way, I put down my money. To my surprise its the very same game. I see no differences at all. I got ripped off. The game is a blast to play but if you pay for an app it should be different than the free version. Beware buying.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Better than I thought it would be. Some good action and a little bit of comedy thrown in that my son didn't get.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was my first book by this author.but I dare say it will not be my last!  Excellent! Absolutely EXCELLENT!
B004PLT3TY|3.0|We've seen this several times, good family movie with some fun action.  It's a cute movie that I'd watch again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A real brain teaser. Although it's challenging the puzzles can be solved with diligence. Hours of intense entertainmet. Loved it. Made me scratch my head.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|The pre-release info on this film made it sound earthshaking. The critics didn't like it much when it was actually released. I think it improves on DVD viewing because one can slow down, replay some unclear early scenes and better appreciate the work that went into it's creation. Viewing it takes some time but the end result is satisfying.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|not too easy and not too hard. the difficulty increases with each floor. Playing with my son last night and had to force ourselves to go to sleep
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|Waited a long time for this . It is almost as good as she was in person.If you like the classic Jazz singers of the past you will like this.
B000SW4DP8|5.0|This film is definitely one of a kind. It's strongest aspect is the magnificent acting by all the characters. The heartfelt acting and beautiful filmography is what separates it from being a cliche. Every now and then a good movie will come along with a basic and classic message that everyone seems to forget: Family heals by sticking together. This story about an Irish family moving to America after the tragic death of their two year old son is a magical journey through the complex human spirits. What makes this a great movie is that it is told through the eyes of two young girls who's strong faith and magical imaginations carry them and their parents through their long search for peace in a chaotic world.
B008393Q2O|4.0|Good for making shopping lists on your tablet. Would love to have the colors: red, yellow, and blue for the tabs. These are the colors of Queen's University.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another great book I'm the crossfire series! Wish it would have ended differently but can't wait for the next one to come out
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This is one of my favo<br />rite games. I played it all the through and now I am playing it again under a new name.
0694013013|5.0|I bought this for my two and three year-old grandchildren...they continue to enjoy it, over and over again. We are all fans of Eric Carle and this book did not disappoint us
B004EPZ08E|5.0|a great movie for those of us who hate our bosses, and fantasize about offing them,a whole new role for jenifer anasten
B00821OX98|5.0|This movie follows kinda in the same as The Walking Dead , Really enjoy this movie . Would recommend if you like SiFi .
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This series cracks me up, it's my new favorite show. I'm glad I decided to buy season one to give it a try.
B00BUVLQNI|1.0|I received Downtown Abbey 123 with Highland Special UK version which I already have.  I want the US/Can version with Highland Special.  Please tell me how I can return it and get the version I want.  I do not want to waste $79!!  Terrible experience!!  Please send me correct version as soon as possible!!  No response from Sydney Melbourne!!  Thank you.<br /><br />Robyn Mound
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Another awesome show from the UK and thanks to PBS for showing it.  The cast, the plots, and the acting are all outstanding.  The period costumes are wonderful.  Even if you're one of those persons who hates PBS (yes, some folks do), I bet you'll love this show.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love to play it every day. it is very addicted.  can't stop play. even my children get into the act
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I really value my time and have no patience with a lot of the garbage that passes for TV &#34;programming&#34; these days.  This show is a rare gem that made me change my mind about totally giving up on TV.  The writing and acting are excellent.  Yes, it can be violent, but the violence is not over-the-top given that the show is about making and dealing meth.  This show definitely is high on my list  of best TV shows of all time.  If you have never seen this show, do your self a favor and watch it.  If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch it for free.  If not, it's worth paying for (even if you have to cook meth to afford it).
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love the game but i would change it by having food take less time and furniture be less expensive along with other things being sold
B007MHVVCU|4.0|Keeps your interest from the start.  I have bought the whole series and I'm on book 4.  Really well written.  Gets you hooked from the start.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I Have been playing this Bingo Blitz game since late May,and I have fallen in love with the Slots section of the games but Warning if you have any issues with the game FORGET IT!!their customer support is no support! And don't purchase credits to play,the game freezes and you may not get the credits you paid for and customer support won't respond to your emails!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best show on TV right now. LOVE Downton Abbey! I am halfway through watching Season 3, and looking forward to Season 4, can't wait!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because, when I go to church I don't . Have to get out my bible.<br />All I have to do is look up what part of the bible I want to read and It gives me the right page in the book. I LOVE THE HOLY WORD!!!<br />Read it, it will change your life!!!<br /><br />  -sara watson + The LOGOZ
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|My husband and I loved it! Great movie well worth it to rent and try for yourself! Can't wait to get this on DVD
B000GYI32M|5.0|Love this show!!!!  My daughter and I watched all seasons and loved it!  You feel like you really connect with the actors!  Wished there were more seasons to watch!
B0096HIEE2|2.0|There was more female nudity than male nudity. The storyline was not very good. My advice to the movie makers, if your going to make a movie about male strippers... Show us the goods.<br />I could care less if I ever see it again.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I like the game  but I hate having to pay for  theglu coins that is normal now. It is a good way to pass the time
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|It was an OK movie to see once just to experience some of the novel ideas they came up with in CGI & cinematography,BUT, the story just lacked something - it needed just a little more development to be a great movie. I won't buy it & may not rent it again.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My original impression of all the hubbub over &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; was that here we had a re-visit to the &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; silliness of my high school years.<br /><br />Then I watched the first series on Netflix. Wow!<br /><br />Brilliant writing, superb camera work, well done in every respect. Now I'm annoyed because I have to wait for the fourth series ...  ;-)
0688101364|5.0|I ordered this book because Rose Levy Beranbaum is absolutely famous for her recipes as well as her artistic talent with food! However, the book arrived broken! I was crushed!! I immediately contacted the seller, wishing for a different copy, but, CRUSH, they didn't have another one!! The seller immediately refunded my money, and told me to keep the book. I am very pleased with this seller...sometimes books get missed in inspections..it happens, although it's the first time for me after many long years as a book buyer.<br /><br />Now, what to do with my treasured, but broken book? I have had several suggestions, but haven't tried them yet. Not giving up, though!! If you are wondering whether this book will be high quality, wonder no more! Rose Levy Beranbaum makes the best tasting cookies around. Her recipes are in there, along with fabulous presentations from icings to jams and beyond! Absolutely, I would recommend this book for all bakers, novice to expert! The recipes, photos, and innovative techniques are highly prized! A top quality book!!
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|My friend kept telling me about &#34;Merlin&#34; so I started watching it on Netflix. Well, the fifth season had been done for a half a year and they weren't carrying it, so I bought the DVD set to see the end of the story.<br /><br />Well done. A trifle silly at time, a trifle jarring if you know &#34;Le Morte D'Arthur&#34; or &#34;The Once and Future King&#34;, but fun. I enjoyed it a lot.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I love it. I'm realaxed and calm. It really works,especailly when I need to go to bed.  I love the different scenes and I can configurate  any scene or music to my liking. Everyone needs to try this app. You will enjoy it. God bless.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|A good time waster and very cute.  My kids loved watching Nemo swim around.  Would highly recommend this game for all ages.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I read all of the &#34;Sookie&#34; books. The show was a little much for me after a few series. The books are not quiet as all over the place, but has enough twist and turns to hmm yourself.
B00AIJP9BS|1.0|My phone is old, so perhaps it works with newer devices with newer position sensors, but on mine, it is unplayable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it keeps my mind functioning by playing. this app is for puzzle solver! Recommend you guys to play this app!!
B0031RS7A4|1.0|I fail to see the humour. Several websites have this book rated as one of the funniest books ever written.<br /><br />30 years ago perhaps. If 70s TV didn't do the genre to death, then Stephen Fry stuck in character certainly did.<br /><br />No laughs & tiresome. sorry.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|The beginning was slow. Middle was very good. The ending was all of disappointing. I was not thrilled with the book
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love Gideon and Eva.  He is a very powerful man with a gentle touch.  I am upset that the trilogy is not finish.
B002QZ399G|4.0|Not as much action as I'd expected, but the story was compelling.<br /><br />All the actors were also very good in telling the story, left me rather impressed.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|I first heard Ramin's work on Iron Man and have payed attention to him ever since. But honestly, I think Pacific Rim is my favorite soundtrack from him yet. It's a great balance of action and heart. I decided to go see the movie once I listened to this score. Definitely recommended.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I think highly of James Altucher. I follow his blog. I wrote an app just to follow him (iOS and Droid - it needs an update). I've read (or scanned) most of his books, including his comic book.<br /><br />There. I admitted I'm a fan, so we can move on with a decent review.<br /><br />This is one of the finest books ever written. I don't give James four stars for his book. THE BOOK IS EXCELLENT AND DESERVES FIVE STARS. It only gets four stars because of the readers. Yes, that is potentially you.<br /><br />You'll look at this book title, you'll read the summary, you'll see the number of stars and read some of the reviews. You'll be excited. \\"Ah,\\" you'll think, \\"finally, an easy answer to all my problems.\\"<br /><br />You're dead wrong. This book will give you the SIMPLE answers to your problems, the SIMPLE techniques to make your life better. Nobody ever said it was EASY.<br /><br />Most of us who read the book will feel empowered. \\"I can do this,\\" we'll say. \\"I can make the changes that will make my life meaningful, create beauty from my existence...\\"<br /><br />I hope you can. This book does give you the techniques. It provides the anecdotal stories from James' own life to give you inspiration and hope (after all, most of us will NEVER lose millions of dollars in a few short months). You'll look at your problems, at the rock bottom part of your life and say \\"I can do better\\" and this book will give you the guidelines you need.<br /><br />The guidelines are SIMPLE. It just won't be EASY. Sadly, my experience with people is that they are looking for easy, not simple. So for you, the potential reader, I give this book only four stars, though the content deserves five stars.<br /><br />Reach high. Stretch. In your own life, you can pull that last star in and make it yours...<br /><br />I wish you well. So does James.
B000SEI230|5.0|Buetifuly laid out and one of the best reads yet. One of the best Nicholas Sparks books. You must read this one.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|Being a huge fan of the original `Men in Black', I was largely disappointed with `Men in Black 2' and somewhat turned off to the idea of `Men in Black 3'.  Still, it was on and I was home and bored and decided to give it a go.  Sadly, they just cannot recapture the magic of the original film, despite getting some new blood and upping the action and effects.  Thankfully, most of the silly jokes are gone, which made for a less `eye rolling' experience than when watching `Men in Black 2'.  Still, the plot is spotty and the tacked on heartwarming ending was unnecessary.  Will Smith oozes charisma though, even when he is obviously phoning in a performance, so he's a joy to watch, and Josh Brolin absolutely NAILS his portrayal of Tommy Lee Jones.  Like, it was somewhat uncanny and I found myself completely baffled as to how I never realized he was such a great actor.  Leave it to this preposterous movie.  Michael Stuhlbarg's character is ridiculous, and he looks like Jason Biggs straight out of `Loser', and Jemaine Clement is more `gross' than `scary'.  I guess that is the whole idea here, to be gross and funny as opposed to engaging and thrilling.  It could have been funnier, it could have been tenser, it could have been better, but at least it wasn't as dreadful as the second one.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Yes, it was suspenseful, thorough, and well written. Excellent character development. Disturbing at times naturally,due to the subject matter. The ending had an unusual twist too.
B0060DYMT6|4.0|Very interesting SciFi movie with one of the creepy-ist &#34;I got you good&#34; vengeance schemes. I am glad I watched it but probably never again.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I don't usually go for non fiction books ...but heard so much about this series on HBO.  I don't get HBO so I decided to read the books instead.  I was hooked from the first chapter!  I am now reading the second in the series!  Great reads!  I highly recommend this series!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I thought this was going to be a movie on who is to blame for side effects in drugs. Turns out to be a very good mystery movie.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This group really rocks big time. Lead singer a cross between Janis Joplin and Amy Winehouse. What more could anyone ask for dang it! Buy it. Support really good music groups instead of all the trash out there.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|It`s simple and easy to use.  The free version has adds but they are all in place and not annoying.  I like it better than weather bug.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|sure takes the guesswork out of knowing how strong the wireless signal is, or if it's even there at all!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another great novel by David Baldacci.....<br />A real page turner; the end was not easily predicted and even harder to anticipate.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Big fan of the triology, but I must confess I havent read the Hobbit yet, I had read bad reviews but it feels like the other movies and I look forward to the next two
B002T44ZYW|1.0|I got this book because I love Lauren Conrad, but after I started reading the first few pages I realized that I may be out of the target age group for this book.  This book would probably be good for a girl in high school, but does not work for someone in their 30's.  Really bad writing even though I still love LC!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Sylvia Day's Crossfire Novels are so addictive. Once you start one you can't put it down until you've finished it.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Mark walburg is a great actor.  Good story line. I enjoyed very much and. Would like more of this type movie
B005NFWCSK|1.0|I rented this movie using Amazon Prime video Service.  The video stream kept stalling making it difficult to enjoy the movie.  The stream would stall, the vide would skip back 30 to 45 seconds and restart.  Some times the sound would drop out too.  Horrible video quality.  Leading to a horrible viewing experience.<br /><br />Movie itself was great.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|had a long flight and rented this movie. Good action movie to pass time. Typical of Die Hard movies by Bruce.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very interactive, plus I just Love horses. So life like and original. Great way to spend down time. Calming and soothing.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|A must read for fans of the genre, especially if one has ever spent any time on L.I.'s North Fork.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the writing and the story line.  Wished I could find my own Mr. G. Cross? I love all of Sylvia Day's books.
B00393SFU2|5.0|In Berlin shortly after the first World War, Berlin is gripped in terror as a psychopathic pedophile stalks the streets, seemingly unnoticed and unhindered. After months of meticulous and thorough police investigations, the cops are at a loss. They've tried everything they can to apprehend this monster - nightly raids on criminal gambling parlours and bars, consultations with skilled psychiatrists and are almost ready to give up until they stumble across an epiphany (that strikes the Mafiosos simultaneously) - use beggars, the city's ubiquitous eyes and ears.<br /><br />As the film progresses, the sheer power of such unspeakable crimes, their everlasting and abhorrent consequences and tragedies are summarised in the film's concluding sentence.<br /><br />The tension, acting and themes mesh together effortlessly and flawlessly to create a monochromatic horror film like no other. Black humour and clever writing make for riveting viewing. The extras alone make this film worth re-watching. My hat is off to The Criterion Collection for allowing modern audiences to enjoy timeless classics.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I'm not one for scary movies, but my husband LOVES this movie, so I bought it for his birthday...<br /><br />SUPER SUSPENSEFUL!!<br /><br />But well done.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book had been highly recommended. As a relatively new gardener myself, I was intrigued by the meanings of each flower. The characters were well developed, but the alternating time periods, chapter by chapter, challenged me until we'll into the book. It's a book I might need to read again to gain its full meaning.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Secretariat was great, War Horse was amazing, but Seabisuit was EPIC on all levels! The character development pulls you into their individual stories. Thin threads that pull these characters together to make an epic take of Dream, Struggle, and Victory! WARNING: Men..your eyes may sweat...
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a great book, easy read and a fun concept! Leaves you wanting to finish every time you open it!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Honestly, if you grew up reading the Hobbit in school, this movie will bring that book to life in so many way. It's a perfect movie full of action, adventure, mystery, and friendship. It's a clean movie with no curse worse or fowl language. I have watched it 3 times since I bought the DVD and I'm sure I'll watch it many more times in the the future. If you're a LOTR fan, you'll love the Hobbit. Excited for the 2nd movie to come out this Christmas!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Never used a wireless headset before, as a gamer I spend a lot of time on the PC and hate the idea of constantly having to recharge a headset.  This thing charges very fast and the battery life is quite nice.<br /><br />The ability to rotate the mic up to mute is a handy feature, though it tends to fall back down if you're walking around and moving a bit.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Such a fun game. Everything you need is right there. It really makes you think. It's not complicated I wish there were more levels! !! I could play this all day!
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|What an inspiring story!! LEGEND, ICON, CRUSADER!! Sir Walter Isaacson does true justice to the story of this marvelous personality :)
B006RXQ27O|5.0|Wanted to watch the movie after hearing about it's 25th anniversary.  The animation is awesome and it really holds up given all the advances in CG over the last 25 years.  I absolutely love this movie.
B004ZNACA6|4.0|Might have gave 5 stars except that the corners of the box were all bent up when I got it.  For 130 bucks I feel like it could have been packed better for shipping.  Or maybe the corners were bent before it was shipped?
0062086529|5.0|Very sweet, mesmerizing story for kids. Great for ages 1-4. My kids love having this story in our book collection.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This movie was solo much better than what everyone was saying. If you come in with low expectation you will be very impressed
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I've loved every Reacher book. This one was in the upper half of what are all great books. Lee Child can't write enough Reacher for me.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The first two books were good and I couldn't wait for this one, but don't waste your money.  The story line didn't go anywhere until the very end when it started to set you up for the next book.  When I got to the last page (which you don't realize until you actually get there on an e-reader) I almost threw my ipad.
0316077046|4.0|I keep getting captivated by Beautiful Creatures series, and I loved book two just as well.  I just wish we could get another point of view besides Ethans, but regardless I love the series, how well it's written, the characters and so much more.  I can't wait to continue reading this series to see what happens next.  I hope to see more on the big screen, I think book 2 would be exciting as a movie as well.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Good cast, story moves in good pace.  Good depiction of class distinction and sub-classes within a class, and most poignantly displayed how tradition can limit a person's self esteem and kills aspiration.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show, one that both my husband and enjoy watching.  Finally something that is not related to the 'reality genre'. Looking forward to the upcoming seasons.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|This album is not what I was expecting but after some listening I started to accept the songs and then enjoy them very much. It also made me see how many good songs were released after the former classic formation ( Mustaine, Ellefson, Friedman and Menza ) was over. It made me see why Megadeth is my number one band.
0545265355|5.0|I love this series and these books have a nice cover and case for them, They look great on my bookcase
1591841666|5.0|An interesting look at beining the best in the world at anything.  Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to be better at what they do!
B00821OX98|5.0|Didn't get involved in this series when it was first launched.  Heard talk about it so I found it on Amazon Prime.  First couple of episodes are a bit slow -- setting the plot and introducing characters.  However, after that I was hooked.  Trying to get caught up so I can watch the current episodes as they are aired.
0802473156|5.0|A must read for every relationship. Has opened my eyes and made me understand more of why people are different. I really love the idea that we should worry more about what our partner wants from us, than what we ourselves want from our partner.  Within reason, of course!  After all, we can only control/change ourselves. Our partner usually then will respond differently and we get more done that way.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would encourage everyone to start from season 1 and watch this show.  It  is addicting...Can't wait for season 4....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|wow, this such an awesome game. Its my new favorite game. wish there were more levels. oh yeah, great game -
B00AEFXLBQ|5.0|A true Classic, made in the days when there was no need for foul language or sex scenes, when movie makers knew how to make films that lasted.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|i downloaded this game for my daughter and im the one playing it. very addictive for all and a good time killer.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Plays just like I remembered from my PC.  I haven't played this in years, but now I remember how much fun it is.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I am huge fan of the OZ movie. This game has awesome graphics . My high score is over 1,000,000. It is a great game an  is very addicting.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Loved this book. Enjoyed every page. Felt like I was there with Cheryl on her hike. Highly recommend it this book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun. Pretty cool rooms , change ways to enter other rooms. Gets addictive. One two three four five six seven eight nine.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|this game is fun but will get boring after a while because there is no upgrades you just keep doing the same thing get upgrades or advance to higher levels by money or skill will give a 5
B000FCK65W|5.0|I haven't read this book in fifty years and was delighted to discover it was even better after the perspective of years of life experience.  What rich dialogue  and characters. If you've never read it do, if you have read it you'll discover new things to enjoy.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is quite the real story. Very nicely woven between his bedside family members & caregivers and his own experience. It's a must read for anyone seeking/doubting/curious about if the lights just go out or we truly have an afterlife. It's not religious to speak of, albeit very uplifting on its relative meaning to our lives.
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|It is really lots of fun and again the hand and eye coordination helps me so I  can focuse better.ENTERTAINING is the Word that is bed to describe this game.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The series has taken unexpected turns and twists. There are many times I find myself speed reading to get to the interusting parts, but when I get there, it's totally worth it. All in all, a great story, but the telling of it could have been better.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|When I first got this game I DIDN'T like it but now it is a challenge to get further and keep getting gas for the car which really duplicates MY life I always seem to be putting gas in my car. IT IS FUN AND EVERY TIME I FLIP THE CAR I CAN'T HELP THINKING I AM VERY HAPPY IT'S A GAME.
B001JRB16U|4.0|My grandaughter loved the movie.  She keeps on singing all day.<br />Brought back memories of the days my daughter (her mother) watched the same movie.  Its priceless.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Could not put it down. Loved all the characters. Their wisdom and strength.  A good sense of what slavery really meant.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game subway surfers is amazing. My kids and I love it we play it all the time. Thank you.
B000093BDX|5.0|purchased as a gift by a big Beach Boys Fan great music by a super musical group recommended to anyone looking for great music.
B009F7OQ5Y|5.0|This doll is quite elegant and demure in appearance -- the dress is gorgeous and would make a perfect gift for any young lady.
B009G41CG2|2.0|Maybe it is just me, but I have a hard time telling when tiles are open and available for matching.  Also, some tiles look so similiar that I couldn't tell their difference without really squinting.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A DA's son is accused of murder and as he works to find him innocent he looses his job, his savings and secrets in his past threaten his marriage.  A riveting novel any parent can relate to.  Do you believe your child?  Do you tell the truth even if it harms his defense?  How can a family heal after suffering such trauma.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I dare you to try not to feel a twang of self stupidity in the shadow of the great Sherlock Holmes...
B008IBP24C|5.0|Great characters, great plot, all good!  Loved the costumes and setting too.  Next best thing after Poldark!  Can't wait to see season 3
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|The show is beautifully acted and beautifully filmed. The murders are creepily lovely, and the food is lovely but creepy. I'm definitely a fannibal.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|just love it its so cool to me right now i could scream aaaaaaaahhhhh like i said can not belive
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I was reluctant to watch initially because I wasn't sure how good it would be. My mother in law loved it, but she's a forgiving woman lol. I loved it! He is definitely badass and witty. Twists and turns Everywhere! Worth a watch!
B00003CXTG|5.0|I love this movie! It was wonderful getting the commemorative edition, for such an awesome price. I could not find this movie in stores so I am very pleased I was able to find it on here!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great book that I couldn't put down. Cannot wait for the third installment of this series. Will be waiting not so patiently.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Love this movie It is excellent especially if you like zombies! Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg  are  great !!! Buy it !!!
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|I like this and the effects it makes, but I do not really know what to do with it. So I use it when I am bored.
B00C6B9PX4|4.0|Over all movie looks great on Blu ray not to be missed!  but I should warn you Universal Blu-Ray's are not compatible with all blu-ray players! it refused to read on my Samsung 3D player with the latest firmware updates! lucky I was able to get it running on my PS3 player to enjoy it, hence the reasoning for only giving this classic only 4stars!
B006P4FBUE|5.0|The girls love to play it not stop!!! Great app and teaches students a lot as well as learning the different keys on a piano.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved all of this series. They are sexy and full of adventure. Couldn't put it away.<br />You won't be let down.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|An enjoyable page turner filled with intrigue, romance, and fantasy. Perhaps a bit of scifi thrown in. A lovely read.
030758836X|5.0|When I began reading the first half of the book, I was only partially intrigued by the story line and considered chucking it.  But I'm glad i read it through to the end because the beauty of the mystery and the very demented personalities of Nick and Amy are finally exposed in the second half.  These are two very twisted, crazy characters!  You have a hard time believing the craziness but at the some time there is still a modicum of reality to it that sucks you in even while you shake your head in amazement.<br /><br />I would have liked a bit more closure at the end but I'm satisfied enough with it.  I look forward to reading more from this author.
B003FXCSNQ|5.0|Fantastic, everything I expected and more.<br />Funny, witty, and charming is Deckard.<br />I was let down by Blade Runner after reading this Novel, not the other way around.
1401938906|5.0|This is the kind of thing I love - a rubric for an actionable plan for bringing the metaphysical into the physical.  Don't just read this book, work it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|takes a while to start off and ger coins and diamonds but its really fun to play when you're bored and has pretty good graphics.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|I paid for this and downloading was interrupted.  I have emailed Amazon to no avail.  Now when I bring it up they want to charge me again because it is past 24-hr period.  Makes me think twice about renting any movies from Amazon Instant Streaming.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|I liked it, it is a funny movie and worth getting. I would recommend it for the comedic sci-fi lover.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am having a lot of fun playing with my grandson and granddaughter.  A nice break from the word games and match three games that I enjoy
B0067R0APK|2.0|Loaded free version of AccuWeather for Android from Amazon App store on my Samsung Galaxy S III. When the small location map was touched the screen changed to the full screen display for the map but it was blank and would not display the map. I thought the problem might be in the free version (thinking the feature might not be available in free version). Deleted the free version and bought the Platinum version for Android from Amazon App store. Same problem existed. Went to cellular store and asked for assistance, which was given freely. He spent some time trying to get it to work and couldn't. He downloaded the latest update for the Android operating system for me. Same problem persisted. He then downloaded the free version of AccuWeather from Play Store instead of Amazon, and it worked fine. Is there something different about the Amazon Apps from those available elsewhere? I will go to Play Store first before trying Amazon again, even though I have had success with Apps downloaded from Amazon previously.
B0031R5K68|4.0|Great read. This book had me hooked right from the word go. Loved every bit of it. I could not put it down!
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I have read this book in the past and it has been so long ago I'm going to read it again.  This is a good series,  the author puts a lot of work into developing the characters and the story.  Honor get's her crew into a lot of bad situation's and get's them out of them,  she pushes the ships to there limit and then some.
B009Q54K6U|5.0|My favorite songs are &#34;The Speed of Life&#34;, &#34;Sitting On Top of the World&#34;, and &#34;Wish You Were Here.&#34;  Overall, this is a wonderful album and I recommend it to all Delta fans and anyone who appreciates amazing vocals!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I started the show before the book and many of my friends told me that I should have read the book. Well not regrets here, great story, great characters. The only complaint is that I cannot go to bed early since I got this book. :)
B00007LTIL|5.0|THIS Is the ultimate cd for a deadhead.  If you don't know and own American Beauty then you are lost for this is THE album!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I put this on my Kindle Fire.  When you type something in the search bar there is no way to go any further.  No go button and when you hit enter on the keyboard nothing happens.  I am just glad it didn't cost anything.
B000006XSD|4.0|Not his best but still good.....King of the Silver Screen=AWESOME.....I never Wrote Those Songs....even BETTER....My God?  Well it is his God but still an awesome conclusion.
B005P4P966|5.0|My husband and I love The Big Bang Theory. The show is very funny. The cast of characters are great. We can't wait for the<br />Complete Sixth  Season to arrive. We have the first thru fifth seasons and have watched them many times over.<br /><br />Diane Dosch
0345803485|1.0|If you like having brain cells...DON'T read these books. Any 50 shades of whatever, will kill all your brain cells and will make you want to slit your wrists.
B008M87GJK|4.0|PLEASED TO HAVE IT ON THE KINDLE FIRE TO GET UP TO DATE NEWS WHEN EVER AND WHERE EVER I CAN GET A SIGNAL
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Like the family tree included, helps with story line!  Has a map as well.  Nicely boxed set for maintaining discs.
B0094K20FK|5.0|The idea being taken from long past Star trek episode was great idea and worked well.  3d battles in space for graphics at the time were superb.
B00B47NO2O|1.0|The pilot was promising but the show went downhill very fast, with dumb and implausible plot lines, boring talky dialogue, and excessive and gratuitous violence. The whole premise seemed to revolve around the killer's obsession with the detective - but who cares? Not I. No real motivation was presented. Kevin Bacon's role in every single episode consists of shooting dead all the likely suspects who could provide any useful information. Head of talking to them first? Every single story line consists of Bacon killing a suspect on the scene and the police backup and swot team for this supposedly deadly major plot arriving hours later, like the Keystone cops. Every-time any major break in the plot was announced to the police, they sent Bacon and an expendable partner detective who could conveniently get shot/beaten/captured. The so-called villain was also utterly implausible and also pretty boring after too long. There was no plot development. Having paid for the thing, I eventually fast forwarded through the final episodes simply to get to the end. In short, don't waste your time or money. Go for some decent Nordic Noir instead of this mainstream American trash.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|The Mailonline Tablet App for Kindle crashes 9 times out out 10, yet the pop up suggesting you get the app never fails.
0553386697|5.0|This has to be one of the more important books that I've read in my life and I encourage all adults to read this no matter where you may be in parenthood (even if you are expecting). It has allowed me to reflect on my rearing and key relationships so I can be a more insightful, integrated person--and therefore--a better parent. The stories and suggestions make it easy to implement even before you finish the book. It can be red in spurts, little by little--so those all so precious minuets you have to your self WILL be well spent on this. Good luck and happy parenting! -written by Mrs. Young
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I've been a WOTE fan since I saw a few of their videos on YouTube a long time ago and then subscribed to their channel. This cd definitely did not disappoint. They are great artists and the songs are just as great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was a great book a nice fast paced summer read. I don't know what else to say about this book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined with You is a wonderful follow-up to Ms.Days' previous books in this series. Gideon and Eva find themselves once more fighting for each other with many new twists and turns. I really enjoy this series as it seems more \\"real\\" and relatable. Loved this boom! Quick read! Can't wait for more!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|had fun playing nice on the rode trip and my little brother loves horses and I down loaded it for him but then I started playing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is such a fun game. Its so addicting. I cant stop!!! Every day I come home and all I'm doing is subway surffers
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great book. It was a smooth read and very interesting. Loved the characters and their interactions. Very sad and beautiful love story.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is tons of fun.  I especially like the arcade game that lasts for 60 seconds and doesn't come to an instant end if you hit a bomb.  Beware, it's addicting!
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Junk story plot and just mindless action. Wait to see it free and don't pay anything to see it. V
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Love the action in this movie.i have been a fan of clash of the titans for years now. It's still a great movie.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|It does the job expected. It's strong and very stable, easy to rotate and nice looking.  I really hope to figure out a way to add a nice fitting pocket for my stylus to this.  That would have made it a 5 star!
B001BKZDB4|5.0|Bought this for my child and they love it.Best DVD I bought for them. Children love high school musical. Great
B00190OHD6|4.0|I don't particularly like Hilary Swank, but I don't mind her in this movie. I thought it was a fun movie overall and it made me want to travel and explore more. Enjoyable and funny story and cast. If a movie can make me cry and laugh it is worth having.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I do love this game, and often play it. But in my understanding you need gems to move up in the game right? And you have to buy the gems with real money, correct? Well that's NOT cool because think of the little kids who play this game.<br /><br />People can spend up to $100 on this game. And that's not right at all.<br /><br />Well played, Gameloft. Well. Played. Hope you're happy with yourselves.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The variety of stories being told in this series are interesting and entertaining.  On one hand, the historical perspective of an age gone or going is educational.  The characters are well-done.  On the other hand, the drama and intensity of the stories are holding our attention and are not boring, and are not interrupted with wave after wave of commercials.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|It has it all - sweet romantic storyline, nicely developed action, wonderfully comical characters. I'd watch it over and over again. Cannot wait for the sequel
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a awesome game everyone who isn't playing it is missing out<br />I always play it<br />this game is so much fun I love it
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|My kids love it and it was a great price too.  I am glad that we purchased this movie.  Lots of nostalgic music too.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Fight Club is pretty much one of those movies that is a must have for anyone who loves movies.  Seeing any movie continue its life on Blu Ray (and then whatever will come next) is awesome and Fight Club came in style.  The bonus features on this disc are simply fantastic and provide both casual and hardcore fans of the movie a chance to see behind the curtain and all the work going into this masterpiece.  The movie itself is in stunning HD quality.  The fight scenes are twice as brutal in HD.  I recommend this to anyone who loves this movie and hasn't yet made the leap to Blu Ray.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|A bit dramatic, eh?  But worth the price.  I LOVED seeing Edward shove Jacob into the wall.  I have been waiting for the whole movie series for that.  (Jacob always got the best lines in the movies) Even though it wasn't in the book, it was still funny.  Seriously, it is only, what, eleven extra minutes or so, but so worth it.  I do wish Summit had released this version BEFORE I bought the first version.  That was pretty tacky, I think.  But I bought the extended version anyway and am glad I did.  There are some new things like Jacob throwing the &#34;doggy bowl&#34; at Rosalie.  I was disappointed that that scene didn't make it to the final cut of the movie.  Their antagonistic relationship really made the book special, but the movie glossed over it all.  Too bad.  I guess I would say if you have a choice buy the extended copy instead of the theatrical version.  If you have already purchased the original then I guess you would have to be a die hard Twilight fan to repurchase this, but in my opinion, so worth it.
B0086700CM|1.0|This is a waste of money and time.  Not exciting, you can't do anything but run, run, run and jump, but you don't get anywhere, just the same thing over and over.  How boring,
B0080SW3CC|5.0|Rarely have I come across a more powerful book, and very rarely does a story that is so short capture my imagination as this one did.  I finished it weeks ago and am still thinking about it.<br />It is a shame that Steinbeck is \\"wasted\\" on middle and high school literature classes, he can really write and should be appreciated when one is older and drowning (as one will be) for a lack of good writers.  Here is a very good writer, one who makes books like they should be made.<br /><br />It is hard not to make comparisons between Faulkner's Benjy and Steinbeck's Lennie (the two most famous ID characters in literature) and it is true, I think, that both characters are used similarly, but while one may have, certainly \\"felt\\" for Benjy, the narrative style makes a deep and abiding love impossible.  One will, however, truly fall in love with Lennie.<br /><br />What is more, Faulkner's book is one of the most difficult, and trying in literature, and this is certainly one of the easiest and most pleasant.  It opens itself to you and shares itself readily.  Not only did I love Lennie, but George, also, who may end up supplanting, in my heart, Hemingway's Robert Jordan, as my \\"favorite\\" character ever.<br /><br />The author is clearly a realist, I think, stylistically.  He shows us life, really, clearly, unsentimentally.  He has a great gift for dialogue and for scene setting, conveying so much, in so few pages.  It was a real joy.<br /><br />I am glad I discovered Steinbeck when I needed him.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was the ultimate cinderella story to me.  The language and excessive sex was a bit unnecessary but the story line was brilliant! I loved the humor and fantasy!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this whole series. Many period shows tend to move a little slowly for me but there's always something interesting happening in Downton Abbey. Many layers to the story line. Worth thine time to watch it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved his other two novels and this was just as well written. He has a way of capturing deep feelings and making the reader feel completely absorbed in the story. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a wonderful story.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I thought the tube would be bigger. I don't know why. All you use is a big drop!. Worked great very thick and sticky and made a great film for heat conduction! I would say ill buy again but there is plenty for two processors, maybe three. If I get real motivated and start building systems I'll order again and more. Great stuff! Received on time and in great shape.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|I love 21 Pilots I can't stop listening. Every song is unique and special and they are all good. They're infusion of rock rap and electronic makes every song special. And they are all so catchy.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|\\"White House Down\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Capitol Policeman John Cale has just been denied his dream job with the Secret Service of protecting President James Sawyer. Not wanting to let down his little girl with the news, he takes her on a tour of the White House, when the complex is overtaken by a heavily armed paramilitary group. Now, with the nation's government falling into chaos and time running out, it's up to Cale to save the president, his daughter, and the country.<br /><br />The cast led by Channing Tatum (also executive produced) (as John Cale) & Jamie Foxx (President James Sawyer) is great. The directing by Roland Emmerich (also produced) is great. The story & screenplay by James Vanderbilt (also produced) is great.<br /><br />The music by Harald Kloser (also produced) & Thomas Wanker is great. The cinematography by Anna Foerster is great. The film editing by Adam Wolfe is great. The casting by John Papsidera is great. The production design by Kirk M. Petruccelli is great. The art direction by David Gaucher, Isabelle Guay, Martina Javorova, Jean-Pierre Paquet, Robert Parle, Charlotte Rouleau & Sandi Tanaka is great. The set decoration by Marie-Soleil Denomme & Paul Hotte, set designs by Stevo Bedford, Peter Bodnarus, Aric Cheng, Forest P. Fischer, Tammy S. Lee, Peter Ochotta, Julien Pougnier, Maya Shimoguchi, Domenic Silvestri, Mike Stassi, Peter Stratford & Lucie Tremblay, set dressings by The Godding Brothers, Jocelyne St-Pierre & Yanick Veilleux is great. The costume design by Lisy Christl is great. The special effects supervised by Clive Beard, Louis Craig & Cameron Waldbauer, coordinated by Karim El Fassi & Corina Rosca is great. The visual effects supervised by Andrea Block, Eric D. Christensen, Alessandro Cioffi, Martyn 'Moose' Culpitt, Sebastien Dostie, Volker Engel, Paul Graff, Christian Haas, Joseph Kasparian, Jan Krupp, Chris LeDoux, Ollie Rankin, Fredrik Sundqvist, Philippe Theroux & Marc Weigert, coordinated by Ann-Marie Blommaert, Cat Counsell, Joanie Croteau, Jake Delaney, Zack Fox, Anouk L'Heureux, Martine Losier, Zachary Mallett, Karina Mariano, Riley McDougall, Carol-Ann Ouimet, Eric Schumacher, Magdalena Strzelczyk, Chris W. Tucker & Andreas Wieland is great. The stunts coordinated by John Stoneham Jr. & Layton Morrison (also fight coordinator) is great.<br /><br />This is a great and fun action-thriller that is entertaining and well-done, as well as, well-made. This is also a film that is greatly paired alongside \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\". Roland Emmerich has made another great action-thriller in his array of action-thrillers. Channing Tatum & Jamie Foxx make a great on-screen team with great chemistry. This is one of the best action movies of the year and of the summer season, so far.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I loved this move but I can say to the  parents this move will scare some children it even scared me but the action was wonderful I loved the movie and I recommend it
B005LJITS0|3.0|it's pretty bad. i'm not gonna lie. However it's not THAT bad if you have that expectation in mind. It is actually entertaining. I haven't felt like... getting up to stop watching it. So it is at least engaging and entertaining despite it being fairly corny, unrealistic, and cliche. The acting is pretty bad butttt the action and the effects kind of ... help gloss over that. I dunno. it's something to do.
B001AW156U|4.0|EDIT: I original,y rated this as a 1 * item due to it not working. If this is your problem, please contact the seller via email and ask for a new one. The person I got ahold was excellent and shipped the real product to me fast. The real triggers work great and really improve the PS3's triggers for racing games, Uncharted reloading, and Bioshock. It's hard to slide your fingers off them, and they give you far more control. I'd recommend this to anyone, only reason it's 4 * is due to the initial inconvenience of receiving the wrong item.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|Not a bad game, but not one that I think I will play too often, but hey it was free.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This app is really great for downloading videos. I don't see why it has so many bad reviews. It works perfectly fine, and THERE ARE NO PORNOGRAPHY ADS. There are probably 100 reviews claiming it, but it is not true. I recommend this over any other youtube app on Amazon.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I've always enjoyed her music, but I felt this movie really conveyed her personality well. I like her even more now!
B00A31UXLW|4.0|A smooth story that keeps you interested through each chapter. You get to know Harry a little more and learn to appreciate a detectives dedication.
B002NN5F7A|5.0|If nothing else watch the first 20 minutes.  Worth the price to just get you fired up. ABC  Always be selling

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Liked this book almost as much as the first in the trilogy, and I am counting the days until the release of the final book in this series.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have tried rebooting, still seeing old posts, useless spam, and just crappy.  My I phone is better and that even had flaws.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have always loved Follet's books , and I can't wait for the 3rd book of this trilogy. Couldn't put it down!
B000JQU4TW|5.0|An effort for eternal life by painting his aging process that allows him to retain his physical youthfulness.  This effort, while physically successful, creates an ethical decline that he justifies to meet his objective.  A strange story, but it illustrates how easy it is to change your principles to meet your needs.
B00936A0RU|5.0|This movie is badass, even with Shia Lebouf. Tom Hardy and Dane Dehaan are so awesome. Gary Oldman appears in it somehow, but he's barely used. Guy Pearce is totally creepy.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is an engrossing and mind thrilling game... the challenges can be for everyone ... even my younger family members enjoy this game. I love watching the little clips with each level
B000ICZD5M|5.0|I have watched this movie I don't know how many times now and I still enjoy the heck out of it each time. It just has it all for us Sci-fy and fantasy fans.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this book. This book is so beautifully written for any genre, age-group. I don't care that it's characterized as YA, this book can be read by anyone who loves to read excellent prose. The emotions I felt while reading this book were so intense - I found myself crying through most of it.<br /><br />The characters and scenes are so well-developed that I could picture everything vividly in my mind. The heartbreak of this story had me sobbing for a good hour, but in a good way - because the book was just so amazing.<br /><br />It's hard to put into words why this book is so good - is it the characters who are so vivid and raw? Is it the age and time? Is it the plot? It's all of that and more.<br /><br />Do yourself and read this book and immerse yourself in the love of Eleanor & Park and the bittersweet tale of first love.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|this app is so cool. you can keep track of everything. this app has all kinds of cool notebooks.its wool cool
B007BVOEPI|5.0|very true to the book!  Excellent cast, awesome visuals, dangerous, intriguing, fun.  You won't regret watching Game of Thrones. period.

1781162646|5.0|Fun, quick read - since I got my Kindle, I haven't bought many non-ebooks.  This took me back to college when reading a King book was a treat - only alowed on quarterly breaks!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Well, if there IS anything as good in between, I certainly haven't heard it! &#34;Time&#34; is very solid start-to-finish, but definitely includes several potential hit singles as well.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I really enjoy this game when i can get it to work. I have been finding that more and more often the game freezes, won't open at all, or force closes.<br />Other than that annoying issue, the further you get into the game, the more challenges and rooms you get. I like that you can add random friends rather than be required to connect to Facebook or invite your own friends to play.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Very complex and well designed game. Similar to the Diablo 3 model, however, better considering it's produced for mobile devices. The market requires you to use gold which is found through various stages, creatures, chests and destructible environments. If you're not patient enough to grind the loot(gear) or items required to advance in the game you could always use money to purchase in game items to better your character. The game often crashes on my phone, which is not the best phone (HTC Amaze) and can sometimes have annoying periods of lag when playing multi-player. Overall - DH4 is a decent and well developed game for those you are familiar with and like(d) the aspect of the Diablo series or any other dungeon &#34;grinding&#34; game.
8866131369|5.0|As someone who loves to have a schedule, this is a perfect mix of structure and creativity. On the left side of the page is your weekly planner, but on the right is a blank page where you can expand on ideas, take notes, and flesh out some of your creative juices.

B00BO0GYW8|5.0|While zombie tales may be frequent and familiar, Max Brooks has crafted a unique entry for this overcrowded genre. The storytelling is conducted in the style of a series of interviews with survivors who played various roles in now (in terms of the time-frame for the story) recent zombie near apocalypse. The tale is fashioned as a companion to a more formal, official UN report on the now ended global zombie incident and includes more personal commentary and insights from various participants around the world. As such, while the various players are many, there is almost no character development. Instead, each commentary provides a unique and different perspectives from the early warnings to the final, still in progress, mopping up activities. The reader is forced to stitch together a more comprehensive understanding of events.<br /><br />What is particularly compelling is Brooks attention to cultural and ideological perspectives and allows biases to creep in that provide for a diverse and at times seemingly illogical reactions and responses. At the same time, he displays an experienced and nuanced understanding of the likely political and geopolitical responses and their ramifications. There are no individual heroes and the outcome is one more of sheer survival rather than conquest or victory.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love this app! Very handy and easy to use. I've loaded this app on everyone's kindle I know! It looks attractive and gently reminds me when to charge my favorite thing.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|not meant for younger audiences, but loved the twist of the original story as well as the witches scenery and special effects.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love the accuracy of Accuweather. It gets me ready for the day and is really accurate.<br />Definite must have.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Best of the series, to me.  This one is a wild ride and always full of surprises !!  Sylvia Day has made the Crossfire Series so much better than the &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; trilogy.
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies not only poses thought provoking questions about first contact, but stares unblinking at the duality of man.  In any one moment you can not be sure if you are witnessing the best or worst human behavior.
B009JZTQOS|4.0|A moderately enjoyable experience for me. I'm not much of an action movie geek, so it was hard for me to tell whether QT was referencing a classic or making it up in the scenes I liked the best. Cheech Marin and Harvey Keitel were great, as usual. Salma Hayek did some wonderfully raunchy things with a bottle of tequila (and no, not what you're thinking, so stop that right now.) Basically a good action thriller that morphed slowly into something wildly different. If I had to describe it on one word, that word would be &#34;wacky.&#34;
B008PZZV8S|2.0|I didn't care for it. I expected something more dark and sinister, less whiny. Matt Damon was not what I expected in this one. He did still play the role well, though. I just didn't care for the story at all. It moved too slowly and was uninteresting.
B003RUZKC8|4.0|I like buddy/outsider movies, so take that into consideration. This movie was not as standard as I expected. Sure, there's the required band of misfits who like to play with very large knives. But: the bad guy considers himself a true American patriot with a side business that just happens to include killing people who annoy him in minor ways. Also, there are some startlingly sweet touches that humanize the fellows a bit. Most of the rest is by-the-book. Pretty girl Zoe Saldana going for the creakiest actor in the whole movie, and yes, he's the leader of the pack and her character has a good reason for it, but still -- ick. At least she kicks ass and doesn't have to be saved all the time. It has quite a few funny moments, too -- more than I usually see. Definitely worth watching once -- possibly twice.
B006VZS1EA|4.0|Its an action movie that shows you have to keep fighting in life.  That a father-son bond is extremely important.  Not to mention the robot fighting scenes were pretty cool.  The ending made me want more.  My kid, husband and I loved it.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Grand daughter plays this game. She is 8. She says it is funny and sometimes annoying which is part of the fun. Not a game to play very long but a quick full in for in between times.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|It might take a few listens but Kanye spazzed on this album. There really arent any radio jams on the album but the quality of rap is still classic Kanye.
B00881PTRC|4.0|Grand daughter and I both like playing this, sometimes together sometimes separately. Good way to practice vocabulary and vowels review fresh.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|If you are thinking of buying season 2, you probably are already sold on the the show. The upside to this package is it comes with Blue Ray (which I use at home) and the DVD version (which I take with me if I want to watch it away for home or a friend wants to borrow the series who doesn't have Blue Ray).
B005IQZB14|5.0|I cried in 4 different places of this book and did so unexpectedly. I wish I could read it again brand new. Probably the best nonfiction I've read in 10 years.
B00B9LNLTQ|3.0|With this album The Strokes decided to stay with the 80's electronica feel they had on their last album, instead of returning to their garage rock roots. I liked &#34;Angles.&#34; Thought it was an interesting direction for the band, and that it produced some really good tracks. With that said, I thought it would have been more of an experiment than a progression. This album seems to suggest differently.<br /><br />It is a solid album. I actually think it works a little better in the old school &#34;album&#34; format of listening to it from beginning to end, than it does in the new digital age of just producing some singles. I'm surprised they went with 'All The Time' as their first single since 'Welcome to Japan is probably the catchiest track.<br /><br />All in all it is a solid album. If you are a Strokes fan you will find enough there to warrant the purchase. But if you are like me it will leaving you wanting the Strokes that put out songs like 'Last Night' and 'New York City Cops.'
B00BLSJI80|4.0|The first four songs ...Great! The rest of the CD Eh.... not so much. Liked Unbroken all the way through!
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Great OST and great animations while giving me something to smile about. What else do I need? Oh, right, more anime like it.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Even if the endoing could have been better, this book took a hold of me for quite some time. I loved some of the turns in the plot. Good summer reading.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Our family has found a treasure in the work of Hayao Miyazaki!  Refreshing in it's tales of children who are the &#34;stars&#34; of these wonderful tales. My grandchildren, ages 4-8 when they first watched this video, are now 6 through 11, who still enjoy this video, as well as the other videos that we have found from Miyazaki! I'm always on the look out for his new additions to his wonderful perceptions of children, the lessons they learn, and presented in an addictive way to their young viewers. As an adult, I'm as rivited as my grandchildren, when we've watched many of Miyazaki's movies together.<br />These are real treasures for children of all ages!
B003XU3MWM|4.0|If you are not put off by blood and gore. It's a decent movie. The wife had to leave the room though.
B00DIJ49UW|3.0|*** 1/2<br /><br />The lovechild of Guillermo del Toro, Pacific Rim is one of the most interesting properties to be released during the Summer months in several years. A homage to both kaiju cinema and the mecha anime genre, Pacific Rim is del Toro's first production since 2008′s Hellboy II: The Golden Army. The reason for the lapse in the popular director's career were the production hells of The Hobbit and The Mountains of Madness. It was just three days after Mountains fell apart due to preproduction negotiations that del Toro signed up for Pacific Rim, with complete creative control. He wrote the script with Travis Beacham, who although has not gathered much attention has put significant effort into building the world of the film before he even began work on the screenplay. This can be seen in many promotional posters and the graphic novel \\"Tales from Year Zero\\", which acts as a prequel to the film and narrates the creation of the Jaegars.<br /><br />For this epic conflict between giant monsters and collosal robots, del Toro turned to Ramin Djawadi. Djawadi is most known for Game of Thrones, whose music started off poorly but has gained a stronger presence in the years. He also composed the music for Iron Man and Clash of the Titans, both of which were poor contributions to their films. With those two soundtracks he sacrificed complex orchestrations for banally simple melodies; style over substance at its most blatant. With Pacific Rim Djawadi manages to keep a fine balance between the two philosophies.<br /><br />For Pacific Rim del Toro wanted a union of orchestra and rock elements, a musical style most blatantly exploited in the Iron Man trilogy. We see this with the opening cue \\"Pacific Rim\\", and we immediately receive the benefit of Djawadi's collaboration with guitarist Tom Morello. We get a powerful melody that executes the strengths of both an orchestra and rock, that although repetitive at times remains memorable and avoids having the rock guitar overwhelm the orchestra. Electronica elements are also employed, but not excessively so. This cue is also the first time that we see the Humanity motif, which we will see one last time in \\"Go Big or Go Extinct\\". One of the albums biggest problems is the lack of unifying themes. \\"Gipsy Danger\\" is very familiar to \\"Pacific Rim\\" in tone and style, although it is lacking the opening cue's memorability.<br /><br />With \\"Canceling the Apocalypse\\" we get a cue that employs the rock guitar as a sympathetic force, rather than an empowering one. Although not exactly uncommon in cinema - we can look at Elliot Goldenthal's \\"S.W.A.T.\\" - it is not so often we see one in a summer blockbuster. This execution is most welcome, but the guitar gives way to the orchestra so that it can give some insight into the characters.<br /><br />With the next track, \\"Just a Memory\\" we not only get our first fully orchestral piece but also our first sight of the Kaiju motif. Although an exciting piece, mention should be given to just how bare bones the Kaiju motif is. At essentially just brass being played at their height with percussion pounding between each blast, it is a horribly simple representation of the villains of the film. The Kaiju are more than just monsters - they are everything humanity fears in this near futuristic age. They have radically changed every aspect of human culture. By all extents they are a walking natural disaster. How can something so complex be given such a simple musical identity?<br /><br />The frank answer is that it doesn't. It barely touches the surface. When composing for the original Godzilla in 1954, Akira Ifukube produced a complex orchestral work, and the titular monster was given a varied and franchise defying theme. The Kaiju of Pacific Rim have nothing on this scale.<br /><br />\\"2500 Tons of Awesome\\" sees the return of the Kaiju theme, with some minor alterations. It can essentially be thought as a summarization of the motif, while \\"Just a Memory\\" was our introduction.<br /><br />\\"The Shatterdome\\", \\"Better Than New\\", \\"Pentecost\\", all make use of synthesizers designed in the style of Vangelis. Even more so, they are done in unison with the orchestra, instead of overruling theme. The two musical ideas work together to great effect, and to see this happen is a rare treat in modern film scoring. \\"The Shatterdome\\" is also one of the few times that Djawadi will use chorus - but unlike previous efforts where chorus was nothing less than screeching wails, the chorus in \\"Shatterdome\\" takes on an almost patriotic tone. The words seem to be a language of sorts, rather than just the wordless \\"ahhs\\" that seem to be so prevalent in modern Western soundtracks.<br /><br />\\"Mako\\" in contrast makes use of a single, intimate female singer, but she sings wordlessly. The cue creates an emotional film for Rinko Kukichi's character, who was one of the survivors of the initial Kaiju assaults.  The cue does a great job of establishing the troubled past of the character, but avoids the pitfalls of displaying her as someone in need of rescue.<br /><br />\\"Call Me Newt\\", and \\"Jaeger Tech\\", are the most lighthearted tracks of the score. The electric guitar makes a return in both, although in very different ways; \\"Newt\\" harkens back to the opening minute of \\"Canceling the Apocalypse\\", while the bombastic execution of \\"Jaeger Tech\\" is similar to the first two tracks. They are entertaining enough, but not exactly memorable. It is hard to recall a defining series of notes from either tracks.<br /><br />\\"To Fight Monsters, We Created Monsters\\" is another action cue and essentially begins the acceleration of the soundtrack. From this point on the music just gets louder and more aggressive. Although slightly slowed down by \\"Better Than New\\", the speed is preserved the trilogy \\"We Are The Resistance\\", \\"Double Event\\", and \\"Striker Eureka\\". \\"Resistance\\" begins far too slowly, but once the chorus makes a return around the :40 mark the cue becomes one of the most defining of the soundtrack. The guitar acts as an undercurrent to the orchestra in \\"Striker Eureka\\", and along with the fast paced strings creates a thrilling action piece.<br /><br />\\"Physical Compatibility\\" tries to use tribal drums along with guitar to create a sympathetic cue, but the results are unevenly mixed.<br /><br />In \\"Category 5″ we see a return of both the \\"Kaiju\\" motif (this theme employed with chorus) and the \\"Jaeger\\" motif from \\"Gipsy Danger\\". The cue itself is one of the most exciting of the entire score, and manages a fine balance between the horror of the situation and the adrenaline rush of the battle.<br /><br />\\"Pentecost\\" is the theme for Edris Elba's character, Stacker Pentecost who acts as the commander of the Jaeger program. Intermixing the Vangelis electronics along with solo horns, he creates a theme for a character that has the weight of the world on his shoulders.

B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|We are a board game family (2 kids, 6 and 8 years old) with over 60 games in our library... This is a great &#34;filler&#34; game.  You can play it for ten minutes if that is all you have or an hour if you're in the mood.  It is easy to learn, simple to play, but has some interesting mechanics that keep it interesting.  We found it a bit challenging for our 6 year old pick up on some of the deductive reasoning that helps you win, but she still enjoys playing, and can easily understand the mechanics.  Overall it was a good quality game and we enjoy playing it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Silver linings starts out slow, and a bit depressing but then quickly gain speed and turns out heartfelt with a sliver lining.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not worth a darn.  Lousy writing and not worth reading.  All the hype is just bull it is not worth the money
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I downloaded the game, and downloaded all the extra stuff also that it requires you to download, now the game won't open on my Kindle. (Fire HD) I'm sad, really love Iron Man, but apparently he doesn't love me back :-(
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever made I wish it was real that wold be awesome. so far I have made a movie theater a 3 story house and a house in the shape of a t
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app. Can do just about anything you  want. Great details. Great functionality.<br />Would highly recommend this app. Have had no trouble using it.
B004KAB3ZM|5.0|This book was quite a page turner. For someone like me who's always been a bit of a space nerd with a particular fascination with the moon, this book helped describe the thought process and technical achievement that made it all possible. This was all topped off by his humor which provided many laugh out loud moments, and by the time I reached the last page I didn't want it to end.  A must read
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very challenging and fun. Hope they Come up with new levels. love this . Game. Some of them are hard though cause you have different rooms.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|i seen them before but when you can see them without commercials it really makes them better. Trekie for ever.
1609611543|5.0|This is  NOT A DIET.,... it is a new way of eating...and new lifestyle. It works though! and I'm not even doing it totally correct.  Cheating some on the weekends, but still lost 8 pounds in 3 weeks!
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Over rated but still good. I wouldn't go to the theater to see it, but on Amazon the price was right.
B00328R21C|1.0|I like the landspeeeder but there is no compartment for the lightsaber. Also the bendy stick like things are hard to implement into the vehicle. The vehicle isn't durable either.Also the price is to high for a product of this quality I mean 40 dollars come on that's way to much for this piece of junk. Very upset.
B003WUYR6I|5.0|This one is an instant favorite.  All of Michael Connelly's best characters - Mickey, Harry, McFierce, and Waller.  Great story line.  Can't wait for the next one in the series - it's obviously already being written!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a good game that forces you to use your brain. The in app ads are okay since the app is free.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome! Love it!!!:) bskzu gsb zkzkiz jjh hzbzjz ooziz Babylon ians oaks Shia kids oaks Sinai sins subsidy Donald sins is oaks sons Odeon London and sons discussions sins sins s!!
B001EC3JME|5.0|excellent and works great for any law enforcement field.  highly recommendable it's affordable and works great with any small to medium flashlight
B0091REZMW|3.0|This a good game will keep the brain alert. I enjoy it better on my computer, my tablet is to small. Better on a large screen.
B0011EVSGE|1.0|This video was o very poor quality and I do not recommen buying. We watched it for 20 minutes and then decided to purchase the HD version, which was much better. In any case, fantastic movie and the kids loved it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is excellent.  Please hurry with season 4 and 5.<br />I am watching seasons 1, 2 and 3 again because it is so good.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for having Downton Abbey 1, 2 & 3 on instant que.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Season 3 does not disappoint. The acting and story line only get better as the seasons progress. It's very well done!
B0092S4WLY|2.0|This game would get better reviews if it was a little harder and if it had more levels. Only nine levels... Mindanao lame.
B00D6BQG1W|2.0|They just bring the story on too quickly. You don't have a chance to warm up the characters to make any interaction between them believable. Just a few minor edits and changes could have made this film a nice romantic comedy; maybe in the Director's Cut.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the Crossfire books but this ending left me disappointed. I can't believe it would leave you in a lurch and not knowing when the next book comes out. With that said I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had never read Stephen King before this book, as I have trouble suspending disbelief.  However, once you overlook the feasibility of time travel, you are hooked into the mid century history.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It is an entertaining movie that is worth watching. Some inexplicable changes from the book, but that is usually the case with these types of movies.
B00CM03H4C|5.0|This came quickly, it's the music score from the new movie as stated, be aware this is NOT period music but based on the 2013 movie with hip hop music.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good game for when you can only play a few minutes at a time. Makes you think. Good for working on your problem solving skills.
B001974DG0|5.0|A great story with some characters you developed strong feelings for and want them to win. There is some scare over the true implications the story has in the real world.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I especially like the ability to add public cameras to mine.  I can check traffic when I get back to the airport to see the drive home.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Strategy is a bit elusive, but very good for passing time...and its got dinosaurs!  Needs more missions in the undersea portion of the park.
B004VOBIE8|4.0|Allows me to go through the downloaded documents and use a proper pdf reader on them.  Haven't tried other uses.
B009ZQNCSC|4.0|Excellent until the end. The ending was wrapped up too fast - the director seemed to be in a big hurry to bring this promising version to a quick and tidy end. The acting was outstanding.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Neceisary for the kindle if you download pdf documents.  It give the abilities one is used to on a pc.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great fun to watch when it's too hot to do anything else, and one can live vicariously though the &#34;Arrow&#34;.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love it cause it challenges your brain just wish it would let you save your progress on a level rather than make you star all over
B004VD3YIM|5.0|Works great with my ip cam and old android phone running ip cam software.  With these 2 cameras running I can keep an eye on the kids where ever the are.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play this eveyday!  The graphic are great and the game is fun.  It's easy enough to win most of the time if you are willing to put some thought into it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this site . With all the help it gives in many areas of the bible . The Study guide , the many types of version and just easy to use .
B0092S4WLY|1.0|There are no direction -- not even a clue.  Well I start to work it out, I click on things that should work but they don't. Frustration.  Then I try again and those things now work.  Too frustrating to continue.  Deleted it.
0780622650|5.0|Great remake of an Old TV Sitcom , I remember it and watched it back then also. All the great actors an actresses played the characters very good . It also helped putting in place just how they got LOST IN SPACE . GREAT MOVIE.
B001NA6096|4.0|The first in a trilogy.  Make sure to follow through.  The firm is a sweet and simple love story, beautifully acted and directed.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|it exits the game to home when I access my dragonvale park because of the stupid update its horrible. When is it going to end bull$###.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Life has gotten more complicated for our couple, but their story continues.  The path of true love is not always straight or smooth.  Can the fairy tale be saved?  The movie is as well-crafted as the first and worth watching.  And do stick with the story for the last film, &#34;Before Midnight.&#34;  You will care enough about these people to see them through another nine years.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I love it!!! Read this in middle school forgot how good it was. Can't wait to start the next book
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever! I cant get it on computer, i dont have an Xbox ,but this is the best! I have 7.1 and its great! Soon they might be adding wolves, infinite worlds, and endermen! This game is the best! First you punch a tree. Then craft wooden planks. Make a crafting table. Then get more wood and craft into wooden planks and make some sticks. Make a sword and a pick . Youll be set.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app.  the best part about it is being able to set  up the math problems.  By using this, I have to wake up enough to do some calculating and by the time I'm finished,  I am wide awake.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I didn't think I could possibly get into a show about meth cooking and dealing when all my friends kept saying, &#34;You have to watch it, you will love it&#34; (in fact, I questioned how well my friends really knew me before questioning both their morality and how I must be--or not be--projecting my own), but, finally giving in and watching it:  I was hooked.<br /><br />As the seasons go on you come to see this bigger picture where the whole series is, not so much a stereotypical battle between good and evil, but more a chronological accounting of how evil insidiously takes over due to the inevitable fact that with power comes corruption.<br /><br />On the surface the plot sounds pretty much morally reprehensible with the &#34;but.... He did the bad thing for a good reason&#34; justification, but once you start to wade deeper into the multiple seasons and deeper meaning propping up the shallow premise...  For me, there came a point when the enormity and brilliance of the underlying &#34;moral of the story&#34; hit me in its entirety and I am stunned and reeling to see how the battle will ultimately end.<br /><br />I hope I'm not the only one or just &#34;reading too deeply&#34; between the lines because, otherwise, I would really have to question the motives of Breaking Bad's many fans' addiction to the series and the deeper implication that has towards the values of our society as a whole.
B005URRCUY|3.0|Save for one cut, \\"Lonely Boy,\\" and a great cut it is, which has the hook, the vocals to be deserving of a great hit that it is. However, that formula is repeated a few times on other songs with less success. It boils down to lyrical ineptitude and the hooks are too few and far between. I'm sure Bernie Taupin is still available.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|What can I say, the man is fantastic...its a shame that it took me 40 years to hear this poet and his music, I LOVE THE MUSIC OF RODRIGUEZ.....
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|If you want to sit back and enjoy a lot of action then this is your movie.  I was OK with my 7 year old watching it. the violence was not too graphic or scary.
B003VANOFY|1.0|when i first got this item it was pretty good. very comfortable, but i never tested the mic before and that was dumb of me. turns out mic never worked, and i would be talking to myself in game... and wondered why no one would ever answer my questions. also, sound died within a year? only had this for 9 months and now all i hear is static. VERY disappointed in this headset costing over $100.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was long awaited and when it finally arrived I remembered why I fell in love with Gideon & Eva. They have such a chemistry with each other, that I get lost in. Both have changed so much for each and risked a life they have grown comfortable in just to be with each other and keep each other safe. As damaged as they are I cannot wait for books 4 & 5 to see where their stories take them.
0786867973|3.0|There was nothing in the description about missing cover of the book. Disappointed. Next time, please specify the actual state of the book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|By far the best, most intriguing and riveting of the series.  A must read, will be nearly impossible to put down.
B007AFBYYY|5.0|Excellent movie with amazing photography.  The quality of the movie and the audio is very good.  Recommended very much. Thanks
B00CWY76CC|3.0|its fun and challenging but this having rate it and write a review just to keep playing is pure b.s.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|Interesting premise with a lot of good characters.  Special effects are a bit weak, but just watch it. The ending is worth it.
B005RJ6CBU|5.0|The songs on this album are a huge step forward for Darren. They have a modern quality with the same Darren sound we have come to love. This album sends you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. I'd say it is his best album yet!
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|good price, fast delivery, great band. Every track worth a listen. Maybe a newer band but their music is old time hard rock and roll.
B00DB3HJ8E|5.0|So I've been watching this show on netflix. I read all the 1 star reviews and i just dont get them. I thought the show was very well done even if a few parts where predictable. I love it when the audience is talked to and smirked to. It's great.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is the best game ever I don't care what ppl say it rocks and its perfect for all ages
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Looking for something different and thought I would try this. Totally addicted.  Got stuck in one room and asked my daughter for help, now she is hooked.
B004UID2LC|2.0|My YouTube is not working I can click the video but it won't stop loading I waited forever and my video still wouldn't come on. That's bad.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really liked this app. It only has ten levels at this time but more to come it said. That's why I gave it only four stars.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book for this year that I've read! I also love the movie for this book. So good everyone should read it
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Got this for my Kindle Fire. Worked great. Faster than the built-in reader. Also search capability is good. Quality product.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Academy Awards for Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Smith and Billy Connoly...Tom Courtney as well and ALL the supporting cast.  Best movie of its type in years...about the life and humore of old folksw without being condescending.
B0071BGOJC|3.0|I had great expectatons for this sequel, but somehow the story and<br />most of the main characters remained rather flat and unexciting.<br />That being said, it is still a good read.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This book fulfills several objectives. It teaches how the brain acts and reacts under new biological investigations. And it also gives a fantastic orientation to good willing readers looking for a strong change, for the good, of their will power. It also analyzes why and how we take many wrong actions that hurt ourselves and our interest. I recommend it to anyone who wants to change their everyday reactions to stimuli originated in our  wide world.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Excellent documentary-excellent recording-excellent artist/musician. This and Coming From Reality are both worth having in your collection if you were a fan of Bob Dylan, Tim Buckely, Nick Drake and the classic production of that late '60's early '70's era. Especially if you are a bass player-the bass playing and where it sits in the mix is great!
B007FIY3VW|1.0|Does not work on my fire hd. Also I cannot find how to get a refund on it.<br />A waste of time.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Saw the documentary (loved it) and instantly ordered his 2 recordings (Cold Fact & this one) Love everything about it. (concept-production-lyrics-voice-musicianship) Music that stood the test of time.
B009CPIR9K|5.0|You know if you want to watch it just by being told it's about Nazis coming from The Moon.  If that doesn't interest you, then don't watch this movie. If you're looking for a very entertaining film to watch with some friends, this is a great choice.
0345529057|5.0|WOW.... this is really worth taking the time to get INTO IT, learn who all those new strange people<br />are and what goes on in these far away amazing fantasy worlds.  HBO is now airing a GAME OF THRONES<br />TV SERIES based on the first book, so far, and it truly is a credit to the author's vision.<br />  I read through this entire series of books somewhat like a hot knife through butter and then promptly<br />re-read it again - slowly -  for pure enjoyment and to catch what I may have missed the first read thru.<br />What an imagination this writer has, and thus far he shows every sign of being quite a prolific writer.<br />So we can expect to hear much more on the lives of the characters we know & love, (or love to hate).<br />  This is a marvelously rich, and visually luscious read containing some very surprising turns and twists<br />which come sneaking up on you DEAR READER, SO watch out for these amazing twists and turns which couldn't<br />have EVER been anticipated.<br />  It IS WONDERFUL TO BE SO WELL ENTERTAINED BY AN ENTIRE SERIES OF BOOKS !!!!  You will NOT be in any<br />way disappointed DEAR READER - all of these series are literally little gems. Happy Reading and EMJOY~!!
1446303314|5.0|I just love this author's stuff. The designs are just simple and easy to use. I have most of her books and use them frequently.
B0026145WK|5.0|Action that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie!  Great movie to watch with your teens to show them the possible dangers of the outside world.
B009KHCT94|4.0|3.75/ 5 stars, rounded to 4.<br /><br />Not that I thought Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning--perhaps Finland's most famous export other than NOKIA--was a bad film or anything, but Iron Sky is better than I expected it would be.<br /><br />- References to Star Wars, Strangelove, and Der Untergang are well-placed, and I thought I even spotted a few nods to Firefly and Heinlein.  The music even briefly references none other than the Pink Floyd record that you'd probably imagine it *would* reference, in light of the subject matter!<br /><br />- The special effects are mostly pretty darned good, and avoid such chroma-related issues such as depth-of-field problems better than most green-screen-intensive productions do.  The \\"roto\\" work *does* seem to mess up a few strands of flowing hair here and there, but this is still a well-made film.  As other reviewers have pointed out, Iron Sky is a farcical tale.  Please don't expect utter realism from the special effects!<br /><br />- To those who have said that the film is anti-American:  Finns don't hate all Americans, especially not Conan O'Brien, Bj&ouml;rn T&uuml;roque, and Beatallica.  I haven't met very many Finns, but they've all been nice to me, the ones that I have met.<br /><br />- Running out of room, but I guess that I ought to explain the title of my review:  I based it on my \\"Buffalaxed\\" American mishearing of the frequently-heard but seldom-understood dialogue from the above-mentioned film Der Untergang.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! It was a nice change in pace from the books I have been reading a lot.
B00499NHLC|5.0|if you like the movies, then you'll probably like this series. the cases are always intriguing and holmes & watson are witty
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Didn't think I would really like Downton Abbey very much?<br />Once I watched a couple episodes, I am hooked.<br />I want more....
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I use this app often.  Its a basic calculator that is easy to use.  Comes in handy when doing bills or balancing the check book.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Really, really bad! I don't understand either bc ive enjoyed the actors in other films.. It was like a made for TV movie. I couldn't even get my wife to stay until the end.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I like this app, but I don't really use it b/c I have one on my phone that works just as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a awesome fun game.some of the games are really fun.but you have to pay money that you make in the game
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I found this series to be very captivating and a fast reader.  I definitely would recommend the series to others.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I read it in 1 day! I was expecting a wonderful closure, but I feel I bit down. The drama was not enough, I feel a lack of strength on Gideon character and the story line kind of loose. I really expected more of this 3rd book. However, The discovery of a fourth book bring on some hope =)  excuse my grammar and spelling I'm a spanish native
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I haven't finished this book, but find it very intriguing.  I would recommend the entire series to friends and family.
B000AP04L0|5.0|If you have ever had a job working in a cubicle or had problems with equipment such as a printer that constantly gives you trouble, you will likely love this DVD.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I'm not completely through the book yet, but its a good story.  It catches your attention right from the beginning which makes you want to read it all in one sitting.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|great acting and outstanding plot. can't wait for the next seasons to come out. definitely a must see. there isn't anything inappropriate and even smaller children can watch it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought this was one of the best books that I've read this year.  I waited to watch the movie until I finished the book.  The movie didn't do the book justice.  Definitely worth reading.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|What can you say . . it is Rod Stewart and he has been a favorite of mine for many years.  Listen each time I start my car.  Love him and his CD.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book.  I really didn't have that much spare time to read, but squeezed this in at every opportunity.  Definitely would recommend this book.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This is a must see series. I can't wait for Season 2 to arrive. Great series for adult males and females!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I personally haven't used this app, but my husband seems to really like it.  He said its really easy to play.
0307352153|5.0|Susan Cain's book is well written, well researched and she made it pleasant to read with great live examples.<br />I saw so many things I recognized and it gives me lots of hope...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book caught your attention immediately and ended up being a fast read.  I would recommend the whole series to family and friends.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Good for at least 2 full charges!!!  Good to protect the ear piece when not in use.  Could have used some tips on how to use it.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I have read several of the John Corey books by Nelson DeMille.  They are riveting!  This book is no exception!
006178480X|5.0|I read this book in less than 48 hours, I could not put it down!!!  Stellar as always-- the fabulous writing, intriguing plot and badass yet lovable characters keep you turning page after page after page.  I laughed, I cried, I was so involved I read some lines out loud as if I were the character speaking them.  Fabulous!  When's the next one coming out? :-)
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|I am a major Tim Burton fan and look forward to every movie he is involved with. I felt that this show was good, but it wasn't as good as I had hoped for. It's worth watching though. I wish it hadn't been done in black and white and they had went with the typical dark theme that Burton usually goes with.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love playing this, its so addictive that I play it every day 24/7. Even though I only have one friend who plays this. :( me sad
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I watched this with my kids and they just loved it. They've already asked if they could watch it again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is great but could always be better maybe add in decals change the vehicles colors be able to name the driver small things that would draw more people to play
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My kids just seem to love this movie. They watch it over and over and it just never gets old.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Always been an all time favorite and still is. Could watch it over and over again. Still a classic in my book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I have watched this show since it first aired and I would recommend this series to anyone. They have some awesome writers that just know how to keep the story line moving and how leave you waiting for the next episode. The makeup artist are just amazing! You've got to be able to handle some blood and guts to hang with this series though.
B003LQ3YXU|1.0|Boring, no real plot to it. Was quite distasteful to my liking. Herd about it from a friend and it didnt intrigue me at all. I don't recommend this show.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|We had a monsters weekend.  Rented Monsters, Inc. and saw Monsters U in the theater.  Creative movie.  Good themes.  Cute animal characters.  Nice not to have to explain inappropriate language and behavior.  Good for all ages.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its pretty good considering its on a mobile device! I really enjoyed the computer version and i really enjoy this version
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I love the Fever Series. Cannot get enough Mac and Barrons. Read them in order. To get more details, read the Highlander series first, but not necessary. Highlander is more romance. Good, but different from the Fever Series.
B00004RF83|5.0|Kirk and Burt together are the best combination any story could ask for.  I don't have to wait for Turner Classics to show it. I miss nearly every viewing.
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|I enjoyed reading this.  It was extremely long and very wordy but the subject matter was very interesting.  India is a fascinating place. Shantaram read like an autobiography.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good graphics, they are never blurry. Good horses though I did  you find have to wait as long for the tasks and such.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This game was well worth the price. The mystery was challenging without being too difficult. The puzzles were varied and the graphics were very good.
B009RH973I|5.0|It's a bit more of a hot pink, compared to the picture attached.<br /><br />Other than that, the product so far is as described. It is definitely for the Kindle HD ( has spaces in all the right places) and is easy to install the Kindle and uninstall. It has a hard cover ( which I like as I have a lot in my bag) and, the front faux leather layer that goes over the screen is heavy enough.<br /><br />Only con that I can think of is that might wear out within the year. And this is to be expected. Would recommend.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This puzzling game is a lot of fun. There are no written instructions, but if you just look around, think, and look some more, you find what you need. I just wish they had more floors.
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|First Total Recall was better. The story in this remake was just a bunch of nonsense. I gave this movie 1 star because after imagining Colin Farrell as Derrek Zoolander the movie is not that bad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think Subway surfers is the best game ever created because I believe it is very funny watching Jake,Tricky,and Fresh get chased by a fat man and a dog
B004N6369Y|4.0|Great reading, I felt like I was right there every moment with Heloise living her experience.  One of Danielle Steele's best books.
0062082353|5.0|Very interesting to read, especially knowing the truth about some things that have gone on in this world that seem unreal.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Highly recommended game. Keeps you guessing and it is addicting! Love this game. It does not getboring at all. Very good mind game as well.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Use this for work over my VPN and it works flawlessly.  I have had no issues with it and would recommend it to any techie who needs a VNC or RDP app
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great show with wonderful characters!  The Show hooks you in pretty quickly...........oops!  That was season #1...........but only continues to deliver!<br /><br />Roy
B0055S348W|1.0|No driver for my brand new printer. Generic doesn't work, period. App is essentially useless asfar as wireless printing goes.<br /><br />How hard is it to get the driver that's publicly available on Canon's website?!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Well done and CLEAN.  As a Christian father, I am cautious with what I allow my kids to watch.  There isn't any nudity or crude language.  The violence is very minimal, as well.
0553382179|5.0|There are certain people born organized--and then...there are the rest of us. This book is helping me get my life under control 15 minutes at a time. The author talks a lot about perfectionism which for people who look at us unorganized folk seems to be contradictory. But the whole point is we can't seem to organize because it'll never be good enough. The author has helped me understand that yes, doing something is better than doing nothing and I don't have to have my house perfect in order for me to have it be nice.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This has been my favorite show since a was very young.If you haven't seen it, your missing out. Your kids and grand kids will love it.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I thought this movie was really good. I hope there's gonna be a part 2 the only thing I didn't like was the end I wish the would of showed more with da boy
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My Grandsons enjoy the game. They are learning to think out of the box and enjoy being successful. The hand-eye coordination is good for their reading and writing also.
B004UJ81IA|5.0|Beautiful prose about a very historically interesting part of the world.  I read as a follow up to another donkey trek over the spiritual passage called, &#34;The Way.&#34;
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|my kids loved this app. Have even been playing this lately over minecraft. Definitely recommend this game to others for sure.
B00008S7KC|5.0|If you are a Pink Floyd fan then this is a must have for your collection.<br /><br />The production quality is very high, especially considering when this was made.  They perform some of their classic songs incredibly.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I love the story.. and how it played out. It was great how all became in the land of Oz.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|I bought this chip for my old (2003) Olympus camera whose 256 meg chip was much too small.  The problem, of course, is that Olympus uses the small XS chip which is used by almost no one else.  This chip works in my camera, but when I turn on the camera, it takes 10-15 seconds to warm up with the new chip inside.  One can miss some pictures this way, but the trade-off is not having to worry about running out of space.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Very good movie with outstanding special effects I recommend this to all shi fi lovers. Good acting great plot lots of action. This is a movie to watch over and over. My wife and I watch it about every three months.
B009NY43NY|3.0|After all the complaints about the ending of the series, I feel this resolution makes a great deal of sense. I've enjoyed reading about Sookie' s trials and tribulations over the years. Now if only True Blood would follow Ms Harris's story lines more closely.
B000AP04NI|5.0|This is a review of the movie, not the quality of the DVD.<br /><br />Referring to other reviewers who thought the acting was a bit stiff.....this wonderful MUSICAL was made when they cast singers in the lead roles instead of big name stars who have to have their voices dubbed. Referring to another member's review that felt the dream sequence was too scary for children - not any scarier than Snow White or Bambi. Life has frightening moments in it; children shouldn't be sheltered from all of them. I saw this movie for the first time when I was seven or eight and yes, the dream sequence was a bit disturbing, as it was meant to be, but I was more aware of the sheer artistry of it. Rogers and Hammerstein didn't feel that because they were making a musical that it had to be sugar coated. All of their musicals have a serious side which makes them more complex and all the better for it. With their transcendent melodies and insightful lyrics and incredible choreography Rogers and Hammerstein raised the bar for musicals to come. Oh What a Beautiful Movie!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Nice variation of hidden object games. The graphics are superb, the music adds to the &quot;mystery&quot; of the manor.  8D
B000I8G5GW|5.0|I think I am speaking for most women when I say that war movies are not my favorite genre. However, this is not your typical war movie. It is a fascinating character study of the madness of the men who have chosen and are devoted to military life and the impact their decisions have on the lives of the men and women who get swept up into their dustbin of insanity. Sir David Lean, the director, grew up in a Quaker family, which I believe helps to explain his perspective in this film and others of his. The movie is best seen on a large screen in order to do justice to the cinematography, scenery, and sheer scope of this epic. A film treasure!
0805047905|5.0|My 1 year old LOVES this book.  I heard from someone at the library that this an excellent book for developing vocabulary skills so  I bought it.  I think I've read this about 4 times in a row to my baby.  Once it's over, she wants me to read it again right away. The pages are nice and thick and I'm sure we'll read it 100 more times.
B000RFPORM|5.0|I was about 13 when I stumbled into this movie. I was camping at the beach at the time and my friends and I wanted to go into town and see a movie. We didn't know what was playing and we didn't care. We had no idea what we were in for. I was totally transfixed and amazed. Over the years I took all my friends to see 81/2 . It is unlike any other movie. Fellinni truly takes you into another world and many of the images never leave you, like a surreal and haunting dream that you can't seem to fully awaken from. Truly one of a kind and a masterpiece!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|a decent challenge, I'm only on level 10 but its been interesting so far. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to look for clues to solve puzzles. hint: you may need a scrap piece of paper for some levels to keep little notes.
B005MLP8E0|2.0|Definitely overrated! The work of an amatuerish and pretentious director. The acting was overwroght and I felt like I was watching a stage play. He tried every camera angle and lighting technique he could think of. The characters were never that interesting or sympathetic. Innovative does not automatically equate with good and in this case less might have been more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever pluayed. It has the suspense, the surprise, and the adventure.  Although, it is kind of a bad example because it starts with your person doing grafiti, then throuhvthe whole thing you are running from a cop. So kids, don't do tradition or run away from a cop. But other then that, this game is super fun and I love it.
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|I love the traditional musical genre, but there is nothing traditional about Cabaret . I just love it for what it is...pure genius... original in every way. It is clear that Bob Fosse was reaching for the heights...and he made it. He had the audacity to make a musical about the rise of the Nazi movement in pre-war Germany and make it work. Although a serious thread runs through the movie, it is highly entertaining and enjoyable. An original from start to finish. The recent Chicago was an imitation and boring from start to finish. Cabaret is a musical, an art film, a tragedy and a comedy all sublimely rolled into one. Go see the Cabaret!
B00CXX8KTA|5.0|Great songs, melodies, lead guitar and vocals.  Whats not to like?  Phil is gone but I believe Scott Gorham did him proud with this.  It is NOT a copy or a ripoff, it is instead a great new band and sound that simply reminds you of how classy and melodic real rock used to be.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|As much as anything, The September Issue is the fascinating story of two giants, Anna Wintour and Grace Coddington, and the world they lead in fashion. Many others - especially Andre Leon Talley - play key roles in that same world. The documentary is visually delicious with perfect music that helps tell the story. The DVD includes delightful, additional features. Brilliant editing as well.
1781162646|5.0|This is a fun read.  King doing what he does best and that's tell a story. It isn't an epic but it is a fun read.  I always enjoy Stephen King.
B00C1BTWV4|1.0|regretted this purchase. picture quality was horrible, as if it was copied over and over on a VHS tape then put through your tv..I was shocked really. never do this again
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|the new sabbath album 13, it sounds like any sabbath album in the ozzy era, most of the riffs are variations of the same old sabbath songs.....so whats up with the hype?, the reunion its whats up. its always nice to hear a reunion album from a band that we love  like sabbath,but even better to attend a concert , we know that they are going to play no more than 2 songs from this album ....thank god, what i cant understand is the lack of good songs, in the dio era all their albums sounded fresh, i dont know why i dont feel that with this one.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is both funny and dramatic.  The cast is wonderful and really pulls you in.  I watched season 1 and season 2 in a week!  Now I can't wait for season 3.  This is worth watching.  The ONLY thing I wish is that they did not say GD as much as they do.  Please pick another cuss word if you have to.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book was excellent  3/4 of the way through.  The end did not  tie up the loose ends as intended and was really not necessary.  Too many hanger-on characters were brought in at the end that were only confusing and added nothing to an otherwise excelllent book. I do, however, heartily recommend it.
1881273873|5.0|This book is an informative and instructional read in a good way especially if applied on people in your life.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Tom Hanks should be ashamed, but like all of  the rest of Hollywood; doing crappy films is the new normal!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I enjoyed learning about this war from different perspectives across the world. That said, this book didn't grip me (no pun intended) This maybe attributed to the fact that no one character is fully developed. There is no central protagonist that we empathize with.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|App is very easy to use on my kindle fire, in fact I like it better then my laptop. I've been using it for seven months and have yet to experience any issues.
B0018RC7QE|3.0|Movie was somewhat slow in places.  Not the greatest writing to keep it moving.  Did watch it through to the end, but wouldn't see it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game!!! My mom and sister and I played this game together...it was great...it's a clean game and very challenging. I hope they . Make more levels soon:)
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|I love the game, there is one problem on kindle fire hd though, it is that you can't use the monkey apprentice and summon the Phoenix if the is a lot of bloons. Other than that it is a really fun game!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Awesome game. I like the opportunity this game gives you to breed rare dragons and strategize on their placement in habitats.
B0073TBYTC|4.0|I purchased this for my college granddaughter to read on the train for her ride to the city...she is a big fan of these books and has read another one by this writer...they seem to be saga books about the same person..
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Ted is better than expected due to sharp writing and great one-liners. The plot is really an excuse for Ted to engage in un-Teddy Bear behavior such as hiring hookers, having sex and a Family Guy style paw fight.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My favorite is MR. Cuddles a huge dragon robot that spits fire. It can be a little addicting, especially when you get into purchasing gear and getting renewed lives. My kids have played this game for an entire dinner at a time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Some levels were very easy, others more of a challenge. It went back and forth on the levels of challenge.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It was given I think an 8 inYou summons things that help you complete puzzles. If nothing else my kids like to summon zombies, and arm themselves with swords and wings, and attack the zombies while riding on deer. It is a real cool game that allows the kids to do really what they want. Downside? If you kid cant spell be prepared to spell for them.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|Now this fell short of my expectations, however that does not mean it is a bad movie, just not what I expected.  I think children will still be enchanted and entertained.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|My kids, my husband and my self all agree this is our favorite group that we all can listen to!  And we have elementary school up to teenagers!  We love all the tracks, but Berlin seems to get played more than any of the others....but Mission Impossible would be a close second.  These guys are just good.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|OMG, what a cute, adorable movie.  The minions were simply delightful.  I can't wait for the 2nd one.  Steve Carell lends his voice is such a wonderful way, it absolutely pushed the movie over the top of the rating bar.  I loved this movie very very much.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like the computer version so much better but if you can't buy the computer version then I guess this is third best the second is X-box but whatever if you like building or crafting or killing zombies you get minecraft
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I love flowers and now I know more about them.  I read it on my Kindle and would like to get a hard copy so I could copy all the flower meanings.
1582701709|1.0|This is the most silly book.  I couldn't read all of it.  do not waste your money. My dogs chewed it up and I did not care.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Loved this book. The story takes the reader on a trip to the circus, not an ordinary circus but surely one I would like to see!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|A great classic with great stars!  Robert Redford was perfect as Gatsby!  They do not make them like this anymore!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game. Trust me you'll play this for hours and wanting more holes. You'll play til you get three stars for all rounds
0120000466|5.0|This is a beautiful, simple children's book. The hard part is explaining to my 4 year old son why it always makes me cry. It gets me every time.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A great &#34;who done it&#34;.  This book keeps you wondering and guessing throughout with surprising and shocking twists.  Couldn't put it down.
B002WJI66C|5.0|I know that it is kind of weird to have friends who LOVE Mario but I have one. As a joke a saw this and sent it to him. When he opened the package he was kind of freaked out until he saw it was a Boo. Then I guess you could say he jumped for joy. The tongue is very longue and can be rolled back into the mouth, we aren't sure if that is what is supposed to happen or not... Anyways the Boo is fun and pretty cheep, and for me it was a good present.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great story. Keeps you wanting more and never a dull moment. I highly recommended this book for people whole love suspense and mystery
B000I9YWDO|4.0|Everything will seem so familiar if you ever worked in an office.  Took me too long to watch this classic.  Was very funny.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Really enjoyed this book and it kept me interested. A good quick read that will make it difficult to put down.
0345803493|4.0|After reading book one, which I could not put down; I immediately ordered book two, then three.  I would not recommend to anyone to read just the first book -- you might as well get the trilogy (it's worth it).
B002JODUI4|5.0|This cd has some awesome tunes. My favorite is ghosts n stuff. if you like deadmau just get the cd.
0345803507|4.0|Enjoyed the storyline from books one and two.  After reading book two, I knew there had to be more; it just did not end right.
B002S9DRA6|5.0|this was great...it even helped to get my 15 year old son addicted to my tastes in music...Thank you Enigma
B00571F26Y|4.0|The science was explained very well. I've been feeling reactions to wheat products for several years now and noticing more and more people with the syndrome. This book may explain why. I voluntarily cut back on bread and other wheat products several years ago before I read this book. Now I understand. The hybridizing of wheat to the point that the crop barely resembles the ancient wonder is alarming.<br />Really encourage everyone to read and push for scientific research. Avoiding wheat products now and I feel much better and lost weight with little other change to my diet. I miss a few things now and then but my overall health is better. The author also includes many great tasting gluten free recipes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun, and and great for little kids. Fun for the whole family. It is great and enjoyable. You should try this game.
B007MAETA8|5.0|This is a slightly different side of John Mayer and I love it. Besides what you might think of the man, you can not deny he is one great guitar player.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Can't wait for the sequel to come out to see what the characters have been up to. They are all trying so hard to just be everyday people.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|My granddaughter entertained herself for hours . It is good because she could be creative  and have fun laughing at her finished work.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is truly excellent. This was something I was very confused about until I read this book. This book was badly needed as a time saving device and now I have built and published my book for kindle and I have more on the way.<br />Thank You.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Very good like the other two I first bought.  She continues to be very enjoyable for listening pleasure for me.
0143039431|5.0|The Joads, who were tenant farmers, lost their land in Oklahoma after the land on which they worked was bought out but, instead of giving up in despair, they followed their dream of starting their long trek to California where they still hoped to make a success of growing fruit.<br /><br />The camaraderie between the family members en route is endearing but conflict looms again as they find that, others like themselves are being obliged to compete for very meagre wages and there are just too few jobs to keep their families in food and shelter.<br /><br />In the ensuing competition and anger that develops between otherwise hard-working honest souls lies the \\"grapes of wrath\\" and yet it is the human spirit of determination to survive and to almost 'out fate' the worst of fates that gave this book its strength.
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|It was very boring and unrealistic some of the instruments used would not have been available during that period. Not a good buy.
0140186395|4.0|As a  tale of envy and betrayal between two generations of brothers, East of Eden would be a tour de force and yet, for me, it was the way one brother, the gentle Adam, could gain the affection of his father and yet the other more boisterous and unrestrained, Charles never could, which was so deftly described. Although, upon the death of their father, both inherited, still the jealousy of Charles towards Adam consumed Charles.<br /><br />The tables turn for Adam, however, when after helping the beautiful but manipulative Cathy Ames to survive a beating, he is drawn into marrying her and, despite his wife's reluctance, he buys land near Salinas, land which he sees as the 'Eden' that he is going to provide for the woman whose suffering he once eased. But Cathy sleeps with Adam's brother, Charles, and becomes pregnant by him while later also having a child by Adam. The offspring, Caleb and Aron, themselves eventually compete for their father's affection and so begins Steinbeck's parallel with the Bible story of Cain and Abel.
0345803493|2.0|I just don't see the big deal with this trilogy.  It's poorly written and the characters are obnoxious.  Sorry, but I had to force myself to finish what I started...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Grandson loves this game. He laughs when he flips car over. Would recommend to everyone.it just makes grandson crack up.
0345803507|2.0|I guess once you start a trilogy, you are bound to finish.  It was quite hard for me to do so, but I managed.  A lot of hype.  I hate to say that if I never hear about Christian and Anastasia again, it will be too soon.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I watched this series regularly when it was, originally, on the air. The storylines were thought provoking, both from a historical and modern day perspective. Enjoyed the interplay among all the characters.....the fact that loyalty overrode, at times, differences of opinion and lifestyle (ie Hank vs. most everyone!). Originally, I never recognized the Sully/ Michaela relationship as central to the series....now I find it very sweet, in light of today's &#34;romantic&#34; portrayals......Watching this series again will be my &#34;video comfort food&#34;!!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Fast moving with good twists along the way.<br />Great characters with layers of imperfections and strengths.<br />I am looking forward to the next in the series
0007466064|5.0|This book really enhances the HBO Game of Thrones series although the show is not quite as good as the books!!!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I was nervous about the dvd what shape it would be in it was like bran new everything came with  dvd like the ad said<br />  T/Y
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is very awesome for people who love the movie jaws! But i would not recommended it for younger kids. It's a great game wjth awesome details and soun  effects!! Hope you guys enjoy it!! :)
B008KUUWX2|5.0|While not my favorite Jane Austen novel, Northanger Abbey is still a complex, well written tale, with many insights into life in the U.K. in the time period of the book.  Excellent character development and a good story.
B004P1JEWU|4.0|I found book One tiring, with so much to remember, but by the end of book Two I was addicted and had to go on. A brilliant creation.
B00314VYNE|5.0|My daughter loves the doll.  It's well made and a good size for taking in the car.  Jessie looks just like in the movie.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Had to see what was going to happen. Had to get the next on. George pulls one into this fantasy world headlong!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I loved it it's the best game so I'm so happy can you make a upgrade like different people who are in the car
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|He is hilarious, He is a great entertainer for the Great Grand-kids. Like having it fun for adults too....Great add to tablet
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I like the story line and suspense. The actors are great. Can't wait for Season 4 to begin in November
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoy watching this series! I don't watch much TV but this is worth it ! Great storyline that keeps you engaged.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Read all of the whole book unroll how this diary came to be found made me cry<br />It's very sad<br />Five stars
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Easy read.  Sparks' books do not always end as you would like.  I guess many readers can relate to similar situations or events.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This was an awesome help for school. I am in college and it was an immense help for looking up definitions. Thank you so much. I am SO glad it was installed on my Kindle Fire Hd. My son also used it for school.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Well the whole thing is unrealistic for Christian Grey to be so young and to have masterered so many skills, etc.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love that any age can play this game.It's very fun to play with.It sometimes finds 10 minutes of happiness inside me.You must buy this game.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book ends very sweetly and a little unrealistically.  I don't know many super rich people that blow through money the way he does.  But then, Ana is a lucky girl to have found on who does and she can enjoy it with him.
0307346617|5.0|Obsessed with zombies and this book just made my day! Read it in a week and absolutely loved it. Going to start reading it again.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The 2nd book is the best of the trilogy.  The relationship between Christian and Ana is stressed to the Max and a few surprises are in store.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because its got everything a reader could ask for such as humor,adventure,a bit of horror what's not to love ? its a awesome book!!!!! I think if you are looking for some great books to read on your kindle .......BUY THE PERCY JACKSON SERIES!!!!!!!! You will love it
B0052QXAEK|3.0|I love retellings of fairy tails.  Having said this I felt that while visually and conceptually this was a great idea the script was just a bit thin.  The book head such a fun take with the beast corresponding with other fairy tail denzians, what a great way to lead into more movies later, I was very disappointed this was all left out.  Also there is no closure with either beauty or the beast and their parents.  I wonder what is to keep the beast from going right back?  But if you are just looking to wastch a sweet tean angst movie ith pretty people, a life lesson and a happy ending I reccomend it.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I love this cd. I keep in on repeat every day while driving to and from work. Its so relaxing and instantly calms me. These guys are so talented.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Awesome app it is so fun and entertaining I would recommend it to any one with a little time on there hands
B0016MJ6T2|5.0|Outrageous performances by both Green and the legendary Macaulay Culkin -- they go over the over the top without going over the over the over the top, if you know what I mean.  Add in the costumes, the true crime angle, the cameo by Marilyn Manson, and you have a movie you will want to watch again and again.<br /><br />What's the moral, the message?  Probably the cliched &#34;nothing exceeds like excess&#34;, but you can judge for yourself.  Perhaps there isn't one....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Liked game. It was challenging. Wish there were more floors. I would recommend this game. The down side is there were only 10 floors.
159463176X|2.0|I was so looking forward to this book. KITE RUNNER is on my top 10 list, 1000 SPLENDID SUNS was good, but not as, and here, this one just dropped the ball completely . A collection of short stories that, as the book progressed, I had a hard time finishing. It started off on a strong note and just fizzled.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have to say that this game is a lot better than MTG13, but I do wish it had the planeswalker game as well
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is the technical stuff makes it a little hard to read. But, of course, one of Dr. ALEXANDER's goals is to convince his scientific colleagues. So that is understandable.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I loved that this book had lots of surprises while still fostering the relationship between Nicki and Jameson.  Great read!
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|They really missed the opportunity to do something interesting. Just a lot of bickering for the whole movie and the plot didn't really make a lot of sense. The action sequences were also very standard -- good guys win and bad guys don't. Too bad.
0307476073|2.0|I was so excited to read this.  I'd been reading PCT memoirs for a while and I had only read good things about this one.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to make it past the first third of the book.  It is well written, I just have a hard time relating to the author.  I find myself wanting to like her, but not being able to, and this, paired with not actually getting much trail story in the beginning (the part that is supposed to grab you), I just lost interest.<br /><br />If you like auto-biographic works, then yes, this would be a good choice.  If, however, you're like me and just want to know what life on the trail was like, then I'd opt for a different book (unless you can make it further and actually find the trail stories in there).
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Wow, I so wanted to love this book.  I just got easily bored and couldn't read very far into it. I  hate to pay for a book, and then not read it through. I just can't.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|I just love the Antony Beevor books on WWII (I've read 4 of them now), and recommend all his books (D-Day, Berlin, etc).
B00849XAEC|5.0|Greetings Guy and Amazon readers:<br /><br />There are many books out there about the business world, both philosophies and marketing.  But nothing really comes at Entrepreneurship like your book Enchantment.  Your observations are keen and every page had valuable lessons.  This book reminds me of that famous Bruce Lee saying &#34;Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash…. Be water, my friend..!&#34;  Thanks for the sage advice Guy!<br /><br />Andy
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I am still depressed over the last episode, but an amazing show that isn't full of foul language or teenagers getting pregnant :)
B00CF34B2I|3.0|How can a card game take so much space in the device! Do they store high resolution pictures for every Magic:TG card ever released or what?!<br /><br />- First, you download a whooping 1.2 GB package from Amazon.<br />- Then, you install the package, which requires another gigabyte and a half of free space just to unpack<br />- Then, you run the game, and it says it needs to download an additional 1.2 GB! WTF?!<br /><br />So you need almost 4 GB of free space just to get started! This is nuts for a mobile game. And my device is not a tiny Android device. It's a 16 GB Galaxy S3 (when factory new, it has just 11 GB free), but still, that's way too much.<br /><br />So I finally didn't check the game out, sorry. But be warned you need a lot of space to play this!
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|I liked the graphics but the controls were to hard to drive the buggy.  Maybe they will add better controls in the future.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|This is #1 in a nice long series which I started after catching the show on telly only to watch it get darker & duller by the episode. Since reading this book I see the writers deleted almost all of the humor or references to its magnificent setting: the high plains. I'm sure it's tough to transcribe a first person recounting into telly tales, however, they've turned them into cowboyish soap operas with inevitable brawls & touristy Indian spiritual aphorisms. Widower Walt has a motley crew of interesting & diverse characters, a chance at romance that turns deadly. He does all of his thinking either staring at the mountains from his half-finished cabin or driving his beat-up Bullet across those wide open spaces in all seasons protecting victims & hunting killers of all & unexpected stripes. Lots of layers to this wounded man on the cusp of reinventing himself, well-read too, with an Indian best friend with a long history together...both are artful lobbers of deadpan White Man/Red Man jokes. & they rescue each other. Lotsa hearty doses of historical & modern morality, which the telly shows can't reproduce. Perhaps I needed to reach a certain age B4 I appreciated the arid wit & ripe philosophies in the yarns Craig Johnson spins. Kept me riveted.
1451695195|5.0|Well written and interesting parsing of narrative make for an engaging and relatively easy read. The author's voice is strong and authoritative which lends itself to the impact of the story. Highly recommended.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a new discovery for our family and the teens and adults in the family love it! It's great to watch a new series from the beginning in marathon form. I would say it's better than Revolution.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This echoes my review of the Season one Blu-rays. The plot lines are smart, and the episodes are actually full of intellectual humor. Such an enjoyable show to watch. Looking forward to more seasons.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|This is a movie that holds up, story and actors are 5 stars! Matt, Danny and Mickey's performances are stellar!
B004132I20|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman have an amazing dynamic that is seen and felt from the very first time they meet. The 'Making of' is very interesting to watch, espicially when talking about the changes that occurred from the finished Pilot episode (which is also included) to the finished product. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to watch smart television.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Even if you disable in app purchases through the Amazon store, this app will still allow the player to make in app purchases.  Had to uninstall after my child made in app purchases even through it was disabled.  Be cautious when using this app.
0425263924|2.0|I was under the empression this would be the last series. The first two books were excellent. I was expecting a hot book like the second crossfire book.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Good access to professional resources.  Also, provides a resource to maintain contact with past resources and previous associates.  Considerable research help when hiring and reviewing resumes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really cool!  Its a great time waster and you can literally play it for hours. I would give it thirty five stars if I could. Download it!  You sure as hell wont regret downloading this game
B005MLOKXA|5.0|So far, the story continues to hold my interest with good plots, interesting court cases, and personal intrigue.  Hope it continues into the next season without becoming trite.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I loved this show, especially because they didn't try and make it SG-1, and in fact it's different enough that it can stand on it's own but manages to keep the same feel that I always got from SG-1.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is a fun game but there is another fun I want to see at the appstore for free its called hay day. ive played at my friends house.
0739375970|5.0|Great story and the reading was done very well, the only issue I have is now that I'm done with this book I've got to wait for at least a couple years for Martin to release the next chapter in this story.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Bought this for my sister for her birthday since she's in love with movie! Can't wait for Despicable Me 2!
0307346617|5.0|While many may not like the first person prospective style the book was written in I thoroughly enjoyed it, as did my wife and 13 year old son. This book does something few, if any, zombie stories before it did and that is show the events on a worldwide canvas instead of limiting the coverage of it to one build, mall or town.<br /><br />As for those complaining about Brooks &#34;pushing&#34; a leftist agenda, I'm extremely conservative but I didn't feel he was pushing any agenda and instead his view give his writing a bias, which is completely understandable and of course he doesn't beat you over the head with it or promote it, instead it's just the way things work out in the book. If Thomas Sowell decided to write a similar zombie story, don't you think it would be conservative ideals that saved the day?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very good game. The levels are tricky yet easy to overcome with just some quick thinking. I am very mad that there are only 10 levels
B001AT4Y84|3.0|Coming after Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Rise of the Machines had the unenviable task of trying to top expectations and there's no way it could. That being said, I found T3: RotM entertaining and thrilling when taken on its own. I thought Nick Stahl was great as John Connor accepting his destiny and liked Claire Danes as Kate. I especially appreciated where the film ends — favoring inevitability over Cameron's hopeful message. What a bold step! The female Terminator is not as innovative as Robert Patrick's character, but manages to remain a good threat to the leads. And Arnold — while botoxed to the gills — is always fun to watch. Worth a watch and a good part of the Terminator series.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Great acting, but I wish it had ended differently. I think it had potential to be a classic, but ended up selling out to fit into the main stream Hollywood status quo.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|Alice in Chains has always been a Jerry Cantrell-centric project, with him carrying the load in songwriting, guitar and much of the vocals, even when Layne Staley was alive. The harmonies were always something that vocally made AIC stand out, along with the dirge-like drudge of the music. The elements of what drew fans to AIC is still there, because Jerry is still in charge. Sean Kinney and Mike Inez make a fine rhythm section, and \\"new\\" singer William Duvall is a great addition. Black Gives Way to Blue, the first with Duvall involved, was a great album. The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here brings more to the plate, and shows that the band as a whole and in its parts is more than able to maintain, and expand upon, the aspects that have made them a hard rock stalwart.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|From start to finish this is a great movie. I love the concept and the execution. Definitely worth watching more than once.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Maggie Smith is the best,the period clothing is just beautiful. Quality entertainment,with lots of twists and turns.I love the help,just as much as the aristocracy.The character development is superb. You will fall in love with this series. You have to watch from from season 1,enjoy.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It showed the human side of war from both sides, and how awful it is that individuals pay the price with their lives and they are never the ones who made the decision to go to war.  Wouldn't it be novel to let the leaders fight a duel to death if necessary rather than send young men and women to war.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This was a really good movie....lots of action, suspense and dry humor!  I Would recommend it and would watch again!
B009K0OL06|5.0|Great show and nice to be able to watch missed episodes! Only downfall is there is a cost with each episode...
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest really helped a lot when my Daughter was planning her wedding. We found many great ideas on there. The recipes on there are great also.
159420411X|4.0|If you are hoping for some simple guidelines that will help you distinguish actionable information (signal) from random information (noise), as I was, I expect that you'll be disappointed. I came away from the book with the belief that the author was honest. He's giving you his best analysis and his best approaches to making predictions. Distinguishing signal from noise requires, in the author's words, &#34;both scientific knowledge and self-knowledge....&#34; One has to know one's own biases before one can honestly collect, review and analyze any body of information to make a prediction. He argues in favor of Bayes' Theorem as the preferred statistical approach to make predictions. Do not worry if, like me, you are not a statistician or find formulas challenging. The author has a light touch in this area and explains that he prefers Bayes' Theorem because it explicitly requires one to express one's initial belief (bias perhaps) in forming a prediction.<br /><br />Mr. Silver does not view predictions as &#34;one and done.&#34; The process of prediction may, and frequently does, require the modification of predications as more, or new, information is gathered. He expresses this as the process of making predictions &#34;less and less wrong.&#34; In some areas that he considers, such as earthquake prediction, the process of being less and less wrong has been highly limited to virtually non-existent. In other areas, success has been more measurable. The author got his start analyzing baseball statistics and had success with some of his statistical findings. The book Moneyball by Michael Lewis describes some of these successes. He next applied his statistical skills to political predictions and enjoyed success there as well. But, in both of these areas there was a considerable body of statistical information and a history of third-party predictions that could be analyzed. Even in these areas the author honestly recognizes that the ability to predict has limitations.<br /><br />Mr. Silver considers chess and looks at the success the supercomputer Deep Blue had against Garry Kasparov. He found one surprising observation about the first win that Deep Blue had against Mr. Kasparov. He considers some of the limitations of the computer's analytical capacity.<br /><br />One section describes Mr. Silver's experiences in playing poker and the predictive approaches necessary to succeed in this endeavor. I wasn't sure if this section was all that helpful, but it did further his thesis that one must recognize one's own limitations (and have a firm grasp on the rules of the game) to have any chance of a useful prediction.<br /><br />Good prediction may require imagination and require one to set aside current world views to look at matters anew. This may be especially helpful in trying to predict matters such as terrorists' activities.<br /><br />I recommend the book if for no other reason than it will challenge you to consider your own biases and preconceived notions. I appreciated what I feel is his honest approach to the subject. I came away with a belief that I have to look hard at the information that I have gathered, the sources of the information, and the analytical to which I have subjected the information before I try to predict an outcome.><br />Mr. Silver considers chess and looks at the success the supercomputer Deep Blue had against Garry Kasparov.

B0089LOKHG|5.0|Five stars that's all I have to say. There was nothing that I didn't like about the book. :)  My favorite book of all time!!!!!
147674355X|5.0|This was the first book I read by Colleen Hoover.  Now I have gobbled them all up and am waiting for her next release.
B009EBLCK8|4.0|This show is fantastic!! The only complaint we have is that there are not enough episodes!!! We want more!  That and sometimes we have to turn the volume up extremely loud to hear the dialogue but then have to turn it way down when there is music cause the balance is very different. But the show itself makes it one of our new faves!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book offers the back story of a man that no one knows but no one could live as they do today without his discoveries.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great series of books.  Can't wait for the next one!  One of those books that you can read again and again.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|short game. only 10 levels. I like the idea but needs more levels to be worth it.  I finished yhr game in about an hour.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Took a little while to figure out how to work this, but now I love it! I can read in bed at night with a small device instead of my PC.
B001NKI60W|5.0|I thought the film was marvelous. It was well acted and the cast had surprisingly good voices.  Any one who likes a good, light-hearted musical will love it1
B006N0YWGY|4.0|I like the launching the gators and flipping the other boats.  I always seem to buy the wrong things and end up with stuff that sells for less than I bought it for.  I still keep trying to get the right stuff at the right time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great app. it is lots of fun.  very addicting.  very well made and enjoyable.  I can't stop playing.  love it!
B0072GPQ72|5.0|We don't buy a lot of dvd's since there are few that we opt to watch multiple times.<br />Star Wars, LOR, Pirates, Avengers are some of the series that my family watches over and over.<br />However, my history-loving teenage son made a special request for War Horse as a bday gift.<br />So, we've added that to our collection!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this app is a great free rpg that's extremely hard unless you buy items with real money.So you would have to wait for timers, constantly grind old levels, and stuff like that and I like games with some challenge.So if you like some challenge I'd say its how I rated it but if not then it be a 4 for you because of it being a cool rpg for a free game.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I have been reading the 1st book in the series and I am loving it.  Thought I would catch the beginining of the series and I was not disappointed.
140120841X|5.0|The book is very fascinated and feel like to read to finish the whole book as soon as possible or at once.
0345803485|5.0|The undergraduate major in French is intended to give students an in-depth familiarity with the language, culture, and literature of France and the French-speaking world. It provides an opportunity to continue the study of the literary and cultural issues first discussed in the two principal Core courses, Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, with a greater attention to historical context and textual detail since most works are read and discussed in the original French.<br /><br />After completion of the four-semester language requirement students take advanced grammar and composition courses to refine their skills in reading, speaking and writing French. They also undertake a comprehensive overview of the development of French literature from the Middle Ages to the present day in a two-semester survey course. A wide choice of advanced elective courses allows students to explore a variety of intellectual interests, to perfect their critical reading skills, and to master the techniques of close reading.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|If you like mystery, plot twists and fast paced books you will enjoy this.  Here is a tip though, read this one before &#34;The Hit&#34;.  they flow together.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I almost don't use my real Kindle anymore, as this app really replaces it well, especially on a larger format phone (I have the Samsung Galaxy Note II).
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it too. SAME as on iPhone.  Keeps track of time, score and moves.  Would recommend to anyone  who likes solitare.
B009MYAQOA|5.0|Loving Frank is a great historical fiction love story.  I have seen some of Frank Lloyd Wright's work and knew he was a trailblazer in his field but I really enjoyed learning about his life with his soul mate, his struggles managing money, and his perfectionism.  The book sparked my interest in the famous man and has made me want to research more about his life and work.  The book was a great easy read.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The author takes you there and treats you to a series of adventures that makes you want to read more.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|I bought this for my son who is 3 years old. He loves it.  It's of a decent size and not to heavy to carry it around.  The steering wheel turns but it doesn't turn the wheels of the backhoe, which is ok.
B005N1OUSE|4.0|You will probably like the idea. Question is, will you practice it ?<br />Therefore you will surely read the second book &#34;unfolding the napkin...&#34;
B0093QE37S|5.0|This is a classic and a must see! The acting is amazing and the story is wonderful.  We loved it.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Great book, liked the verifiable data that was a big part of the story. I enjoyed the historical data that authenticated much of the plot that kept me wanting to continue reading each page.
B009JVSAVM|5.0|This is a great complete set and the price was right. My husband and I were able to catch all our missed episodes. The discs were in fine shape. We had no complaints.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Hard to put down. Surprises until the end.  Harlan Cohen is a master at humor and plots I never bore of his imagination.
0439882826|5.0|This is more than just your average pop-up book.  Each page has several different pop-ups to open and the detail in each one is amazing.  My husband has looked at this several times and keeps finding new fun features.  Both our girls want to look at it too, but he is afraid of their little(they are 5 and 2) hands doing damage so he has to help them.  The light sabers that actually light up at the end is awesome!  This is a must have for any Star Wars fan!
B00B7IJDMA|5.0|First of all, I love the Walking Dead. And I was curious on the music played on the show. This whole CD is great.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I enjoy this game alot.<br />It is very relaxing, easy to play & enjoyable.<br />Would reccommend it highly to anyone.
B008NW67E0|5.0|If you like modern blue grass, you'll love Mumford & Sons. The whole cd is great. Highly recommended to anyone.
B000QCQ9O8|3.0|I would give part one 4 stars but the rest of the book I found a bit boring especially part 2. I didn't mind the twist at the end because it does make sense. But after reading part 1 I felt like I was reading a different book about war and I wanted to go back to the story about Briony and her lie.
B0052SF6CM|4.0|Most of the songs are great. I love the Florence and the Machine, so I had to get this CD for the one track. I don't like mp3, give me CDs or records.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is the best written book from a dog's perspective I've ever read. ENZO made me laugh and cry...I believe
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Nice to see the season cliff hanger without commercials and a good value since it is a 2 hour episode.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I chose to rate it at 5 stars only because I couldn't give it 6. It is an endless adventure of compassion, tragedy, and the \\"at - your-own-risk\\" attitude of the modern day world. Buck truly does answer the Call of the Wild.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Lots of fun and entertaining! Tons of stuff to do and acquire!  Can visit other villages and get ideas to build/manage yours!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|What an amazing and moving story of passion, forgiveness, guilt, greed, and sacrifice.  Can't we all relate to each of the characters in different points of our lives?!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a fun game, keeps me entertained.  Simple to play and earn plenty of coins to upgrade and unlock new stuff.  Good times.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I enjoyed this game  because it was easy to play.  All you have to do is match the blocks, it get harder as the levels continue.  In the later levels there are blocks that need to be matched first or unlocked.  I like that you can play it as a complex or simple game, so that people of different abilities can play it.  I don't really get the earning money to build houses or whatever, but I still had fun.  It is also good that you can have a choose of plying a timed game or not.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved the first two books and preordered this book. However, I was extremely disappointed in the pushed back release date and the storyline stalled and had to focus more on supporting characters drama then focus on the real relationship that we fell in love with.
B00D37UQ1K|1.0|I am shocked at the level of fan mentality going on here, just because it's by Mayer does not mean you twihards have to defend such a lame movie adaptation. This was a miserable adaptation with so many holes in it as to make Swiss cheese blush! I have not run into one single person that enjoyed or recommended the movie, as a matter of fact they all told me to wait till video to be disappointed. Sadly I did not listen... Ugh! Read the book.
0307476464|3.0|1Q84 has no connection to Orwell's 1984, which was my first disappointment. I chugged through over 900 pages and was rewarded with awkward sex scenes, which had ultimately nothing to do with the story line, and other disappointments. The conversations lead no where, and offered no insight into the plot. To try to correct this, it seems that Murakami inserted a narrator of sorts in the third section, but this still did not satisfy the gaping holes in the story. Although I enjoyed the stories told within the story, they had no connection to the story line of 1Q84. But, I've heard that the other works by this author are incredible, so although I won't give up on reading Murakami, I would not recommend this book.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|I never saw this movie when it came out...I've heard about it...and recently was told something again about the movie...and told my friend I've never watched it...she told to rent or buy...I will love it...And I surely did...
B007REV4YI|5.0|The greatest bond movie ever. You needed it because it explained so much of the innuendo that's never questioned. I don't want to give anything away, but watch it it's worth it.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is a great and silly film! It was sent to me quickly, even arriving before the promise date!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was excited to receive what I thought was the &#34;final&#34; installment in the Crossfire Trilogy.  But I felt this book reminded me of the abrupt way Bared to You ended.  Reflected in You had a more natural ending.  It seemed like the right place to end this part of the story.  I could hardly believe it when I swiped the page of my Kindle and found I was at the end of Entwined with You.<br /><br />On the positive:<br /><br />Romance was off the charts!!!  Pages were sizzling!  (spoiler alert) The wedding was a great touch!!<br /><br />Cons:<br />There are soooooo many facets introduced or reintroduced that were just left hanging.  I love the story of Eva and Gideon and continue to root for the success of their relationship.  So while I'm not opposed to the continuation of the story, just don't sell it as a trilogy!!!<br /><br />I read Bared to You shortly after 50 Shades of Grey trilogy and thought Dey was a much better writer, although I loved both stories.  At least at the end of 50 Shades trilogy, there was a natural ending.  I would have preferred a longer story for Entwined, even higher price if necessary, to get a little more &#34;meat&#34; (smile) into this book.<br /><br />Note to author: You have a loyal fan base.  Don't wait too long to give us a follow-up. Or if you do, make sure you take the time and effort to finish the story!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day has done it again!!! She writes wigh such vivid detail that you can almost see the characters.  You cant help but to become entwined with the book and its characters.  This series gives 50 Shades a run for its money.  Cannot wait to read the next one!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun and super addicting.first time I played,I was up till two in the morning.I recommend you try it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A really enjoyable game - gets your brain thinking!I thoroughly enjoyed playing it; it's very addictive.<br />Would definitely recommend the game.

The couple focus is on Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton.<br /><br />My Take<br />I think this one is my favorite if only because it's about a pair of writers with their particular fears and the drab hen who finally catches the eye of one of the ton's beloved sons by simply being herself.<br /><br />I like this whole series. It's true enough to the time period that I'm not snorting in dismay, and the primary characters, the family, are such a treat. They're loyal, interesting, intelligent, and full of love for each other and hapless others.<br /><br />I find it very odd that Francesca was married off, and we never got a story about it. I keep looking and nothing's there. This is the first mention of the Smythe-Smith family (a new series by Quinn). And we learn a very considerate fact about Penelope AND Lady Danbury.<br /><br />Ooh, Colin is a hypocrite. He is amazingly generous in so many ways for the typical gentleman of his time period until it touches on his own interests. In that he is so dizzyingly jealous, ripping up at Pen, making her cry. And then he does does a turnaround, demanding respect for Pen from her family...oh...<br /><br />The Story<br />Penelope Featherington has been in love with Colin Bridgerton for years and years and the closest she's come to him is her friendship with his sister, Eloise. Until bit by bit, day by day, Colin comes to realize he is in love with her. Her intelligence, her humor---she's beautiful. And he so desperately doesn't want to love her.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Penelope Featherington has been in love with Colin Bridgerton for years, never expecting it could ever be returned. Portia, Mrs. Featherington, is her match-making mama and as flighty and idiotic as Penelope's sisters, who insists on dressing Pen in everything that is wrong for her. Prudence and Phillipa are her older sisters married to Robert Huxley and Nigel Berbrooke, respectively; Felicity is the youngest sister.<br /><br />Eloise Bridgerton is Pen's best friend. Violet, Lady Bridgerton is their mother and a lovely lady; she takes Pen under her wing.<br /><br />Colin Bridgerton is the third child in the Bridgerton family. A plain mister, but wealthy enough that he can travel as he wishes, keeping a journal on his trips. Anthony Bridgerton is the oldest, Viscount Bridgerton, married to Kate Sheffield ([[ASIN:0380815575 The Viscount Who Loved Me (Bridgerton Family, #2)]]); they have a two-year-old, Charlotte. Benedict Bridgerton has married Sophie ([[ASIN:0380815583 An Offer From a Gentleman (Bridgerton Family, #3)]]) and has pursued his art. Daphne married Simon Bassett in [[ASIN:0380800829 The Duke and I (Bridgerton Family, #1)]]. Eloise, Gregory, and Hyacinth are the remaining unmarried children. Francesca evaded having an installment and is now widowed. That'll teach her...!<br /><br />Lady Danbury (she's something of a dragon lady) lays down a challenge: £1,000 for the first person to lay proof of Lady Whistledown's identity before her. Cressida, Lady Twombley is one of Penelope's enemies. She's a nasty girl, er, widow, who's gotten what she deserves, but she still tries spreading her evil, the blackmailing b8tch.<br /><br />Lady Whistledown is a gossip columnist who has been writing Lady Whistledown's Society Papers for years. It's a scandal and morning entertainment for the ton and has been for years. Mr. Lacey is her publisher.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is a silent night of deep blues as evening settles over their country home.<br /><br />The title is odd as Penelope may be fantasizing about Romancing Mr. Bridgerton, but she never truly believed it could happen.brooke, respectively; Felicity is the youngest sister.<br /><br />Eloise Bridgerton is Pen's best friend.

B00594XOZU|5.0|I like having this app because you can text without having a persons number ,So be fair I will give 5 syars. :)
B005DJREGQ|1.0|It's a deplorable representation of young adults.  I  would never allow my kids to view this garbage and I hope other parents feel the same.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book made me cry, but it was written amazing. The emotion and intensity. I would recommend others to read for sure.
B00BC24NT4|2.0|A long way from Smiley, le carre is stretching to look for bad guys.. This ones weak. His characters not convincing. He comes across a bit self righteously.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i love love love this app. i do graphics on facebook for the pregnancy and infant loss community as way to honor my own baby...but I just sometimes don't want to sit at the laptop for hours and hours. so I figured id look for an app that would allow me to do everything I can do with my programs on my laptop. I adore this app. simply divine.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I love Stephen King's earlier novels, this one, although definitely modern, reminded me a lot of my favorites. I only wish it had been longer!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very fun and  entertaining game. I especially love  how all the pieces fit together! Really enjoy this one.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Jeez it was Hot and funny! You gotta hand it to Emma Chase making you laugh while you swoon is genius! The male point if view was great!!! He was just so alpha and who doesn't love that!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My little pony friendship is magic is a really fun game for people of all ages it is entertaining and fun
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|This is a really fun game and I love it so so so much and its the best game ever and its so cool
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was so much fun finding and figuring out the clues. kept me interested that i had a hard time quiting.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|This is a great book for fans that just want more Star Trek TNG.  Excellent story, bringing back characters and stories from the tv series.  I was especially captivated by Dr. Soong's long tale, and how his crazy schemes were impacted by the war with the dominion among other events from Star Trek lore.  Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B009FAQ8IY|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. Great scenery. Marlon Brando at his best. The classic western with bad good guys and good bad guys.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love to watch this show. Each actor/actress portrays their character so well. Also the show really allows you to see how it would have been like to live in the 1920's. The storylines never get boring. It's a must see series!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The best movies of all times. The ones that has set the standard in computer generated imagery (CGI) that all other movies have to measure up to.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|great game. there are a lot of things to do. its free so far. you just have to be patient. its definitely worth the download.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I never understand why people buy batteries at full retail price. Go on amazon (or ebay) and buy 5 or 10 pack for same price or half price of one single battery at retail store. I've never had a bad experience buy batteries. Only downside is, you have to wait for it to come in the mail (say 5-7 days vs prime's two days) but for the money saved, you still win unless you need it asap for some reason. It's not as if you use two of these before you save money, you save money on the first one already and you have tons of spares.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|My kids loved this movie...all the bright colors, characters, etc.  Thought it was really well done and promoted a great message of good triumphing over evil.
B001XULSG6|5.0|Nobody's gonna argue that one. Best character development, great story, evil borg. It's all there, and some good humor to lighten things up.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Another good one from Guillermo del toro.<br /><br />Made me jump more than once. Was scary without the gore. Overall good story for this type of genera.
B0052FYPJK|5.0|Yes, many (all?) of these notes are are copied verbatim from various sources or adapted from sources to meet his needs, nevertheless this mishmash of data is full of insights regarding Lee's system of combat and deserves to sit on every martial artist's bookshelf, real or virtual.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The best 3D movie so far and by far. Great effects, sound and acting. Highly recommended to be watched in 3D.
B000001DZM|5.0|After seeing the musical, I wanted to remember and had to have this.  Just what I wanted!  The music is so uplifting!
1780387105|5.0|Justinguitar.com is an awesome course and I'm loving my new song book. I would recommend it to anyone. What else can I say?
B00COGY2P2|3.0|The plot of the movie follows the book pretty well but as much as I have enjoyed Lee Child's<br />books I would strongly suggest that they find some one else to play Jack Reacher, some one<br />of the same stature as the character in the Jack Reacher novels instead of some one as wimpy as<br />Tom Cruise.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very good game. Quite &quot;myst&quot;-like puzzles to solve. I enjoyed it very much, just wish there were more chapters, or that the entire games was longer.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|i bough this move and another one from this seller and it came is great used shape.  the move was prefect when i put in our dvd playier.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|A great game, as always.  Super excited that it even works on my Droid Bionic.  The new play mechanic of Booster Draft is great, but they should allow you to reset it once you have 100% completed the Booster Draft campaign.  Also, the price for buying another slot in the Booster Draft is twice the price through Amazon as it is for XBox 360, $1.99 vs 80 MS points.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was such a great sequel. I loved the ups and downs between Eva and Gideon. They are both seriously messed up and they are perfect for each other. I am very happy that Gideon can do what's necessary to protect Eva, tho sometimes he does go over board. This is a supremely well written book and I recommend this trilogy everyone.
B009AMANBA|5.0|While not all that I wanted it to be, Lewis's performance is so magnificent that it takes the movie to 5-star level on its own.  Having read Doris Kearns Goodwin's book \\"Team of Rivals\\", I know how closely it followed its source regardless of the accusations that it altered a few historical moments for dramatic purposes or had no historical basis at all.  This is the closest we may ever get to actually seeing and hearing the man himself.  Also, it's the only movie I can remember seeing in the theater that was met with spontaneous applause when it ended.  It probably reflected the desire to have a leader of that caliber in today's government from any party.
B00846REIS|5.0|A friend recommended that I read this book. I'm so glad that I did. It was a really amazing read. The secondary characters are very memorable......especially Cary! I Would recommend this author and series to everyone. The sex scenes are so steamy! Eva and Cary are the best, best friends!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Continuing to build and draw us in, the mixture of cases and character development are a good blend.  I'm not an attorney, but it is convincing in its legal detail using current social events and references that seem very realistic.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|The remastering was overall very good.<br />I feel my original analog LP sounds richer and the feel of the audience reaction is not the same.<br />But its a CD and Sir Paul is great
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Was looking for a travel/weekend alarm, and this gets the job done.  I opted for the pay version as I felt like it was worth it to:<br /><br />a)  Get rid of the ads.<br /><br />and<br /><br />b)  Be able to pick my alarm song from any MP3.<br /><br />Seriously, waking the kids up with the Pee-Wee Herman Show theme song was well worth the price of admission.
0800141849|3.0|She purchased this movie, never really felt these two were a real couple.<br />Jeff Bridges did not convince me that he was a professor.
0525953728|3.0|The details about the actual raid on Bin Laden were informative and interesting but it too long to get there.  I realize that he was inhibited by secrecy issues butI believe that more could have been written about the intelligence lead up to the raid and what took place prior to the planning for the mission.  The author claims that he wrote the book to put the record straight, not to bring attention to himself.  I think his smug attitude toward government and President Obama in particular were annoying.  There are different kinds of pressure.  Give credit where credit is due.  He was just too smug for me.  Will play well with the NRA though.  Congratulations to the entire seal team and associates.  Wish they all could tell their story.
B008RTE08E|5.0|All I can say is that I always loved this sixty minute fun filled experiment.<br />The Beatles always had such a comical side to them.
1468179993|5.0|Basic knowledge for anybody who wants/needs to public speak. An excellent book for a beginner as well as also a good material for the more advanced ones.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|The book follows Ender as Speaker for the Dead. Another alien race has been discovered and Ender is asked to Speak the Death of a human living in the colony. How will Ender deal with this new alien race. Will he have a chance to make up for past actions?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Super fun puzzle game says it all.  Lots of levels, lots of fun, and it's free!  Only one minor complaint, you have to fill up the whole screen to win the level.  Sometimes there are ways to solve it that are more efficient, meaning they use less pipe and as a side effect they don't fill up the whole screen, but you get no reward for that.  Super minor inconvenience though, hardly worth mentioning on a free game.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was raised in a different country, a different culture, I had my high-school time roughly at the same time. It all came back. Thank you Steve.
B0027CNFR4|5.0|Three superb main actors.  Hilarious scenes.  Great music.  A great &#34;feel good&#34; story line.  What more could<br />you ask for?
B000FCKC4C|2.0|The book was written in a somewhat &#34;childlike&#34; manner. I found it uninteresting and not inspiring. It did not promote the introspection I anticipated.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Didn't know much about the show but after episode one I was hooked. Each story is action packed and Stephen Emmel's body is not to be believed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a season....so glad to be caught up and cannot wait for season 4! If you haven't watched yet, make it a priority.
0007466064|5.0|This purchase exceeded my expectations.  This installment not currently available in US in paperback, but the UK copy I received was in perfect condition.  Would not hesitate to recommend Amazon to anyone who loves to read!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I loved that this novel showed all sides of the war. I found myself sympathizing with many different characters. It also made me appreciate my life and freedom in a way I never had before.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is the best in the series. But i really hope Aden, Vasic, Teijan and Adam get their own books. I can't wait for more in this series.
B0058SNI9O|4.0|These are my third pair of Crocs I had the originals a few years back but they were not as cute as these. Crocs are my go to travel shoes because they are super light, do not require socks, and can be washed quickly. They keep your feet comfortable and dry and if they happen to get wet in the rain, they dry instantly. I like them in the summertime because they are low maintenance. They run a size larger than what I normally wear which is fine with me because I wear a six regularly and my crocs are usually a size five.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved it, my husband loved it and my 3 year old loved it.  It is funny and cute.  There are a couple adult jokes that go over the kids' heads, but they do say fart and a couple other little tiny things I wished were not in there.
B00821OX98|4.0|Would some of the characters really behave the way they do? I doubt it, but its really fun watch them all develop. Easy to get hooked... I am...
B0095P33IW|5.0|A good bit of this film is a superhero-origins story, in which we follow Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a plain-featured young man of about 20 years old who is a classic &#34;90-pound weakling,&#34; as he tries five times to enlist in the Army during the early part of World War II.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Different from the movie in a most excellent way. Mr. Brooks does a excellent job of creating characters believable characters and telling their story.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|great complex show that really builds on itself and gets you inside the characters thoughts.  great use of historical references, can't stop watching!
B007JZGIMS|5.0|Rocket player works very well for using your android device for your music.  I would recommend getting iSyncr to go along with it.  It makes syncing with your iTunes library very easy.
B004LWZW8I|1.0|Love the movie but.....Movie had visible scratch and would freeze when played. Returned through amazon for refund.  Will purchase another copy.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It has been great following the saga of Gideon and Eva as their relationship has grown and flowered. I have to admit that I do get a little jealous of their sexual appetites but for the most part I just find their love thrilling.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Hard to imagine all of the Last Battle unfolding in one book - I wanted them to win but didn't want it to end. Mat, Elayne and Egwene reach their peak and become everything you hoped they would. Perrin is finally doing more than whining and finally stands on par with his peers. While Rand's battle and final path is a bit of let down, I'm not sure there was a way to win given the build up on that one. The nature of his battle is clever and unexpected - as is the finale.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not a loyal reader of Stephen. Our book club picked &#34;11/22/63&#34; with the promise that it was not the typical Stephen King novel.  Being a native Texan and having been 16 years old, living 60 miles north of Dallas when Pres. Kennedy was assassinated, made the subject matter of the book a real teaser.  I was not disappointed.  First, I was amazed at the research that went into this book. I found myself looking up people that I had never heard of connected to the subject.<br />Second, the plot grabbed me from the start.  Third, our book club discussion on &#34;what if&#34; was enlightening.  Well written, long, but worth the read.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|excellent product. I recommend.<br />This is something practical, useful and excellent quality.<br />reached the expectations. Received without any defect or failure.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Have read all three and enjoyed them all but was shocked at the ending<br />I think Mr Archer has to be writing more on the Cliftons.  Hope so!!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The script is well written.  One is skillfully drawn into an understanding of the complex relationships among the characters without being clobbered with violence or excessive drama.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|This book is different.  Selling is different than it was 10 years ago, and this is the only book I have seen that understands that.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I now have the first two seasons on DVD. I will be getting the third as soon as it is out. I love the series and I can now watch it whenever I want.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|This is a great show and another great season!  I will watch it again and again. Highly recommended to all
B008IGP8LY|4.0|The album is a tad simple and nothing special. But If you are collecting Batman soundtracks, just something you got to own.<br />The cover is really thin and nothing made of heavy paper or something else that gives you the feeling of a decent cover or special album.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I'm certainly not sorry I read Silver Linings Playbook but in my opinion its not a must read. The message and basic story line make it hard to put the book down but the writing comes off immature, making the book (and the main character) sometimes very frustrating to &#34;deal&#34; with. Purchasing it on my Kindle app as opposed to paper was the right choice but honestly, its probably a book best borrowed than purchased.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|Wow what a great combination! they should get together on a permanant basis, hope there is more to come!!! RNFR
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT IS THE BEST game EVER and I love it<br />Createative mode is awesome I just love it survival is not that good
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|Wow what an album. I think Valtari is still their best album, but even after 19 years this band still has it, that's impressive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app rocks so many cool features and really realistic I always am playing for hours very addicted you should get this awesome app
B001NA6096|4.0|I really liked the dialogue in this movie - felt real. Good chemistry between the 2 main actors. Can't wait to see the next 2.
B00C5XBAOA|1.0|Like many other parents who were excited about the arrival of this product, I have been so disappointed. I tried someone else's recommendation to glue the heads of Sophia and Amber in place. Doesn't work. They now sit at the bottom of the toy basket headless.  If they could make the base of Queen Miranda's base wide, why couldn't they do that for the other characters? There is nothing redeemable about this product.
B008602KQI|5.0|The acting is wonderful and the story moving. Jennifer Lawrence plays an inspirational character who should be a role model for young women, rather than the shallow, helpless characters in many films.
B0065CCM76|5.0|I was very pleased with this album.  It brought back many memories of the many great songs Bob Seger sang when I was younger.  I saw him on The Voice and it prompted me to buy the album.  I always like to buy the greatest hits and you will not be disappointed with this album.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I like this game because you have to draw the stickman out of trouble, and I doodle all the time! Also, you collect the pages of a storyline while playing, and so far I really enjoy the story. You should really play this. It's fun, and all ages can play it.
B00AEFXXZU|5.0|No complaints. I ordered it and was shown it would take about a week and it was on the door step just 3 days later. As for the movie its a DVD and it worked.
B007ELLDFO|4.0|Well written with an original premise and the author respects the intelligence of her readers. Miss Brodie is a fascinating protagonist.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The movie was good and we laughed.  We enjoyed it.  Glad we watched it as the cups song is very popular now.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Let's keep this simple, shall we? I don't do spoilers because some would feel that it is like being a blabber mouth person that doesn't know when to shut their pie hole.  So here goes,  most people today is on SOME kinda prescription med, do they really know what the side effect of what they are taking. This movie address just that thought.  Not only does it address that thought, it shows you what happens.  I is a wonderful thriller that will keep you guessing till the end.  Get your beer or wine and settle in for a nice ride!  ENJOY!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is great with HD.  Cannot get any better.  The story and sets were wonderful. Would highly recommend it. To anyone.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|This is easily the best album that Hanson has released to date. This may even be the best album of the summer. Forget about Mmmbop please and focus on this amazing rock album they have created over 15 years later.
B0094M2ITG|5.0|I originally saw Big Fish with my children when they were young when it came out nearly 10 years ago and I think I liked it as much if not more than they did. I just watched it again with my young niece and again, I enjoyed it just as much as she did.<br /><br />This movie catches the child's attention in all of us with its fairy-tale qualities that keep you questioning the reality or fantasy based story line. A great movie to address father-son relationships as well as following your heart and ambition calls.<br /><br />Great for families, but also for all adults that would love to spend a few hours dreaming Big.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great and I have not experienced any glitches which is a major plus!  I would definitely recommend this app.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I wish it were longer! I would buy more levels in a heartbeat. Kept me entertained for a solid three hours. More please!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|suspenseful tv series doesn't take long to get over the whole zombie thing<br />would recommend it to anybody. they just leaving you hanging , highly addictive
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Better than I expected. !!!!!  The speed of serivice was great and  it's got a top spot on my repeat listt
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The best of the best look clean and the audio is great... am so happy because my kids find a place with great movies
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Couldn't put this book down once I started reading, just as good as the first book... Will be waiting for the next instalment with much anticipation and excitement!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love the intricate thinking involved yet it is not too complicated. very fun...and keeps your attention for hours...awesome game!
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|Really just another Sookie book, not that different to the others but if you got this far what the hell... A nice easy read...
B005HSL626|3.0|OK the game is fun but... I looked at the key details and it said \\"Location-Based Services\\" what game needs to know your location and I heard it can access your camera and illegally spy on kids. So I tell people to cover the camera while in the game and I do not know if it can access the camera when not in the app so I might delete it.
1475143389|5.0|This book takes everything you need to know about getting into the best shape of your life, and simplifies it for anyone. It's straightforward, clearly written, and provides you with l the tools you'll need to begin an awesome journey. I also love that it disspells many of the myths that can prove to be harmful. Mike backs up his words with solid research. I recommend to anyone, no matter what your level of physical fitness may be.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really liked this app. The numbers were easy to read, and the instructions were easy to follow. Well worth t huh e time.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love having twitter on my kindle.  This app gives me the opportunity to comment on the books I'm also reading with my tablet.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|this has to have been one of the best books I have ever read it was gripping from the very begining<br />it was laugh out load at times and at other times it was sad this book had everything
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I was in the middle of reading this book when the Cleveland, Ohio news hit the headlines regarding the three women held captive with one of them having given birth during captivity. It certainly brought the content of the book more to life.<br /><br />The whole book is told from the perspective of Jack, a five year old and this both made the book more interesting but also disengaged the reader a bit from the raw, horror of the story. The biggest disappointment was that I couldn't connect with the narrative.<br /><br />Honestly, I really wanted to love this book because it's garnered so much praise but I just couldn't. It didn't leave me with much of an impact after finishing it. I did find it a page-turner in the sense that I couldn't put it down and wanted to be done with it but I think I was hoping it would get better and it just didn't.<br /><br />I think this book would be well suited for a book club as it lends itself to discussion very well. Perhaps if Jack had been a bit older, the author could have went deeper into the complexities of Ma and Jack's relationship etc. As I write this review, I realize I'm frustrated because I feel this book could have been better. There was so much more that could have been explored in respect to their relationship, and how they were going to reintegrate into society but it just didn't delve far enough to make it more interesting for me.<br /><br />I do credit Emma Donoghue for taking the risk of writing from the perspective of a five year old and that's why I rated it 3 stars
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It's stupid not right for my kindle and yes I\\"m bragging for you people that don't have 1I\\"m luckier than u.
B001XV09UG|4.0|I enjoyed the glamour of the settings, the beauty of the subjects, and the suspense.  I had seen it before, but the whole story and<br />its simple end message made more sense on 2nd viewing.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This is a wonderfully addictive game with a fatal software bug on the Kindle Fire.  After playing the game for several weeks, the software then fails to start properly and falls straight back to the Kindle home page.  The only apparent way to fix the problem is to uninstall the app and then reinstall from the cloud.  As a consequence you lose your entire history and start again as a rank beginner.  This is very poor programming quality.  Don't purchase if you value your time building up a reputation inside the game.
B00499NHLC|4.0|If you like a good mystery that follows a lot of the original Doyle stories, you will like this series.
0345525558|4.0|I read it pretty fast since it kept me wanting to read more.  Entertaining.  Good characters and story but still, I expected a bit more.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I just started downloading from my computer crochet patterns and I love it. Having my favorite patterns and cookbooks with me when my friends gather to sew or crochet is great. I can share and recommend pattern web pages. Hoping to upgrade to Kindle Fire.
B009CG25RO|5.0|Almost as good as Goodfellas, which is the best real life mob movie ever made. The Godfather is great, but it is fiction and very stylized. I think everyone from Goodfellas but Ray Liota is in it. Again, very realistic. Based on real life. If you loved Goodfellas, you'll love Casino.
0321356683|5.0|If you are in the Java development business, you should have this one. Great tips from an experienced software architect.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|I found this book to be slow and drawn out.  I stuck with it because I needed closure but I would not tell anyone it is a &#34;must read&#34;.
1577314808|5.0|Just as Tolle mentions in the book, he tells you nothing you don't already know. But the style in which he writes inspires the reader to look deep into themselves to find true Being.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is seriously amazing. I was very torn between this and a few others, and I made the right choice. The first place I took mine was to Namibia, where I worked on an animal rescue. I literally had to wrestle this thing away from cheetahs and baboons, and aside from a bite mark, it is in perfect shape. It has withstood animals, sand, dirt, rain, flights, overhead bins, and being stuffed under seats. My camera has never been damaged. Also, it holds everything I need. On a typical trip, I bring my Nikon D3100, 2-3 extra lenses (including one rather large), a converter, headphones, charger, extra batteries, cell phone accessories, remote, two water bottles, a camera manual, cleaning tools, filters, and a tripod. You will not regret buying this. It is also very comfortable. I typically have a heavy bag, but I can hike with it for hours without a problem.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I would like to see this book and the Boone series made into a movie for young people. It is great reading for all ages.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its a time consuming game that has many steps but its really fun and a bit challenging..I love it it
B005XZHQKY|4.0|very good images in high definition, highly recommended to learn a little more of the marine world and its species
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|The game was okay. But i had too many connection issue. Making it difficult and annoying to keep trying to play.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love the kindle fire edition very challenging fun to play very relaxing if you don't have it you should try it lots of fun. Thanks Amazon
B009439HEY|4.0|Steve Hackett created another great collection of Genesis songs. I like his colabiration with different artists to bring a new flaver to his music.
B00A4A2N6K|5.0|i love this album.  high school is my most favorite song.nivki minaj has steped her game up. go nicki m
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Its not Black Celebration, its not Music for the Masses, its not Violator or Songs of Faith of Devotion, but, I really like this album.  Ever since the great Alan Wilder left the band,  they have taken a completely different direction sound wise.  This new album has its classic DM moments on songs like &#34;Heaven&#34; &#34;All thats mine&#34; and &#34;Soothe my Soul.&#34;  This album is very bluesy and gospely which they do very well.  I think DM needs to get rid of whoever their current producer is and  work with the awesome, uber producer Flood again.  His work on Violator and Songs of faith... were beyond brilliant.  All in all  this album is for true DM fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers! I play it all the time. It is very t like all the characters and running away from the inspector and collecting keys,coins and mystery boxes! It is probably one of my favorite apps of all-time.I like most of the games I have on my Amazon Kindle Fire, but Subway Surfers is one of my favorite.
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|Great action, realistic storyline, and entertaining characters make this movie a classic Swartzenagger hit. Welcome back Arnold. I truly enjoyed the movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Absolutely addicting. I cannot stop playing. It has great graphics, and I absolutely love how it changes locations, so there's something different about it, instead of the same thing over and over. Anyway, the reason why I rated it 4 star is because sometimes it glitches, and/or automatically close.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is soo cool it is almost like your actuly taking care of a real horse love so much because i love horses
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It keeps you wanting to achieve a better score each time.  Can't figure how folks get those 150,000,000 pt. scores.  Maybe one of these days.....
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Very well written If you like Jane Austin style books this one is  a must read.<br />great book Well worth your time time
B0089LOG02|5.0|The orphan train story was presented realistically but always with a positive outlook.  The voice of the children was written in a believable voice.  A very good read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game this is like this the only game on my kindle I at least have.so you can drive and race also do tricks.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|I do like this album, although so many people have been bashing it. Kanye West has changed, yes, and people should accept that. People change throughout their life and it comes out in their art. His art is music, and his music has changed. He talked about (on his VH1 music special) evolving as an artist, and the success of an artist being based on whether they evolve or not. This album shows he has definitely evolved. Whether you like it or not is your choice. I loved how the album was produced. These instrumentals are unlike anything you're used to from Kanye West. Some of his material and lyrics on some of the songs is questionable, meaning he's not making a good point, or what he's trying to say is just stupid - for example 'New Slaves', and his sample of Billie Holliday on 'Blood On The Leaves', which was a sample choice that made no sense for what Kanye's song was about. Don't get me wrong. I like this album. It's just strange that some of his lyrics and choices could be such a miss. You have to listen for yourself.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|This is a fascinating subject - Hitchcock - and I knew it would be a winner with Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren in it.  I was not disappointed and this was information I never knew.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the Kindle for Android app.  You can use it for purchased books or books from the library. It is very simple and makes reading enjoyable with its settings.
0393338398|5.0|I am a reader who was drawn to this book due to the author and the concept and not baseball itself. Not being from the U.S. I couldn't say for sure if I have ever watched a full game or not. The reason I point this out is because it's possible to get a lot from this book even if you know nothing about the game.<br /><br />I think that regardless of the industry that you work for you will recognise what this book is about - efficiency of thinking and evidence to support processes. While baseball is the subject of the investigation I think that readers will discover similarities in their own life. The next time that you hear someone say `I just know' or `this is the way we have always done things' an alarm will go off in your head - and with good cause. For this reason I think that many readers, like me, will find this as much a book about philosophy as about sport because it highlights the flaws in arguments that are common and regarded as logical.<br /><br />Outside of the numbers side I found the experiences that professional sportsmen go through to be fascinating. The way that people are fed into a machine at an early age with an almost certain outcome of ending in the garbage is quite disturbing. What's interesting is that some of the players who are simply discarded are actually gems just waiting for a numbers person to apply some polish.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed the previous work of Michael Lewis I would say this is one of his very best. Not as good a Liars Poker but I would suggest that is an impossibility.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The 2nd and 3rd scenes were less challenging and New Age. Not a big fan of that. Do more of 1st scene.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Surprisingly entertaining, griping and not too easy, perfect combo.  I love thinking games! You should try it, it's totally free.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, a little short but worth it. I haven't seen a kindle game like this before. If you like all kinds of puzzles this game will be memorable and worth every penny. Very much like Myst.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I read the whole book and I don't know why.  It was just too graphic in details about their sex capades and I don't think it needed to be THAT detailed.
B00846REIS|4.0|The book was good.  A little to much sex happening for my taste.  Don't think it needed to be so detailed.  But I still couldn't put it down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game I love the activities. Its tedious but at the same time fun and fufilling to play.
0439321603|5.0|Any Harry Potter fan would be proud to own this book. It is a definite must buy. I Highly recommend!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I would highly recommend this to any Phantom Of the Opera fan. Great performance, great picture, and you'll want to watch it over and over.
B0031R5K68|5.0|Excellent plot, kept you on your toes throughout with the twists and turns in almost every chapter. If you've liked Brown's previous books, you'll enjoy this too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this season.  Can't wait to catch up further on future episodes for Downton Abbey. I love it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I haven't read a decent John Grisham book in awhile (not counting re reading his oldies!) I did enjoy this one. I feel like Grisham was just having fun and no one knows how to get and keep your attention like him!<br />Incredulous story though. It would make a great movie...<br />If you feel like a quick, summer read and enjoy Grisham of old - get it. It's high priced, but every once in a while its great to be with an old friend.<br />Worth it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I personally think that subway surf is the best game EVER ONCE I GOT 10000 COINS i love this game because it is soo addicting
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I love this game, and I am really glad that it is on android market. Small concerns with app not following rules, but overall it's a great experience.
B008GJVH7M|2.0|Without going into the plot, I felt Miller's Crossing was contrived and the acting was below average.  Lead actor Gabriel Byrne (playing Tom Reagan) was a dead fish and the supporting cast offered equally poor performances.  All of the actors appeared to be caricatures acting out stereotypes.  I think the film was supposed to be stylized as a modern film noir but the attempt failed.  The plot was uninteresting and the pace of the film felt forced.  Miller's Crossing was not interesting enough to consume 90 minutes of my time.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Love the game.... So much to do... Been playing with my ps vita non stop... I recommend persona 4 golden...
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|I like this game but it is stupid that it is only 20 min for the demo and it is so copying minecraft and minecraft is better than survivalcraft
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Better than 100 floors and I really liked that game. Definitely recommend this awesome game to people who like puzzle games.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|If you are a Diablo fan, this is a must try. Great addictive fun on the android. What are you still reading this? Give it a try the initial price is quite right.
B00123AYG4|2.0|Where to begin.....ok i like Silent Alarm but only after listening to it repeatedly. I initially had a little trouble getting used to the lead singers voice. But i did like the guitar work and the drummer was very percise. Now as for this album I think they overdid things a little on this one. Let me explain: im all for artsy post punk and alternative rock but DAM! When songs start they seem to have a strong beat, or some creative electronic happening, but then they start to get bloated and the band sounds like they are trying way too hard. With all that said I can see how people can like this and i do also,(to a point) but not nearly as much as the first album. If u really want my opinion dont listen to this one as an introduction to this band. Because this album is boring!
B004P1JEXE|5.0|Great insight into what will happen next. So many twists and turns. who is still alive and who died??Hmmmm interesting
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|At first I thought the show was a little corny (I honestly didn't know what to think as this was the first time I'd watched or really heard of Doctor Who), but I stuck with it and grew to love it!!  Now I'm hooked on Doctor Who and got my husband hooked as well.
B0007939NO|5.0|I have always loved this movie and now I have it on DVD.  Its wonderful and watch it every March.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|I DOWNLOADED the app but it didn't work. I can't find it in my apps and I have to log onto the Appstore to get to it.
B003TY3F06|5.0|the best story ever  there should be a sequel what does he want to do to blu lou after killin his dad
B003O86FMW|4.0|I Couldn't put the book down.  Finished the book in less than 24 hours.  Can't wait to read the Rockingham!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun great and a great way to spend free time I compleatly seaport this great fun game
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game alot, but you need to make the instructions clearer. It took me a while to figure them out.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|If you like playing Magic, you'll love playing this app. Plus with it on the kindle it makes it easy go have a fun quick game when you can't get your actual decks out.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|This is a great so for beginners and pros alike. I am teaching myself guitar and this has helped a lot.
0425263924|5.0|love all 3 book. if you got fifty shades of gray you will like these 3 books. a crossfire novel

B001I45UFC|4.0|It was a very easy summer reading book.i am not a fast reader at all. I got on the 7th chapter the first day!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I have a kindle fire second generation. It crashed on the second day of playing. All I get is a black screen. When it works, its great. I hope it gets fixed soon. update. I tried it again a week later and it is working fine.
1118488768|5.0|There are few people in the world who know more about the changing landscape of marketing and PR than David Meerman Scott.<br /><br />He wrote THE book on the matter years ago and now with the 4th edition hitting shelves he hasn't just updated a few words and photos, but completely updated it with new and timely information.<br /><br />I'm lucky to have David as a friend and mentor and this book is one that I always tell people they need to read when they ask for business books that should be required reading and this is it.<br /><br />Doesn't matter if you are a seasoned veteran or a recently graduated worker bee. Buy this. Read it. Live it!
B009CF3MEK|3.0|Enjoyed watching this movie after reading the book. Didn't like Mia Farrow's accent- fake southern! Still, I recommend it for the costumes and other actors.
B0070Y60YE|4.0|This watch is terribly versatile, and timex is kind enough to make the straps in a variety of different styles and colors. I haven't put this on a leather band yet, but it'd probably do as a casual dressy watch in a pinch. Water resistant too. People who wash dishes or get their hands and wrists wet on a regular basis need not fear wearing this to work. Oh, and the timex Indiglo feature is pretty nifty.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|It reminds me a lot of the old windows screen saver from the 90's except you control this one. I can see it being fun to doodle with.<br /><br />The permissions are a but intrusive and state there are IAP but I did not see them in the app. So I am assuming they disabled them in the app but left the code there so amazon thinks it's still there.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is one of the biggest bargains in horology. While the watch is a little small for some (clocking in at 37mm). This li'l seiko comes with a nice automatic movement. I ditched the stock strap soon as I was able to get it off. Looks good on leather, and nato straps (of almost any color).
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|We ordered this movie and waited with great anticipation for its arrival. We started the movie, watched possibly 15 minutes of it, and just couldn't get into it. Maybe it would have been better had we watched it with our grandchildren, but we've enjoyed so many \\"children's\\" movies without the grandchildren (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Monsters Inc, The Incredibles, The Polar Express, etc) that we thought we'd enjoy it even without them. Unfortunately, the movie seemed a bit boring, and we didn't care for the actor who played Oz. Such a disappointment since we went into it expecting it to be fun and charming and just a great movie.
1781162646|5.0|I've never been a Stephen King reader, and have little interest in the supernatural (of which this book has a little, not a lot) but I thoroughly enjoyed this wistful, coming of age tale. Several of the scenes were lyrical and tear-inducing, not something I'd ordinarily associate with SK. I worked in an amusement park myself for several years and, while I could quibble that there were some things the author didn't get right about how things work in a park, he captured the feel, atmosphere, and lingo perfectly. Impressed by this book, I immediately read King's 11/22/63 (see my review of that), and in less than half the pages this one managed to be far more moving, truthful, and memorable. Highly recommended.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read this and jumped right into the other 2 books.  Found the movie on amazon and watched it too.  Great movie also.
1451627289|3.0|After 300-400 pages I was careening happily toward a five-star review. By page 600 it was down to 4 stars, and by the end, sadly, it had dropped to 3 stars. Still, the ability to get through an 800 page book tells you something about its quality and readability, which I attribute to the author's fine style and herculean if less than totally satisfying effort. It could have used an editor willing to trim about 300 pages, though.<br />For me the book began to sag when Jake went to extraordinary lengths (and spent corresponding time) trying to figure out if Oswald was the shooter--even though up front he accepted that there was a 95 percent chance that Oswald acted alone (most rational people, and even Stephen King in his afterward, would put that closer to 99 percent). There are very, very few actions in our life where we demand 99% certitude before we are willing to act, and yet Jake goes through contortions trying to bump that figure up from 95 to 98 or so. Why not just play the (overwhelming) odds, eliminate Oswald right away and go back and correct it if it turns out to be wrong? I know--because then there would be no book. Much like there would be no movie if a, b, and c didn't happen. And speaking of movies Jake reminded me of those film characters who you watch and say to yourself, over and over, \\"don't do that,\\" \\"don't be stupid,\\" \\"I can't believe he's going to [fill in the blank].\\" And then the character goes ahead and does it. Jake was told early on not to draw attention to himself, yet he repeatedly does just that, taking actions that make him stick out like a sore thumb and putting himself at unnecessary risk. (he even seems to realize it but can't help himself).  And AMNESIA as a central plot device?! What is this, a 1910 drawing room farce?<br />The best parts, by far, concerned Jake's dogged efforts to change the fates of his high school janitor and the girl in the hunting accident. Extremely well done with some moving passages. Once we get to boring Oswald, the  long, slow, steady decline begins. The very end was partly redeeming, but it felt rushed and underdeveloped.<br />All in all, an interesting misfire.
B0049VZ222|5.0|It gives you just enough to satisfy but leaves you wanting to know what's going to happen next!!! Ensuring that you will tune in again for the next episode!!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am still finding a good use for Evernote but it is simple to use. As I use it I hope to learn more about it. I am still using one note as evernote does not work with office 2013.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Yup, Its a lot like 50 Shades but who cares? If you like these kinds of books then this is something you'll wanna read!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Time consuming, but fun. I can't wait to get through all the levels. Having the coins to spin slots with is great too.
1449437524|5.0|it was the perfect gift in waiting on a bad day for my girlfriend.  So buy this book and hide it,read it yourself though, then when something bad happens to your dog loving spouse or friend, give them a surprise awesome gift
B00CF34B2I|5.0|...and I'm not disappointed.  It has some features that are improved over the 2013 PC version, though I've not tried 2014 on the Pc.  This *is* an app where I fully expected in app purchases, so that is not an issue or surprise..  Overall, a good experience
B0091REZMW|5.0|This can be  frustrating always having to buy diamonds and sending and asking friend requests.  would like to play without having to involve outside players.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very good. Highly recommend this book. It is very good. Loved it so much I got the sequels to it.
B00CRJTZE4|4.0|Pros<br />-Haven't had any installation issues<br />-simple BIOS, with advanced mode for tweaking<br />-was able to install a hyper 212 evo cpu fan with a zalman z9 case<br />-1 week of use no problems yet<br /><br />Cons<br />-the cpu fan I installed block a RAM port , but it'll depend on what you put on your mobo
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|It's a shame really that such a great blu-ray is wasted on a lazy sequel.  Bruce Willis feels like he's sleep walking through this movie and the script is full of plot holes, leaps of logic, and just general laziness.  I actually enjoyed Live Free or Die Hard and was hoping that this would continue in that fashion, but this just falls incredible flat.<br /><br />However, if you're a fan of the film you couldn't ask for a better blu-ray.  The audio and video are top notch and the supplements are pretty great too.<br /><br />Overall...good disc, bad movie.
B00004YTIQ|5.0|And it still does the job! I purchase two, one to lay on the bottom so as to save the surface paint job on my deck; and of course, the other as a pool cover. It is an excellent price-technically they hold up really well so  I could likely still be using the ones I purchased four years ago! But, yeah... just get new ones...I recommend this to people who are too lazy to clean like me :)
B005HED08I|5.0|I loved Star Trek in re-runs as a kid. But now the new remastered versions have some great special effects and enhanced graphics. This was an amazing series.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I have a small wrist, and also play guitar, so I'd been looking for a watch w/ a left side stem. This one is perfect.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is a fantastic series, cant wait for the next one to be released. I will be purchasing it when it is released.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|&#34;It's a dangerous business, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no telling where you might be swept off to.&#34; In this case, you will be swept off your feet with a well-crafted interpretation of the story. A great first installment.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is one of the most endearing series I have seen in years.  I've watched it several times and anxiously await Seasons 3 and 4.I would recommend it to anyone of all ages.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Fun game.  Irritating when the game times out or won't load.<br /> Can't complain too much since it is a free game.
159463176X|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read. Khaled Hosseini is a master at story telling. No wonder this is on the best sellers list!
B001KZG99A|5.0|Good acting and script.  SciFi with lousy plots are ones I quickly turn off. this was not one of those.<br /><br />Good Scifi needs villians and a lovely gal - Gwyneth filled that spot admirably.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Game is fun but lately it won't connect to whet server it comes from for hours at a time.  That makes it impossible to finish to job for day.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|The variety of games and the levels of games makes foe a very good tool for entertainment. I would recommend it highly.
B00908DDZM|5.0|was everything i wanted and  expected out of macklemore. This is worth getting if you like something alittle off the beaten path
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Hoping to see some dramatic insights into these incredible days of American history. Predictable hollywood good guy bad guy stuff, focus on slimy politics disappointed me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved all the book, E L James did a wonderful job making you want more.  I don't know a women who read them that wasn't taken by Christian.  It turned out to be a wonderful love story and he definitely needed someone good to love and to love him.  I never held onto a book and turned the pages as fast as I did with this book.
0307279189|5.0|Really enjoyed the book, not being a runner I really had no idea humans could run so far, lol Couldn't put it down.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|Being an avid Spotify user, I checked out this album. I had already heard Sweater Weather on the radio and thought it was just okay. When I heard Afraid, I knew there was something more to this record. Then The rest of the album completely swept me up in its arms as I went through the work day. The vocals, the lyrcis, the arrangements, the beats are all amazing! There is something for everyone on this record! And any Lana Del Rey fans might recognize a familiar synth sample in here. One of thee best albums of this year!<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Afraid<br />Everybody's Watching Me<br />Let it Go<br />Alleyways<br />W.D.Y.W.F.M.<br />Flawless<br />Female Robbery
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I read this over spring break it was so rich with detail that it made the book just magical.  Loved it!
B00CL50KDY|4.0|Not a typical zombie movie, but interesting and light hearted for a weekend afternoon movie.  What can I say...I like Teresa Palmer!  ;-)
B002XXNSF6|4.0|I saw Before Midnight and wanted to see the beginning of the series that started with Before Sunrise.  Both movies involve conversation almost all the time and it is pretty amazing that one's attention can be sustained for two hours.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|This is a very profound story and movie.  A must see as far as I'm concerned!  You don't have to have read the book to follow the story, but would be better if you did...they did change couple of things from the book.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|I am not a Barbie person, but I well could be after seeing this Barbie!  She is stunning in her 2013 winter themed gown.  The designers clearly had a snowflake concept and they carried it through beautifully.<br /><br />She will be a treasure for years for any collector (RR - wink!) or young person who loves Barbie.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Hey,<br /> this is an amazing app I really recommend it!<br />It is for all ages, even a four year old could mange this app:)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We can't get enough of downton abbey, unfortunately it's quite a long wait till the ensuing season, wish they had double the episode per season
B0043H2V2Q|5.0|To get the movies in steelbook is definitely worth doing, especially if you are a fan of steelbook case collecting!
B005XI4WFS|5.0|It really bothers me that Violet keeps referring to her mother's stillbirth as a miscarriage. Anything past 20 weeks is a stillbirth, and her mother lost the baby at 7 months. More likely than not she would have gotten to hold and see her little baby brother or sister, and take pictures with him/her. And she sure as heck wouldn't be acting or talking this way after such an experience. A deep, misguided flaw on the part of the writers. God forbid they ever have to go through such a thing.

B000JMKTLO|2.0|Enough to keep me.reading but I didn't find it very mysterious. I like her books but this one was lacking in depth

B0087GF8ZG|2.0|The light worked just as expected, turning on and off automatically as stated in the description. It was bright enough to light up my closet, allowing me to differentiate colors. The sensor has an actual activation angle of ~150°, which is pretty impressive for what it is.<br /><br />However, the velcro's adhesive is really terrible. I used the velcro to stick the light to the wall, and not 10 minutes later, I hear plastic parts splitting open.<br /><br />Problem: The velcro mounting solution failed at the glued connection between the back of the light and the velcro. This was most likely caused by the adhesive force unable to resist gravity's torque.<br /><br />Solution: Do not trust the 3M adhesive on the velcro; use superglue or hot glue.

B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book looking forward to reading the next book. I will say it reminded me a bit of 50 shades of grey at first or I was expecting it to be a lot like it I some ways in comes off that way but very different I a lot of ways too. Just love it...
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|This book deals entirely with the supernatural....it's quite bizarre in it's content....I wouldn't mind that so much except there was never really any point to any of it and it never really went anywhere...left me wondering why I was reading it.  Would not recommend.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|just really enjoyed this book, having read the fall of giants, great depth to the storylines but disappointed to discover i will have to wait until next year for the final book to be published
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I like it a lot, needs a few more guns though. Otherwise it is super super fun. The M1 grand is the best
B002RI9UBS|3.0|at times i was confused not sure of where i was exactly in the book, was it all a dreams or something more...
B00A757EFW|5.0|Was very suprised to see the game was as good as the originally  was. Only problem it only goes ONE level,unless you buy it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Another great addition to the Angry Bird family. Although similar to other editions it is different enough and tantalising enough to hold your interest.<br />The build ups are always clever and there are always levels frustrating enough to draw you back time and again to achieve the 3 stars.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|This was a very informative, showing each move and being able to start out slow (short workout) you get to build-up to tje more intence workouts. That is very appealingly  fresh and fun ! :-)
B002VPE1WK|1.0|I brought this with my first DSLr. It is very bulky and really a back pack. Very heavy . I used it on my trip to sea world it was hard to carry around . I wouldn't recommend it for any daily or amateur use. I will probably use a regular hand bag next time to carry my Nikon as the camera itself is pretty strong. Don't need this back pack unless you  are a pro but in that case you need a bigger bag. ITs good to just keep all your gear at home or in the car just not easy to carry around on your back.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|J. Cole really came true to form with this album. For all fans, this is a strong bounce back from the semi disappointing album Sideline Story. Born Sinner is definitely a classic where J.Cole shows how he has evolved as an artist. For the potential fans - listen in depthly and find out why J.Cole is a hip-hop king in the making!
B00280LYHS|5.0|My daughter just absolutely loves this series.  She liked this book, would highly recommend.  She's age eleven and likes all the books she's read thus far.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so awesome and fun..,but it can get challenging if your stupid like me. its not exactly easy, but it wont leave you awake at night wondering how to get past room 3,lol
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you like the Batman Saga then this would be one for library Excellent box set for a good price
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Fun and action packed, I really enjoyed this game! Just remember with the big fish games, they are only &quot;free&quot; to a certain point.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is very well done. i am looking forward to updates with new rooms and increasing challenge. not 5 stars because of so few levels.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|This set of the first 5 seasons of &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; is just as I expected it would be.  I saw others give poor reviews and state that these are pirated or not original discs.  The discs I received are real and the quality is as expected, that is, very good Blu-ray quality.  Each season has a variety of extras, such as gag reels, and the cast discussing aspects of the show.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|This was clearly one of my best decisions ever made. And I certainly hope you do the same. Buy it for your girlfriend, she'll love you forever.
