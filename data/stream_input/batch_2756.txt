B00AESN8XY|4.0|I thought the game was free when I got it, but it is still enjoyable. Game play is somewhat limited with this version. Other pathogens require more money.
B000RUAR5G|5.0|This movie is almost as good as chocolate milk. It was awesome as a kid. Still awesome as an adult.
0984183523|5.0|A spot on book not only for people who are looking to get into consulting but to learn strategic thinking
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I could not put the book down. I enjoyed the story. I thought that it was going to end like the characters' favorite book. There were emotional moments in the story and I hope that the movie captures the light and heavy moments in all characters. I hope the movie does the book justice.
B0033QC0WE|4.0|I think I wrote a review of the full price set some time ago. I was probably lukewarm at best about it. I feel that the set may have had a capacity to shock once but that time has dulled that. What remains is a set that has some interesting things in it but perhaps not a single performance that would be in a list of \\"Beethoven performances that you must hear\\". In this I feel it was so different from the once equally shocking Harnoncourt set because (for me, anyway) that set has gone on to become a standard to judge others by. It has matured as I have listened to it over the years! Similarly, van Immerseel has since given us a HIP Beethoven set that is far more rounded and enjoyable than Gardiner and all the more successful for that.<br /><br />And yet at this now very cheap price (less than £15) there is a very strong case to get this Gardiner set. Gardiner's approach is uncompromising and that is perhaps it's strength. It has this quality in common with the great Beethoven conductor of an earlier age, Otto Klemperer. It doesn't often smile and it rarely charms. But it sometimes thrills and makes you shout (perhaps for joy!). You may not like or love it so much but it means something and is historically important.
B008PHN6F6|4.0|I needed this movie for a class project and wanted to pull it up on my iPad. I was able to stream it from Amazon fairly quickly and was a fraction of the price I would have paid instead on the iTunes store.
B003W16T9K|4.0|Many people think very highly of this set. I don't quite go that far but at this price it is still quite a good buy. The two late symphonies get performances that are adequate but there are so many accounts of these great works out there that are better. The earlier symphonies sound a little slick to my ears but do have plenty of life and at least some charm. The set is, of course, very well played and recorded. For good accounts of the early symphonies I think you would do better to get Davis or Minkowski. For good accounts of the whole set, Kertesz is hard to beat.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|the game is well structured and has good playing value. this is one to add to the collection to pass time away.
B008CUVOKK|5.0|i bought these for my step son who loves the books so i am very happy with this purchase. thanks
B0067R0APK|1.0|I liked the format on the free version better than this one.  I have downloaded 2 other weather apps and use one for radar and the other one for forecast.  Before the upgrade I used only the accelerated app.  IT WAS BETTER WHEN YOU HAD THE ICONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome! Great development of characters, especially Edith and Thomas. The plot line keeps getting better and better.... Maggie Smith is divine.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I miss the old version where I could find what I wanted. The new version is difficult to use, I can never get the view I want to show.  I don't like the change at all.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Whilst not as fresh as the original saga, it's good to see some of the old gang back to a new quest. The plot feels a bit like a forced bolt on to the world that has already been established, but the writing, pacing and characters make up for it.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|My wife is just starting to get used to the iPod, and I am sure she will love it.  Other products meet expectations.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this is a great game for children to get and you get to own your own horse!!!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I really enjoyed the workout this game gives the brain. Hope to see more added to this app in the future.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|I learned about Ben Howard from a blog. I searched him at youtube and began to love his songs not instantly but after listening to them a few times.  The works of some of the really great artists out there don't fall under mainstream music so one must spend a lot of time searching for them or exploring somebody else's suggestions or artist choices.  Stumbling over Ben Howard's &#34;Every Kingdom&#34; album is one of the most exhilirating experiences I've had when it comes to discovering new artists. Ben Howard is likewise backed up by a great band who can keep up and help bring out that unique type of folk music that can only be associated with him. After listening to this album over and over again, one may realize the beauty of not being categorized as &#34;pop&#34; music because its musical essence does not wear out quickly but effortlessly persists through time, and may continue to be loved and listened to for several lifetimes.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I use this because YouTube for my kindle can not handle those long videos, such as livesreams, and its all in HD quality! Pure Awesome
B009WUBERW|4.0|A feel good movie with all the old action stars.<br />Great escape movie, not much plot but lots of explosions and gun power!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who may think they are introverts or who works with them. I would especially recommend it to anyone who has ever felt bad about themselves for not being more social or for being too quiet. Cain points out how society has changed from emphasizing the importance of character to the importance of personality and as a result has overvalued extroverts. But this book reminds readers of the importance of introverts, what their advantages are over extroverts, and how they can use it to their advantage. For example, Cain mentions that although many extroverted CEOs are more famous and often meet the stereotype of what people believe are good leaders, some of the best performing CEOs based on track record have been introverts. Also, she mentions that introverts can be better leaders of highly motivated, competent teams (though extroverts are better at leading teams that need motivation). So this book is useful if you are an introvert learning what your leadership style is but is also for a leader who is charged with leading introverts.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Truly awesome. Similar to Flipboard in terms of content but a bit more specialized towards your own personal interests. It's free too! An absolute must-have.
B00026WU82|5.0|This album, I have to say, has got to be my favorite album of all time. Its starts with a big bang(like a rolling stone), which is one of the things that makes this album so awesome. And keeps that exitement going throughout the whole album. And ends with this 11 minuite poem that everybody needs to once in there life. I mean, it seems weird that me being a 16 year old writing a review on bob dylans highway 61 revisited. But I love, love, love this album. Every word in this album rings true for every ear(if only every ear would listen). And it also keeps you wondering what he is talking about on some of his songs, thats why you want to keep listening over and over. So if you have a deep respect for music like I do than listen to this album. It will change your whole understanding on music and Dylan.
0345525558|5.0|A good story that includes information on the effects of foster care on the children who get lost in the system. The flower language was enjoyable also.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|First off all I used the audible version to get through the book for a book club.  The book was read by the author and two others with very heavy accents which I had trouble understanding.  The book had too many characters with too many difficult names with too many twists and turns in the story.  I could not follow the story.
B00003CWOL|5.0|I had a very difficult time trying to find this to rent and ended up buying it instead. I am very happy I choose to purchase this movie. This is seriously one of the most entertaining movies you will ever see!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying House of Cards.....halfway through and I hope it never ends.  I've seen the British version and I think this ranks above it!  That's a lot to be said since that production received rave reviews.  I'm never disappointed with a Spacey performance.....and Robin Wright ,as his beautifully elegant wife, gives magnificent support to Francis Underwood's character.  The Congressman's asides and comments to the camera make for some very amusing moments. If Kevin Spacey doesn't win the Emmy for this performance then there is no justice in this world.....Debby Martello
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Are you a nark? This movie has so many great actors! It won best picture and it was well deserved!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I had heard of this show but had never seen it until a friend mentioned it to me.  After that I started watching it on here and I am addicted.  Apart from that, the music is fantastic and USA even has a page on their site that lists out the songs used.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It was realistic yet hearwarming.  I'd recommend it to most people.  It is a little too explicit for kids and some others.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|loved it before.  was so bad with the changes that I deleted it to reload. then I saw that many others have the same complaint.  can u fix this please?
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Serviceable movie with Arnold back in the drivers seat. This is walking tall with a little bit of Fast and the Furious thrown in.
1451626096|3.0|I was dying to read this book, since I have enjoyed the Tudor Series and now the Cousins' War.  I wanted to love Elizabeth as much as I enjoyed the other protagonists, even the &#34;Red Queen&#34;, but I just couldn't believe that a woman raised by Elizabeth Woodville, would not try to use her influence on Henry VII.  To me, she was not strong like her mother, but weak and whiny.  Ok, there are some justified reasons why she despised him before they were married, but afterward, it doesn't even occur to her to use the same magic on him as her mother did on Edward IV.  And yes, I realize that his mother was domineering, but she was in a position to give Henry the love and affection that he craved.  It was as if she suddenly forgot how to use her sexuality, when it was implied that she sure as heck used it with Richard III.<br /><br />It was still a good book, there were moments when I was heartbroken for the royal couple's awkward marriage, and times I was joyful that maybe they found peace with one another.  But, the constant paranoia was overwhelming and made me anxious, I felt like I had to rush through the book to find something happy again.  Then with the introduction of Katherine Huntley, I was just as devastated and annoyed as Elizabeth, but again, she did nothing, but accepts karma.<br /><br />I guess, I expected so much more from the daughter of Elizabeth Woodville and the mother of Henry VIII.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|Not based in any reality we're accustomed to this movie explores your imagination and the inspire your creative side. I thought this movie was fun and enjoyable as a romeo & Juliet from two different worlds who can never truly leave meet or be with each other. Very Reminiscent of terry Gilliam movies.
B00701QVVY|5.0|Overkill are one of those bands that have that amazing ability to write and put out one great album after another in the 33 years that they've been around, I mean they keep getting better and better with age and they're always consistent which makes these guys one of the best and most hard working Thrash Metal bands alive. In the 33 years that Overkill have been around since their formation in 1980, they have gone through many lineup changes with vocalist Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth and bassist D.D. Verni being the two original members remaining from the band's original lineup, and as I've mentioned before, they have always remained consistent throughout the years putting out one great album after another. Overkill's sixteenth studio album 2012's \\"The Electric Age\\" continues exactly where 2010's \\"Ironbound\\" left off. This album is a pure fist in the air, heart pumping, headbanging, powerhouse modern thrash metal masterpiece that simply electrifies from start to finish. Every song on \\"The Electric Age\\" is a true highlight paced with tons of shredding riffs and wicked solos, and plenty of breakneck thrashing speeds, and powerhouse drumming that will kick your ass and have you coming back for more. Even the overall production on this album is just flat out perfect as well. Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth is in top form with his trademark powerhouse vocals as always, meanwhile guitarists Dave Linsk and Derek Tailer shred the speakers with their onslaught of unstoppable shredding, razor sharp riffs and ripping solos. These guys are arguably some of the best guitarists Overkill have ever had. They certainly know exactly what they're doing. Meanwhile D.D. Verni does exactly what he does best, pounding the listener's eardrums with his always amazing, crunching, metallic bass lines, and of course Ron Lipnicki displays his powerhouse talents behind the drums with speeding, pounding beats and ripping and rattling double bass patterns. Lipnicki is definitely an absolute powerhouse of a drummer, and he's also the best drummer that Overkill has ever had thus far in my humble opinion.<br /><br />As I've mentioned before, every song on this album is a highlight such as the explosive and awesome opener \\"Come and Get It\\" which begins with an awesome pumping intro and then kicks into traditional Overkill fashion with rapid heart racing riffs and air tight hammering drum beats, and there's also a great marching and galloping middle section and a killer solo as well. The following cut as well as my personal favorite \\"Electric Rattlesnake\\" is another blazing, pounding thrasher that features more sharp, fiery, muscular riffing and speeding drums along with a catchy and groovy mid paced section, as well as another awesome shredding solo and a pumping, thrashing chorus to boot. Track three \\"Wish You Were Dead\\" is yet another awesome headbanger which keep the thrashing greatness coming (I just love Blitz's wicked, piercing scream at the beginning LOL), while track four \\"Black Daze\\" is a more catchy and groovy mid paced number slows things down a bit, but it's still very groovy and catchy, and is guaranteed to get your head bobbing to it's catchy, and groovy beats and crunching riffs and bass lines. Meanwhile, the fifth track \\"Save Yourself\\" gets the album right back on the rapid, air tightened thrash attack with a quick drum intro which is followed by more rapid guitars and drums, and fast in your face vocals. The following cuts \\"Drop the Hammer Down\\" and \\"21st Century Man\\" are both in your face, thrashing, headbanging highlights that keep the electricity of this album going especially \\"Drop the Hammer Down\\" which features more memorable riffing, air tight drums and menacing vocals including a killer guitar/drum intro in the beginning as well as another awesome solo, meanwhile \\"Old Wounds, New Scars\\" is yet another electrifying highlight that includes the catchy and hilarious sing a long line of \\"Got a lot of mouth for a Jersey white boy\\", as well as \\"All Over Butthe Shouting\\" which is highlighted by an addicting and memorable chorus along with more blazing, shredding riffs and thrashing drums. Then finally this masterpiece of an album concludes with \\"Good Night\\" which begins with a nice and peaceful melodic intro making you think that this song is actually going to be a ballad, but after that, the song rips right into high gear with rapid fire riffing and air tight drumming and killer vocals, and there's also another awesome blazing and shredding solo included as well, making this song an excellent album closer to conclude an all out electrifying masterpiece.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Electric Age\\" is yet another fine example why these New Jersey thrash veterans continue to get better and better with age and write one great album after another while showing absolutely no signs of slowing down at all whatsoever. As I said before, this album is an all out, straight up electrifying modern thrash metal masterpiece, and by all means if you're a fan of Overkill, thrash metal, or metal as a whole in general, \\"The Electric Age\\" is a serious must have in your collection. Believe me, Overkill have definitely outdone themselves with this masterpiece...It is indeed electric!!! BUY IT NOW!!!<br /><br />\m/the Shouting\\" which is highlighted by an addicting and memorable chorus along with more blazing, shredding riffs and thrashing drums.

B007DIQC90|3.0|i only really like 1 song on this cd. but that sometimes does happen. i'll listen to it more often.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really cool! But sometimes I experience minor difficulties with it. This game would be even more interesting if there were something new.. like a time when u play at night... like a difficult part (say night) and easy (say morning). But this game is fun and I look forward to the new people places and ideas!
B00454U1NS|4.0|i do like most of the songs on this cd. most of these cd's are alot cheaper getting them from you .,unless the s&h is outrageous.i hate s&h.
B009WUBERW|1.0|Awful, stupid movie.<br /><br />This was like some last ditch effort for has-been actors to feel relevant.  Sorry, it didn't work.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|this cd is pretty good. i only really liked 1 song on it so i sent it to my sister. she likes it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A young woman is hired to be the companion to a quadriplegic man by his mother.  The term of her employment is  for six months.  Without giving the entire story away, she soon learns he is planning an assisted suicide at the end of the six months, and his mother hopes that having a positive, upbeat companion will make him change his mind.  I found myself shedding more than a few tears over their impossibly difficult situations.  The book was very well written and touched on a different subject matter than Im used to reading about.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my kids and i likes to play this game. the quality of the image are perfects. even the sound is good. keep going with the development of this entertaiment games for the family.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Always something moving along  and all kinds of unexpected twists. I couldn't put it down. I would like to read more from Connelly.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|love love love diamond dash. its a lott of fun. and helps you pass time!! I love it. you shuold play.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|This show is very entertaining, and the characters are easy to like.  Suspend believe-ablity a bit, and the show has a satisfying mix of humor, drama, and romance thrown in.  Good show to watch with the girl.
0140067477|5.0|Read  this book years ago, somehow lost it in one of my moves, fun to have it back. in my library of Buddha books.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This was a very good movie. Good story, good action, and plenty of laughs. A definite recommendation for anyone to see.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I think I'd have to watch this several times to really get it.<br />I had a hard time following all of the story lines.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|The only thing I did not like was that on kindle you can not go to the letters only the page numbers.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is by far the most powerful piece of literature I've ever read. It is truly ineffable. The only way to know is to read it yourself,and I encourage anyone to do so NOW!
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|I've not read any Gaiman books before, but seen many TV shows he's written, so wasn't sure what to expect. But this short novel is perfectly crafted and a delight to read.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This app is great. It doesn't add the pressure of a timer, so it's pure thinking, with the fun of trial and error. I solved all the levels in an hour or so, but was completely engrossed the whole time. Replay value is high, because I turned around and replayed it again instantly, just for the fun of it.
B00E7SID9G|4.0|\\"When a true genius appears, you can know him by this sign: that all the dunces are in a confederacy against him.\\" - Jonathan Swift.<br /><br />Unlike the dunces, I have actually read Aslan's work. I wouldn't call him a genius, but he has actually presented a compelling compendium of intelligent scholarship on the historical Jesus, much of which I have read before in my studies, having received a firmly Christian education. Much of that intelligent scholarship, I might add, comes from Christian historians themselves, rather than those who believe the Bible is the inerrant truth because the Bible says so.<br /><br />Without the silliness surrounding this book from the Fox News types and the contemporary zealots, I might have missed it. So thanks for the heads up.
B004478AS4|4.0|Thought the author was even-handed in his depiction of the clash of cultures in Nigeria. It was a different style than most American novels but reflective of a Nigerian perspective.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I rented this to watch it again in anticipation of watching the sequel, Red 2.  Now I'm looking forward toRed 2 even more.
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|Interesting game! I WOULD LIKE GO SEE A MORE ROBUST ENDEAVEOR IN WHICH ONE IS ABLE TO TAKE OFF, LAND AND TAXI TO TERMINAL OR HOLDING POINT AS DIRECTED BY GROUND CONTROL OR ATC. Nice job!!!
B00B780TAK|5.0|I watched all three seasons over a month's time and loved this.  Can't wait to watch season 4.  Wonderful cast, story line and scenery.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I used to use this app every day then When the app updated my anti virus said it was malware and to delete immediately so I'm looking out for the up update to re-download.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I personally think that it is a very fun game but possibly not for everyone. I do believe that people should go ahead and try this app because it really does deserve its ratings.<br />:)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Downloaded this on my kindle expecting it would be not very good but I'll try it because it's free so I downloaded it and was pleasantly surprised it's an amazing game and I would recommend it to all ages[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I find the controls to not be sensitive enough. I always fail because the controls don't pick up my motions and it's very frustrating. If you don't go in expecting a temple run quality sensitivity then you will be fine otherwise you may wind up frustrated like me.
B006M4F67A|4.0|The gameplay is five stars.  The game has a great layout and fun levels.  I'm just annoyed about how I lost ALL of my progress in the new update.  Frankly I might just get rid of the game because I don't want to redo what I've already done.<br /><br />This probably won't affect the new buyers though considering there's no progress to loose, but who's to say this won't happen again?
B0031KE9C6|5.0|Originally having watched these in middle/high school, I decided to jump on to the VM bandwagon and prep for the movie. So glad I did! I'm remembering why I loved this the first time around and it's just as amazing upon a second (or third!) viewing.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Very fun game! The gameplay is unique and there are side quests you can do. The classes are really fun. Download it now! :)
0425263924|1.0|I read this book cause I read and liked the first 2.  I did not like this one at all, it just seemed to have a lot of filler in it.  I read it, skimmed most of it, and then sold it on Half.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I almost have no words! This book keeps you guessing and on your toes til the very end! Never would have predicted the ending. I recommended this book to all my book club friends!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is great for those of us who were raised on arcade games! Simple rules and tilt is super responsive on the kindle fire. It is hard to put down.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its good for long drives but I ride western. if u can make it so u can choose western OR English then it will b 5 stars
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|He actually found a game that's taking him away from mine craft and skylanders. It is a really cute game!
B006LXQID8|4.0|Good storytelling with a quirky point of view. I watched it with interest although it was obvious how the story would turn out.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The two main characters are awesome.  I love the combo!  The story lines are interesting.  I would recommed this show if you are bored and have nothing to do.  This show is like eating a potatoe chip.  You will not be able to watch just one episode.  I will be upset when I get to the last season and the last episode.
B006GLMHBM|5.0|loved it,  having never seen it the first time around.  great to be able to watch it on my ipad.
B00A822VDY|2.0|The case came shrink wrapped then placed into the cardboard sleeve. The sleeve looked lightly used but I accepted that it was new from Amazon until I opened it.  The blue ray and the additional disk page that held the blue ray wasn't in it at all and the disk page had been broken out of the case.<br /><br />2 stars because I can still use the DVD and I can't complain about the movie.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Well another set of lies to pull in the uninformed. Aslan does NOT hold a PhD in Religion. He has a BA in it. He does NOT teach religious history for a living in fact, he teaches a \\"Creative Writing\\" course at U.C. Riverside. He teaches the art of Protest in the Middle East @ Dru University. If Luke couldn't get it right 40 years A.D., how in the world could Aslan get it right 2000 A.D.?<br />Finally, here is, what I believe is driving Aslan more so than his fake Religious History Scholar rant. Here goes the \\"line drawing,\\" are you ready? Aslan owns a media co. that gets it's funding from, Levatine Cultural Center, connected to Code Pink, Connected to TIDES foundation, Connected to National Iranian Council, whom is connected to George Sorros, connected to PLOW Shares, connected to Media Matters, connected to International Crisis Group, connected to Samantha Powers.<br />Now maybe everyone has a better understanding what the real agenda maybe....<br />People really need to seek the truth before they go into things blindly...
B00992CF6W|4.0|awosome app really cool my brother loved it so I thought to try it. and I was surprised how fun it was
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Since the music is very much enjoyed, it is nice to have the DVD for entertainment. After a few more viewings, it most likely will be donated.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is awwwwwwsome!!!!!!! I love it the world tour is really why I love this app so much if your thinking about getting this app go for it
B005LAIIHG|3.0|This would have been a better movie to rent than to purchase the DVD. It definitely will be donated to a thrift store.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Never had any issues with app until now. I move an email to a folder, go back to inbox and the email is there again. I delete emails and then they appear in my inbox again. I read an email, go back to inbox and it's there again as unread. Getting aggregated.
B000RPCK1U|4.0|This was purchased as a gift for someone who is trying to complete a set of all of the 007 movies. The price and quality were good.
B000ID37RM|5.0|I use their media a lot and it was very handy for the convenience of how easy it is easy to access Amazon. I am mad at apple so this just works out fine...
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|UPDATE: Someone has pointed me to Allan Nadler's excellent review of this book. Please search for it to see the depths of Reza's incompetence as a scholar. I give this book three stars as a work of feverish fiction.<br /><br />(Warning: to vote &#34;not helpful&#34; you must IGNORE this review, which contains up-to-date info on the state of *actual* NT scholarship. It WILL interfere with your gushing admiration of this book. Keep your mind tightly closed!) (Spoiler ends) Today, most NT scholars, even skeptics, accept two facts (without necessarily endorsing the Resurrection): Jesus' empty tomb, and the disciples' experiences of the risen Jesus. This book is a wild ride back to the 70's, when Barth and Bultmann were in full bloom and these two facts were staunchly denied a priori. How has forty years of scholarly progress passed Aslan by?<br /><br />It is a rare thing for an author to have the stones to insert his own appellation in the title before proclaiming the book's subject. But, as we will see, this is Reza Aslan: self-promoter par excellence.<br /><br />His hubris is often breathtaking. Of Jesus' baptism's &#34;This is my son ...&#34;, he says &#34;As John Meier rightly notes, this moment 'does not mirror some inner experience that Jesus had at the time; it mirrows the desire of the first-generation Christian church to define Jesus etc. etc.&#34; Aslan is able to peek into the mind of Jesus and proclaim, nope, he didn't have that experience.<br /><br />But much like Michael Bellesisles ill-fated book on gun ownership that was universally lauded by critics (who turned out to be clueless clowns when it was revealed that Bellesisles book was based on fake data), it appears this book may be headed for the same fate (except among the uninformed). For one, Matthew Franck shows that Aslan has misrepresented his scholarly credentials.<br /><br />&#34;For roughly the first half of the interview Aslan dominates the exchange with assertions about himself that seem intended to delay the substance of the discussion::<br /><br />'I am a scholar of religions with four degrees including one in the New Testament . . . I am an expert with a Ph.D. in the history of religions . . . I am a professor of religions, including the New Testament - that's what I do for a living, actually . . . To be clear, I want to emphasize one more time, I am a historian, I am a Ph.D. in the history of religions.'<br /><br />&#34;... By the final minute he is saying of himself (and who really talks this way!?) that 'I'm actually quite a prominent Muslim thinker in the United States.'<br /><br />&#34;Aslan does have four degrees, as Joe Carter has noted: a 1995 B.A. in religion from Santa Clara University, where he was Phi Beta Kappa and wrote his senior thesis on &#34;The Messianic Secret in the Gospel of Mark&#34;; a 1999 Master of Theological Studies from Harvard; a 2002 Master of Fine Arts in Fiction from the University of Iowa; and a 2009 Ph.D. in sociology from the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br /><br />&#34;None of these degrees is in history, so Aslan's repeated claims that he has &#34;a Ph.D. in the history of religions&#34; and that he is &#34;a historian&#34; are false.  Nor is &#34;professor of religions&#34; what he does &#34;for a living.&#34; He is an associate professor in the Creative Writing program at the University of California, Riverside, where his terminal MFA in fiction from Iowa is his relevant academic credential. It appears he has taught some courses on Islam in the past, and he may do so now, moonlighting from his creative writing duties at Riverside. Aslan has been a busy popular writer, and he is certainly a tireless self-promoter, but he is nowhere known in the academic world as a scholar of the history of religion. And a scholarly historian of early Christianity? Nope.<br /><br />&#34;What about that Ph.D.? As already noted, it was in sociology. I have his dissertation in front of me. It is a 140-page work titled &#34;Global Jihadism as a Transnational Social Movement: A Theoretical Framework.&#34; (Google for the rest.)<br /><br />A big clue to his alleged scholarship is how he flippantly dismisses Josephus's Testimonium Flavianum: he simply proclaims it &#34;has been so corrupted by later Christian interpolation that its authenticity is dubious at best, and scholarly attempts to cull through the passage for some sliver of information have proven futile.&#34; Wow! Talk about airbrushing. He is not lacking for creative hubris. Must be those classes in &#34;world-building&#34;.<br /><br />*Anyone* familiar with the scholarly debate around this passage would immediately raise an eyebrow. Because ... it's funny ... although he name-drops John Meier in a really friendly way, Meier himself, in Volume 1 of his book, &#34;A Marginal Jew&#34;, DOES &#34;cull through&#34; this passage and finds very important material, even accepted by skeptics (and *actual* historians) such as Bart Ehrman.<br /><br />Now, it's hard to explain what Aslan is doing here other than outright deception - giving the impression that he has given Meier's work the attention and respect it deserves, and doing due diligence for you, the reader, to present the best scholarship possible. But he has merely picked what he wants and simply swept the most important bits under the rug, hoping you would be utterly unaware.<br /><br />(If you are not aware of Meier's reconstruction, probably one of the most well-known pieces of scholarship on the Testimonium, perhaps it's a bit early to insist on the accuracy, impeccable scholarship and integrity of Aslan's book.)<br /><br />His main claim, that crucifixion was &#34;reserved&#34; for sedition, falls flat on its face when you actually read his endnotes, in which he says, instead, that it was the &#34;primary ... punishment&#34; for sedition. (If his source supports him, you can't tell, because he doesn't quote much of them here.) You start to suspect that's why he didn't provide footnotes. And we do know<br /><br />He glibly explains away Isaiah 9:6 (&#34;For a child has been born ... and his title will be ... Eternal Father, Prince of Peace&#34;) as &#34;mostly likely composed for specific occasions to serve both religious and political functions.&#34; He does not attempt to explain this further, understandably.<br /><br />There are great Muslim scholars. Aslan isn't one of them, it seems.<br /><br />But as creative fiction, this is gripping in its unfettered imaginative audacity.<br /><br />Do not be revealed as a clueless clown. Check his sources. Oops, hard to do, since he has no footnotes.<br /><br />I'm not saying don't read it. I am saying, don't buy it, either literally or figuratively. If you feel cheated, demand a refund.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I opened the box, plugged the HDMI and USB ports in, was up and running in 3 minutes. I used the chrome plugin to stream a tab and it was great, then tried streaming HD video through one of those tabs, also worked great. Then sent some videos from youtube to load directly through chromecast, worked flawlessly.<br />I'd suggest any of the negative reviewers to make sure their internet connection is fast enough to stream HD content and that their router supports wireless 'N' standards. A wireless 'G' router isn't going to cut it these days for the high quality HD content you've come to expect from your cable providers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|get the game it is the best game I have ever played I love it it is worth $ 7 you will not regret voting it
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Samsung Galaxy SII and Note 10.1, smooth and small file size, really no reason for any permission,  but goes with app territory. I like the challenge surprisingly. Thought it would be dumb, but really gets you thinking. Kill a minute or an hoht...will keep this faotd.
B002VWNID6|2.0|Very upset!  I order this product the first time.  It came with only 17 scenes of the movie on it.  I did a product return and Amazon again sent another movie with only 17 scenes available on the movie!  When It said I was ordering the Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves DVD I guess it referred to the DVD case because I sure couldn't watch the movie....So, disappointed!  Quality Control is a vital part of business Amazon!
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|After I complete the Mummies Puzzle, I am in a loop.  I can't go any further than the 1st puzzle?<br />It seem to be an interesting game, but it's very frustrating. I would like to get passed the 1st Puzzle.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Just like Subway Suffers and Temple Run, Minion Rush is fun, playful, and of course, addicting! It will have you going crazy!
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Great graphics,expecting a free game disappointed part way thru can no longer play game without buying. Can't replay free part without buying!! Should state whole game can't be played without buying!!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My boys and I really enjoy watching Wreck-It Ralp. We have a 3D television and was really fun to watch with boys..
B00377E5SG|5.0|This is a light, easy movie to watch, with wholesome goodness. Harrison Ford and all the actors/actresses play their parts well.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|My boys and I really enjoy watching Transformer. We have a 3D television and was really fun to watch with boys..
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|This book is more about james than bob, however it's still very good. You found out how people could be mean and how a true friend could save you life really means. It's an eye opening and touching book.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|It was enjoyable at the beginning but then got boring.  Not able to advance to other screens, still trying to figure that out.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Great story, but it took a while to get in to. Decent plot twists, although a few were obvious. I would recommend it to any fan of fantasy.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|i was easy enough for an 'older' person but challenging enough to enjoy!  So could be enjoyed by the younger and older customer.  Not for the hard card gamer.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I just love this cd. A true throw back to the Sabbath years. Sounds like it would have been their next album if they had not broke up. Good solid old school guitar work, decent lyrics. Ozzys best in years. A must have for Sabbath lovers
B00005AR3G|4.0|Nowhere near as great as Beauty & The Beast, The Lion King, or even Snow White, but this is definitely a highlight of Disney post-renaissance. It starts out a little slow in terms of humor but really picks up during the last twenty or so minutes, and they're constant. Visual gags mostly.<br /><br />The character development of Kuzco is also interesting. In just over an hour you see a heartless king evolve into a generous emperor, and how patience and perseverance can shape another person's life, thanks to Pacha.<br /><br />Don't pass this one up, if you can only pick one Disney film that came out in the year 2000, go with this one. Fun for the whole family, but like Is aid the jokes that the adults will laugh at are saved for near the end with clever visual gags.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Wasn't a huge fan at first, but once I got the hang of it I played almost constantly.  Fun stuff
B008NMT684|4.0|my son loves this app at age 2 it only took him a few days to figure out how to do it by himself
B00992CF6W|1.0|I think mine craft is a creative way to make cool things and have fun at the same time<br />I
0375507256|4.0|The structure of the book took me aback at first, as it was a bit difficult to jump from one story to next, leaving the previous one in the middle of its unresolved plot. Also, each section is written in the language of its time (past) or how the author speculates English will have evolved (future), which complicates reading a bit. That said, I enjoyed the book a lot! All stories are different, interesting and entertaining. Give it a try!
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I decided to read this book on my Kindle because it was free and I did enjoy learning about his thoughts on how to succeed in today's economy. Good information glad I read it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love Angry Birds and Angry Birds RIO is my favorite!  It's just fun to play and challenging for all
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I tried other similar products, but it too much time to configure and to get it to work.  The MobileLite worked with a few simple steps.  The apps work fine.  When i attach a USB drive to the MobileLite, i am able to stream movies to my other devices.  nice product.  Battery feature is okay, only use it if i really have to.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Opens your eyes and helps you look through other eyes. Loved the writing style. We all need to put ourselves in others shoes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is in my opinion one the best games out there it lets you buy care and feed horse's
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love uno to begin with. The multiplayer is extra neat.  I am new to the game and am really enjoying my kindle.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|are dvd  and blu ray  disc on the same disc  dvd  on one side  and blu ray on the other  let me know
B005EHQGTS|5.0|As an IT guy I have been use remote desktop connections for year. This app is great to be able to surf the web for pages that use Flash or just to connect to my home PC to copy files or do other work. Connecting my tablet to a tv or monitor and using a keyboard and mouse I can remote control my work pc and not have to carry around a bulky laptop.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|Greatest love story ever!!!!  I didn't cry in the Notebook, didn't cry in P.S. I love you although both those movies are up there for great movies.  Sobbed for Francesca and Robert, too brief was their time together.
B001OMJGD0|3.0|THE MOVIE WAS OK BUT NOT AS VISUALLY EXCITING OR THE STORY AS SATISFYING TO ME AS EARLIER VERSIONS.  MY GRANDSON (age 9) LOVED IT AND WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE ENDING.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I originally did not think I would be interested in this series.  One day I thought, what the heck and started watching it.  Cannot wait for more.
0385742886|3.0|This was my least favorite book in the series so far.  I am reading them in order of release date... not sure what way he meant them to be read.  This gives great insight as to how the flare disease took over the world.  But honestly it was written with too many repetitive action scenes and I found that for the first time in the series I had a hard time connecting.  The first two books are excellent, but this could have been an extended chapter in one of the books and I probably would've gotten everything I needed.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk shares their love for music by taking us down a path where music and imagination meet. This was well worth the wait, but for those spoiled from earlier albums will take some time getting use to. For those who are music purists, this will turn the mind into musical putty.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've been through so many headphones over the years, trying to find that satisfying and clean sound, but have always been disappointed and simply settled. I thought maybe my ears just weren't as good as they used to be. Today my MDR7506s arrived and it's like my ears are reborn! The sound stage is so clear and natural, plus the ear pads completely cover my ears and feel tight, without being uncomfortable. My wife had bought me a set of Bose Triport headphones a few years ago. At the time they seemed to sound good, but the MDR7506 sounds soooo much more natural and clear. Plus, the Bose cost over $100 more, are cheaply constructed and uncomfortable in comparison! My only compliant is I wish I had come to these headphones earlier. What a great deal!
B004UPANAI|5.0|It's one of my favorites of the series.  There was no buffering or skipping.  The quality was exceptional.  I was very pleased.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Such a fun movie that is very original in its little characters.  I might even watch it again! It would be a good family movie that everyone could enjoy.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game will make you think!!  Move the drop/bubble around the course in calculated moves while avoiding treacherous spikes that will kill your bubble. You might close out the game in frustration but you'll go back and figure it out. You earn coins along the way that you can spend if you get stuck; and it will show you the correct moves instead of just saying it was competed so you will learn how to tackle the same scenario the next time. The Quell and Azada games are the only ones that I liked enough to play more than once which is the biggest compliment that I can give. Try this for sure!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love this series!  We couldn't watch it when it was on TV, so I was glad to be able to purchase it from Amazon
0679809015|5.0|This book is a good little book to have. It's great to use as a distraction while changing diapers. My kids love lifting up the little flaps.
B004XIZN5M|3.0|Just like the approach gives you a different perspective.  Also allows you to avoid if you have to the expensive gym membership
B006O7XOOW|4.0|This toy is pretty simple but entertaining for babies and early toddlers. My kids lost interest in it by about 19 or 20 months and started trying to use it as a stool instead of a ball toy.
B008M87GJK|3.0|I don't like that you can't flip the homepage horizontally. Headline stories aren't always relevant to me. Could be more user friendly.
0763644765|5.0|This is a very cute book that we've been using to help mentally prepare our son for potty training. Although we're not quite there yet we've been reading books like this and talking about it so that we're not just totally springing the idea on him out of nowhere.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|Great book for someone beginning a meditation discipline. CDs referenced in the book are also worthwhile. I highly recommend it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I've played many games by Big Fish, and this one is no disappointment. The sequel looks great, too. It's all very mysterious, and I would have never guessed what would have happened at the end. This is a great game, and I can't wait for Enigmatis 2! :D
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This matches my old Kindle, which is white.  Works just fine.  I bought this as a permanent fixture for my suitcase, as I would sometimes forget to pack my charger cord.  I'm going to order an extra phone charger cord, as well!
B0091REZMW|5.0|The game is totally awesome!! Yes you have to wait for energy but that makes for longer play time! Thanks for the awesome game!!
B002AWX6UM|5.0|The story of these boy soldiers is so difficult to read, yet so important to read. It was so easy for the central character to get manipulated into fighting the war in Sierra Leone. I was angered, saddened, scared (I experienced so many emotions) all within a few chapters of the book. We have (at least I have) no idea what is happening on another continent on this planet we share and we need to know!
B0091X4HQA|4.0|I decided to buy this via Amazon with my rooted Kindle Fire HD. Unfortunately, I found the same movie in HD on the Google Play Store for a dollar less. So therefore 4 stars. But overall it is a very good movie.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|it was a fun book with the Gods of Egypt and two children in the battle.  moves along very swiftly.  kids should enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game, but there needs to be a whole lot more levels to this mind twisting, brain straining, headache of a game
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I like most of the Angry bird games, this one is tough... I won't give up I will play till one of us wins. I really like the game called Rio. That was the first game I down loaded and has a special place in my heart.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This book is a classic for a reason.  How can a person in the depths of degradation and despair rise to find meaning in life?  Viktor Frankl's account of his time in a concentration camp is a treatise of hope for us all.
B00170F0WU|5.0|In my opinion.... \\"A Masterpiece\\". This movie was an instant classic. As soon as \\"leon\\" asked the mobster \\"do you understand?.. Say it\\" that was it. It really set the tone for what kind of cleaner this guy was. This film still holds up today by far. Luc Beson's best work
B0088P2A7A|4.0|I gave it four stars, what else is important? This whole idea that you MUST add words to a review makes me not want to bother.
140006922X|5.0|Aslan's books is a truly incredible read. It delves into the early history of Jesus of Nazareth. It pays particular attention to how  Paul reshaped Christianity's essence. This book is for some reason considered controversial, but it does nothing to paint any figure anachronistically. Overall, it is very interesting and well researched.
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|Some reviewers compared this to Inception in terms of its special effects.  I really liked Inception, but the Inception plotline let the FX folks do just about anything with the people and props because  -- it's just a dream and who are you to say what my dreams are like?  But Upside Down's theme was a science fiction account of twin planets sharing an atmosphere. They somehow stayed in such close proximity that they formed a ceiling-floor relationship to each other, and their highest peaks were mere yards apart. Further, objects on the each planet obeyed rules such that they were subject only to the gravity of their own planet; if they were somehow moved to the other planet, they would 'fall up'.  Right away, such plot devices made me start thinking about why such schemes would not work, rather than concentrating on the narrative, which in itself was thin gruel.  It was basically Romeo and Juliet, where one planet is populated by overlords and the other by serfs.  I don't think one can be fully entertained by the acting and the plot.  Perhaps you can be amused by the special effects.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|All you have to do is see who is in this great movie!! Kleenex and laughter allert. Makes you want to say, &#34;Awwwww&#34;!
B00CHILW64|4.0|This is the story of one European family on vacation on the coast of Thailand when it is struck by the deadly 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.  Some terrific use of real disaster footage seemed welded seamlessly with CGI to put the viewer right into the struggle for survival.  Some of the subsequent tsunami's -- like the 2011 Japanese event involving nuclear power plants -- reminds us how utterly destructive these events can be.  The appearance of low-lying Thai landscape strewn with the detris and victims was distressingly realistic.  Movies based on real life always seem more gripping to me and this tale seemed to stick reasonably close to reality.  There were ~ 200,000 fatalities in this tsunami, and I would not have been surprised at any number of deaths in the family portrayed in this story.  Some have criticized the film for focusing on one European family when so many of the victims were from the native populations.  This of course resulted from the book having been written by a European, about this family, and he survived to write it.  I have difficulty envisioning another set of facts that would have resulted in a true drama with a focus on those who lost their lives.  It would be a dreary documentary indeed.
0671449028|2.0|Good book but the sequence of events for me is wrong. \\"Going to bed after exercise\\" gets two stars instead of four stars. We should teach our youngsters to go to bed clean, Right??? .
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I cant wait until season 4. Glad that amazon had season 3 available. Cant wait for more to come. huge fan of Downton Abbey.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Anyone who has ever been even a casual fan of baseball should read this book. Lewis' investigation into the Oakland A's and more broadly sabremetrics, provides intellectual insight into what often is considered a boring sport. Now I find myself understanding the game a bit more and watching a lot more baseball tonight. I'm only hoping that Theo Epstein can do for the Cubs what he did for the Red Sox.
B003UBTX7C|2.0|Listened to the audio version of this on a road trip and my wife and I were both ready to put it away after we got halfway through but we sucked it up and kept going to the end.  This book was way to long--unnecessarily and it goes way over the top with the corniness.  I think Baldacci thinks he was really clever but he isnt- I didnt find it believable or interesting.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|Great performances from the cast. I usually do not like Tilda Swinton but I found myself endeared to her character. The two actors playing the title role gave the best performances. I appreciate the concept, though I feel like the director held back on the end. A film worth your time for it's performances and commentary on violence.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like temple run but with minions. Yeah i got my minion. Lol. Will be playing this game a lot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is soooo cool! It's like temple run, and subway surfers in one! But better. You will live this game!
B003FC6WBQ|4.0|Good old fashioned story with megastars from the past.  Whatever the story they were great entertainers and superb actors.  Well done.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|need better instructions not to sure how to play yet need a help button to walk you through the learning of the game
B004529NKC|5.0|my son and his friends enjoyed watching this movie.<br />It was romantic.<br />Dance music was awesome that you can dance to it.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I got this app this morning and I have already completed all of the 44 levels in merely two sittings. I really enjoyed playing and hope there will be more levels soon.
B00A83075M|5.0|My son enjoyed watching this movie with his friends.<br /><br />Even though it is a cartoon movie, he stated that it is liked playing on nintendo WII GAMES.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This is a very good light read for summer vacation or relaxing on the deck. A book usually lasts me a couple of weeks as I am a very casual reader. However, I finished this book in a weekend. I enjoyed it as I usually read mysteries. i will read more Grisham.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|It had everything that you would expect from a James Rollins-sigma force novel, and yet it fell short in a few aspects. It was a little short and not much plot and character development.<br />The twist in the end was really good. I never expect Rollins to kill of characters like that.<br />Definitely recommend it to anyone who is into the sigma force series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I luv that you can make the alarm slowly get louder.  The math definitely gets your brain waves flowing first thing in the morning.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|The children like this game. The app works well. The children especially like placing bandages, taking temperatures, listening to the heart beat. They want me to upgrade so that they can do x-rays and other things. They sound so serious they say because if I upgrade they can make sure that their patient does not have broken bones and besides we will get two more patients. I feel it is good for helping children get to know the things that are done when they visit the doctor's office.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. It is a arcade game where you collect gems and there are alot of levels to play.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really enjoy Mahjong and like the fact that the tiles are easy to read. I highly recommend it if you like solitare games.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Downloaded the game because it looked fun. However once it was done  downloading it wouldn't load and froze my kindle. Very disappointed.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|Overall the game is pretty fun. I would probably rate it at 4 stars if I only considered the gameplay. I enjoy puzzles and this kind of thinking. However, I had to dock a star because every time you open the app the music and sound come back on. It's kind of minor, but definitely an annoyance for someone like me who never wants the sound and music effects playing. If I could, I would give it 3.5 stars, because it still is a fun game, but since there are no half stars, it gets 3.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The only thing bad really was it was a tad bit repetitive but other than that I really enjoyed Christians character.
B005LAII0I|1.0|I do not want to anger anybody but i was not a big fan of Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs because it was only trying to be a hit because it was a first animated movie , so i would give it a 7/10 . But anything the original animated movie of Snow White failed , Mirror Mirror only uses those flaws to make a very bad and very bland movie . It is just to hip to really become a good movie . So do not see this movie and spend your money on Snow White and the Huntsman.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|This game was interesting well developed. However, with only 48 levels it was very short. The difficulty jumped significantly in the last 15 or so levels. I wished there were more the difficult levels.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|My 8 year old is REALLY into Greek Mythology. He tried to watch this about 3 years ago when it came out, but it was a little scary for him, but now he eats it up. Good flick!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I love this app it's like a mod and you can do amazing things. I even made my own skyblock map! But I would reccomend the paid version so you can make stuff like a poignant spawned
0545265355|5.0|This was an awesome series!  What a concept.  Kind of scary, sad and inspiring all at the same time.  I went through them pretty quickly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this app and its so fun. I give it 5 stars. It has so many twist and turns.
034580404X|5.0|Quick read.  Very sexy but surprised to find that there is actually a story line in the books and I was actually reading quickly to see how they ended up.  Very happy with the purchase and service from Amazon.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new version has turned getting the forecast into a game. The Forecast tab is a hairsbreadth away from the &quot;gift box&quot; icon - probably a purposeful decision by the marketing group - so most taps bring up the what-you-can-do-with-your-points page, which usually takes a minute or more to load on my new Kindle Fire HD on an 802.11n network.<br />There is no real differentiation to any parts of the interface - everything is the same flat value so you have no sense of what is active and what's not.<br />It now reminds me of the images I've seen of the Windows 8 interface - only worse.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|This is a nice cover for the Kindle Fire, especially for the price.  It keeps it clean and also works as a backboard to hold up the screen while watching movies/tv shows.  Very happy with it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Although this game is addictive, it was also challenging and fun. I played the previous games called Quell, so I was compelled to continue.
0345529057|3.0|I bought it since I waned to read it but fonts were too small i have to returnit but may be will buy the big one later
B00COO2D6O|4.0|it keeps beating me this is a very frustrating game, but i can't seem to stop playing it. i hope i can figure out how to beat it.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|My friend wanted this product and I bought it for her. She said she love it and it is a great product
B00C2VGAW2|4.0|I enjoyed both the movie Great Gatsby, and the music. Jay Z's take is definitely appropriate for a Baz Luhrman film, but I would personally have liked a bit of period music to have been incorporated into the soundtrack.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Always wanted the DVD and so happy I finally Got it. One of my favourite Cartoons and I love it so much
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I bought the album because of Sail, but I like a lot of the other songs as well. They are positive and upbeat overall, and I especially love &#34;Not Your Fault&#34; for it's vibrant angst.
1451696191|5.0|Bought as a gift and children love it. was a great movie too. I enjoyed both the book and the movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|I agree with those that said this game made no sense and was extremely frustrating.  Had no idea of what was expected or how to do it.  Boring.
0375851569|5.0|I love these book and wanted to give a gift for my friends daughter, she love it and want to read it right away.

B000WQWPKA|5.0|One of the best moves and action. I love the cast and director. Done very well and wanted to collect this for the future.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Nice to watch something that isn't really a musical nor too much drama.  Nice to watch with the family and to have it available in the que.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|All the cast is great great job and good story. I really enjoyed the movie and the cast mostly the Thor
B003JH8LPW|5.0|This book was terrific and I couldn't put it down.  I have already recommended it to a friend.  Dan Brown is a fantastic thriller writer.

B00C7L8DM2|1.0|A Taken knock off, sure that's the state of film today, but the premise is not the problem it's the execution, just atrocious, ARAAAAGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I have not seen a move I was so excited about and moved with the movements. Great cast and great story line
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I would definitely recommend this game. It is entertaining and keeps my children busy for hours. It is challenging enough and has different levels - which help to keep the kids entertained.
1423140605|5.0|I love this authors book, they are the best. Anyone can read the book very simply written and Love the story line.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written, simplistic, no plot, waiting for a story line.<br /><br />It never did develop into a viable story.<br /><br />Way overrated!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The best move of the summer ever. I love the story and of course the cast. Still keep watching it over and over again

B009UAO1ZG|3.0|A well written, important and scholarly book butchered by Amazon by omitting footnote linkages and page numbers to save a buck with no concern for product quality.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I seldom agree on TV programs, with our tastes being so different, but this is one program that we have thoroughly enjoyed together. Just sad that we've run out of episodes to watch until Season 4 begins.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|play with horses, care for them l,love them. such an amazing app. u should try it. definitely the best horse care game I can find.
1932735410|3.0|The Rita book and her format is a well-known standard guide necessary to pass the Project Management Exam. While I don't take away anything from the positives of the book, I feel it's best to clarify several misconceptions about the book based on previous reviews that I feel may not be an accurate interpretation of the book, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />For one, this book is a great book that teaches the concepts that the PM Book 4th edition guide does not explain well. It really goes into depth and explains what is needed to know based on the concepts taught in the PM Book 4th Edition. However, please note - the Rita book alone in itself is NOT ENOUGH to pass the PMP exam. I understand that the PM Book 4th Edition guide is boring but believe me, it is necessary to read that as a supplement to this study prep book and also perhaps use additional flashcards or take an outside course in a classroom or on-line test prep if you don't have too much time before you sit for the exam. There are elements missing in the Rita's book that are explained in the PM Book 4th Edition guide and that are ON the exam. There aren't that many, but there are some.<br /><br />Some other minor issues I had with this book but was able to overlook during my studying for the PMP exam was:<br />a) This book does have a condescending tone. I can overlook that in the business world with colleagues who may not know better, but in a study guide, is it really necessary? Perhaps in the new edition, the tone is turned down a notch, but I sat for the PMP exam in July 2013, before the new test came out with additional material to study and I know there is a new Rita's book - a later edition.<br />b) Rita's Process/Knowledge Chart - the PLANNING column is not helpful in fact, it's confusing. The monitoring and controlling and the Executing areas are helpful to review, but in the third chapter of this book, it is drilled to 'memorize' the planning column and know them in order. if you know the material well enough, you don't have to memorize that column and it's not really in alignment with the PM Book 4th edition so I found it confusing. I mention this specifically because Rita's chart is RE-ITERATED (A PM-ism) many times in this book.<br />c) Finally, Rita has a final chapter in this book that tries to 'tie everything together'. I have to say that it does a poor job of doing so.<br /><br />The reality is, the information presented in this book is good a relevant. The book is 500+ pages long. I read it at least 3 times. But I feel it was missing something - had some gaps. The exercises were ok - I did the majority of them. But in order to pass the test, just using this book and using it alone would not work. So my advice is, yes, it's a good book to buy to help you pass the PMP exam, but should not be the sole and only source of what is used to pass the PMP. I studied from April 2012 to July 2013. Advice is to make sure you have dedicated enough time to learn and study and memorize all of the material you need to for this exam because it is hard and challenging. Also, get additional reference material other than this book alone, it really is worth it. If you can, try to invest in a course in a classroom to study right prior before the exam, do plenty of practice questions and see why and where your knowledge area gaps are, and good luck!
B000GFLKF8|5.0|How did I miss this when it first came out?  Denzel Washington is terrific as a rookie detective wise beyond his station; Jodie Foster is sharp and slick as a fixer.  The rest of the cast is just as good, and Spike Lee's directing keeps the tangled story clear with contextual cinematography.  It's all handled with a light touch, too.
0529064847|5.0|Its good, for my son now to the private school, he lost the first one, so I find this here in Amazon. I like it, and its complete. Thank you. I recommend this biblie.
B00CO8AF60|5.0|A brilliant  film but where are the extras? On dvd there were many but on the bluray there are none.How  ridiculous to  exclude them.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Wanted to get to the end of this about 3/4 of the way along.  It just seemed to drag after a while and I wanted to say &#34;get on with it&#34;!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Stop reading reviews and start reading this book. It is so well written and constructed. The twists are great and the emotions are real. I couldn't put it down. Why aren't you reading it yet. . .
B0063M22QO|5.0|Just started tonight, but looks like a lot of fun.  I like the challenge and it seems more difficult than others
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I had high expectations for this movie, and for the most part, they were met.  I liked all the choices for actors, I liked the direction, and the special effects were great.  I really like Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner.  I put this movie in the same category as Captain America, Iron Man I, and Batman Begins.  Much better than a lot of the super hero flicks like Thor, any of Spider Man 2 and 3, or any of the Fantastic 4 movies.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|My Weather Channel app recently changed, and I prefer the previous one. Now when I open the app, I seldom get information--about 90% of the time, in fact! I miss the hourly predictions, but did notice it showed approximate time to expect rain showers. When I have been able to access other features, they seem to work well.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love the color and the texture of the cover. I like how it the Kindle snaps in and out exactly.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|If there was there was single book out there that could transform relationships and change the course of a marriage on the brink of disaster this would be it. The key is that both parties must each independently &#34;buy&#34; into the program and &#34;do&#34; the work. It is simple, emotional and communicative work. Much easier than the paperwork involved on divorce and paying off parasitic lawyers. However, it goes against our grain, our past hurts and disappointments and unmet expectations and our pride which makes it actually harder to do.<br /><br />I'm starting a new relationship and getting married in a few weeks. The foundation for our marriage is NOT going to be love but Communication and this is our handbook. Love won't build a marriage but Communication will. Build your relationship on a solid foundation build it on the principles outlined in this book and then you will have enduring and sustainable compassionate love.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|We really enjoyed this game. It is not predictable like some games. I hope that they add more levels soon.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I can't begin to say how much I love this series! Obivously or not, in order to understand anything in the later seasons, this one must be watched, and you'll be hooked from the first episode! I love how the series still has fun episodes and hilarious scenes thrown in with the deeper, darker stuff. It makes it well rounded and you'll find yourself itching for more!<br />Also, this is a FANTASTIC price for the seasons- in stores they are $30-40, depending on the season.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|A Great read keeps you wondering where Harry will end up, another Jeffrey Archer great. Cannot wait to read the last of the trilogy .

I love how the series still has fun episodes and hilarious scene thrown in with the deeper, darker stuff.

It's still compelling and worth the watch!<br />Also, this is a FANTASTIC price for the seasons- in stores they are $30-40, depending on the season.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|Applied a couple coats to index and thumb of my leather riding gloves. Worked right away with my iPhone, even with a screen protector on it. Seems a bit expensive for such a small bottle of chemical, but then it's kind of a specialty item, isn't it? Beats paying exorbitant prices for special touchscreen gloves!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I've just started this season, and boy does it throw a fresh new plot into the series. I can't begin to explain how much I love this show! Obivously or not, in order to understand anything in the eighth season, this one must be watched. I expect it to be as well rounded as the others and I can't wait to see how it develops!<br />Also, this is a FANTASTIC price for the seasons- in stores they are $30-40, depending on the season.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|My daughter actually found this, she had really enjoyed Les Miserables and was looking for something similar.  This was surprisingly good, and had us all singing the rest of the weekend.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|What a great addition to the series! I can't begin to say how much I love Supernatural! Obivously or not, in order to understand anything in the later seasons, this one must be watched. I love how the series still has fun episodes and hilarious scene thrown in with the deeper, darker stuff. It makes it well rounded and you'll find yourself itching for more!<br />Also, this is a crazy awesome price for the seasons- in stores they are $30-40, depending on the season.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Good misdirection.<br />Good acting by all actors that were in this movie.<br />Good directing by the director of this movie.

B003L77GGK|5.0|I can't begin to say how much I love this series! Obivously or not, in order to understand anything in the later seasons, this one must be watched.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|got started by watching season 3 on pbs need to see the others will recommend great wonderful as season 3
B002BVQU5A|4.0|I took my husband's advise and watched this for the first time. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Johnny Depp and he did not disappoint in this movie.  Pop some popcorn, curl up and watch this one!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game and graphics although kind of hard for the average person like me even though it is meant for children
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I was a cute movie that you really didn't have to think.  Just hit play and enjoy. Not something I would watch over and over again but if it was a rainy day and I flipped to the channel, I would stop and watch it again.
0374531269|5.0|This book was absolutely incredible. It made me want to reach out and save him. I could not put this book down. Very well written. Ishmael Beah takes you straight into every second he is reliving. I was instantly inspired to get more involved in my community, Amnesty International and the IRC. Grab you Kleenex, your heart will twist as go through this difficult time with him.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is a great game!  So much to do in it. Got it for free but would have definitely paid for it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book, I don't know that I will read another book by this author.  Maybe rereading it would help me to like it better.  It is not a book I would necessarily recommend to others.
B004XZR63M|4.0|this book is good for people wanting to have a better understanding of the difference in thinking between rich people and poor people.
B00CATSONE|1.0|...especially when it's free. This thing reads like a high school sophomore term paper. Probably can reap more in depth study about Tesla on Wikipedia.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Need I really say more about this product. So far I really like it and highly suggest getting one. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B000VZSOI4|4.0|This real book is great, it has a great selection of songs, for a beginning jazz musician. It is perfect with the Bb edition, all page numbers are the same, and it makes it easy to play with somebody else. The only complaint was they the packaging was HORRIBLE, the book's corner was all smashed and bent, though all music was still readable. This is why I give four stars, four and a half if I could.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Factory balls is a super fun super addicting logic puzzle. The goals are simple and everything is easy to figure out. It is also really easy to redo a level if you mess up. When I got this game, I played about 20 levels before I made myself quit. This is one of the best games I've seen. Totally worth 99&cent;, even though I got it free, but I'd still pay a buck for it.
B007C52NY2|2.0|I have to say I read the first two volumes of the trilogy and got 186 pages into the final volume when I discovered that not only were 60 pages missing, but page 501 followed 186. When I went looking for 187 I never found it. The story picked up at page 236, 89 pages after 501.<br /><br />Somehow the printing really got screwed up. So I have to rate the purchase as unsatisfactory.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is like such an ADDICTING GAME!! LOVE IT!! I would definitely recommend this  game to someone just am amazing game!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun. Looks like real horse and stuff. Fun to play an  it's actually like having a real horse. 3-D action and stuff c:<br />You could  buy coins and gens too.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|We had never heard of Joe Bonamassa before and couldn't understand why there were big ads on display in our city when he was on tour. All of my &#34;expert&#34; guitar playing friends couldn't/didn't tell me anything about him. One evening we were watching PBS and viewed this presentation. We were blown away.  I ordered the CD from Amazon (I know I could have helped with the public fundraiser by getting it from them; but I wanted it NOW)...we didn't even wait for the end of the show.This has been copied to every single musical player that we own. I played it non-stop on a 2 hour road trip and I still have it loaded in my vehicle.This guy is fantastic and the musical genius displayed by all of the performers made me smile and be amazed!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Suspense and perfection on every page. Very great comic, well worth the money spent to read it. I love it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I really like these books, and I'm not usually into this genre. Well written and engaging.  Read the books before watching the series, you'll be glad you did.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love this game but the costumers get mad fast. But I really recommend this game if you love Hello Kitty!! And the best part is its free! And it's like your owning your real restaurant  but it's a cartoon. That's why I  give five out of five stars.
B004BSFC46|5.0|These are great!  We've been using them since about age 2 months (daughter is 4 months now).  She enjoys just picking them up and crinkling the bug's wings (not necessarily wearing them on her wrists).  We've strapped them around her feet, too, and she'll stare for long periods of time at them and kick like crazy!
B00BC5I6Q2|2.0|\\"House of Cards\\" began as a trilogy of novels by Michael Dobbs, which is the best version. BBC turned it into a miniseries starring Ian Richardson, which is excellent. This American version just turns it into ordinary TV with a nasty protagonist and lots of sex and violence. Francis Urquhart (initials not incidentally \\"FU\\") is a villain, but as Dobbs wrote him and Richardson played him, he calls Shakespeare's Richard III to mind, a villain thoroughly enjoying his villany and including the audience in the fun. As played by Kevin Spacey, renamed Frank Underwood, he is just a despicable man.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's  a page turner. And a really fast read. Oh yea and you should read it. Cool. Cool. Peace out.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics were awesome. Not a mindless game, need to put thought into it. Won't say more or else I might ruin it for you! Worth the 2 bucks.
0938045768|5.0|This is a good book for anyone. You'll get fit, assuming you actually open it and lay off the Cheetos.
B000N5F6OW|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed watching John Wayne doing his thing in this enjoyable movie about big game trappers in Africa. John was the usual gruff, big lug with the young, sweet French woman who admired him greatly. The movie was a lot of fun and had its moments of excitement...Highly recommended.
B00847KFDS|3.0|There are some really good covers of these Fogerty classics. Check out Bob Seger's version of Who'll Stop the Rain and the title track Wrote a Song for Everyone with Miranda Lambert. Unfortunately, not all of them hold up against the originals and some of them are a tough listen.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I had high expectations fo this book because of its long tenure on the bestseller list and great reviews.  It wasn't worth the time.  It is a good story about family, tragidy, and community, and has some decent legal drama, but overall I just give it 3 stars.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|The error message was that the Amazon servers were unable to deliver the streaming video - try again later. What I suspect is that there was a billing issue (that has since been resolved). My beef with it is that after trying several times to get through to Amazon about it, I gave up. Booo.<br /><br />Oh, and Cloud Atlas was a fun movie. Nice cinematography. I know because I rented it from Vudu ;-)
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|A friend just got this from Amazon and invited me over to check it out.  We were so excited and were planning on buying a few of these since the price is just right. We quickly realized this is too good to be true:<br /><br />We tried Netflix and was not able to watch anything. The picture was very choppy with out of sync audio.  It kept on buffering and we could only watch 2 to 3 mins at a time before buffering again.  He has the Roku and AppleTV on WIFI there and both work flawlessly with HD quality pictures.  We then rebooted his WIFI, hoping that it may help but the Chromecast kept on buffering.  We then tried youtube and it was worst.<br /><br />He got a replacement yesterday from Amazon and it didn't help. Save your $35 dollars and buy a Roku and AppleTV.  This is really a worst streaming device on the market and I don't understand why lots of folks gave it great reviews.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I love the idea of this product and of course the price.<br />It is limited to what it can do but the developers are working hard to push things out.<br />I am excited to see its growth.<br /><br />I purchased this item, out of the box and into the TV, chose the hdmi port, followed the instructions on the screen and within 5-10 minutes I was watching netflix and listening to my music without any issues. I plugged this into the my receiver and worked with 7.1 surround sound like it was on a blu ray player. Awesome for the price, excited to see what is next.
B00275EHJG|4.0|I liked the humor in this.  The only problem I had with this DVD was that it might be a little too stressful in some parts for young children.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not stop reading it, it had me hooked until the end. I wanted to continued with the next book right away cause I was so intrigued by what would come next only to find myself wanting the story to be prolonged.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it is amazing. I am submitting this because I want gems to buy my horse something awesome.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|If you are an avid fan this is for you. As an occasional fan this was just another action adventure movie but it is a little unbelievable how much destruction and violence occurs and he always lands out on top.  Enjoyed Judy Dench and Daniel Craig but loved the bit with Ben Whishaw from my favorite show The Hour.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I was quite astonished by TESLA's courage, dedication, resilience and such little self-interest but I was even more surprised about how mean were Thomas Edison and JP Morgan.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone.
0525478817|4.0|This was a great book with lots of ups and downs.  There is a reason as to why they are making a movie out of this book.  You will laugh, cry, and all the in between.  Although the plot is not as in depth as I typically like it's a young adult novel so it's great for your high schooler.  For the adult reading this book, bring it to the beach and you'll be done in one afternoon. And you won't regret a second of it.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|quality from amazon was good. movie had an allstar cast but was not that funny. true to life, just not that entertaining.
6305433909|4.0|Sister Act 1 and 2 are \\"must see\\" movies for pure entertainment. I purchased them for my wife and I also enjoyed them. You really can't go wrong setting aside a few hours to watch them.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I love Sophie's books for light vacations reads. This one was okay, but definitely not her best. It became almost tedious and too much at parts. It still is a light read---glad I read it overall.
B00DGQF0K0|3.0|Grand daughter is stuck, and not sure what the numbers are on the one level.  The one with the car and blocks with 6 - 1 - 2. Can anyone help her to go to the next one?
0064471837|5.0|This sounds like the basic set up for any fantasy world. It's not, though. The thing that fascinated me the most is that this world is fairly analogous to Earth in the 1940s. They have the sort of technology and culture that England had during that time, and that's not all. The world is divided into two halves, the New Kingdom and the Old Kingdom. Technology doesn't work in the old and magic doesn't work in the new. The wall, a dividing line between the two, is constantly guarded on both sides and not just anyone can cross. Sabriel, the daughter of a powerful necromancer, is an exception to that rule. She possesses her father's abilities and knowledge and, as the synopsis hints, has to use them to quiet the rising dead and their new ruler.<br /><br />In addition to what's, in my mind, a great bit of world building, Nix has created some very good characters. Sabriel is the sort of strong female character that I like to see in YA fiction. She doesn't need rescuing and in fact at one point rescues a royal male. She's not over the top though. She has her own fears and worries. She's far from indestructible and needs to adapt quickly to the changes in her life. She makes mistakes and earns her place in my heart. My other favortie character in this story is Mogget. He plays a reluctant and not entirely trustworthy adviser to Sabriel. There are truly some funny bits to their interactions.<br /><br />This is a well written novel. Not for nothing, it won an award or two. The world building is largely seamless. The threats to the characters are well handled. You feel pretty certain who's going to survive and who won't, but never so certain that there's no tension. There's plenty of action and suspense, with a dash of romance. I immediately handed this to my thirteen year old daughter to read. I give this five out of five wands.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best series I've ever read, it's mind blowing. It's most absolutely gut wrenching it's a must read.

B0080SZ0V8|2.0|I think there needs to be more help clues. When you are stuck there is no help getting on track
B0030ZOYHC|1.0|It doesn't include the 20 page booklet!!! Misleading!!!! I'm writing a complain for this! Totally unacceptable! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I love Iron Man - I hope that franchise lasts a long time because Robert Downey Jr. does a super job as a super hero.  It was fun to watch - all the other heroes were great too.  I was not familiar with Captain America but I like his character too.  It had a nice balance to it I thought.  I hope they do another movie together.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut was always one of my literary heroes growing up.  As the years have past (as did Mr. Vonnegut), that opinion has not diminished.  I've purchased this book several times because I keep lending it out ( and never seeing it again.  Purchased the e-book now and enjoying reading this masterful novel once again.
B0026772N8|5.0|This is not only a great insight on life, but a fantastic fiction story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because it wasn't just a dry telling of major topics in philosophy. Rather, it gave an overview of philosophy in the context of a story about a man, his son, and his motorcycle.<br /><br />This is a great book. I am not a scholar of philosophy, so I did not find those topics &#34;watered down&#34;. This book gave me a new perspective on life and I plan on re-reading it in the future.<br /><br />There were so many moments in the book where my hair stood on end and I had to stop reading it so that I could fully digest what I had just read. I had to take a moment and just let things sink in while my jaw was on the floor.<br /><br />Another thing, READ THE AFTERWORD!<br /><br />Buy it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|fun like everyone said but loads slow and freezes on my older kindle fire. but that could be the two background apps I run contributing to that.
B0083GOVLW|5.0|Persepolis is a beautifully done film that takes you on a journey through Iran's roughest times, and while much of the story is very dark and bleak, you cannot tear your eyes away. Beautiful drawings shed light on the lives of the people who went through such a terrible period of history and shed eye-opening light on our shared humanity.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Nothing compares to a good old-fashioned movie with morals - you don't have to concern yourself about the language or content.  I highly recommend an old-fashioned family night to go with this movie - great for family discussion afterwards.  Kids are missing so much today by not being exposed to solid, pure enjoyment at it's finest like they will if they watch this movie - as well as their parents and siblings!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have to confess, I am a fan of Khaled Hosseini's work, and with the latest one, The Mountains Echoed, he does not disappoint his fans. The Mountains Echoed is an emotional tale which will pull at your heart strings and give you a new perspective about your own relationships with your near and dear ones. The characters are very well sketched and while you wonder which character will lead lead to what, the readers are never dissapointed. The language used is brilliant and the story unfolds as if one is seeing a moving picture.<br /><br />Why then did I rate it 4 stars?<br /><br />While each character is interesting Khaled does not develop some of them fully well. We know very little about Abdul's struggles and his whereabouts, whereas Dr. Vavaris' story is etched out in detail. Also some of the other characters like the two cousin brothers, are also incomplete.<br /><br />Conclusion: A very endearing story, well sketched characters, and a masterful storyteller... Do you need more?
B007ZXK08C|4.0|It starts very slowly and makes you wonder what all the hype is about. It takes off about 1/3 into the book and follows some wonderful twists and turns. The ending was very disappointing and I felt let down by it
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I loved the descriptions of Bombay and the Indian people. I visited Indian twice and the novel brought back wonderful memories.<br />The writers imagination is amazing and each event is fast moving, and believe me there are many.<br /><br />My dislikes - the long philosophical ramblings. I started to just skip over them as most of them I didn't understand or cared to and the other was the descriptions of Lin's experiences in the New Zealand prison. I didn't see much need for this except to explain how he learned to fight.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|This light is very similar to the Rayovac Sportsman which enjoys good reviews.  I have compared the two as a number of others have and taken the two on a camping trip.  This light is a little less rugged, but very much the same as far as light output.  Those who worry about the blinking locator light will likely have more to worry about as it blinks more frequently and is a bit brighter with this lantern.  I don't store the lamp with the batteries active so it is of no concern to me.  Unless you feel you need a more rugged light (I don't), this will do the same job at a better price point..
B00514HDNW|5.0|Anyone who likes a great sci-fi and horror combination should enjoy this.  Each of us can imagine ourselves as the last of our kind and how we would handle it or lose it! Good reading here.
B00DYWO09I|1.0|Prince of Persia games, at least the 2D variety, are about dying over and over until you make the jumps thanks to the pin point precision needed to make them(i know because i played the original that came on floppies with a hard 60 minute time limit) . But now, you need revive potions to restore for checkpoints or you have to restart the level. These can be found  in game, or bought with coins, lots of coins. Coins can be gathered slowly in game, or they can be bought with real money. $1.99 for a thousand coins.<br /><br />Once the potions run out, you'll either have to farm them by continually restarting the level, which will take forever and go fast, or you have to buy them. 1 potions costs 250 coins, 5 costs 1250 coins(note no bulk discount).<br /><br />That would be bad enough, but the collision detection is often poor, springing traps when you appear to have cleared them. That seals this game's fate.<br /><br /> DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is nothing but a freemium cash drain masquerading as a standard prince of Persia title. But Even the most blatant shameless freemium cash drains don't have the potential to drain you as fast as this game does.<br /><br />You will die, and die a lot, but this time you will be paying with real money for it, where once restoring was free.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love the plot, actors and set set up for this this Movie...you will also like the books. :) Buy it!
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this album but I really enjoy it.  There is a nice balance of different styles that makes this a great listen.
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|I pre-ordered this album and downloaded it the day it was released. I decided to wait until now to write up a review because it wasn't easy. You see, I am a lifelong fan of Black Sabbath. The fan in me wants to make excuses, or give kudos because, well, they're Black Sabbath!!<br /><br />I listened to this album several times in my car, where I do some of my best listening. Frankly, it just wasn't fun, but I kept on listening because I AM a fan (although I probably disqualify myself from fandom in the eyes of many fans just by writing this review.) After several listens all the way through the album. I stopped.<br /><br />Then, I went back and listened to the old albums, and also the Reunion live album. The first thing that struck me was the subtlty of the drumming by Bill Ward. Now, this isn't a Bill Ward thing. There are a lot of drummers with a lot of finesse out there. Drummers, who like Ward, stretch the tempos here and there, who play like musicians and not like click track automatons.<br /><br />The thing is, Ward, Iommi and Butler were jazz influenced, blues musicians back in the day. Listen to their first album and you hear a lot of jazz influence. It swings even. Which brings me to the other way that \\"13\\" disappoints...<br /><br />The songwriting. The songwriting is just not as interesting as it used to be. It is as if Sabbath has forgotten all their earlier influences from progressive music. Now they write more like their younger fans who never even had that influence.<br /><br />The melodies in 13 are not that interesting, but I think that owes more to Osbourne's decreased vocal range. Not exactly the guys fault, although lifestyle sure can hurt or help these things. But, the melodies of the old records were all over the place, high and low, in good ways. One would want to hum these melodies as one walked along. On 13, on the other hand, they sound more like 5 note chants. Boring and unmusical.<br /><br />Please don't crucify me for this review! I'm juststating my opinion. If you love this album, more power to you. Crank and enjoy! This is just my opinion.<br /><br />I still love Sabbath. In fact, there is no way I would not buy this album, even if I already knew how it was. Something by Sabbath is still a lot better than nothing.<br /><br />But, I will not fool myself into believing that this is anywhere near the Sabbath album that would earn any more than two stars for me. And, if someone is not a fan, I would not recommend this album. In fact I would steer a new listener, non-fan to the immensely better albums, any of the first five, because I do love Sabbath and I would want the new listener to learn about Sabbath from those albums.
0451087542|3.0|Kids in America take the Long Walk in a 1979 sports novel (of a sort) by Richard Bachman. One hundred boys set out, and they will walk day and night, in rain or shine, until one by one they are (literally) eliminated from the competition for slowing down or stopping. Whoever endures the longest will be the winner - everyone else will be dead.<br /><br />The story focuses on 16-year-old Ray Garraty, who falls in with a small group of other Walkers - \\"The Musketeers\\", they call themselves. Their motives for signing up for the race are stunningly vague; most of them seem to be in it just because they have a death wish, implying that in the ultra-conservative future of the Long Walk youth suicides are made into a spectator sport (perhaps in order to improve statistics, to show how mentally healthy the society is under the new regime?).<br /><br />The novel follows its simple countdown structure doggedly throughout, not once deviating from it. There's very little backstory, and none of the outside world is fleshed out in any detail, except for the big brother style figure of \\"the Major\\" who runs the Walk, and the seething, bloodthirsty crowds, who are almost an entity unto themselves. But basically there's just the Walk, starting from the Canadian border and snaking its way down through Maine towards Boston, and the patter of 100 pairs of feet on the asphalt.<br /><br />It does get a bit tedious after a while. That may be the point; the competition is explicitly made out to have a psychological aspect as well, and it's hinted that some winners have gone insane. No wonder, watching 99 fellow walkers get blown away would presumably trigger a hell of a survivor's guilt (there's no doubt some symbolism with the Vietnam war at the root of the novel). The novel's severely limited approach is structurally great; as entertainment, however, it doesn't quite maintain its sparkle throughout, with the latter half visibly dragging (like some of the Walkers by that point).<br /><br />While the novel is the first one Stephen King ever wrote, it does contain some strikingly well-written passages. The landscape of Maine as the road twists and turns is brought vividly to life, and most of the Walkers are given personal characteristics, even those who only appear for a sentence or two. There are some odd details - some walkers apparently wear leather and jeans - making sports of the future seem decidedly retro.<br /><br />Read all my reviews at mikareadshorrorfiction.wordpress.com
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My wife and I got as caught up in this, as we did Downton Abbey.. Once we started this series it was hard to get in bed at a reasonable hour.  We wanted to see the next episode and the next..  We both love Masterpiece Theater and this is one of the very best series.  Also, Call the Midwife is very good.  All of these present a captivating image of what life was like \\"then and there.\\"

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I got lost in this book.  It gave me a real insight into the Foster Care system, which I had little knowledge of and also the language of flowers.  Before reading this book, I did not know that during Victorian times, flowers were given meanings and were used in bouquets to send a message.  My favorite part of this book is the characterization of the main characters.  I came to &#34;see&#34; Victoria, Elizabeth, Grant and the others.  Would make a great movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun. Not very challenging, but enough to keep my interest. Very short game at this point, but more levels are promised.
1591845556|5.0|I have followed Josh Kaufman since reading [[ASIN:1591845572 The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business]], one of the best books on business that I've ever read. I was really excited to pick this book up at first, but after glancing through the table of contents and flipping through the chapters, I was pretty sure it was not going to be my favorite book on learning. The problem, in my mind, was that the bulk of the book was simply anecdotal, and the meat of the book was thin - really only two chapters at the beginning. I also recently picked up two excellent books on learning, [[ASIN:0547884591 The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life]] and [[ASIN:0670024961 Mastery]], and did not see how this could compare.<br /><br />Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised after reading it. The 10 Principles of Rapid Skill Acquisition and the 10 Principles of Effective Learning may be short chapters and seem simple, but they contain valuable advice. They will help you sort through what you should be learning and how to pick it up quickly. I thought that this would be the most interesting part of the book, but it turns out the case studies included were much more rewarding.<br /><br />Yoga: Kaufman explains his method for learning yoga quickly. This is a good example of learning, but also a great example of teaching - I learned more about yoga then I ever cared to know and it was actually interesting.<br /><br />Programming: This is easily the most technical chapter and the hardest to understand, but also the most inspiring. Seeing something as daunting as learning a computer language from scratch broken down so quickly was pretty amazing. I added learning Ruby to my list.<br /><br />Touch-Typing: Interesting study about typing and switching to a more efficient keyboard. One tip from this chapter that is worth the price of the book: Practice skill acquisition and sleep within four hours. Sleep helps cement new skills (especially motor skills) into your long term memory.<br /><br />Go: Again, knew nothing about this, interesting to read about a history of a board game.<br /><br />Ukelele: Learning to play a ukelele in 10 days . . . pretty amazing case study. This has gone onto my list as well, though I'm not sold on a ukelele over a guitar.<br /><br />Windsurfing: Interesting chapter on learning a very physical skill.<br /><br />The case studies will help you craft and break down your own learning projects. They are great, and will be immensely helpful for me as I choose what and how to study.<br /><br />If you are really interested in learning skills quickly, I would highly recommend picking up [[ASIN:0547884591 The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life]] and using the DiSSS CaFE learning method in conjunction with this book. Using the techniques and seeing the examples from both books will help you start learning on your own very quickly. Honestly, it would be hard to invest your $40 on two better books . . . if you want to learn, start here. Highly Recommended.ecially motor skills) into your long term memory.<br /><br />Go: Again, knew nothing about this, interesting to read about a history of a board game.<br /><br />Ukelele: Learning to play a ukelele in 10 days . . . pretty amazing case study.

B004ELSDZK|5.0|Totemo is a simple but well polished game. The learning curve is gradual. The gist of the game is that there is a grid of orbs in each level, and you must click the orbs sequentially in a row or column in order to remove them. Depending on the level, you may have to click on 2, 3, or 4 orbs. Certain orbs can count towards 1 or 2 clicks as well, adding even more depth.<br /><br />The presentation of the app is great - there are rich backgrounds, subtle music, and fluid effects. At the beginning and end of every stage, a little Totem guy pops up to flesh out the story and provide funny commentary. While probably unneeded, I actually really enjoyed the caricature and was glad he added an \\"emotional\\" aspect to the game, rather than having the player just beating the puzzles because they are there.<br /><br />I was stumped for about two weeks on one puzzle towards the end of the game, so the difficulty level is definitely there for those who like a challenge. I highly recommend this game!

0142501123|5.0|Every young child will enjoy Julia Donaldson's story about a witch and the adventure she has when she decides to take a ride on her broom. It is written in rhyme which is fun to read and children love the sing song quality of rhyme. There is sequence and some predictability within the story as the witch meets various animals. Once the children understand the pattern they may be able to help with part of the story. There is also an episode with a \\"ferocious \\" dragon, but the animals rescue the witch. The witch uses her problem solving skills to make a new broom too.<br /><br />So lots of interesting parts of this adventure for you and your child to enjoy together.<br /><br />Axel Scheffler's illustrations are full of detail. The facial expressions on the witch, animals she meets, and even the dragon will bring smiles to your face.<br /><br />I believe this is a story your child will ask you to read often.<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I grew up in Silicon Valley after coming here from China as a teenager following my dad's career change. He was the old timer of Silicon Valley, worked for HP and later on collaborated with Cisco. I'm the new Silicon Valley, now working for Amazon, with friends at FB, google and apple. If I have to describe the book in one sentence, it would be \\"everything in the book is true\\". Most of the things Sheryl mentioned are things I figured out on my own after years of work experience as an engineer in a male dominated world. I do wish someone told me these things when I was younger. It's very brave of her to step out and talk about her own experience, maybe it's different from yours, but I don't think she meant as you should do what she does. She just shows you one way of having a successful career and the mind behind all that success, which is quite useful case study material for anyone, not just women.<br /><br />One thing I also found interesting is that she basically addressed all the criticisms she's been receiving about this book in this book. Yes, she already knows what the nay sayers were going to say. this also shows you how somethings just never change that I almost find it comical. After you read this book, you'll realize all her criticizers have obviously not read the book. I really encourage anybody to read the book. I have a son, but if I have a daughter, I would definitely have her read it. heck, I'll have my son read it, too. He's only one though, so he'll learn how to read first. =)

B00CW665VI|5.0|I was very skeptical about a book in first person this point of view...a guy's point of view to be specific.  But when all my Goodreads friends were raving about it within the first week of release, I knew that I had to get on that wagon!<br /><br />Drew is awesome.  The opening scenes with him describing his flu had me laughing out loud (see here that YouTube video of the \\"Man Cold\\").  Only Drew's sister could force him out of his funk.  Then we get the back story.  I loved seeing things from the man's point of view as he waltzes through life with his silver spoon, and yet stumbles at every turn with Katherine Brooks.  She simply befuddles him.  Everything about her calls to him, but every fiber of his being screams back, well except for his manhood that just screams for attention.<br /><br />He is used to winning at everything, but with Kate, he seriously has no clue.  But you really need to meet Drew so I'll give you a few quotes:<br /><br />\\"It makes me want to kiss her and strangle her at the same time. I've never been into S&M. But I'm beginning to see its benefits.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's simple guy logic: If a woman is angry? It means she cares. If you're in a relationship and a chick can't even be bothered to yell at you? You're screwed. Indifference is a woman's kiss of death. It's the equivalent of a man not interested in sex. In either case--it's over. You're done.\\"<br /><br />And my all-time fave from him...<br /><br />\\"I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS, but lots of guys have a thing for Ariel. You know, from The Little Mermaid? I've never been into her myself, but I can understand the attraction: she fills out her shells nicely, she's a redhead, and she spends most of the movie unable to speak.<br />In light of this, I'm not too disturbed about the semi I'm sporting while watching Beauty and the Beast--part of the homework Erin gave me. I like Belle. She's hot. Well...for a cartoon, anyway. She reminds me of Kate. She's resourceful. Smart. And she doesn't take anys*** from the Beast or that douchebag with the freakishly large arms. I stare at the television as Belle bends over to feed a bird. Then I lean forward, hoping for a nice cleavage shot... I'm going to hell, aren't I?\\"<br /><br />Now meet Kate:<br /><br />\\"There are three kids of males in this world: boys, guys, and men. Boys - like Billy - never grow up, never get serious. They only care about themselves, their music, their cars. Guys - like you - are all about numbers and variety. Like an assembly line, it's just one one-night stand after another. Then there are men - like Matthew. They're not perfect, but they appreciate women for more than their flexibility and mouth suction.\\"<br /><br />\\"She (Drew's niece) talks like you. It's not every day you hear a four-year-old say Prince Charming is a douchebag who's only holding Cinderella back.\\"<br /><br />\\"My office door slams open, leaving a dent in the drywall. Here we go. \\"You are driving me crazy!\\"<br />Her cheeks are flushed, her breathing's fast, and she's got murder in her eyes. Beautiful. I raise my brows hopefully. \\"Crazy? Like you want to rip my shirt open again?\\"<br />\\"No. Crazy like the itch of a yeast infection that just won't go away.\\" I flinch. Can't help it.\\"<br /><br />And the great lines go on and on and on.  These two banter smart.  They love hot and steamy.  Their friendship is mean, honest and deep.  But best of all, their happy ever after is so sweet and smexy that even Drew chokes back the saccharine and enjoys the ride!  Totally pick this one up for an awesome summer read!  Enjoy!<br /><br />Reviewed by [...]
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game and graphics. i was a bit sckeptical about this game at first, however upon downloading it i realized that it was great.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you're an avid YouTuber and stream music from Google or Pandora, you will love this device. For $35 you can't go wrong. I love watching my channel subscriptions on the big screen and no longer have to use the xbox YouTube app.<br /><br />This device is going to change how we watch TV, remember YouTube has been experimenting with paid channels.
B00DZSPKZY|5.0|I've tried every launcher available that will work on my Impulse4G and this one is the only one that doesn't bog down this phone. It requires very little memory and does a pretty good job of organizing the other apps. Now the downside, the free version would let me change themes with no problem, but the paid version crashes every time I try to change from the default drab theme. If that was fixed it would get five stars.<br /><br /> The author of this app is very quick to update when there are problems. I talked to him and was informed that an update was coming. I've just updated and all the problems were fixed...excellent service. If you have an older phone like I have then this is one launcher to have. It is small and fast.
0062014536|2.0|I LOVED the first books in this series. Loved them. I was so excited about the conclusion that I even put off buying it until I knew I had time to sit and read it completely. But, Requiem did not live up to its predecessors. I felt like there was a lot of rambling and wandering. The ending did not make any sense at all and left me hanging. Don't waste your money....whatever ending you want to make up for yourself for this series would be much better then this.
B005LAII4E|5.0|GI Joe: Retaliation was better than I thought it would. A few surprises I did not see coming, but Bruce Willis never let's me down. Still like the first one better.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|This makes some nice artwork to play with when bored.  Lots of different styles and colors to use.  Daughter loves it!
B008602KQI|5.0|With most of these books turned movies, the movies are a disappointing and nothing like the book, this movie did a fantastic job of capturing the essense of the book. Can't wait for the sequel!
1583762027|5.0|I dunno- to each his own, but I found this easy read to be life-changing.  I think it's because it is a short read that doesn't throw too much at you at once that made it easier for me to implement into my own life than some denser materials on the subject.  I'm starting to find out that it's better to conquer one habit at a time than to change several at once and this book really keys in on just a few things.  As someone who has suffered through some Terrible audio book readers, I was very pleased to find that Mr. Tracy's voice is engaging to the reader without 'pushing' it.  In other words he sounds like he's naturally interested in the subject and not putting on a whole 'enthusiasm' act and screaming the law of attraction in your ear and jumping up and down like a lot of other motivational speakers.  Sometimes I wonder if they really believed in all they said than why did they feel the need to put on such a show?  I like that Brian doesn't.  He just reads the material and you can just hear in his voice that he simply believes in what he is saying and wants to share it.
0394826817|5.0|I purchased this book about 38 years ago for my two girls.  It was a great book to read to them at night - directly addresses manners.  I have sense purchased it for a niece and now for great-nieces and great-nephews.  Worth every cent!
B007IK44CK|5.0|This was one of the best MI movies. I was drawn in right to the end.  Strongly suggest you take the ride.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Got as a Christmas gift, for an avid Rod Stewart lover,  it will definitely get you in the holiday spirit.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|As usual Rollins offers an exiting read and one that keeps you engaged and filled with anticipation.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the next one.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Even if you don't like cartoons, you will like this one. It is funny, cute, smarmy and has a great ending.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|Anything the Eagles put out was fantastic. From the very start of their careers to the end of their first tenure. Just about everyone of them could be considered lead vocals. They put out the music of my life. I recommend it strongly for anyone's collection!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This CD is fun and happy and good for a party, there are a few profane words, but it has an early 70s Prince flavor.
B0090SI582|5.0|In a year jam-packed with blockbusters and art-house thrillers, there are a great many movies that are purely amazing and awesome. Among them are three comic-to-film adaptations: 2 Marvel films and a DC Comic movie. One of these Marvel films is The Wolverine. Set after the events of X-Men The Last Stand, Wolverine/Logan is now away from everything and everyone, wandering the back-roads of the Yukon. But when a girl named Yukio finds Logan, she has him travel to Tokyo, Japan with her to meet with a man from Logan's past. But as Wolverine battles with losing his immortality, he also has to battle his inner demons, which threaten everything he knows.<br /><br />The Wolverine is easily one of the best Marvel films yet, having a good script, great directing, and superb acting from the even greater Hugh Jackman, who truly is Wolverine in this installment. What I found truly incredible, though, is how the action sequences didn't just help bring intensity to the movie, but were needed to help the story move along. Even better, the action sequences were not absolutely massive. Even the battle between Logan and the Silver Samurai (which was one of the most epic action scenes of all time), was not grand in size. James Mangold really knew what he was doing when he directed this, and if you have seen his film 3:10 to Yuma, you can get the feeling that he took some details from that and put them into this movie. The script, by Mark Bomback (the new Total Recall and Live Free or Die Hard) & Scott Frank, was not cheesy, over-the-top, or missing anything needed. The dialogue was great, very believable, and the characters were perfectly written; character development was all over the place! The musical score by Marco Beltrami is easily his best since 3:10 to Yuma, and the visual effects, while not award-winning (compared to other movies this year), are great, never out of place. The cinematography was stunning, with the shots of Nagasaki and Tokyo helping to place the audience and Wolverine in a totally different world.<br /><br />Overall, The Wolverine is the movie Wolverine fans have been wanting for a while now, especially after the mistake that was X-Men Origins. I just hope Jackman is as big in X-Men Days of Future Past as he was here, in both character and physique.<br /><br />4.5/5 Stars
0525478817|5.0|As it's a book with great character development, a great plot, and dealing with mental/bodily illnesses without romanticizing them, it has made it to my list of favorite books. This was the first John Green Book I had read(I've now also read Looking for Alaska, Paper Towns, and i will soon read An Abundance of Katherines), and I was not disappointed, especially since my book came signed when it was not supposed to!<br />If you are thinking about reading it, DO!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is awesome!!! The only bad thing is the price. Other than that it was totally worth buying. I highly recommended getting this game if you play GTA.
B00132D808|5.0|I love the sound of this album. It's very lightweight and quite nice. Panic at the disco did it again.
0618918248|5.0|Well written and researched, Dawkins has a compelling argument for his point of view expressed through the pages of this book.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Suspense throughout the book. Action packed. Enjoyed the story line with the many twist thrown in.<br /> Would recommend you read this book.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I loved the previous books.  Was this published in Norway 'in sequence?'  It didn't read like a sequel.  So, perhaps it had not been translated.  In any case, after getting to know the older Harry, it took some adjusting to reset the character.  That said, any Harry Hole followers will enjoy.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I had read an article on Jeremy Irons who I guess stars as an older Richard and decided to start from the beginning. Glad I did.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|As an avid Buddy Guy fan, I would have to rate this album at the top of his long list of recordings. There is not a bad song on it and along with the collaborations it is top notch.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone regardless of their listening preference.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Everyone I knew was reading this book. My mom, all my friends, 8 year old boys waiting at the bus stop in the morning. So fine, I took the plunge.<br /><br />Loved the writing. Took me a little to get into it. It was kinda wordy at 1st. Like talking with cotton in your mouth. Alright already- enough descriptions, I got it.<br />But either I got used to it or the \\"over-writing\\" calmed down a bit. And the book just took off. Like a jet plane. There's no stopping it's path and you don't want to put that book down. The characters consume your thoughts. Your every action. You're wondering what's going on. Was that clue just to throw you off? Could you really have it figured out so early??<br />Maybe.<br /><br />But your brain will go on an epic mind-eff till you read that last page.<br /><br />The ending is the only reason I didn't love this book. I needed a redeeming character. You want a real-life ending full of people that suck? Well, here you go. But not me. I wanted more. It's not even like I needed some happily-ever-after to tie up some cheesy bow on the end of this book. But I did want justice. <sigh> I know, I know... \\"go look for it somewhere else, lady.\\" Sure thing, I'm on it. Off to read something that leaves a smile on my face... not a fear of everyone around me being cray cray.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft,pocket edition, xbox, and computer but unlike in survival craft there are no animals that u can ride like horses or camels. otherwise I adore minecraft!!!!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I am asking if u can give us the killer whales spawned eggs. Can u also put in a multiplayer so we can have help to build things. Also please add elephants so I can finish my zoo instead of me having to put up a sign saying &quot; elephants can not be found yet&quot; or &quot;sorry no elephants yet. Oh and can we ride the elephants. Please right back.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This is challenging and you always want to try it one more time. You can choose more difficulty if you want to challenge yourself more.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Fast and easy information that you'll find in seconds so all around I give this four starts as this was worth the download and use.
140006922X|5.0|The contention between Jesus' brother James and Paul is revealing. The historical framework and application to mold Azlans idea of Jesus is compelling. Saw Azlan at an event in LA - great thinker of our era.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I loved this solitaire app as I found it assessable. I found this app made playing solitaire fun and it's worth my rave, five star review.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|this is a good app for beginners or veteran MTG players. The tutorial is easy to understand and the spell animations are a nice touch.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app isn't worth it and I found that it's hard to navigate and the information given is fuzzy to differentiate as compared to the iPhone's version.
B005K17RU0|5.0|One of the best free weather apps out there. I love the moving radar maps and the hour by hour predictions.
B008XG1X18|5.0|With this app I was able to see full pages - and in great detail - and pin fast. You won't miss a beat. I give this app a rave, five start review.
B00DULWFZE|5.0|All I can say is, wow. I absolutely love this album. I am thrilled that Kevin is back and has a lot of lead vocals on this album. My favorite song is Show 'Em What You're Made Of. This is a totally different sound from The Backstreet Boys and also their first independent album away from Jive Records. You guys are totally amazing. You never disappoint me. Here's to another 20. KTBSPA!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|You can keep tract, socialize - communicate - fast and swift and accessible to your not missing a beat. I give this a rave, five start review. Worth the download.
1451626096|2.0|Ms Gregory, if not completely historically correct, usually provides a good overview of the times in which her subjects lived, and believable characterizations. Unfortunately, as in &#34;The Queen's Fool&#34;, no character in this book really &#34;comes alive&#34;; because too often Ms G. TELLS a story rather than allowing the characters to speak for.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|With this app you can tweet, keep informed, send information - your thoughts - same as desktop version and even read full pages, too. I give this a far star, rave review.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Tho' &#34;Downton&#34; is essentially a thinking woman's soap opera the superb cast (as well as historical bits, sets, costumes, even music) make it addictive.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is definitely worth the five stars as this is a rave review. I was so thrilled to access this app. Fast, accurate, easy to understand, week's or more forecast, hourly, etc. What's not to love?
B000P0J0D8|1.0|It is porn.  Pure and simple.  I wanted a good clean family fun and after five minutes--we shut it down repackaged it and mailed it back to Amazon.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It wasn't bad but not quite what I have thought it would be, so I thought it was best to give this a average review.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|This is a definate favorite--but it has to be the James Stewart version.  Only he can really pull off Elwood P. Dowd.  In this version, all the actors are top rate and are quite believable as the characters they portray.<br /><br />This is such a sweet, yet hilarious movie, even though it was filmed several decades ago.  &#34;Comedies&#34; today only seem to be about slapstick and gross out jokes. But not only is Harvey full of laughs, but it does make some good, yet subtle social statements.<br /><br />I have this movie in video, but my old VCR died not too long ago and I found myself yearning to watch my favorite invisible, 6 foot rabbit again so I ordered it in DVD version.<br /><br />He almost makes me wish Pookas were real.  And who says they're not?
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game - app was as good as the iPhone/android app, assessable, fun, all around neat game. Definitely worth it and it receives five stars.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Exceptional album from top to bottom. Highly recommend to anyone looking to expand their catalog.  Only regret is that there is only one record to enjoy.
B000000Y2F|4.0|The audio on this latest remastering of a somewhat misleading title is better than ever.  But after the discovery and subsequent  release of a full concert by Monk's Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall in 1957, the rather miscellaneous collection of Monk-Coltrane encounters in \\"Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane\\" has suddenly become dispensable.  The present assortment includes three tunes from the group's relatively brief, productive stand at the \\"Five-Spot,\\" which served as a kind of musical \\"workshop\\" for the pair, the culmination of which was the striking and exciting, full and complete Carnegie Hall concert, recorded in glorious audio, with Monk's piano making a scintillating entrance on \\"Monk's Mood\\" (a surprising but effective choice as the opener on the program).<br /><br />Rather than this album (which can still be highly recommended to \\"completists\\"), most listeners interested in the Monk-Coltrane musical relationship would best be served by supplementing [[ASIN:B000AV2GCE Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall]] with the complete session on which Coleman Hawkins joins Coltrane with Monk: [[ASIN:B004JZJ8DC Monk's Music]].<br /><br />The only difference in personnel between the \\"Five Spot\\" tracks and the Carnegie Hall concert is the bass chair.  The highly-regarded Wilbur Ware can be heard on the present album whereas Ahmed Abdul-Malik is the bassist on the Carnegie Hall disc. To my ears both players are equally strong.  Ware lays down a heavy and unyielding, almost stubborn, pulse, building a foundation with minimal note choices (at one point, he plays the same note in the same register 8 consecutive times, or for two complete measures); Abdul-Malik seems, like Coltrane, more in tune with Monk's chords and harmonic movement.  But the differences are actually quite subtle, becoming apparent only after consciously and attentively concentrating on the playing of bass on the two recordings.<br /><br />Monk fans often have strong views about which of his 4th members was the best complement to the leader's musical conceptions.  Coltrane's \\"sheets of sound\\" and virtuoso, rhapsodic playing, especially in the upper regester, certainly makes for a fascinating contrast with the more earthy, alternately gritty and playful, conceptions of the iconoclastic leader, who nevertheless reflects the tradition of jazz piano extending back to Kansas City boogie woogie as well as New York stride pianists.  (There's little doubt that, despite the radically different styles of the two groups, it was a similar \\"beauty and the beast\\" contrast that contributed to the enduring success of the Brubeck-Desmond Quartet.)<br /><br />About Johnny Griffin (once billed as the \\"fastest tenor in jazz\\") there are stronger differences of opinion.  Some listeners are drawn to the interaction between Monk and this youthful tiger from Chicago; others find him little affected by the influence of Monk's idiosyncratic system--a player whose flurry of notes was self-sufficient, permitting Monk to desert the piano for a couple of choruses in order to \\"kick up his heels,\\" dancing around the piano as only he could do. (I witnessed him do so on two occasions; on the 3rd, at Chicago's Plugged Nickel, he threw a tantrum and walked out of the club during the early part of his first set.)<br /><br />Monk's meeting with Gerry Mulligan on Riverside [[ASIN:B00DU4GP2U Mulligan Meets Monk [Original Jazz Classics Remasters]] finds two masters in characteristic good form--the \\"High Priest of Modern Jazz\\" (Blakey's term for Monk) and the musician most responsible for moving the baritone saxophone into the jazz mainstream sharing their humorous, unfailingly swinging, ideas in a high-spirited session.  Also, Monk is heard to good advantage in late career with Sonny Stitt [[ASIN:B007X77EZ2 Giants of Jazz: Copenhagen 1971 (with Sonny Stitt, Kai Winding, Al Mckibbon & Art Blakey)]].<br /><br />But more often than not the player most often associated with Monk is the superb Charlie Rouse, an unsung hero who was at the same time a complete master of his instrument, capable of \\"mixing it up\\" with Monk like few other players, one moment wailing the blues and, the next, spinning out rapid-fire, cleanly articulated (but not overly \\"polished\\") lines which, when interwoven with Monk's frequently fibrous, gnarly conceptions, make for an endlessly fascinating and fully engaging kind of dialogue, or \\"game,\\" for the listener.  Whether playing separately or together, Monk and Rouse invite to their interaction a fifth player--you, the listener. However heated or intricate the exchanges of the two principals, the listener is never left out, neither suffocated nor overwhelmed by Monk's jagged harmonies or Rouses' prodigious streams of notes.<br /><br />Coltrane is an awesome featured guest, with Griffin not far behind; Charlie Rouse, on the other hand, conspires with Monk to offer listeners who are serious about partying the time of their life. [[ASIN:B00006GO99 Monk's Dream]]; [[ASIN:B000053VC9 Thelonious Monk - Straight No Chaser]]. As an introduction to Rouse's singular skills, even apart from Monk, I recommend downloading his performance on [[ASIN:B001ZMVF2O Weirdo]].onk is the superb Charlie Rouse, an unsung hero who was at the same time a complete master of his instrument, capable of \\"mixing it up\\" with Monk like few other players, one moment wailing the blues and, the next, spinning out rapid-fire, cleanly articulated (but not overly \\"polished\\") lines which, when interwoven with Monk's frequently fibrous, gnarly conceptions, make for an endlessly fascinating and fully engaging kind of dialogue, or \\"game,\\" for the listener.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I Had 2 islands and thank God I didn't buy more gems, because I just updated and now I have NOTHING!! A little help?
B009G41CG2|3.0|I like the various layouts available.  Since it's quite small for the number of tiles I sometimes have a hard time seeing what they are. I'd like an indication of how many moves I've made and how many are available at each move.  I play another version that has that option and it's very helpful.
B002RI91IU|4.0|The yarn about his father, uncle and grandmother make an excellent read. I suppose, though, that all writers fictionalise their lives to make good reading. And why not? Day to day lives are pretty dull so why not perk them up with an affair or two, a murder, and odd actors who aren't keen to change their clothes? And if you write well, as does Auster, it keeps you reading.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice layout and handy to have a hints available option. The only thing I don't like is that every time I want to play a new game I get an ad that I have to click skip and go back home to get back to the game. Frustrating.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love I!  Putting puzzles together is very relaxing!  Would love more free puzzles.  They give my brain a workout.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The saga continues and each day pulls you in deeper. I cannot wait until the next series. Can only get better.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Cool game I like to play games and the fact that I can play with friends makes it speedometer camping
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Both my son and I love it. I've had it on my phone for two weeks and is been played every day. We still play it over a year later.  It's easy enough for little kids without being too easy for the older kids.
B004SIP6N6|5.0|I bought this for my husband who loves this movie, and all of Kevin Smith type movies. He now owns it in blu ray. Happy husband!
B008B1BL4E|5.0|If only they put uniforms on diplomats and stuck them in muddy trenches in place of the millions of poor soldiers who paid the price for their stumbling, opinionated, self-serving attempts at international diplomacy.  One of the recurring themes brilliantly developed by Clark is the lack of cohesive policy within the foreign ministries of every major player, save for Serbia.  There, the eternal quest for a &#34;greater Serbia&#34; should have been put to the music of &#34;Impossible Dream.&#34;  Still true. I especially loved the depiction of the Kaiser who, like Hitler, moved armies that no longer existed around his war boards.  Did he actually ask for plans to invade Cuba, Puerto Rico and New York in 1903.  Read it and weep.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I use this DVD just about everyday and my body is starting to change shape! My arms are noticeably getting smaller. And I am getting stronger. I love this DVD.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|A touching story about an inspiring girl. I cried several times. I was very pleased and won't regret reading it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and was never once let down by his beautiful writing. His details were incredible and I'm sad to let the characters go!
B004ECJNT4|1.0|This was in German.  I do not speak German. In England and Australia they speak English. Was not what I expected at all.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Did not care for story line but had fun as a woman admiring the eye candy of course. Fun DVD for the eyes only.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Keeps me goin for hours hard game to set down. Could make a larger selection of items to buy with gold and maybe an option to buy forging items but great game
B007J4T2G8|4.0|First time I was as swept away as Ana and lost much of the underlying story in the passionate emotions evoked. I liked it then and like it even more now. It is much deeper than it may seem at first.
B009AMAJVO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Acting is very good and the plot line is good.  Starts out action packed but then fades somewhat.  Easy story to follow but the you can figure out the ending about half way through the movie.  Entertaining.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|good action comedy,good case was good choice of actor for characters.cant wait for the next avenger ,hope it is soon
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Great and unusual story, with hands down the finest performance by a lead actress this year.  Tatiana Maslany as (no spoilers here) Sarah, Cosima, Beth, Alison  will leave your jaw hanging.  Well worth a watch.
B002RKRTGO|5.0|I have loved Sherlock Holmes ever since I could read. He is amazing and never boring by any means necessary.
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|Audio quality is sub par. Voices are quiet special effects are extremely loud. Please match voice volume to special effects
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|it was a good movie, saw all the iron man movies and thought why not watch this.  good movie.<br />see it
B002GHHJU4|5.0|This is a great soundtrack! Every song on it is awesome! Not every soundtrack has a great list, but this one does!
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|This is precisely why I love Christina Aguilera's music: powerful vocals and amazing lyrics. I hope she continues to make more music as the years go by. This is highly recommended.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I ENJOY games like this where you get to find hidden objects.  This one is fun because it can be never-ending and you can help or compete against friends.  Also very cool that it has a story line.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Great game. Keeps me busy. Can't wait to finish more levels. Was happy when I reached level 20!! Neon flow is cool.I give it 4 stars.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Enjoyable law show depicting the  material &#34;haves&#34;, and &#34;have-nots&#34;.  However, don't you know the material  &#34;have-nots&#34; (Mike Ross) exemplify those we really stand on the side of...  Recommended!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|For me this is as good as Fifty Shades of Gray. Once I start reading, I keep going until I fall asleep.<br />I'm so glad that this was recommended for me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm surprised this book had lower ratings than the first two-- I loved it! Definitely worth the cost and I look forward to rereading this series again someday.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I had a really hard time getting into the movie because I felt like the actors chosen for the main characters had distracting (either fake or just overly drawn) accents.  They weren't as attractive as you would think either.  Also both looked way to old to be playing their ages.  But the story line was great, the drama was there and I learned to get over the initial draw backs.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have been a huge fan of this series since its beginning. But I must admit that I could tell, for a couple of books now, that the author was ready to put this series to bed. Was the ending as emotionally satisfying as I had hoped? No. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed being in Sookie's head one last time, and I will miss her.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|This movie was a bit of a dark comedy, but I really liked it and I can't wait until the sequel comes out!
B00280LYHS|4.0|That this is the last in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. But this has to be the best of the series! It is most definitely a nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat, page-turning thriller! A wonderful, and fitting, end of a fantastic series =0)
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I really thought this movie would be funnier.  But all of the funny parts are what you see on the previews and so it's not as funny during the movie.  Great story line though, touching, and light hearted.  Not a waste of time, but not something I'd probably watch again.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|good family fun movie! love any action packed movie with a happy ending. good characters with mild adult humor safe for kids
B005UG542S|5.0|I was watching the part one episode on regulare television and really wanted to see this 2nd part badly but of course they were not showing it and I immediately thought of Amazon. Sure enough; it was there and cheap. Bada Bing.. watched it on my PC streaming.. it was freaking awesome! I will definitely do this again! No buffering; granted that had to do with my connection speed but still.
B00957T6X6|4.0|I love the books (but don't get too attached to any of the characters...) and would recommend them to anyone. My only complaint with the kindle edition is that I wish there was an easier way to flip chapters, and flip to the end and back to verify the cast of characters (there are a ton. Even after considering the casualty rate...)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Hello<br />I ordered this on 24th and received it on 30th. Setup was simple no major issues, I was looking for MAC address on the product but it is not listed there. Following are the steps I took for setups.<br />* Install Chrome Cast app on my smartphone.<br />* Plug in included power supply on chrome cast and plug device into HDMI port.<br />* Switch input on TV<br />* Open Chrome Cast app on phone, press setup.<br />* Named device (not requirement)<br />* Added Chromecast to my network, this is where I found MAC address it was listed at the end.<br />* Chromacast connected to my network, setup complete.<br />After using the product for about an hour, my opinion is that this is great product. But currently it is in early stage so there are not many services available for native support<br />Netflix and YouTube works perfectly no problems at all. When casting through PC via chrome browser works well also, but with little lag. As long as casting is done using supported services using PC, or mobile device it works very well.<br />Currently when casting using chrome browser, you see the tab that you are casting but for me that is useless because if I am watching streaming video on any site except youtube, you see the tab and video in small screen but as soon as you make the video full screen casting video is not visible only audio.<br />I also tried casting desktop (experimental) and you will be able to see video full screen, but these option is basically mirroring and audio will come through PC speakers, instead of TV.<br /><br />Bottom line as long as this device is used for currently supported services(Netflix, youtube) it works perfectly well. For me this was more of impulse purchase specially due to cost. If you have Smart TV, Apple TV, PS3, Xbox or any other web enabled media player there is no need to purchase this, since all these device already have Netflix and YouTube built in.<br />It might be useful in future as soon more service are natively supported.<br />Sorry for any grammar error.<br /><br />Thank you
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was a unique way of telling a story, through interviews of characters that supposedly lived during the Zombie war.  I enjoyed it very much.
B008NAFU9A|3.0|**I was given a copy of this book from the Author in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.**<br /><br />I really loved The Forever Girl (book #1 in the series). In the first book, during a battle with the Queen of the Maltorim, Sophia is helped by one of the Queens guards. This guard, Ophelia, comes essentially out of no where and we don't get much of her back story.<br /><br />Her Sweetest Downfall is Ophelia's story. How she was turned into a Cruor and why she is now helping Sophia are all explained.<br /><br />There are no spoilers for the first book in this novella, so it could be read before or after reading The Forever Girl. Or really skipped all together. It is a backwards look at Ophelia's life and gives you more insight into her character. But unless she is to make more appearances in the rest of the series, it's really just character building of an otherwise secondary character.<br /><br />Although I really loved The Forever Girl, Her Sweetest Downfall irked me at times. Ophelia is working as a maid circa 1808 and is told by her Lady to deliver a letter right before downfall. She is captured by a man, Ethan, and taken through the in between to his cabin in Damascus. She hates this man, loathes him, and is trying to plot her escape from him with every fiber of her being. After deciding that she cannot run from him without knowing where she is and how to get away, she decides to go to sleep and determine a way to escape during the day when he is helpless to follow her. However, when she awakens...she's suddenly in Love with him...<br /><br />Huh?!<br /><br />Once I was able to get over this sudden love interest and let the story grow, I was able to enjoy the story behind the mysterious Ophelia and how she was meant to play a part in Sophia's life. We also get more back story on the Queen Castilla as Ophelia's fate leads her to join the Maltorim as a maid to the Queen.<br /><br />But this storyis more about the love interest between Ophelia and Ethan and how it shaped Ophelia's place in the Maltorim. It was a nice short read, but the instant love attraction left me a little confused. If you have read The Forever Girl and are looking for a more developed character from Ophelia, this is the book for you. Otherwise, it could be skipped without losing any of the greatness from the first book.<br /><br />Check out all of our reviews at [...]
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I could really relate to every part of this book. It seems to hit every chord in my social life ...
B00729GQ0A|5.0|**I was given a copy of this book from the Author in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.**<br /><br />Loved. Loved. Loved This Book!<br /><br />This is not your typical paranormal teen romance book. Does it have an angst-ridden romance? Yes. Teenage girl trying to find her place in the world? Yes. Vampires? Well, sort of. Ok, it's sounding like a typical paranormal teen romance book, but I promise you - this one is different. Better. Just check out this opening line -<br /><br />\\"My mom died during an exorcism on my eighteenth birthday. On that same day, an ever-present static moved into my head like a squatter I couldn't evict.\\"<br /><br />Sophia hears a constant chattering in her head, all of the time. It plagues her existence. However despite the fact that she has this infliction, which she has never told anyone about, she otherwise portray's a normal eighteen-year-old. Even without knowing about the infliction, the people of her little po-dunk town are fearful of her. Everywhere she goes, death seems to follow. The town's people blame her for the deaths and the fact that she is a practicing Wicca, makes them coin her a \\"witch\\". It is so bad, even the local authorities seek her out whenever something goes wrong in town.<br /><br />There's a symbol spray-painted on a barn: Sophia did it<br />Someone's child gets a deathly illness: Sophia did it<br />Someone died tragically: Sophia did it<br /><br />Sophia doesn't let it bother her. It's almost as if she feels sorry for the town people's stupidity. They need something to explain the unexplainable and Sophia becomes an easy scapegoat. Sure, it bugged her, but she didn't let it show.<br /><br />Although this book is coined a paranormal fantasy, I think it borders on paranormal horror/thriller. Shortly after performing a simple cleansing ritual - another attempt at ridding herself of the static - strange things begin to happen. Sophia sees cloaked figures walking slowly down her street, or standing across the street simply staring at her house. This ghostly/paranormal activity escalates throughout the book with increasing severity.<br /><br />It is rather difficult to catch a reader off guard, unlike movies where you can quickly cut to a particularly scary clip and make the viewer jump, books require the reader to get through an entire sentence or paragraph to fully \\"see\\" the scary clip. I cannot remember a book ever making me jump, but this one did.<br /><br />I found myself reading so quickly that the scenes where being laid out in my mind better than if I were watching a movie. The story moved from one scene to the next without any unnecessary pauses or what I like to refer to as \\"filler\\" text.<br /><br />Ok, I said there were vampires in this book - sort of. This book takes a divine organic approach to vampires and all things magical. It sounds a lot like the creationist theory of existence actually. However, instead of God creating man, the Universe did. And it was going well, until man became corrupt with greed which led to violence and hate. In order to clean up their mess, the universe took the bodies of \\"pure\\" individuals after they died and made them into Cruor, Earth Elementals, meant to protect the human race and eradicate the bad.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Cruor cherished their immortality and looked only for ways to prolong their new lives. They learned that by feasting on the blood of their prey they could steal it's life force and maintain their own immortality. From this mankind formulate the stories of Vampires. To combat this new threat to mankind, the Universe created several other Elementals:<br /><br />Ankou - Air elementals who function like grim reapers.<br /><br />Chibold - Fire elementals who appear as small children. \\"Fire-starters\\". Believed to be extinct.<br /><br />Strigoi - Water elementals who can shape-shift into animal forms. They also possess the ability to read auras, designed to hunt out the corrupt Cruor.<br /><br />Witches - Spirit elementals, they were humans chosen by the Universe to receive great powers.<br /><br />I really like the twist on traditional vampire legends, taking it back to something that is more organic and less super-natural.<br /><br />There is an angst-ridden relationship in here. I know, I know! Some people get really upset by these otherwise pointless relationships between the human and the paranormal character. But I have a guilty secret - I freakin' love it! Hey - don't judge!<br /><br />Boiled down into it's most basic form, these relationships are just a story of forbidden love. Romeo and Juliet were in the same situation and everyone loves that story. So instead of Romeo being of the House of Montague, let's say he's of the House of Dracula. Just as taboo, just as off-limits.<br /><br />Sophia meets Charles, a Strigoi who is sworn to protect mankind from the corrupt Cruor.  He is reluctant to allow his feelings for Sophia because he knows only too well the fate of deal-breeds, those who cross the special lines to form relationships. Sophia is not all too keen on a relationship with this stranger either, she knows he is different but unable to get any information as to what makes him so. Of course, as she begins to learn about his world and her place in it, their relationship begins to grow.<br /><br />\\"I want to be with you. To not resist the urges you create,\\" he murmured against my neck, \\"but more than anything, I am compelled to protect you. Compelled beyond reason, perhaps, but I know I must.\\"<br /><br />Thrilling battle scenes, a MC that finds true powers through the knowledge of her heritage, a angst-ridden, a forbidden love story, creepy ghostly activity and divine organic paranormal legends. This book was so jam-packed with different pieces of the paranormal genre that if you like anything about the genre, I challenge you to read this book and not find something you like. but hey, maybe you'll be like me and LOVE EVERYTHING.<br /><br />If you like the forbidden love stories like i do, I strongly suggest picking up this book and giving it a go. You will not regret it.<br /><br />See all of our reviews at [...]
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|Becoming a little too melodramatic for my liking. I enjoyed the first and second season but the third leaves you in a lurch.
1781162646|3.0|This story is not the typical King. Overall the story is good and well written but there is very little creepiness or gore.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is the probably the worse streaming device on the market.  Really!  I don't understand all those high ratings.<br /><br />My experience is as follows:<br /><br />1.  Receive package with product - Nice looking.<br />2.  Take product out and try to plug into back of T.V. - NOPE Will not fit in the space for the HDMI.  So I have to use the included HDMI cable and bend it to make it fit.<br />3.  Realize T.V. has no USB port so I have to plug into power.<br />4.  Now go to Set up:  CANNOT do set up with iPad; Go to computer - Have to download Chrome with Extension, then go to set up.  Okay.. So far not that big of deal (at this point I'm already 15 to 20 minutes into the setup - Not the 5 minutes advertised.<br />5.  Set up complete.  First application I try:  Netflix directly from my Mac Mini running OS X 10.7.  I get a spinning Chrome Logo on the T.V Screen for a very LONG TIME - 15 minutes at least before I give up.<br />6.  Exit the NetFlix streaming, but to my Surprise - the Spinning Chrome logo continues on my T.V. Screen - and I cannot stop it!<br />7.  I unplug the Chromecast device to exit the Spinning Chrome Logo.  This does it.  But, to my surprise, I have to go back and do the SET UP All over again!<br />8.  Next I try streaming Netflix again, now using my iPad.  Again, get spinning Logo on T.V. screen and repeat steps 6 and 7 again!<br />9.  At this point, I'm already 1 HOUR into getting this to work.<br />10.  I try a different site, and use the Chrome Browser to CAST a video - it works!<br />11.  I try You-Tube, -- It works!<br />12.  But, CANNOT get Netflix to work with it's &#34;built in support&#34;.<br />13.  Finally, I call Google Tech Support.  They answer phone fairly quickly and try to be helpful, but they CANNOT figure out a solution to get NetFlix to stream to the Chromecast.  I am on the phone with them for about 1 Hour!  They tech cannot offer any suggestions that work;  He just has me go down a bunch of restarting, resetting, router settings, etc. that are complete waste of time.<br />14.  3 HOURS later from the time I received the Device, I still don't have NETFLIX working!  Give up and go to bed.<br />15.  Next Morning, I decide to try streaming from Netflix Using the Chrome Browser TAB (instead of the built in Netflixt ChromeCast within the movie); This does it! -- Well Kinda -- Since it only streams the Video - BUT NO AUDIO.  NO SOUND.<br />16.  I call GOOGLE Again, to figure out why I am not getting AUDIO on Netflix, Yet I do get Audio on You-Tube and other sites.  Again, Google Support cannot find a reason or solution, and nice lady has me spend at least another hour with resetting, rebooting, etc.<br />17.  So Total amount of Wasted Time now is about 5.5 to 6 hours to no avail for Netflix streaming with sound.<br />18.  I finally figured out a work around to get Netflix to stream with Audio.  I use a wireless speaker (Creative Labs D200 - very nice speaker) and set my Mac to output the Audio via BlueTooth to the D200 speaker placed near my T.V. Screen.  But now, I cannot use my full stereo speakers connected to my Big Screen (at least for Netflix streaming using Chromecast).<br />19.  In the end, I've figured out (which I wish Google would have told me), that you cannot properly Stream Netflix on a Mac using the Chrome Browser Tabs as the audio is not supported for QuickTime for SilverLight.  And Casting directly from within the movie does not work (probably because of a bandwidth issue as it tries to send it in full resolution).<br /><br />My Old TIVO worked MUCH better and no hassle (it just finally died after many years of use).  I was hoping this would be just as easy.  Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />Google Chromecast  is advertised as being Easy and plug and play.  Not the case at all!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Two Towers the saga in the books that I find reads more like Homer's Odyssey. It was done in a way that captivated the audience and keeps the flow of the saga going. It is a must have for all movie lovers every where. The cinematography is captivating and the story telling superbly done. I recommend anyone who has seen the basic version to purchase and watch the collector's edition.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|I sat down expecting a kick-ass action movie and that is exactly what I got!<br />Tons of WOW moments, so many wicked cool action scenes, lots of things getting blown to bits, groovy rides and graphic deaths.<br />I LOVE this Die Hard movie!<br />It fits perfect to this series. It's not as good as the first, but really they never are, still it's amazing in its' own right.<br />The hubby agrees. He says he loved that it was steady action.<br />Works for me. I bet it's work for you too!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The best thing about this Mono boxed set is the packaging; unlike the stereo remasters, the discs in this limited edition are housed in precise miniature replicas of the original Parlophone/Apple album covers-- right down to the way these covers are constructed.<br /><br />Even tiny versions of the inner sleeves are replicated as exactly as possible and, of course, all the original extra goodies are also present in miniature-- the SGT. PEPPER cutout sheet, the four WHITE ALBUM color glossies and collage poster, etc. The detailing is extraordinary and each disc even comes in its own resealable clear mylar sleeve.<br /><br />As for the music, well it's The Beatles as they intended you to hear them-- not the after-thought stereo remixes by studio engineers. This set is a nifty addition to a serious fan's collection, but not essential, as most people will prefer to get and enjoy the Stereo Remasters.<br /><br />Be careful where you buy EITHER the Mono or Stereo sets, however-- both have been extensively counterfeited and sold at \\"bargain\\" prices for which you receive inferior product-- in both sets, shabby construction and inaccurate detailing are dead giveaways that you've been hoodwinked. Be especially cautious of the sets offered for sale on eBay-- check out the forums on that site and the videos on YouTube that show you how to identify these fakes, ask lots of questions before you buy and if you don't like the answers, look elsewhere.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I love this game it took me a minute to get use to the manner of playing. But I got use to it. I couldn't put my kindle down. I enjoyed the story line, it kept my interest and I am only half way through the game.it is in my opinion worth the money
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|It won't work on my kindle it looks great but until that glitch is fixed I am not playing another gameloft game
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|i was hoping for something different and better. Both of us thought the movie was pointless and annoying. We ran out of time to finish and we didn't care. The characters were empty and neither one of us cared much for the their fate. I know both the lead actors like to act in odd \\"thinker\\" movies but this one left us both wondering.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|The minions are awesome!  My son is getting speech therapy to communicate better - but he's learning all the minion phrases!  I guess its about motivation...
B0090X4GJE|5.0|Overall good cd. I have not purchased any cds in the past 10years or so. But this one I wanted to check it out and buy it. It  was worth it.
B00296A4F4|4.0|However, the story lines are contrived and a bit too theatrical even for supposed high school students. The writers do not shy away from anything and seem to take a mixture of stances on the many issues they tackle.  Which is exactly what one would expect in a real high school - you know one where perfectly choreographed dancing and multi-part singing backed by a full band does not break forth at any given moment. You have to love musicals for that bit of silliness alone.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|Dark, depressing, confusing and long however well written it may be.  I would not recommend it even though it's on all the must-read lists.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Cannot stop playing.  Great fun and some really nice funny people.  I am totally hooked.  Many levels that keep you interested.  Challenging but not too hard.  You will love it if you like bingo or slots.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched all three seasons and cannot wait for the next one to start.  The ability to watch on the Amazon app was perfect.
B002S43V3Y|5.0|I haven't seen this in over 20 years, so it was a nice way to spend the evening. Music by Cat Stevens was just so so.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Silver Lingings Playbook is an odd little movie. It's about mental illness. Most movies about mental illness are rarely true to life. They are usually the Hollywood version. This movie is not entirely the Hollywood version. Although I did not like it that much, and it did have some Hollywood stretching in the story, it is the closest thing I have ever seen to a real life portrayl of people with mental issues. Don't get me wrong, although it is close, it is still a far stretch from real mentally ill people.<br /><br />The storyline is not that great. In fact, I found it pretty bad. The Hollywood stretching, regarding the dance stuff, is simply unbelievable. It is the background acting, the simple everyday stuff, that make this movie so bizarrely interesting. Most all the actors in this movie do a great job. The family dynamics remind me of so many families I have encountered.<br /><br />This movie would have been a lot better if the writers had left out the implausible parts. They were just too much of a stretch and really detracted from the movie.<br /><br />While watching this movie, I was reminded of the TV show Roseanne. Roseanne, although it had some far fetched storylines, was one of the closest TV shows to ever portray real life families.<br /><br />4 stars for great acting. 1 star detracted for the storyline.
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT IS AWESOME I LOVE IT SO MUCH I WOULD RECOMEND IT FOR ANY ONE<br />Buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This tale is continuing as I write this...the many trials of war, occupation and the blessed volunteers that tried to assist the (barely) living. Emotional experience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is nice and simple but fun at the same time. Runs great. I have the kindle fire HD
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Wish this show was still on loved it. Its better the second time around. My son got his first time to view the show.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is for kids only<br />It is easy to use but it can get a bit annoying because if you want to buy anything you have to have a lot of gems
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Simple in concept and design, but watch out, the challenging puzzles will suck you right in.<br /><br />I also like that there is no other goal besides solving the puzzle.  I didn't think that I would like this when I read it in reviews before downloading but it works for this game.
B009IEXKXI|1.0|There was way too much geek explanation of how and why. It bored me beyond belief. I flipped through to to 10%  that held my interest:  the events on Earth and Hermes. If you thrive on nerd explanations this book is for you. If not don't bother.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Plus: Tom Cruise did a credible job in the role of a former military law enforcement officer. The movie is well-paced with a tight story line, a constantly moving plot and enough action to keep the viewer engaged.<br /><br />Minus: If you have not read the book series this movie is based on, you're left a little bit out in the cold on Reacher's back story. The script should have fleshed out this aspect sometime in the movie. The all-too-brief description just does not do the character justice.<br /><br />NOTE: OK, many reviewers seem to miss the point of a movie review. Its about the movie, not comparisons to the book. If the latter was the case, most would not like the movie version for The Hunt for Red October, which does not do the book of the same name justice. Having read Clancey's book several times prior to watching Red October, I was very disappointed with the movie's plot line as compared to the book's. Did that make the movie bad? No, just different.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|just the best camera app I've ever used with my new kindle fire. easy to use with all buttons right there in front of you
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I have not yet used google on my kindle yet. I have used  in on my desktop.  I like it .
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever. Rick riordan is the best author. No one writes quite like him.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|I grew up with The Beatles and this movie was their best! I hadn't seen it in years until I bought this on Blu-ray. Fantastic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Season 3 just as much as the previous seasons.  There is lots of drama to go along with the great scenery and wit from Violet.  I can't wait for Season 4.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|We recently watched this for Movie night at our book club after reading the book. It was quite as good as I remembered from years ago when I first saw it. Great girls night movie!
B000KN9G48|5.0|In my youth I overlooked DM's earlier works because I didn't understand where they were coming from and really I thought they were just plain terrible songs. Now I'm grown with a mature taste in music.  Of course I knew of Everything Counts, but the rest of the tracks were unknown to me until recently.  I absolutely love this album and I'm so obsessed with it at the moment.  If you have any doubts, I recommend searching the net for the half hour documentary on the making of the album.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read this book because of all the critical acclaim attached to it.  Now I have it on my list of &#34; must reads&#34;.  Usually I find that although a book achieves a certain status among the literary world, I simply don't enjoy reading it.  The Book Thief is different.  It takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning as the story is told from the Grim Reaper's perspective, but after you get past that, the story will gobble you up whole.  Wonderful characterizations.....this book will make an impact on everyone who reads it.
140006922X|5.0|The book is awesome! I think this is a great point of view on the historical person Jesus Christ.  If I remember; I believe the same negative tones were said about the, \\" Jefferson Bible.\\"  It is now considered a classic.  The book present an amazing view of the life, times, culture that Jesus had to endure during his life. The author has done what few have not done. Churches, History and even too many scholars have put too many Coats on this man.  Professor Aslan has taken off all the ridiculous coats and has bared the True Jesus to us....Amazing Book!<br /><br />Don't listen to anyone. Read the book yourself. Many who have given negative comments to this book have not read it.  Commentators from FoxNews, have not read nor do they know what they are talking about.  Read the book yourself and discover an amazing man that lived in an amazing and turbulent time and Changed the World!
B0058SNI94|4.0|I was so hesitant to buy &#34;real&#34; looking Croc shoes. That is until my sister talked me into a slip on sandal. I was sold. So I tried these slip on &#34;Jayna&#34; Crocs. They fit perfect, I have not experienced any of the noises some reviewers have mentioned. I love, love, love the comfort of these shoes.I never thought I would love rubber style shoes, but the comfort is unbelievable. So now I have two pairs, and I will continue to buy these comfortable shoes. These shoes look good on the foot also. I have nothing but good to say about them!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I chose this rating because I do not think Vince Flynn could write a bad book. Fast paced, well written, grabbed my attention and kept it all the way through the book. I like the way he paces the story, love Mitch Rapp, and wish the good ol USA could handle threats the Mitch Rapp  way!! Missing Vince Flynn already!
B009RH973I|3.0|I could not see enough detail when I ordered the case. I was hoping for a hard cover like the backing.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|The Bloomberg app has everything you need to keep your finger on the pulse of the markets. It's also got some great options for news. Overall, I'm very happy with this app.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|I can't believe it took me 5 years to watch this movie for the first time..it was riveting entertainment.<br />Robert Downey, Jr. is an incredible actor and never disappoints.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The book starts with 2 venues and I did not get the connection until quite a ways into the story. The Irish setting was a bit hard to get used to, but it became like a cadence after a while. There were some funny parts such as the toupee, which I told my 10 year old grandson about and he laughed and laughed. The sad parts made me want to skip them, but I didn't. It all came together for a very enjoyable read.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is a good version of temple run mixed with a 3rd person shooter. it has a good way to tell what happens after Iron Man 3 the movie it has characters from the comic such as Crimson Dynamo and it also has fun objectives and has fast gameplay and its very fun over all
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|My all time favorite mystery detective movie and it came it the complete series ive already watched over half of them
B009O07NMA|5.0|I hardly ever like every song on an album but on this one, I not only like every song, I LOVE every song. The entire album is amazing. The boys are so talented! I can't wait until the next album! This is my favorite album, along with Luke Bryan's Spring Break: Here to Party album.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|This and Florida Georgia Line's album are my two favorite albums and I never have favorites on stuff like this (there's always too many good ones). I bought this not knowing a single song but I love Luke Bryan so I figured I'd like a few, at least. I love every song though. It was so catchy. I love that he wrote every song. Obviously he's incredibly talented, but this just proved how much more talented he is.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Quick, smart writing. Gorgeous men. Fun tv, and worth the wasted time.  Great use of exterior New York shots...makes you feel like you're there.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like the new app it's pretty fun to earn coins and the display is better. I like it no issues with kindle fire battery
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very flexible, lots of information, easy to use.  Also has proved to be very accurate.  I use it on a daily basis.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|Updated review:<br />This game stopped working on the Fire HD last week, and I have to say, the developers were great. They responded to my comment below via email, letting me know the problems in the games were fixed.<br /><br />And they are! The game works great. I love that even though the puzzles are increasingly complex as you advance through the levels, there are no time limits. It's nice to concentrate on the puzzles instead of rushing through each level. The graphics are great, and the bunnies are sweet. Good job!<br /><br />______________________________________________________<br />Prior review:<br />What the heck happened? The game was working great, I was very happy with it and was prepared to give it 5 stars when it stopped working.  It crashes every single time a new game started.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My husband and I are both enjoying this show.  We are coming into The Good Wife many seasons behind, but we are glad we found it, and we have many shows ahead of us to keep us entertained.
B003DO13O2|4.0|\\"Hergest Ridge\\" is my favorite Mike Oldfield album. I bought this deluxe edition to replace my scratched-up CD I have owned for many years. That older, non-deluxe CD of Hergest Ridge was printed with the 1976 mix, which was created for the Quadrophonic craze of the time, and appeared on the \\"Boxed\\" collection. Mike Oldfield said he wanted the 1976 mix to be used for all subsequent releases.<br /><br />On this Deluxe Edition set of CD's, you get the original 1974 mix, as well as the 2010 re-mastered version. I recall people complaining for years that they wanted the same version that they remembered from their first vinyl editions of \\"Hergest Ridge\\" back in 1974. Well, they finally got what they wanted here. But if you're looking for the much more polished mix that was created in 1976, which had appeared on every cd printing up until now, it's not there. What you get instead is the very odd 2010 mix, a re-imagining that no one was particularly dying for in the first place. This new mix is admittedly brighter and cleaner, but lacks the sophisticated blending of parts that made either the '74 or '76 mixes so magical. It's jarring, and in many parts completely unbalanced. One sin that haunts the entire series of remixes that Oldfield created in 2010 is some very ugly compression, and it's evident here as well.<br /><br />Musically, Hergest Ridge is a masterpiece. Whereas \\"Tubular Bells\\" was almost hyperactive in its transitions from one theme to another, Hergest Ridge is more focused and patient. Melodies are allowed to develop naturally, with different instruments weaving in and out, gradually building on one another. The central musical ideas are more sparse--Oldfield felt he was at a creative low point following the exhaustion of creating \\"Tubular Bells\\" But this limited amount of musical motifs actually makes the album much more thematically unified.<br /><br />It boils down to preference. If you like the original, hard-to-find 1974 version of Hergest Ridge, this album is the godsend you've been praying for. For those like me who prefer the more polished re-mastering from 1976, this is still an excellent album, just to see what changes happened between the two, and to finally get your hands on the original version. And despite its numerous shortcomings, the 2010 mix is still worth a listen. Like the best Oldfield compositions, there are many many layers to discover, and the 2010 version unearths and highlights some aspects and instruments you might not have noticed before. This album also features Oldfield's rough demo recordings of both tracks of \\"Hergest Ridge\\", which is also worth a listen, if only as a curiosity.<br /><br />This album is excellent, but it seems we'll have to wait for the next go-round of re-releases of Mike Oldfield's catalogue to get that ultimate edition of \\"Hergest Ridge\\".bum is the godsend you've been praying for.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|fast paced and really intelligent humor, we really just love, love this show - can't wait for the next season!
1416955070|5.0|This Review is done by my 12 yr. old daughter for our blog.<br /><br />On word: Amazing!!! Great beginning, middle and end. It starts off with a normal 16 year old girl named Clary Fray and her best friend, Simon Lewis, going to a club called Pandemonium. While in Pandemonium, Clary witnesses a murder but no ordinary murder. Clary thought the person who was murdered was human, but turns out he wasn't, neither were the people who murdered him (or it). The murders had strange markings on them and that's not even the weird part. Clary was the only one who could see them. After that night her life would never be the same again. It's a great balance of action and romance. A great book for teens. (Warning: Has some homosexuality in it.) It's an overall well rounded book. Thank you Miss Cassandra Clare for writing an excellent book!
B000MVN8GK|5.0|I love this series it keeps you guessing, it's one of my favorite shows to watch investigation, murder, mystery in the life of a teenager/ young adult.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was a hilarious journey through the life of an exceptionally talented and successful woman. All  knowing yourself and loving what you do and who you are.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|This book really made sense to me.  I need now to get the cook book so I have a little more variety to choose from.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This book is AMAZING!!! You will love it if you read it. I love the twists, this is a great book
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Loved the old version but the new verzion keepsfreezing on my Kindle and won't load. Sick and tired of it. The few times I could load the new version I wasn't crazy for it anyway. Made it more complicated to figure outthe weather. Shouldn't  have changed it!
B0036R92V2|5.0|This is the old version not the new one. When I ordered thought I had ordered the new one but this version was okay! The seller had great communication and delivery was timely.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It started slow but it was enough to keep me interested. I love the story and the characters were great.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I absolutely love the show and decided to read the books. I am impressed with the writing and the depth of the story. Each chapter intrigues me in a new way and I'm finding it difficult to put it down.
B00CFAHSEO|2.0|I have listened and enjoyed Vitamin String Quartet etc but this Piano Guys doesn't do much for me.  Maybe their last CD was better but I am going to pass on all of it for now.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|Zoom isn't perfect but it works well enough for a smaller space than the Kinect itself would like to use. It still has light sensitivity issues and doesn't seem to like when people wear glasses to play but it's good enough
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Very slow, froze up my device three times before I junked it. Looked as if it would be fun .
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Perseverance, struggle, religion, nature and love combine in a story that pulls you deeper and deeper in the more you read.  With amazing detail you are drawn in to a story that could only be true, yet the subject matter screams out fantasy.  Whether you read the story as an easy read adventure story or an allegory that tells of man's relationship with both God and nature, you can't help but enjoy this book.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Bought this video for my 6 yr old twin grandsons. I was hoping they would love it as much as I do. They did!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Not as good as the book of course, but a great show.  This was on sale at a great price so I couldn't pass it up.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very pleased with speedy shipment!  I haven't checked the discs yet but it is great to get all three - bluray, dvd and digital copy!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It was another fast moving, keep you on your toes and guessing book.  I found it difficult to put down!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|absolutely love this app!!! the best ive played yet. just love it!!!!!! I would recommend this game to all my friends!!!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Awesome item.  When I guessed something, it always got it right.<br />And never failed.  So I kept it.  So cool.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Thank u, I just got in mail today, now I catch up on dexter, now all I need to do is get season six
B009GXHOW4|1.0|Didn't work.  Didn't understand any of it.<br />Thought it would be cool to get, but I was wrong.<br />Forget about it.
1909313033|5.0|As someone that is employed by 3 pugs this book helped me understand its not just me, all pugs treat their caregivers like that ;)  Great read - funny stuff.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great storyline, great cast, great acting, great great.......no dull moments. The court cases are so interesting!!!! Cary is a character I love and hate, kalinda is cool and Diane is awesome.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|Couldn't understand which part was the dash deluxe? It is more like basic cooking 101. If you don't know anything about cooking this might be for you.
B0097K21YW|3.0|It's kind of a fun game and works as a time killer, which is what I usually play games on my phone for.  But after playing through about the first 5 maps I just never felt like I was accomplishing much and while it's kinda fun, it just didnt keep me interested enough to keep it on my phone.
B005H9B44A|5.0|This is a very awesome movie with lots of action. Very hot girl kinda superhero too. on Thor's team. Awesome.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I attracted this movie and book into my life. I will forever be grateful for the teachings and inspirations I have received from watching the film and reading the book. Thank you.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|It's the last time you will see Megan Fox looking hot and sexy. Plus it has cars that turn into fighting robots. Every kids dream.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I HAVE ORDERED THE WHOLE SERIES, MOSTLY FROM AMAZON. IT IS A PRIME DVD AND I ORDERED IS ON MONDAY. SO I SHOULD HAVE THIS NO LATER THAN TOMORROW, AUG. 2ND. NOT THE 5TH LIKE YOU ARE TELLING ME. IF THAT IS SO, THEN I GUESS I GET THIS DVD FOR FREE!!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is a very action pack movie all the way to the end. Ironman, Thor, Hulk, Captain American, Hot Girl what more can you ask for?
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Very typical Tarantino style film.  Lots of blood and cover your face scenes.  Also, not for those who can't handle over use of the N word.  I think it's used over 100 times in this film?  I think Jamie Foxx gave a great performance.  Lot's of inside jokes and nods to the original Django.  I'm not a movie expert, so I'll keep my review to that.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. I like how it stores the numbers so you don't have to remember what you started with. I love it and I like that it has big numbers my eyesight is bad so this allows me to see it. Thanks for a great app.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST RUNNING APPS FOR MY NEXTBOOK SPEND HOURS PLAYING THIS GAME... HAVE ALL THE ANGRY BIRD'S GAMES...
B002ONV5E6|5.0|Third time I watched this and I liked it as much as the first time I watch it in the theater. If you like spy-revenge type movies this is for you otherwise go watch a chick flick.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Best darn SciFi space opera ever made, plot to visuals top notch, however what really set this movie on a pedestal are the actors!! Each one more endearing than the other, I laughed, got all stressed out and cried. Totally the finest SciFi ever made. Still can't believe Fox dropped it after one season?!? (Fire Fly) if you enjoyed the movie you will love the series.<br />Enjoy
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is a great bit of fun however it is to overplayed now and the features are just crazy.  It was more fun 1 year ago!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Loved this Series it's the best SciFi epic ever made, if your thinking of getting this just do it, I don't write reviews very often but this series compels me to say a few words. You won't be disappointed I guarantee it.<br />Enjoy
B0086700CM|5.0|Are you ready to waste hours of your life, running around in circles from the evil monkey, not the one in your closet.  If so DL this game now or Temple Run 2!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it. I think it's a very good game especially for kids and I really like it you should totally get it. It's really fun!
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I was sick of waiting for Ivy bridge-E so I went Sandy Bridge-E.  This was a HUGE upgrade over my good old 775 Core 2 Quad 9550, RIP.  If your looking to upgrade wait for Ivy Bridge it is due out in a month.  Still will walk all over haswell because of the features the x79 has over the x87.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Quite the surprise.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Cute story.  Some puzzles repeat with increasing difficulty as you proceed through the game.  Some quick and painless, others long and grueling. Various puzzle styles.  I want more.  I see there is a sequel.  Will get that one soon.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is a great bit of fun however it is to overplayed now and the features are just crazy.  It was more fun 1 year ago!
072325804X|5.0|We got this for a first birthday gift.  Really nice quality and all images are the original!  I great book to have in your child's book collection.
0321784421|5.0|This book is great for everyone that wants to dive right into web 3.0 learn the right way and stop using tables!
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I like the GI Joe movies. Lots of action, nice special effects, cool gadgets, great fight scenes with storylines/writing/acting taking a backseat. This movie was no different.<br /><br />Although for most of the movie I was confused as to whom was the good guys/bad guys, I really didn't care. I just enjoyed watching it. After a while, you kinda figure it out.<br /><br />Masterpiece Theater? Nope. Kickbutt movie with The Rock? You bet.<br /><br />By the way? Since when is Dwanyne Johnson black/African American? Apparently he has gone through some conversion process. In the movie he is an African American male with black children. On the promo pic, I thought he looked much darker. Anyway..........confusing/odd/bizarre. Still a good movie and enjoy watching him.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Really nothing to review here if you like the walking dead and want to rewatch the first season in FULL HD then this is just what the doctor ordered.  Looks great on the PC and on the HDTV!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best TV series EVER...... I couldn't quit watching it. You become part of the upstairs and downstairs, loving them all.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|This is a great classic film that I ordered for my parents.  They love the movie when its on TV so I said why not order the DVD.  No issues with the item or the DVD.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|This has to be one of the best Kubrik movies - it is funny and terrifying even by contemporary standards. Doesn't skimp on the special features either with several types of 'making ofs' and interviews with relevant film makers.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Did have a problem with running long in descriptions and a little one sided but overall I'd tell others about it.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|I've loved this movie since it came out when I was a kid and I still love it as an adult
B00005OM4Q|5.0|The regular theatrical version is so good, it's hard to imagine improving it, but the Director's Edition adds even more depth by fleshing out side stories.  I could probably watch this once a week for a couple of years before I got tired of watching it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it gets me up and has perfect snooze time and I love it without it I would be late for school
1455510319|5.0|written a bad book yet.  I like his Bosch books better, but the Haller series is good, too.<br />.  .  .  .
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I was not at all groggy, but I fell asleep watching it. Slow, boring, and unrealistic. Yes, it is a toy doll franchise made into an action movie, but they could loosen up a little bit with the kid stuff and tighten up a bit with the story line. The plot was so cliche that it made cliches blush and the acting was abysmal. Wanna know how I really feel about it, don't cha?  I want my $3.99 back!<br /><br />But it was not Amazon's fault, so I cannot request a refund. It hurts me, as a movie goer, that I can find independent films on AMAZON, especially Amazon Prime Video, that are real winners --then I watch a \\"big budget\\" Hollywood style movie and it puts me to sleep like warm milk on a rainy night.<br /><br />I admit army uniforms in many cases are drab green, but this movie was just plain drab! I thought, wrongfully so, that the inclusion of Bruce Willis would up the standards for this franchise. Nope. Silly is as silly does.<br /><br />I originally had this sad puppy crapping out at TWO STARS, but I rethought the graphics and eye-candy, including some impressive fight sequences, but even they were marred by dark lighting, shadow shooting, and quick-cut editing. Still, I can see where a tween or teen might find the gunfire, explosions and swordplay riveting.<br /><br />When I was a wee lad of only five, I choreographed far better G.I. Joe action in my backyard.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|It's not bad, but reading this, all I kept thinking was &#34;Hunger Games.&#34;  Wool is Young Adult Science Fiction Light, not &#34;real&#34; SF, so how about some truth in advertising, please.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have always been partial to historical pieces so this is right up my alley. It makes you laugh and cry because it really draws you in. Well made, LOVE the costumes and casting is amazing (can't get enough of Maggie Smith!)
1454701250|5.0|The book has very nice photos and tips for inspiration i love the colors in this book, and the techniques are very use full.<br /> Highly recommended.

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|SO far this game is fun but i do not like how you have to spend coins to play a game i mean come on how suckish. But good game so far
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell is fun, addicting, challenging, user friendly and frustrating all in one. Thankfully the hint feature saves you before getting too mind boggling. The is a great addition to my game collection.
0807014273|4.0|I haven't finished this book. However Jerry Sitter recommended this book. He read this book 2x.<br />I liked this book so far because it explains how some one can survive in the most miserable situation.
B00CZAYL76|5.0|Wow guys, FFDP keep getting better! American Capitalist was a great CD that i loved since the first listen. This is even better! Can't wait now for part 2 to come out! FFDP never let us down
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|It is not the best doctor game ever but it is a fun game it is pretty cool my friend would like it :) &lt;3
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is really cute and this was a great deal.  I almost purchased this movie from the app store for the same price I got a DVD, Blue Ray and a digital copy.  Always check Amazon first.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|love it it was every thing i thought it would be thank you so much and people should buy this
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Fun and fast paced action. Having this many words required in a review is annoying. The book is good, thats enough.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun my boyfriend loves it and love it I was it was in real life it's interesting how u play it
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Volbeat is unbelievable. I own above heaven and guitar gangsters and just bought outlaw gentleman a couple of weeks ago. All 3 albums are awesome! complete albums not just 3 or 4 great songs but complete albums. I was expecting outlaw gentleman to have a slight drop off from the other 2 after listening to the teaser samples of the album. Boy was I wrong! I've listened to this album everyday for 9 days in a row. I've been a musician for 27 years 10 professionally and I believe Volbeat is hands down the best hard rock band out there right now. If you like hard rock you simply can't go wrong with Volbeat.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|great product good quality video allows easy storage and allows me to have and share these movies with my son before Disney vaults them
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|I was looking for a recording app, not really video recording but this is perfect for making music for me and my sister!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|temple run 2 is okay but I like the first one alot better I suggest you get the first one insted of the second one
B000TRXRUY|3.0|Wife had never seen a Bruce Lee movie so I had to show her this one. Classic scenes in a kung fu movie. Must see.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun addicting game love the minions. Just wish the fire fighter costume was cheaper I love it. My kids love it too
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and it was amazing! Two thumbs up for the story, the suspense and the scary scenes. What intrigued me the most is the sound, everything related to the music during the killing scenes. It's one of a kind, frightening and will chill your bones. Must see.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|TWC has dramatically changed this app.  Theme  interface is not very user-friendly, hard to navigate and provides far les information.  Like other reviewers, I will be deleting this from my kindle and looking for an app that provides more weather data, and fewer useless and frustrating graphics.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|That says it all bingo is by far loads of fun. Even when I didn't win I still kept playing. I love bingo especially since I don't have to spend money makes it better.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|The instrumentals are full on Megadeth.  The vocals are starting to get a bit strained at times.  Overall, a good listen and welcome addition to my Megadeth library.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|The HP 12C calculator is a legend in the financial world. This newer model is faster than my trusted original 12C (which still works great after 25 years!). These HP gems are powerful, well-built, and easy to use. Comes with a CD instruction disk as well as a manual. Highly recommended!
140006922X|1.0|The author is a muslim with the mission to undermine other religions.  This work is simply slander from a man who follows Mohammed.
B00DU74U74|4.0|This movie is ok it's like a teen version of the body snatcher but with a better ending , but it was ok
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this for the second time after watching the movie and got a lot more out of it than the first reading
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was beyond enlightening! This is a book that has made a permanent impact on my mind and my heart. The author presented the scientific aspects of the material in a way that any layman can understand. She introduced us to the Lacks family in a humble, non-condescending way. I was moved and educated. This book is a true must read for anyone who has ever had any interaction whatsoever with any aspect of the medical field (that should be almost everyone).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun to play. It's not too hard, but also not too easy. I only hope that they will add the other levels sometime soon because I'd love to continue playing.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It takes me back to my childhood. It's fun and I love it. It's a really fun game to play when you have nothing to do.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book get you in the head of a lethal Sniper. He writes well and makes you feel like you were there.
B00006674X|5.0|My mom loves Elvis. This worked great as a birthday present for her. I am thinking of getting her another one for her for Christmas.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Intelligent, graceful, and entertaining. Rarely are there gory scenes, and when they do appear, they are short lived. This program thrives on content, good acting, and beautifully developed characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very good. Don't throw eggs in multiplayer kindle via iPod. Late updates are ok. And sound is better than iPod
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Firefly is the best show EVER!  Your life will be forever changed after seeing this show.  I truly envy anyone who gets to see this for the first time.
1451695195|3.0|This New York Times #1 bestseller is an unusual true story about life after death. It's fairly short and to the point (208 pages). I admit it seemed like a reasonable account of a near death experience (NDE) as the author comes across as very believable considering his training as a neurosurgeon. However, don't expect much in the way of exposition, theorizing, explanations, or insight about what the experience really was or what it meant. It was a personal experience that goes beyond words. It's basically a story about \\"what\\" happened not \\"why\\" it happened. Don't expect much info on \\"The Other Side\\". Chapters 29 (A Common Experience), 30 (Back from the Dead) and 31 (Three Camps) is the most interesting part of the book. The author dismisses the more common explanations such as REM intrusion, DMT dump, and the reboot phenomenon as \\"spectacularly short\\" as a workable hypothesis.<br /><br />There are plenty of academic, medical, scientific and other technical terms used here that seem to get in the way of a good read. That style demands to be taken seriously but can make the story plod along because the author lacks the flourish of a natural writer. Very interesting glimpse into heaven but no word of hell. I was disappointed in the title because little actual proof is offered and Heaven remains as mysterious as ever when you finish reading this book. Few answers are really provided so it is up to the reader to decide for themselves what these experiences mean. The author has a website discussing NDEs and reincarnation.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|have had so much fun plai<br />ng this game what a hoot  grab all the bananas you can and run fast
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This is a collection of some of the greatest games to ever come out. Metal gear solid has been ground breaking from the beginning and continues to thrill gamers.

B0000VCZKW|5.0|\\"Matilda\\" is a cute and loving classic film. Matilda (Mara Wilson) is born into a horrible family who neglects her and refuses to give her the love and affection she deserves. Matilda is a very bright and smart little girl with a special power. At age of four, she knows how to multiply big numbers. At the age of six, she walks to the library all by herself and teaches herself how to read. Matilda learns how to do everything by herself.<br /><br />Unfortunately she is stuck with her horrible family.  Her father is a cheat, lowlife man that buys illegal car parts and her mom is a big diva who plays bingo all day. On the other hand, if it wasn't for Matilda's dreadful family, she would not have discovered that her mind is so strong that she's able to move objects just by thinking about it.<br /><br />I love the special affects in the movie. Matilda has the power to lift things with her mind and the way the camera angle is set up makes it look so realistic. I also like the narration throughout the movie because the movie skips parts of Matilda's life. Having the narration makes it easier to follow along with the storyline. I love how every role in the movie is such a despicable or unique character. There is a horrible, dreadful principal at the school, a sweet innocent teacher, a cheap dad and the awkward looking kids at school. What I didn't like in the film is how the horrible principal, Ms. Trunchbull, is very harsh and picks kids up from the hair and throws them or abuses them in other ways.<br /><br />I really love the relationship between Ms. Honey and Matilda. Ms. Honey (Embeth Davidtz) is by far my favorite character because she is just so sweet. She takes Matilda as her own child because she knows how mistreated and neglected Matilda is. Ms. Honey has a genuine heart that makes her very lovable.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Matilda is four and is left all alone in the house and decides to start making pancakes from scratch. It is an adorable scene because normally a typical four-year-old wouldn't be doing that. So, it was very cute.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Matilda\\" for ages 7-11 because it is a great movie for kids. It will make your entire family laugh. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars so go check it out. It is playing on HDnet Kids Scenes the entire month of July.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jailene A, KIDS FIRST!

B009WUAK2M|3.0|Great to see all the stars together. A little corny, but entertaining which is what a movie should do, entertain you. I don't expect an Oscar performance from every made.
B00E00P5JC|5.0|Below are reviews by two of our youth film critics, one from a 15-year-old and one from an 11-year-old.<br /><br />Geared towards kids under the age of 10, \\"Turbo\\" will be sure to have kids delighted and cheering the snails on. However, the excitement merely lingers for a short while, just like the exhaust trail from a racecar speeding by.<br /><br />For a movie about racing snails, \\"Turbo\\" isn't half as bad as I thought it would be. Although initially skeptical, I changed my mind for the better because of the movie's amusing wit and heart. A normal garden snail named Theo has big dreams of being the fastest racer in the world.  His brother, Chet, sees Theo's dream as nonsense and a distraction to their work in the garden. One day, a freak accident involving Nitrous Oxide changes Theo to Turbo. Suddenly this snail has the abilities of a car - headlights, a stereo, and of course, unparalleled speed powers! A Mexican taco seller, who shares the same dreams as Turbo, enters the snail in the Indy 500. On his journey to the greatest car race in the world, Turbo befriends a gang of smooth cool snails (you'll never look at snails the same way again) and meets his rival, the menacing racer, world-renowned Guy Gagne.<br /><br />The plot is straightforward and simple, mixed in with heart-warming feel-good morals typical of underdog family-friendly animated genres. \\"Dream big!\\" the film seems to shout at every turn.  I could have done without highlighting the message quite so much. Although \\"Turbo\\" starts off slow, it gradually begins to pick up speed. The filmmakers also could have included more brother bonding moments between Turbo and Chet.<br /><br />The voice-overs are solid, especially Ryan Reynolds' Turbo and Paul Giamatti's Chet. The snail gang is hilarious, voiced by Maya Rudolph, Ben Schwartz, Kurtwood Smith, Snoop Dogg and Samuel L. Jackson. Unlike Blue Sky Studio's \\"Epic\\" that came out earlier this year, DreamWorks hired big names not because of their celebrity status, but because their voices actually fit the slick, suave characters.<br /><br />At its best, \\"Turbo\\" is a heart-pounding inspiring flick, perfect to keep kids entertained. \\"Turbo\\" isn't going to make its way into my evergreen library but certainly this family-friendly film will grab the kids' attention long enough to give parents a much needed summer break.  The 3D is impressive! I felt like I was really racing alongside the snails. The film offers a snails-eye view, an interesting perspective especially while racing. \\"Turbo\\" can't be compared to Pixar's movies, but even so, it's a rip-roaring adventure. Reviewed by Cassandra H., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic<br /><br />I loved the movie \\"Turbo!\\" It is really fun and must have been an awesome movie to act in. This movie is an animated film about super-speed snail racing and features the voices of many different actors. Turbo is a lonely garden snail who is about to gain super speed powers and will race in the \\"Indy 500\\" which is meant for cars but, his amigo Tito didn't take \\"no\\" for an answer.<br /><br />This is a fast-action movie where Turbo, who watches a speed race every night and idolizes Guy Gangn&egrave; who is the national champion racer. Turbo memorizes every line he says as well as the commercial for the drink: Adrenolade. One day, when he is working in the garden, a \\"big red\\" tomato falls on the other side of the garden where the lawn is being mowed. Turbo is so slow that he imagines he is the racer racing for the \\"big red\\" tomato. He does not make it to the tomato but he still goes on his own journey in the rain all alone. This is when everything starts to happen and Turbo receives his powers by a racing car's kind of gas.<br /><br />The main characters are Turbo the snail (Ryan Reynolds), Tito (Michael Pena), Chet  (Paul Giammati), White Shadow (Michael Bell), Whiplash (Samuel L. Jackson), Smoove Mov (Snoop Dogg), Burn (Maya Rudolph) and  Skid Mark (Ben Swartz). All these characters are great but my favorite and the one that stands out the most is Chet because he was pretty annoying and he is the one that puts most of the negativity into the movie.  I thought it was really cool how the writer did that.<br /><br />My favorite part is near the end where after Turbo loses all of his powers and then tries racing again at Dos Bros Tacos for everyone to see. All of a sudden, when it is almost time to race he gets all of his powers back in an amazing magical moment and it is really nice and cool. Turbo is really happy that he gains back his powers and speed.I recommend the movie to all ages for anyone who loves action-filled adventures and having fun. I also found this movie very cool and safe for children to watch. It has very funny characters and scenes. The moral of this story is that even though you are a small snail and have big dreams, you can do anything you set your mind to.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacy-Love B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|We love this movie and own the soundtrack as well, not to mention watch it all the time.  Can't wait for the sequel!  Aca-believe it!
B008JFUPZI|3.0|This movie is only pretty good because it is pretty predictable and isn't totally appropriate for kids. I did like it though because it has a ton of action and suspense. This movie is also 3-D which makes it even cooler because of all the action scenes.<br /><br />This movie is about a guy named Nick (Ryan Rey6nolds) who has a good wife and works for the police department. He also has a good partner (he thinks) until his partner wants the gold that Nick has so he kills him. Nick then works for the Rest in Peace Department and he is paired with a new partner named Roy (Jeff Bridges) who is a cowboy. Nick and Roy have to save the world from a guy named Hayes (Kevin Bacon) who is going to build something to bring the dead back to life!<br /><br />The main characters in this movie are Nick, Roy, Hayes and Julia. My favorite character is Roy because he is really cool, good at fighting and hilarious! He is so funny and is just a really weird guy. He does some things you wouldn't think he might do and it makes everyone laugh.<br />My favorite part in the movie is when a big fat guy gets shot in the butt with a grappling hook by Roy. He was flinging him all around and trying to kill the bad person that's technically already dead. I just thought it was really funny.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie for ages 10 and up because there is a lot of violence in this movie and it's rated PG-13. It also has some stereotypes that might not be the best message for kids. All in all it was pretty funny as long as you realize that is what it is meant to be - a comedy.

B0090SI582|4.0|\\"The Wolverine\\" picks up a few years after the 2006 film \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" leaves off. Logan is living alone in the mountains in fear that if he is around other people he will hurt them like he hurt Jean Grey (killed in X-Men: The Last Stand). When Logan is summoned by an old dying acquaintance from World War II, he decides to pay his respects and travel to Japan to say farewell to his friend. Soon after he arrives he realizes that he was called there for a different purpose. Yashida, the man from Logan's past has brought him to Japan to offer him mortality so that Logan can finally be at peace. When he realizes that not all is as it seems with the powerful Yashida family, he has to face the tough decision whether to give up his life as Wolverine completely, or defend the Yashida empire. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven D recommends the film to X-Men fans or \\"anyone who wants some action and entertainment.\\"<br /><br />I really like this film. I was a bit confused at the beginning because it's been years since I first saw \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" which plays a big part in this film. Once I jogged my memory a bit, the plot was perfect. The 3D in this film is incredible because it isn't over the top. It is very subtle in a way that makes the images clearer and more realistic, but doesn't have things jumping off the screen. The plot twists are very nice even if they are a bit predictable. All in all I am very pleased with the outcome of \\"The Wolverine.\\"<br /><br />My favorite character has to be Yukio played by Rila Fukushima. She is a very spunky character who is sent to find and bring Logan to Japan to say goodbye to her master. She has incredible martial arts skills and is a very funny character. She is very small, so you wouldn't expect her to be a fighter, but she ends up calling herself Logan's \\"bodyguard.\\" I also like Hugh Jackman's character Wolverine/Logan. He is very hesitant to go to Japan because he has left his identity of Wolverine behind him but, when he sees that innocent people are going to be hurt, he fights for them. Although he is a very tough character, you can see that he has a soft side, which we wee through his many visions of Jean and his sleeplessness because he misses her.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Logan battles the Yakuza mob on top of a bullet train. It is such a fast paced, high action fighting sequence that it kept me on the edge of my seat. It was also very unique because it happens on top of a train moving hundreds of miles an hour, so the participants of the fight are almost flying through the air.<br /><br />I recommend this film for ages 13+ for the action, violence and mature situations. This movie is perfect for X-Men fans or if you just want some action and entertainment. I give \\"The Wolverine\\" 5 out of 5 stars, so be sure to check it out when it hits theaters on July 26th.

B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Amazon lists the aspect ratio as 185:1 in the product description, which is WRONG.  The aspect ratio is 239:1, so you will have those damn black bars on your screen.  Just a pet peeve of mine.  But if you buy a widescreen TV it seems to me that every widescreen DVD should fit without those black bars at the top and bottom.  185:1 aspect ratio is the only one that fills your widescreen TV perfectly.
B006LSZECO|2.0|First off, I wanted to give only 1 star but b/c the book was somewhat intriguing & held my attention for a bit, I gave it 2. When I bought the book I was unaware how bad the language was and many times it got so raunchy in nature it was hard to get past. But the worst thing about this book was its ending. I was so ticked off I wanted to throw my kindle out the window. Truly, the ending left me dumbfounded & mad & ruined the entire book for me. I was so mad I endured it all to be so disappointed in the end. I would not recommend.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I spent so many hours on this game, it's not even funny. One of the aspects I find most intriguing is that your job doesn't completely define your game play.
1612930425|5.0|The book is amazing. You can't argue much over a classic. I did a book report on this book in one of my professor's classes. Elizabeth is such a free minded girl, and the way the characters change throughout the book makes you grow an attachment to them.

B00CP4RZIO|2.0|We all know what Chimaira had to offer--an excellent blend of genres with incredibly angry lyrics and plenty of good riffs. Unfortunately, that Chimaira had Rob Arnold and Matt DeVries playing lead and rhythm guitar, and their presence is sorely missed on Crown of Phantoms. And lest we forget Andols Herrick, who owned the kit on some of Chimaira's best albums. Needless to say, Herrick would have done wonders for this album. Their current drummer (Austin D'Amond)  is capable, but not memorable. The same must be said for the new guitarists (Emil Werstler and Matt Szlachta), who are definitely talented, but their riffs don't hold the same memorability as those of Arnold and DeVries, not to mention that Werstler's solos seem half-assed when compared to the wonderful lead work that Arnold provided. You could say that Crown of Phantoms has me stuck in the past, but as the proud owner of two monstrous Chimaira albums (Self-Titled and The Infection), I must say that Crown of Phantoms has left much to be desired. The riffs are desperate attempts to emulate Arnold and DeVries, the drums mere background noise. Rather than leave their own mark, as Soilwork's two new guitarists have done with The Living Infinite, Werstler and Szlachta attempt to blend in and sorely disappoint. The riffs are boring. The solos? Generic modern metal fare. In an attempt to replicate Chimaira' sound, the new members have inadvertently created their own, less than exciting sound. It doesn't sound like Chimaira, and while it's not always a bad thing for a band to reinvent themselves, with five new members it just wasn't a task these new boys could take on. This is Chimaira's weakest album to date, without question.  It's hard to replicate the genre bending sound that was achieved by Chimaira's already revolving door, but when everybody but Mark Hunter is practically brand new, perhaps it would have been best for Chimaira to go on hiatus.

B0093OGBL6|5.0|Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy is a well thought-out, in-depth story of Michael Jackson and his journey--the good and the bad.  Dr. Moriarty brings an interesting point of view to a celebrity biographic--that of a psychologist.  Many biographies are written too factually, but this book blends facts with the author's take on why things happened and how they affected Michael and his family.<br /><br />The way that the author focused on one aspect of Michael Jackson's life in each chapter made for very easy and fluid reading.  I especially enjoyed the chapter entitled \\"Michael Jackson and His Family\\", which speaks about the unusual and often detached relationship between he and his family members.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in knowing more about Michael Jackson's life.  Empathetically told, the author's portrayal of Michael Jackson, the man, versus Michael Jackson, the star, puts a new spin on the man we all think we knew.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|I don't own any other Daft Punk music so I cannot speak to its placement in the Daft Punk cannon of works but this album by itself is a masterpiece.  I believe the music really compliments the tone of the movie while being strong enough to stand on its own.<br /><br />I always appreciate a good soundtrack but I am certainly not a soundtrack-buff.  Even some of the most memorable film tunes are buried in 2 hours of easily forgettable functional music, which is why I only own a handful of soundtracks.  Daft Punk's score of Tron: Legacy, however, is a score filled with one memorable tune after another.  You can tell that I'm not the only one who feels this way given its enormous critical acclaim; the amount of positive reviews on Amazon and iTunes; and the fact that other films/shows have used the music in their own promotional material (Game of Thrones used \\"The Game Has Changed\\" in a preview of their third season and \\"Recognizer\\" was used in a trailer for one of the recent Resident Evil movies).<br /><br />\\"The Son of Flynn\\", \\"Recognizer\\", The Game Has Changed\\", \\"Outlands\\", \\"End of Line\\", \\"Disc Wars\\", \\"C.L.U.\\", and \\"Tron Legacy (End Titles)\\" are definitely worth mentioning and Daft Punk fans will certainly like, \\"Derezzled\\" even though it is very short.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this album.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The trilogy gains substance because the author does not sugar coat the ending of the series with unicorns and rainbows.  The reader can readily accept that the outcome is realistic based on the actions proceeding.  Great series.  Now I guess I need to check out the movies.

I am being told that it gets better and the third book is the best (don't know if I can get that far!).  I really want to see what all the hype is about.  I truly am trying to find some redeeming quality as I am only 1/3rd the way through (she has just been deflowered).

0316228583|4.0|Rowling's first foray into the world of adult fiction was an entertaining read. The Casual Vacancy deals with events following the death of Parish Councillor Barry Fairbrother. The little village of Pagford turns out to be a hot bed of political back biting, bigotry and ignorance as the residents squabble over the vacant seat.<br /><br />Rowling hasn't quite purged Potter from her head as the children of the village play as large, perhaps larger, a role in the novel as the adults. However, excellent characterisation made it an entertaining read as did some very effective social commentary.<br /><br />Rowling has her detractors but I for one always enjoy the way she spins a tale. My biggest criticism is that it is perhaps a couple of hundred pages too long and don't expect action. This is very much a character driven novel. A worthwhile read that attempts to deal with large social issues in a small village.

B002CIY8EM|5.0|I have heard about this book for years, but until now never really thought about reading it until I watched H2's, \\"Ancient Aliens\\" series.  There are different theories of our existence and learning about them is interesting.  Having been raised Catholic, it can be difficult to think out of the box, but how else can we learn, explore, and seek new questions and answers.  This book, and others like it, open our minds to other possibilities of our creation and our history.  I understand why in 1967, this book created a stir.  However, today, the questions that the book asks, do not seem so far-fetched.  Even the Catholic church reaches out to the heavens (with their large telescope) to see if there are answers and knowledge to gain about what has happened in the past, the present, and the future.  Sometimes, I had to read things a couple times to make sure I understood them correctly, but all-in-all it was interesting and entertaining and finished in 3 days.  I will purchase other books by Erich von Daniken as long as the price is right.

They can be used for &quot;Save Me!&quot;, an immediate resurrection. Four characters return, Guy Dangerous, Scarlet Fox, Barry Bones, and Karma Lee. So far, no Easter Eggs have been discovered, unlike the original Temple Run with the Thunder/Storm map, but I see that changing in the future. If you have ever played and enjoyed the 1st Temple Run, Temple Run 2 is a must-have app!

B005DOKL3E|5.0|The cover fits great! The material is good, sturdy and the colors together are nice. There is no smell as mentioned in other reviews. Probably something that has been fixed since feedback about.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I love the actors, there werent to many egos to deal with. Im a big Helen Mirren fan so it was good to see her in this role. Unexpected action film, great actors, and good story.
1594746036|1.0|The author, although borrowing from the history of the Kindertransport and the film documenting its history (Into the Arms of Strangers) to provide the basis for the book's premise, failed to refer to the Kindertransport or credit the film Into the Arms of Strangers. For those who do not know the history of the Kindertransport, or the film documenting it, the Kindertransport was the rescue effort in 1938-39, making it possible for 10,000 unaccompanied children to travel by train to England, escaping Hitler's killing machine.
0345803493|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker (Bk 2) answers questions I had from Fifty Shades of Grey (Bk 1) about the abuse Christian suffered. Ana is his guiding light into a world full of love and helps him conquer the demons in his past. This is the continuation of a wonderful LOVE story between two people who are share a VOLATILE ATTRACTION for one another so plenty of sex results.<br /><br />E.L. James does a great job at keeping her story on track without rambling all over the place. I was not tempted to skip over any portion and I appreciate the fact that James didn't waste my time just to increase the page count. It's fast paced and extremely interesting. I read \\"Darker\\" in two days as well as Fifty Shades of Grey and couldn't wait to find out what happened from one page to the next! I am about to begin reading Fifty Shades Freed now!<br /><br />WARNING: This is an ADULT novel so if you don't LIKE sex - choose a different book/movie!!!
B004PGAQMW|5.0|KID FRIENDLY.  VERY FUNNY.  NOT SCARY FOR SENSITIVE KIDS.  RENTED AND DOWNLOADED FOR A ROAD TRIP.  KIDS WERE GLUED TO IT AND I WAS LAUGHING THROUGH MILE AFTER BORING MILE.
034580404X|5.0|I am astonished to see how many negative reviewers kept coming back for more! Haha! Most of the readers that hated the first book passionately bought and read books 2 & 3! I bet they'll also be first in line at the movie theater when the movie comes out so keep this in mind while deciding if this trilogy is for you. It's not for everyone but the story is very interesting because this lifestyle really exists. Ana & Christian who have completely different sexual inclinations fall in love and attempt to co-exist in a loving relationship that is fulfilling to both of them. That's what the Fifty books are about. Christian is flawed from abuse & worth saving so Ana guides him onto a healing path.<br /><br />If you haven't experienced SERIOUS LUST & ATTRACTION I don't know if you'll understand the VOLATILE ATTRACTION between Ana & Christian. If you don't enjoy sex I doubt you'll enjoy the Fifty books or movies. If you can not sympathize with Ana's character who's young & insecure about herself but hopelessly in love with a damaged soul choose something else. This has a lot of sex in it but it's FICTION, people! This story is about someone ELSE not YOU so just because YOU wouldn't behave like Ana it doesn't mean that people like her (& Christian) don't exist. I can understand the empathy that Christian needs so if YOU don't -  read something else.<br /><br />I really LIKED this story and I like E.L. James' writing style. She didn't waste my time with a bunch of unnecessary crap just to increase the page count. There is a little repetition (biting lip) but it's Ana & Christian's own private little \\"thing\\" between them and over quickly so I didn't mind it. I found myself using my Sony Reader Dictionary a good bit but Ana & Christian are not only smart but well educated so I understand this besides I am always up for increasing my vocabulary but if YOU don't want to learn new definitions - read something else!<br /><br />I hope my review sheds some light on the frame of mind required to really \\"get\\" this extremely complicated love story.equired to really \\"get\\" this extremely complicated love story.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This story would be good for any teenager that feels out of place in their school or town.The two characters,Eleanor and Park,both feel out of place and find something in common. But the story also shows that in high school you can't judge someone for their behavior, you never now what is going on at home. Like the character Tina, who Eleanor would not have thought they had something in common.

B000V7J82S|5.0|Obviously if your looking to buy this album you know who the great Bob Marley is. And this is, in my opinion by far the very best collection of his work put on a single album. Great song to just chill to.]o. Lay back and relax. Maybe burn one. Just a litle toke. 420. Or not, you can be lame. Its just great music for anyone. Happy go easy music.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this games because it makes you think allot ,the only down fall I can tell unless I have not found out how to do it yet is a wish I could change the colors to something else
B005COO1X6|5.0|short story but Stephen king is always a good read.I enjoyed it and would recommend it.didn't expect it to end like that
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Having read the two earlier novels by this author, I wasn't sure how this one might stack up.  It was great to find that this one is probably my favorite of the three I've read.  Beginning with two small children in Afghanistan, the story follows their lives from there to Paris, to the US and back again.  Dropping in and out of people's lives at different periods can be confusing, and sometimes this can be, too, but it's well worth your time to stay with it.  Really a lovely book.  No spoilers here!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|There is a reason the title has the word *freed* in it. That reason is that after your done figuring out why this book has so many great reviews, YOUR DONE!! No more reading a bunch of repetitive crap about spineless heroines and mediocre -at best- bsdm sex. The repetitive carp as I said mainly focuses around the whole don't bite your lip thing, Ana saying \\"holy\\" followed by a swear word, and talking about how gorgeous Christian is. Yes yes we get it, he has beautifully sculpted  lips and scorching gray eyes and every woman looks at him as if they were undressing him with their gaze. And now on to the \\"holy *****!\\" matter. She says it for every single event that goes on. Christian's eyes darken and she knows that he's thinking about sex. \\"Holy s***!\\" There is a creepy ex boss following them in a high speed chase. \\"Holy f***!\\" She drops a pencil on her shoe. \\"Holy s***! Not my shoe!\\" I know that last one is exaggerating a little bit, but you very point. If you go back to the beginning of my review I mentioned something about a spineless heroine. It's true. Ana never stands up for herself expect in the begging where she throws her brush at Christian for giving her hickeys. Other than that point she apologizes for every thing she does that upsets the guy. EVEN FOR BITING HER LIP! She decides to change her mind like an adult and goes out for a drink with her friend because she doesn't know how serious the matter of security is because Christian never tells her any thing and yet she has to say she's sorry for making him worry. Really E L James? You could have at least given the poor girl a backbone. And saying that the reason for her bowing down is to keep the romance alive is a pitiful excuse. I will now take pity on all the people who thought this book was fantastic and bring to an end my review that is full of criticism. Farewell all those who decide to purchase this book series because of what their friends told them and good luck mending your wounds to those who have.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is pretty good. it works well and its moderately entertaining. the only downside is u have to constantly battle the villains which is very hard but other than that great game.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Rarely do I write a review, but this new supergroup featuring Richie Kotzen, Billy Sheehan and Mike Portnoy is more than deserving of a stellar review. Now in my 40's, it's been a long time since I've been this excited about a group. This bluesy-rock album brought back fond memories of the late 70's - early 90's music I know and love.<br /><br />Rocking out from beginning to end, starting with Elevate, I was pleased to find that there wasn't a single song I didn't enjoy. I was so memorized with Elevate, I played it five times straight.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|A fascinating true life crime investigation which gives a vivid picture of life in old Peking. The photos are intriguing, but a detailed map of the old city would have enriched my understanding of the crime and the subsequent investigation.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I didn't have very high hopes for this book but I actually loved it. Her humor is to the point and self deprecating and everyone loves that in a memoir. It was fun to get the back story on her life as a teen but it was especially fun to hear about snl, Palin, and 30 rock. I may have been converted to a Tina fan.

B009IH0ICG|5.0|I do not miss building a pyramid of charcoal briquets!  This chimney is a wonderful way to get the BBQ going and is a perfect accompaniment for my Weber Smokey Joe Silver grill.  A few sheets of crumpled up newspaper under the chimney, a match or lighter, and you are good to go.  I get the grill up and running in about 10-15 minutes and also don't have to hassle with lighter fluid.  The design of the Chimney is simple and durable and seems like it will last years to come.  Also -- not having to use lighter fluid greatly enhances the taste of the food and you don't deal with the dangerous flare ups that can sometimes accompany the fluid.  You won't regret this chimney!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have PS3 and Bluray 3D player.  Both devices can stream Netflix and youtube video.  Therefore, the first day it came out, I was not too excited about it.  Then, I decided to give it a try 2 days later on Bestbuy shipping with 3 months netflix promotion.  Here what I want to share:<br /><br />-  Both bluray player and PS3 offer a difficult way to search or enter song from youtube.  I was able to enter data faster when using smartphone.<br /><br />-  After the chromecast starts, I shut down the power of my phone and netflix movie still showing on TV (so cool).  Similarly, I exit the youtube app on my phone, and the video continue playing until the end.<br /><br />-  I was able to play Candy Saga Crush on my phone while watching the youtube video.  I think HDMI connected to laptop must show on TV what it is showing on laptop screen.  For example, you can't check email on when connected HDMI to TV without Chromecast.<br /><br />-  My daughter will not have to watch youtube movie on the small screen of my phone anymore.  I'll send it to the TV for her to watch.<br /><br />Currently, apps are limited and the device feel little warm to touch.<br /><br />My advice, don't need to spend a lot of money on ebay to get one.  Eventually, the price will go down.  The netflix promotion might or might not come back.  You have been able to live w/o it before, so no need to pay a lot of money to get it now.
B00304VVII|5.0|All shorts were good, each with very different styles. I wish there had been an option for the Japanese dub.

B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This app is great. I found it fun and addictive. I truly hope they add more levels as I am done now and want more Chimpact please!!! In some levels the diamonds were pretty hard to find but I went through each one after all levels were finished and found the ones I had missed. PLEASE give us more levels! To me this is one of the best apps I own besides all of the Angry Birds & Stupid Zombies 1 & 2.
140006922X|1.0|If you are interested in the progressives view and the re-writing of history then this book is for you!  But not for me.  I am disappointed that the author enhances his credentials to market the book.  He does not have a PHD in religion or history and in reality teaches how to write a protestors point of view.  I am disappointed in the media but it is not unexpected since they never tell the truth anyway, regarding the hype of the book.
0374533571|5.0|Awesome book! I have read it in 3 days! Matthew quick always bring good stories! It also arrived on the estimate date!
140006922X|1.0|Islam's imam is our antichrist. Please listen to Dr. Zuhdi Jasser who is a devout islamic muslim. This is not about left and right. This is about end time Bible prophecy.Islam is the opposite of love and peace.<br />Amazon won't let me post a link but allowed the ones who gave good reviews post links. You can go to youtube and search for \\" Glenn Beck ISLAMS IMAM IS OUR ANTICHRIST\\" and you can also search for a playlist called  \\"WHO IS ISLAM VIDEOS\\"

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and Challenging. I have played similar games and this one tops them all. A lot of fun.
1781162646|5.0|Joyland was a great read as expected as Stephen King wrote it.  It was not as long of a story but since it was put out by Hard Case Crime it was to be expected.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|One might look back and say, \\"Y'know, if Knopfler only released ONE ALBUM and faded into oblivion, he couldn't have done better\\".  Not only does that hold true in retrospect, he would still be remembered and not in the way 'One Hit Wonders' often are.<br /><br />Mark Knopfler taught a lot of guitarists a few tricks when he released this album.  I was fortunate to have been stationed in the UK when Dire Straits made their name.  They were big to me before my younger brothers had ever even heard of them.  I remember writing to the family telling them to keep their ears open.<br /><br />While Sultans of Swing is probably their best known piece of work it is by no means the only good piece.  6 Bladed Knife and Down to the Waterline are definitely excellent stand alone songs.  Each song as different from any other, yet somehow totally familiar.
B0045HCIZY|2.0|I say the current one in the movie theater and thought I would see the beginning movie.  It was so bad I did not watch the next one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is a really fun game because when I'm bored I just play this game and I'm not bored anymore. You can slide, you can  change characters, you can jump, and use huver  boards. It is a fun game.
0441013597|5.0|This book series is an excellent read and will keep you enthralled and your imagination pumping for many days after you finish each chapter.
B006S01GH2|5.0|This is about the girl you wish lived next door!  She's cute and unusual both at the same time.  It better than the run of the mile single girl story.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The author's commitment to detail allows you to feel present during the scene.  He is an amazing writer, making you feel connected to the characters of his book, and tying everything together seamlessly.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|I was born after WWII, but I never knew this happened in France during the war.  It was riveting!  I loved how the past and present came together as this journalist learned more and more about the little girl, Sarah, and the meaning of her key.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book is a quick read like the rest of his books and the main character is quite crafty.  The twists and turns of the plot kept me guessing and I loved seeing him come up with new and innovative ways to stick it to the government.  Who doesn't like that??  The only thing that kept me from 5 stars was how often I had to suspend reality as he painted the authorities / FBI / Attorney general as stupid.  I kept thinking... There is no way they would go for that - but alas, they did...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is jam packed with action and emotions. It will have you mourning for people that don't even exists. You will be on the ends of your seats to find out what happens in this book. Caution not for the following, weak stomachs,faint of hearts and crybabies
0762777931|5.0|This book is wonderful!  Offers an introduction into vegan lifestyle and eating (and living) clean.  Kris Carr did an excellent job organizing the flow of this book so that everything makes sense and you are never bombarded with too much information.  She offers reasoning for all of her suggestions and really walks you through her journey to this lifestyle.  The best part is she never cast judgement on those who eat meat or drink soda, she is simply trying to help you improve your lifestyle and be a happier version of yourself!
1452126577|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this, but I'm a fan of Grumpy Cat so I figured why not.  Well, it had me roaring with laughter as I flipped through the pages.  I shared it with others and got the same reaction.  A cute book with great Grumpy Cat photos and sayings.  If you are having a bad day, flip through this and you will no doubt cheer up.  Highly recommeded, and I say that with a grumpy smile on my face!!!
B007QPFGJW|3.0|A few surprises.  Happy it was a library book.  If I had paid for the book, I would have asked for my money back.

B00BMR5HOO|1.0|Shows Im 100 miles away from where I am. Weather bug is right on, No issues and finds me any where I am.
B00AFEY354|4.0|Good use of back story versus present events. I liked it but didn't love it. I might watch it again and feel differently though.
B00A2H9L2E|3.0|This movie to me is adding parts of horror to this picture. It is a O.K. movie but not better to me then the first one. They were trying to make it scary and horrorably before the endings. But, the movie is not yet completed because there are more to this story then meets the eye.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|You really have to pay attention to keep up with all the different story lines.<br />There is a beautiful theme that runs through all the stories.<br />I was drawn to it because of the complexity and the idea of a small group of great actors that swap roles through time in vastly different but connected stories.  I was under the impression that the characters in each story carried over from previous incarnations in new bodies, but I lost that in many cases.  Perhaps some of the clips that were cut would have helped with this continuity.  Overall I liked the movie, even if it disappointed in some small details.  The grand vistas and the overall story are beautiful and it is well worth watching on the largest screen you have available.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love this series and ordered it in the DVD widescreen format.  The items are as described on the website.  Delivery was quick.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I enjoyed it.  A nice escape for 90 minutes or so.<br />I had few real expectations.<br />It is a fairy tale adventure with excellent effects.<br />The actors did a good job of it.<br />The story was a bit thin, but then there was little to start with but a short fairy tale.<br />Overall it was well done for what it was, light entertainment to while away some time.
B000RUAR5G|5.0|Have loved this movie since i was a little kid. Now as a adult i still watch it now and then. Good movie for the whole family.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Action, violence, no need to think real hard.<br />I didn't come in with much in the way of expectations.<br />It is very loosely based on the fairy tale.<br />It was kind of fun, pretty campy, a nice enough way to kill a couple hours if you are interested in fantasy and action.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|This series rules.  This is right in my wheelhouse (I'm 34, an engineer, a nerd, nostalgic...), so this is not an objective assessment, but I love this show.  Just classic tv, they don't make shows like this anymore.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Bias stated.<br />I enjoyed the whole series with all its odd twists and turns.<br />I think it ended too soon, and they never tie up all the loose ends, but overall a very satisfying series.<br />Season 3 has all sorts of things going on.  The acting is excellent.  The effects were awesome.<br />The story will keep you guessing all the time.<br />It is intense Science Fiction that moves in and through the Twilight Zone.  While it has been compared to the X-Files and it is in the same genre, I would have to say it is unique in and of itself.  This show has taken twists and turns the X-Files would not have been able to keep up with.  It didn't have the single minded obsession of Mulder and unending skepticism of Scully.  They are a team that enters into each adventure with open minds, a variety of personal issues, and many things going on behind the scenes.  If you are a scifi fan, this is a must.  If you like weird stories of what could be, you should try it.  If this sort of stuff disturbs or scares you in any way, run screaming, because this is likely way more than you can handle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though this book is a easy read. It is packed with so much emotion! I recommend it to everyone! Young or old boy or girl the read can keel anyone wanting more!
B00D6QU6RW|2.0|I don't really care for the new sound of BSB. I'm glad I listened to the sample tracks before deciding on whether or not to buy  this. They have changed to much for me wont be buying their music any time soon.
B00CL151G4|5.0|This show has smart, clever writing and wonderful acting by Jonny Lee Miller (Holmes) and Lucy Liu( Watson).  The idea of Watson being a women is something that is a twist that does work in this case.  Show is enjoyable to watch and I was hooked from episode one.  The writers have sworn there will be no romance between the two and so far they've kept their promise. I watch alot of crime dramas but this is one that I watch again and again, when I do I do notice stuff which I did not notice the first.  The writing and direction of this show is a breath of fresh air to what is out there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Finally, a post-apocalyptic story that doesn't star zombies or people roaming the wasteland. This is a story of discovery and the folly of men who fear the truth. A great read. Don't let anyone pull the wool over your eyes.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|A unusual story with GREAT acting.  Sometimes a little bit scary.<br />But the story moves along in such a way that the negative and<br />positive aspects of the film are equally enjoyable.<br />Thank you
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been a fan of Magic the Gathering for a long time and Wizards of the Coast has done a great job on everything. This is no exception.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have used the random deal the most and found that it lets me win fairly often. Can play a round rather quickly and not get frustrated.  I don't have to pay to get to the next level or call a friend to move on.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really like this version. Game cues are intuitive and, overall, the interface is very pretty and easy to use.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Eastwood gives perhaps one of the epic performances of his life.  Is this his final message.  Movie is true to life. Old grunt from Korea who loved his wife and country, worked hard and did not abandon the neighborhood just like he did not abandon his country.  Turn of events with neighbor boy allows him to overcome &#34;inbred&#34; and war fed racism.  Weakness for me was the depiction of the Catholic priest.  The priest had common faults of a green cleric but was too brittle to believe.  A few particulars with ritual or liturgy were not followed.  However, it was an excellent movie with a perfect ending.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I found this novel to be very enjoyable. The concept is creative, and kind of has a similar feel to Gaiman's 'American Gods.' This is very much worth a read.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I saw it at a friend's house and had to buy it. I've watched it like 100 times and enjoy it every time. A fun teen movie.
B000FC1192|4.0|This is probably the most entertaining and creepy children's story I have ever read. It's a very fast, addictive read. If you're a fan of Gaiman, it's a must.
B00COO2D6O|4.0|Overall a good game. Don't like that money doesn't carry over between missions and earning stars is too hard.  Very entertaining in spite of that.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I found &#34;Stardust&#34; to be truly entertaining, and it fed my fantasy novel needs. It has a movie adaptation, but I'd suggest reading the novel first.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The whole family loved this book. Great discussion material with our pre-teen. It should come with a box of tissues, however!!!
B008220BLG|5.0|This movie rocks! It has plenty of action and romance, plus Nicholas Hoult adds a great deal of humor to his character!
B004YKSXYW|4.0|It's written for children so it's easy to read and puts historical events in chronological context. Clear and simple, great for smart kids (great!) but I didn't find myself hungry to keep reading it myself. I learned a lot from it and would recommend that parents read it to their kids at bedtime (much better than fairy tales).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best show ever! I couldn't stop watching!! Great fashion.. drama...love stories...I love the characters...the setting...EVERYTHING!!! I am so excited for next season!!!
B003TOMAPC|5.0|My first thought was this movie was going to be a joke. After watching the whole movie I became hooked. Well done movie great casting and story. I hope the next one weighs in as good as this one.<br /><br />Another movie I enjoyed was Empire of Danger [[ASIN:B0030BMC8O Empire Of Danger]]
B0015GDVTU|5.0|Gerard Butler is hot. Hillary Swank is gorgeous. The story line is great. You'll need half a box of tissues to make it through the whole movie. Need I say more??<br />One of my favorite movies by far!
B0090SI4OC|4.0|* caution: some mild spoilers *<br /><br />I have to admit that, based on some of the reviews I read, I wasn't expecting to like this movie. However, I found it extremely enjoyable. It's possible that my enjoyment of the movie is attributable to a) the fact that I loved the book (and therefore the plot) so much, and b) that I watched it with initially low expectations. Having seen it a couple times, I won't say that it's a masterpiece, but it definitely held my interest and I do enjoy it.<br /><br />Regarding the benefits of READING THE BOOK FIRST:<br />I absolutely loved the book, and have read and reread it countless times. As such, the plot and content of the book was in my mind as I watched the movie. This allowed me, I believe, to fill in certain gaps and moments of inadequacy in the movie plot and acting (there were a couple iffy moments with the male leads, although overall they were believable), as well as some clich&eacute;d or corny dialogue, and some important aspects of the character and plot development that I felt were present in the book, but lacking in the movie. For example, if I had watched the movie without reading the book, I don't think I would get the same sense of the affection/love building between Wanda and Melanie, nor would I get the extent of the conflict Wanda experienced in terms of her feelings for both Jared and Ian, or her different reactions to each. Things seemed to happen rather quickly and more superficially in the movie, although some of that may have been necessary (considering the timing and medium). Regardless, I do think that some of my enjoyment of this movie was most likely contingent on my love of the book.<br /><br />So, this is my advice to anyone contemplating watching or buying it: first of all, don't expect a cinematic masterpiece. This movie is no Twilight franchise, for Stephanie Meyers fans, so watch it for what it is.  If you want an enjoyable couple of hours, go for it.  I also suggest reading the book prior to watching the movie, if you really want to have a good idea of the journey that Wanda (and the humans she comes to love) undergoes.ng the movie, if you really want to have a good idea of the journey that Wanda (and the humans she comes to love) undergoes.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love this app because it's an easy way to get to a certain part/area if google. Also because it it shows all of the options of google.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|So far, the app was very helpful. I like it. I can add notes to the task and sync it across devices.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I love this book because it really shows the meaning of being nice. Also it shows that even the most simplest of things that you say can have an impact on someone ans what they think our how they view themselves.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|another excellent book by lee child; just when you think jack reacher has this case figured out & the reader does as well, something new happens & everything changes; great story teller; he has a lot of competition i.e. balducci, late v flynn, conelley etc but child does not have to take a back seat to any of them;
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I loved it. I couldn't put it down. I really wanted them to get back together. I was mad at John for not leaving the army for good.
B00004Z459|5.0|it was delivered on time and price was great too. my first favorite linkin park album. every song worth listening. all of them are good. that is not possible in music world.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game. I love it can't wait for the next place. My friend was right I did enjoy this game.
B00008H2LB|5.0|it was delivered on time and price was great too. this is my second favorite album. i love this album, work of art.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I really like it and enjoy the scholarship from Aslan. I find it fair to Jesus and even appreciate the title now and what it stands for. Follow my bookmarks in the Kindle app. He is also a good reader and the immersion experience with Audible is great. Buy it. Enjoy!
B000OCXMAE|4.0|it was delivered on time and price was great too.<br />not as good as i expected from linkin park. but it is still a good album.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is amazing its fast and i love it.I like better than txting on regular message.It's a good app and i enjoy and i hope everyone else does to!:)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This was originally downloaded for my son but I find myself playing it. Its fun to play for people of all ages.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Still mostly an Iron Man fan but this movie was fun to watch. If you're a fan of super hero's then you'll enjoy this action-packed flick
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love creative because if you fly up high enough you could go to outer space and never die like you do in survival. But I Love survival because at night all types of  monsters come out and try to attack you.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Absolutely perfect as a series, it shares accolades right alongside the lord of the rings series.  The intertwining stories make for never a dull read.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Spider is fun I'm always trying to find a fun card game and I think I found a cool one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ;) ;) ;) ;) ;) ;)
B005544TRQ|5.0|Watched all of season 1 then season 2 on my Kindle now I'm recording show every week on the DVR.<br />LOVED IT
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I am a big fan of Nicholas Sparks .  I live in South Carolina so he feels like a hometown kinda guy.  Have a lot of paperbacks that I read all the time.  He writes with so much awe, love,  compassion, tenderness, and the list goes on and on.
B0070YDOT8|3.0|I loaded this on my kindle fire after using it on my iPhone. It really doesn't work well on the kindle fire. I am unable to use the rewards and Challenges. I have looked to see if there is an update, but unfortunately have not been able to find one. The reason I put 3 stars is because I know it does work on other systems.
B0032KNA4I|5.0|Got the one I wanted! Ordered wrong movie before.
B009NY43NY|5.0|So sad that this is the end of this wonderful journey. I only hope the end all book is just as good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is the best horse app I've ever played! I would for sure recommend this for all of you out there who love horses!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I HIGHLY recommend this game. If you like temple run or subway surfer you will love this game. It incorporates the cute lovable minions and temple run, and It keeps you wanting to play more. Keep up the good work!!!!!
B009WUAK2M|2.0|I like action movies a lot, but this one has a very weak plot and mostly a way for well known stars of action movies to do bits of their standard stuff. It was a bit of parody, but not enough of a joke to be good. Unless you have nothing else to do, save your time. I kept hoping it would get better, but was disappointed.
1619695944|5.0|J.K. Rowling should have written THIS book under another name. The readers were ridiculously hard on her.  You cannot compare a children's book series with an adult story.  Now when she did use another name with her latest book people thought she was horrid for doing so.  Anyway...<br />  This is a wonderful story;  great plot, great characters, real life.  I could feel the characters' pain both physical and emotional.  This is a dark story and its characters will haunt you.  Maybe I liked it because it was audio.  I don't think so.  I can't imagine putting this book down and not finishing it.  I think people like to complain too much.  Write on and on J.K. Rowling, I love your work.
B001PP9ALY|2.0|Too much violence and graphic sex right at the beginning of the movie.  It would be helpful if there were notes about the movie before I purchase it.  These are the kinds of movies that I think are detrimental to our younger generation.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Thought this was going to be a goofy, girls book to read. It was but I definitely enjoyed it. I would recommend this to all my girlfriends. :)
B003TQ50V6|5.0|I watch this about every year because I like it so much. I recommend it for some great entertainment. Enjoy.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|This game is designed for the computer to win every time!! If you are winning it  freezes up and you have to start all over. The computer is a sore loser and will not let you win any if at all.  SKIP IT!!
1451627297|2.0|I found myself skimming the last chapters of the book.....I had had enough. But what was most annoying were the many goofs and bloopers, and expressions that would not have been used in the 50's.  I found it hard to believe that young people were doing the Lindy Hop to Glenn Miller in 1958. \\"Wings of a Dove\\" on the radio before the song was actually written.  Jim LaDue tells Coslaw \\"You Rock!\\"  Someone needs to \\"Man Up\\".  People listening to \\"Louie Louie\\" in 1961. ( a 1963 song).    Also..the way that everyone speaks the same way.  Words constantly stream from the characters' mouths in a sort of clever, snappy patter.  Everyone ....Al, old ladies, bartenders, salesmen, little kids.  I was so glad when it was over.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Great graphics very fun game to play to waste some time.  However, it really never helps explain what you are doing and absolutely no clues.  So it will take about a week to finish and figure out. But overall, I guess it was okay as a low $$ app.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|The version of &#34;White Light, White Heat&#34; is worth the price of the disc. Emmylou Harris has particularly haunting vocals on this album, which evokes the mood of the film perfectly. It's great.
B008KWHM6U|5.0|I love Two Door and I was super excited to see that this new CD was so cheap. I received it in the mail today (a day earlier than expected) and everything was perfect. I've never been so happy with a product in my entire life!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I go bananas over this game it is the most addictive game it should be illegal. Go minion rush. Bananas.
0765325950|4.0|The so so ending did little to diminish the significance to this book which ranks among the best in the series.<br /><br />Mark downs for the seller who did not mention the book would be lacking the cover.<br /><br />Shipped on time, as stated.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love the story line.  I have not finished all the parts yet, but plan to real soon. I can't wait until I get back to it.<br /><br />U
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Not sure why this movies was pitched as a comedy.  It's funny in parts, but over all is very dark and full of negativity.  It tries to flip to a happily ever after ending at the last moment, but for me it was too little, too late.
0765348276|5.0|The first of Scalzi's series, Old Man's War, pays obvious homage to Heinlein, himself a master of the Science Fiction genre, but does so with such originality and such a careful touch of modernity that you don't feel like you're reading a retread of a classic, instead you see what it means for someone to stand squarely on the shoulders of a giant.<br /><br />The power of this book comes from the immense universe it imagines, one that goes far beyond the Star Trek universe, even the Ender's Game universe (which itself is paid clear tribute to in book two of this series). It supersedes those universes in its imagination of worlds and races -hundreds of them, not just dozens. And it puts humanity in a relative underdog position against the universe, rather than at the center. In sci-fi, we are typically governors or rebels against the invading force, but in this series we're just on the periphery, exactly as our placement in the Milky Way Galaxy would suggest. It's a healthy bit of humility that sci-fi doesn't always force us to face<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best app ever get it and see it for your self you can hunt, craft and kill mobs.
038533348X|5.0|Thought-provoking and fun read. Huge fan of Vonnegut. This author endures. Cat's Cradle is the tale of a writer, a scientist, a religious leader, a midget, and a clarinet player that takes the reader on a madcap adventure leading up to the end of the world. In this work, Vonnegut comments on religion, relationships, philosophy, and the woes of scientific discovery. One of the best books ever written.
B008MVPA9K|5.0|Size was true, can wear with or without socks. More comfortable than cheaper, off brand.  Light weight and cool. Color was true
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I like games that are a lot more involved. If you are looking for a fairly simple game that requires little thought this is the one. There are many others that are more enjoyable.
B00AZMFO6I|2.0|The most interesting thing was the Scenery. The Music was also very good. For seven more words, what can one say?
B009TO99TG|5.0|This collection is an amazing deal for fans of Coldplay who don't already own any of these albums or for new fans who discovered Coldplay after Mylo Xyloto.
B009ZM74F8|1.0|This film is so bad I do not want to bother to write bad things about it.<br />I don't know where to start.<br />Totally lacking in perspective and imagination.<br />Premise: Eradicating all humans with emotions?<br />REally? We need yet another reminder of how ghastly humans act?<br />there is nothing else to being human.<br />Not a bad question to start with but to frame it in nothing but wholesale slaughter and destruction is, well, sociopathic or psychopathic. Either way it is without emotion.<br />the premise to me is grandiose and utterly absurd in every respect.<br />Humans cannot understand the world without emotion.<br />Humans, who are not mentally ill, cannot as a matter of reality, judge anything without emotion.<br />This is another portrayal of the darkness of humanity with no redeeming quality. To me THIS is porn.<br /><br />I have no doubt you have something better to do than watch this film. A root canal maybe?
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I am actually enjoying this game but am extremely frustrated that I'm stuck because I refuse to bug my friends to be on my game. I have no friends in the game and am stuck because of it. If they would make scootaloo gems (not the heart kind) instead of heart stones that would be better.
1400052181|5.0|Rebecca Skloot has done a small miracle; taking a subject(cell reproduction) that could have so easily become bogged down in scientific jargon and flat writing and brought it vividly and gracefully into life.  You will fall in love with Henrietta Lacks, and will be grateful to Rebecca Skloot for the years of effort that went into unearthing Henrietta's story, and telling it so well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's good, but it is really slow. The graphics are great though! I think that the stuff that you can get in game are way too over priced...
B00BCJ1AXE|5.0|I listen to this CD while I run, ride in the car, anytime I can.  My kids love the music and the clean version is great for them.
B009178OQA|5.0|If you love sushi, this is a great documentary. Contains a unique perspective of on man's quest at perfecting sushi. Informative.
1781162646|2.0|I was looking forward to a great King 'supernatural' type of read.  Unfortunately, what I read was more of a criminal mystery type novel.<br /><br />I would have liked more 'spooky' twists and turns rather than what I got.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Saw this movie on HBO, then I bought it. It a good movie to watch on a rainy day !
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This novel assumes a literate, well- informed audience, who can detect fairly immediately the first of many ironies in an amusing tale.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I like this game it's cool to dress them up and do there makeup and everything. I like this game so much
1878424319|3.0|I really wanted to be blown away by this book after reading all of the reviews, but I found it to be just okay. There were parts of it that were helpful. But overall the book seemed too focused on becoming some kind of divine entity. I wanted more down to earth kind of information. Seems like Ruiz is teaching people to live in a dream world of heaven on earth. I'm more of the mind frame, life is hard deal with it - don't try to pretend it isn't what it is. That being said, there were certainly some aspects of the four agreements that stuck with me, such as being more mindful of my word and assumptions, and trying not to take things as personally. I already have been told to try my best all my life. I just didn't take these messages to the level he did, that they have the power to transform your entire life to \\"heaven on earth\\" with love everywhere and a constant state of bliss. But Ruiz would probably argue that this is just how I've been domesticated to feel, so take my opinion for what it's worth.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm new to this type of game and really liked it. I would love to see more games from this company...
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love the little minion guys, but the game itself was actually pretty boring. You might be able to do more things if you buy the extra things, but I didn't want to pay for it
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|If you're not watching this show you're missing out on one of the best shows currently on TV. GIve it a try! It's great!
B003Y5H54W|5.0|This is such a good movie. DVD is of high quality.  Makes a great gift for the Movie Nut in your life.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Love it!<br />Love the world created and atmosphere.<br />Well rounded characters and great premise.<br />Nothing new, but brilliantly created. Texture
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James Altucher writes with brutal honesty, worldly perspective and gut busting humor.  Not sure I've ever read a book that somehow simultaneously speaks to entrepreneurs, the unemployed, stay at home parents and recovering addicts, until now.  This book is a handbook for life at a time where people are more confused about the future than ever.  One of the few books where i have taken immediate steps to implement an author's action plans, with tangible results in my business and life.  Thanks for this, James.  I owe you one.
B00DUCXFUC|3.0|Looks like we will have to wait another year for some better special features OR extended versions which I actually doubt will happen anyway because Nolan never has released an extended version.  In fact, most don't even have deleted scenes.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A very nice and wonderful story about Dorthy and her comrades  and OZ and good witch of north and  south.
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|I love this book.  It has you laughing from page one.  Would recommend this book to anyone.  Can't wait to read the rest of her books.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It was entertaining from start to end. I'm hoping the rest of the series will continue to excite like this.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I think the old version was better! I don't like the layout of the updated version. It still has all the info that I need and want, it just isn't as easy to find it all!
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I love this game it mack's feel lucky because it is my 8th birthday I think it deserves 5 stars
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is cool<br />Ssh fb chin chin cm cm cm v vBulletin cm cm b xxx if dc consuming c funding cmcm iconic cuz curmudgeonly chick B-)B-) cmcm
B008PZZUTS|3.0|I found this movie to be good not great, and following a typical storyline of &#34;the big score&#34;.<br /><br />Few surprises, a double-cross, and some big bucks. No surprises.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Or winter or spring or fall... I give this tome 4.5 stars.  Hated putting it down and it's by no means  a deep story but still flows well and is fun to read.  The perfect mind candy for those days/nights when one wants to go back to antiquated laws and hidden corsets.  Well....mostly hidden.
B00AYR2FOI|2.0|Not what I thought I was getting. This Boz is not the old Boz regrettably which would have been good, but not contained in this CD.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|i believe the f word used  lowers the standard of the story and doesnt need to be used in order to get a point across. Todays standards are so low compared to the years past when it comes to the words used to describe a situation. please up the standard in your other books.other thn that i look forward to reading more because this series has the best of todays sitiuation humor.
B00C7EGV5U|5.0|This book is a stark reminder of how tradition, ignorance, power games and hierarchical imperatives can screw things up. The writing is straightforward, sharp and intertwined with dark humour. It is a tale of human nature.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|stumbled on to this title by accident. I hated for the story to end.  love love love it and recomended to several family memberes.
B005PK56TA|3.0|I've been meaning to watch this show forever. It was interesting. A whole lot of sex. Not as much horror as I expected.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I let my grandson pick out a few games to put on my Kindle Fire and this was his choice.  He loves the game and tries to better his score.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I really enjoy this game and it is so challenging. It is great that if was free also. I am new to this, so will be looking for more games like this.
B001F7EZ9Y|5.0|I play these songs on my mp3 when I'm exercising.....this is one of AC/DC 's greatest collections of songs I think...AC/DC baby they rock
B00AEFXZJE|5.0|This is how we danced (and got put down by some) in the 60's, 70's Nd 80's.  Don't knock it if you haven't experienced it!
B00008WT5M|5.0|I can't say enough great things about his album if you love rock and roll you have to have this album in your collection. I use it to work out with on my mp3 player.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Watched with my husband and almost 17 year old son.  It was fantastic.  We are now into Quinten Tarentino movies.
B00BUWY74M|5.0|Downloaded easily and offered ample info on pertinent training... I have not read all of it however i can only imagine how much more there is to offer, considering all of the questions that I have!!
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed reading this After Death Experience book written by a doctor who had studied the functions of the brain for most of his life.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has read about ADEs and also anyone who 'believes' in life after death.  I appreciated how the book was written about his experience, how it happened and the way he presented it.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|Meryl Streep is tremendously good as a woman who breaks up the relationship between Bruce Willis and Goldie Hahn. Willis makes a good harried husband of Streep.  He applies make up to corpses before burial. Isabel Rossellini appears in role of a woman who sells immortality. This movie has a good cast and is quite funny.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|It's rare that a 'Pot Boiler' contains solid scientific research and then weaves it so seamlessly into both a wonderful character and the story itself. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. And having recently lost a very dear friend to cancer, I found the explanation and use of the Dark Energy and Multiverse theories in the novel to bring me a great degree of comfort. Yeah, I'm a softie, but Mr. Rollins continues to grow as an intelligent and exciting writer with each book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Omg I love this app I belive that it is fun no matter how your feeling some times I'm frustrated then sometime  like I have to do this and then the weekly challenges are great to I really do belive you should buy this app
B007MDB6L0|4.0|I grew up with Disney films. Baby grand daughter on the way and want to be sure to share some of my favorite memories!<br />Like the new additions to the Tinker Bell story
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is a good one to keep you occupied if you are waiting or something. Not too hard, but not super simple, either. I enjoyed it.
B003DT19F0|4.0|I grew up with Disney films. Baby grand daughter on the way and want to be sure to share some of my favorite memories!
0439023491|5.0|I read it because the first in the hunger game series was one of my book club's selections.  I'm now reading the final book Mockingjay but haven't finished it.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I like the game but instead of playing for the games you should be  able to play the games you want to play.
0425252868|5.0|I have read many a book on WWII and most of them have been great. THIS STORY IS EXCEPTIONAL!I was vaguely aware of this true story and saw the print at one time or another. But this put into perspective the huuman element of the WWII fling experience on both sides. Another great book is the \\"Masters of the Air\\" on B-17 bombers in WWII. Spielberg/Hanks are rumored to be making a HBO mini-series on it. But read this book. I often read that someone should make a movie based on this story. I don't believe a movie would do this great book any justice because you need to read the book and put yourself in the human element.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great book enjoyed it to the fullest. No need to say anything else...<br />I hate this requirements need to type so many words before you can submit. That is why I do not do it often... but Lee Child is good
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love love love this app!<br />I hope there's updates on it though for bug fixes cause it does glitch a good bit. Besides that I LOVE LOVE LOVE Minion Rush.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like mystery and hidden games so this is just up my alley.I enjoy playing the game except i play play it it on my kindle so I can't in large it by much.l would prefer a bigger picture.other wise l really like it.
B00AOIKEZO|5.0|This book was an amazing work of art and texture, it was smartly written, and full of mystery. I would name this the best read of the century.<br /><br />I faithfull bookworm
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book was so great.  I finished it in two days because l could not put it down!  Rick Riordan a good author if there was a God for books it would totally be him!  So I really recommend this book to the Percy Jackson lovers!!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love challenging levels, it's cool how it actually gets your brain working!! I just love it!!! You should get this app, definitely
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|Same of what my title so yea this game is good so you should get this game its not a waste of money
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this is a great app if you like the movie despicable me you get to go through different places if you go really far and battle vector and mina you also get to buy differnt characters
B005BC3MBQ|5.0|Perfect animation for an epic Album! Discovery is my favorite Daft Punk album, and great part of the success of it was the extraordinary story told in Interstella 5555, as well as the high quality of the music of course.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft I want more spawning eggs though and a nether portal and easy down load mods off of the app
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I guess I expected too much, it didn't deliver, it moved too slow.  I like James Franco and was disappointed in his character.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a awesome game. I love it. It's really good. I have a little city. I'm gonna make it bigger.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I enjoy fantasy and this movie fit the bill.  There is some violence, it's has humor and the animation is great.  I can watch this movie again and again.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|It's a great game but the little twich is that it's a little bit hard and/or fustuating for kids. But beside that it's a great game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its awesome. On my kindle fire hd its never shut down no glitches and is so fun. I Really enjoy this game
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Lots of stuff blows up, except the plot... Not much to work with there... Not entirely unejoyable, but we were keeping an eye on the running time throughout...
B0042J6VUS|2.0|My son loves to make stop-motion video movies with his Lego's, and this seemed like the perfect accessory to mount his iPod Touch in. However, the first time we tried to place his Touch in the mount, the top of the mount broke off. I was able to glue it back on, but even then, the mount isn't very flexible in opening and closing around any device very well at all. As it is now, the Tripod is just sitting on my son's desk as a decorative item. I guess it was cheap for a reason.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|If you ever wanted to get some insight about North Korea and have an incredible story to go along with it than this is the book for you.  I love Fact based fiction and this book is truly amazing.  You'll start and you won't be able to stop.
0062060554|5.0|Mystery, suspense, packed with lots of twists. Couldn't put it down. Have lent this book to a few friends and they all agreed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really am glad I found this app.  The graphics are great and it gets more fun the more you play.  Good game for kids or adults.  You can rename your horse, buy him new tack, or new riding gear for yourself with coins you earn as you play.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like are the pop up ads that keep interrupting the game.  Some of the ads are so far off from My Horse, sort of violent looking.  I just click them closed quickly.
1476712042|5.0|This book was great from the very beginning. Abby meets Travis and the emotions from there go wild. From disapproval, to hate, to like, to love, they went thru it all. These two have so much passion for each other. You can't stop reading to see what happens with them next. This is not a regular romance novel. There is nothing boring about it. Travis is a bad boy who's controlling and has a bad temper. He is gorgeous and has girls falling for him even if they know that means he is into just one night stands because no one is worth his time. He is covered with tattoos, drives a motorcycle, and fights for money. The reader  will fall in love with the characters especially him once you see how warm and caring he can be. Of course there are other characters who try to win over the hearts of both Abby and Travis, but these 2 are magnets to one another. Their love is crazy and dysfunctional but you want them to make it work.  It took me 3 days to read it and that's because I forced myself not to finish it so quickly because I wanted this story to last.
B00A27X972|3.0|Intriguing I loved the whole idea, and it ended well.  I highly recommend this book, it makes you think  about us and our frailty as humans.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I don't think I have ever read a Connelly I didn't like. In the  Black Box  he brings the victim to life in a way that makes you feel like she was your family. I didn't find the plot exceptionally compelling. It was the human element and the way he goes about  investigating a 20 year old murder and bringing the murderers to justice that keeps you turning the pages.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I have enjoyed using this app for the past few months, but now find it irritating.<br />It started skipping steps and telling me I was using more than one device (not true).  I installed the app again, thinking it would update the first version, but it did not.  On the Amazon web site, I deleted one of the two Draw Something Free (Kindle Tablet Edition) apps that were visible.  That seemed to be successful, but the Kindle device still shows two copies.  Just confusing, and disappointing since it still skips steps quite often and now I have two apps cluttering up the Kindle.<br />And, all along I would have liked it better if Kindle had the option to pay a few dollars for unlimited &#34;bombs&#34; and many, many colors as IPAD version does.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Wantes to read thos book before the movie came out and was so caught up in it that I finished the rest of the series that's currently out in about a week.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|People can rant about how its a bad movie, but honestly its fun. People just relax and realize its make believe...
B000AL730O|5.0|I bought this as a gift, I have this cd . I hope it is the same cd that I have. Mine was more expensive. I really love Paul McCartney no matter what he sings. I'm sure my friend will love it too.
B003EYDU60|5.0|I think the producers and director did a great job with this movie, they really did a great job portraying the characters from the cartoon. its been out for years and still I love watching it.
B00AALHW6Y|3.0|I really like Darius Rucker. I know him best as Hootie and the Blowfish. I love his voice. I really like some of the songs but not all. Don't know if I would buy this again.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I've always known my dogs knew what was going on, just don't have the ability for verbal communication. Uplifting story about pursuing your dreams, never giving up, and doing the right thing / helping others.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I like playing Bingo Blitz because its fun and at times aggravating.  You have to focus and be patient.  It must be good because people have been at this for years!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Dr. Eben attempted to combine two books: one proving heaven and the other his life story. The latter is simply ramble. As a reader the numerous anecdotes kept raising the question: \\"why does this author think his readers should care about these trivial details?\\" Dr. Eben proof of heaven fails miserably. It is disappointing that a neuroscience expert relies so heavily on his personal interpretations of an experience. The brain has evolved to interpret reality in a particular way (to keep us alive), but there is no necessity of this interpretation to be representative of true reality. This is why we have science- to understand true reality objectively not through our direct senses or other erratically subjective means. Reading the book I was anticipating Dr. Eben to address this issue, since he himself is a scientist, but my expectations were not met. As Dr. Eben stated, his experience is not completely unique. For example, others have experienced similar heaven-like episodes induced by trauma. But beyond what he explained in this book is that mescaline and dimethyltryptamine (two chemicals which have historic roots being used in ritual ceremonies) also induce similar heaven-like states. Dr. Eben's book reads as a loquacious trip report of LSD or DMT.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I WAS CAPTIVATED FROM THE VERY START.  COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN.  IT STIRED EVERY EMOTION YOU CAN THINK OF. CAN'T  WAIT TO START THE NEXT BOOK IN THE SERIES.
B0000VCZKM|2.0|The only reason I am giving this 2 stars and not 1 is that a couple of the performances were decent, Quinn and Finney. I agree with the editorial review, its like the movie was filmed in a void. There is very little heart to it. And then they have the scene toward the end where the Rooster character is chasing Annie up a tower!! Excuse me, but this is supposed to be a charming little story, and not some thriller. And then they also take one of my favorite numbers from the show, NYC, and replace it by that insipid \\"At the Movies\\". The dance numbers, mostly by Reinking, were also terribly overblown. The TV movie version with Kathy Bates was far superior.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game. I love going through the different continents. The game is different every time you play, so I never get bored. The only thing I don't like is that you have to collect so many character pieces to be able to unlock a player. I wish there were some other way (also other than buying them, which takes a lot of coins) to achieve them. Other than this, I absolutely love this game!
B008FTAAG2|4.0|This is pretty much what I expected.  I had listened to a few of the songs online and well I got what I set out to get.  It's a moody yelling fest with good metal music, great production, and nice lulls in the rhythm and volume to set the tone for the lyrics.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|it gets kinds boring by the time its good but you get really bored after a while so don't waste your memory and time on this:(
B00CWV8X04|5.0|I found the movie very interesting and it held my full attention throughout the entire movie.  It's not at all what I had expected.  The turn that it took was very shocking to me.  I would recommend this movie to a friend.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I am in the process of reading this book and find it very good - as with all Nicholas Sparks books. Would highly recommend.
B008NW1M4K|4.0|Keep an open mind and it's a very enjoyable read. I found the end a bit flat but don't want to spoil it for anyone here.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Anyone working in the corporate world should read it. It gave me a lot more insight into people.  It's really good.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I heard one of &#34;the piano guys&#34; tunes on YouTube when my daughter started to show an interest in playing the cello. When I ordered the cd I honestly expected to only like the one tune I had already heard on YouTube, but I have to say the whole album is fantastic even the &#34; new direction &#34; tune
B0010SKSTO|5.0|Terrific read. It's valuable to understand one's body language. I particularly like how the author talks about why he needed to understand why it was important for him to know what people were actually saying without verbally saying it.  Love it.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I had hard time putting the book down. My husband read over my shoulder constantly. We are both seniors.  I can't wait for more.
B007SGM084|5.0|Thought this book was about seniors with all the media of older gender reading it! Hope they make the movie soon!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Got his game for my daughter and she loves it. So realistic. Love the fact that it was free also.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It started out as fun but of course it got tougher. You only get one hint per round but using them they go fast and then OF COURSE you have to buy more. I would advise giving it a pass.
B009M2T7K6|3.0|I purchased this for my grand daughter for her birthday.  I feel it is a lot of money for the doll. It is cute and something she wanted so it did make her very happy.  She is 5 and not real rough on her toys.  I think that is not really a durable toy.  But she loved it, guess that is all that mattered.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Makes one appreciate the easy life given and which we so often abuse and forget. This book is a must!!
B000HWZ5VU|5.0|It's Robert Plant!! What more can I say. If I could turn back the clock 40 years, I'd have gone to more of Zep's concerts.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|Awesome app. Makes a great and fun music player too.<br />PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE Add a function to keep the equalizer settings locked, if wanted. Especially in Automix mode.<br />I'm soooooooo tired of resting the equalizer after each song.<br />Thank you and thanks for this great, free app.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty neat game to keep your mind away from your daily mental uses. I would recommend you downloading this app for some escaping fun!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Though Marcus Luttrell did not write this by himself and there may be inconsistencies found by some it is still his story. It represents the fabric of character that it takes to obtain and maintain freedom for all people. Freedom to live in peace is costly! Always has been. This book gives thought to that for both Americans and those abroad as to how grateful we should be to warriors and their families worldwide who fight for basic humanity for us all!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|The time machine needs to be rebuilt... 401 pieces to assemble to get back to 1985.  It's got so many custom pieces, including a \\"flux capacitor,\\" a time travel dash display reading 1958 (a reference to when the first Lego bricks were built), and a personalized California license plate that reads... OUTATIME.  Mr. Fusion will supply you with the power to go Back To The Future!  We just need to get the set and get building.  If you want the official Lego Delorean, with the wing doors and fold-up wheels, this is the one to get.  Including 2 minifigs, both Marty McFly and Doc Brown are ready for adventure!
140006922X|5.0|Great Book from a great scholar of religions who spent his life and twenty years of Academia researching and writing about religion ... a must read for anyone interested in the life and death of Jesus.
B001LIBRL6|5.0|I first saw this movie after my high-school sweetheart had dumped me...I was in my second year of college, feeling pretty down and some friends took me to dinner and to this movie. I always was a Woody Allen fan, and this film became my \\"break-up movie.\\" It had the right mix of romance and silly comedy to help this broken heart begin to heal. I have shared it with all my kids, have seen it 20+ times, and watched again tonight -- with that girl who dumped me 41 years ago. Did I mention I married her after a 39 year hiatus? Anyway, this is a must-see Woody Allen movie. It harnesses his tremendous writing skills, makes perfect use of his stand-up comedy skills, and shows the lovely intensity that was always present with Woody and Diane Keaton. And Tony Roberts, as always, plays the Margaret Dumont-Marx Brothers role to perfection. The sight-gags make me guffaw, to borrow a line from this film. Love this movie!
1423101499|5.0|love reading.  I watch the movie and I had to get the books. book was on time and I had no issue with sender.
0553801473|5.0|George R.R. Martin continues the excellent A Song of Ice and Fire books with this new entry. It brings back all your favorite characters and introduces many new ones. And there's Dragons!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Although I didn't think I would like this memoir, I found it intriguing despite my disgust of the wimpy and ignorant narrator.  She goes through several transformations from a Minnesota girl to an almost-junkie to a real backwoods woman.  Her honesty is the most compelling element of this book, I think.  Enjoyed it and found that her growth became mine.  Good job!
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|This literally is the first case I've ever actually LOVED for my iPhone 5! It feels almost like the actual phone and has a great feel to it. This is exactly what I needed and recommend it for everyone that has an iPhone!!! Good job SPIGEN! :)
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Was very good , Kinda upset I waited for it to come out on dvd 3d would have been awesome! This is straight up a action movie, like a cartoon G.I.Joe come to life. I give it solid 4 star's all day long . If you like action movie's this is for you all day long, As good as the last and has some nice twist's! Well worth your 3.99 any day!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a really interesting, compelling and convincing (in the sense of being scholarly) book that provides a really good introduction to the historical Jesus.  I particularly like how it allows the reader to feel what first-century Palestine and the pre-Jesus Jewish religion was like.<br /><br />There are a few areas where it could have been edited a bit more thoroughly - in particular, some repetitions - but these do not detract from the book's excellent readability.<br /><br />I'm amused at how the people giving the one-star reviews are criticizing the author's credentials, or calling it all a pack of lies, clearly because it doesn't align with their dogma... they don't actually seem to have any substantive criticisms other than that it doesn't align with their beliefs!<br /><br />Worth a read.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like it but ... I don't really understand how to play it . There is to much going on . But other then that . It's coot . &bull;~&bull;

B004VD3YIM|4.0|Just to watch my grandson when he is suppose to be taking a nap and I don't have the time or energy to run up and down the stairs to get him to lay down AGAIN and go to sleep, I can talk to him and convince him to do that for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is one of the best games I have ever played, you get to choose the characters you are by unlocking them in different levels. The best thing is you can try over and over again to beat your high score. I strongly recommend Subway Surfers as a game you should download.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I do enjoy Doctor Who and really enjoyed his 4th and final season.  At first I didn't know if I would like Catherine Tate as his newest companion, but by the 2nd episode I was a fan. What an exciting season for Doctor Who.

B0091THDOM|5.0|The fit is perfect<br />The design is excellent<br />The elastic pull-strap works flawlessly<br />I am so pleased with this product that I just ordered the other two color options.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Picked this one up on the cheap - at the time it came out, I was a little disappointed after the Lincoln Lawyer movie. Mr. Connelly even pokes a bit of fun at that himself here... It was just that the casting was off. But man, I'm pissed @ myself. I've now read all Connelly's books - and he just doesn't disappoint. There are less than 5 current mystery authors I can say that about. #greatread

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Initially didn't like the series but it eventually grew on me. I would suggest reading her other series Gregor the Overlander
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Delivered as promised, nicely packaged.  I love this musical.  I sure miss Audrey Hepburn.  She was beautiful and talented.  She plays the part perfectly.
B008IZYW3U|5.0|As a fan of QUEEN, and Freddie Mercury, I must admit to not having this album. But I am now so glad I have 'discovered' it. I absolutely love it, and have had many a sing along on the way to work, with the CD turned up very loud.A great collaboration. It certainly showcased what a talent and a musical genius Freddie Mercury really was.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Intriguing puzzles that make you think - not a typical puzzle game. Great graphics, creepy music  and cool mechanisms. Love it.
B000MR1V22|5.0|My family and I had so much fun watching this movie!!  All the characters were well developed and interesting.  We were rooting for them to accomplish their goal.  We've watch the movie several different times; it was that good.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I adore this show, and the HD streaming with Amazon works flawlessly with my Roku box.  I have both seasons of this show on Amazon streaming, and while I was anxious at first about paying so much for a digital copy, I have absolutely no regrets.

1465408746|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2SAWOXR7DCUCN]]There have been quite a few books released on Star Wars vehicles already, namely:<br /><br />[[ASIN:078943962X Incredible Cross-sections of Star Wars Episode I]]<br />[[ASIN:0789485745 Incredible Cross-sections of Star Wars Episode II]]<br />[[ASIN:0756611296 Incredible Cross-sections of Star Wars Episode III]]<br />[[ASIN:0789434806 Incredible Cross-sections of Star Wars Episode IV, V & VI]]<br />[[ASIN:0756627044 Star Wars Complete Cross-Sections: The Spacecraft and Vehicles of the Entire Star Wars Saga]]<br /><br />Now, we have another new book, with most of the content rehashed though.<br /><br />Compared to the previous compilation the Star Wars Complete Cross-sections which is 152 pages, also from DK, this hardcover is 208 pages. The extra pages come in the form of related film stills and commentary. Some film stills and additional commentary are also added to the cross-section pages.<br /><br />The expanded edition comes with 4 new cross sections: Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder, the Medical Frigate, Home One and the Scout Speeder Bike.<br /><br />The book itself is smaller in size to the first few books. It's not much an issue because the details can still be seen but you lose the effect of viewing those amazing artworks at even larger sizes.<br /><br />The illustrations from Hans Jenssen and Richard Chasemore are amazingly detailed. It's quite a feat to imagine all those engines and wires running beneath the spaceships and whatever vehicles or walkers. When I look at Star Wars vehicles, part of me think of them as movie props, but these guys really make everything look so believable.<br /><br />Even if you already have the Complete Cross-Sections, I think as a fanatic Star Wars fan, you would probably want to get this book just because of those four new cross-sections. I know that I-can't-help-myself-I-have-to-have-everything feeling when it comes to collecting.<br /><br />5 stars if you're seeing the content for the first time.<br />3 stars if you already have the previous compilation book.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)>3 stars if you already have the previous compilation book.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog.

B008PZZV8S|3.0|It kept me interested but I don't care for unresolved murder stories. I found it distressing that the main character would be continuing his life of deception and murder.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I don't understand how to play it at all & the directions aren't very good at explaining it at all
B008Q08EG8|5.0|Just as good as when I first saw it a young lad. They don't get any better than John Wayne & James Stewart.
B005COO1X6|4.0|As always, mr. King keeps  you wanting more.  A  good escape for those periods of time you have to wait and while away the time.
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|Hard to remake a classic like Evil Dead.  It's a cool movie and you can definitely see the homage to the original but sometimes I think it would just make more sense to rename movies something else.<br /><br />Definitely didn't see a potential for an Army of Darkness remake out of this which would've been interesting... but that's probably a good thing.<br /><br />Still, good movie, good graphics, fun summer flick to watch.  And if you're new to the series, not a bad movie in general.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is so awesome!! I love the selection of heroes. Every Thursday there are new free weekly heroes. If you download this game, I GUARANTEE that you will love it.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Definitely liked this one.  Never thought my favorite character in a Disney movie about Rapunzel would be a horse but that guy has got so much personality you can't ignore him.<br /><br />Great movie for the kids and definitely an instant classic.<br /><br />Bought the streaming version as I'm tired of collecting physical media.  Zero issues as always via Amazon.  Great service... though still annoying that I can't buy videos from the iPhone/iPad.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love the game but I rated it with 4 stars because you can't change your skin we should be able to do that.
B00CL50LEC|3.0|Didn't despise it, didn't love it.  I'll give it three stars JUST for having two &#34;breeds&#34; or &#34;levels&#34; of zombie in it.  Definitely liked the concept of that.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie can really be summarized in one line, &#34;Hey I just met you... and this is crazy but... you ate my boyfriend... so call me maybe.&#34;
B00CI1TQHM|5.0|I was worried that Steve Strange might feel compelled to \\"update\\" the sound of Visage with this, their first release in what seems like forever.  Or that it was just another feeble attempt by an 80s icon to profit off the fond memories of his fans.<br /><br />I was thrilled that it was neither!  Strange not only wanted to keep things as they were, but actually made an effort to use equipment from their heyday (one article stated that nothing was used that was built after 1986!); and it is clear that a lot of effort went into making this as good (if not better) than any Visage production in the past.<br /><br />The result is an excellent album!  These songs will take you back, fond memories of when music was an art and musicians had talent.  Yeah, I know I sound like one of those old farts who can't let the 80s go; but why would I?  Music was considerably better than as proven by the fact that many of the artists from that era are still enjoying a strong following (check out the UK's 80s Rewind festivals if you don't believe me!).<br /><br />So what should you, the Visage fan, expect from this new album?  Classic Visage!  There is no reason to hesitate, it is definitely worth the money.  Every song is a danceable, rhythmic melody up to the original Visage standards.  It sounds more like it was made in 1983 instead of 2013.  Sure, Rusty, Midge and Billy may be missing; but the sound is still there and you honestly won't know the difference.  Five out of five stars, and I only hope we don't have to wait another 30 years for the next Visage release!
B00190KZUU|4.0|This moving was very entertaining, with a great message! My boyfriend and I watched it on a Friday night and were both happy with the movie choice!
B009AMAGQM|1.0|I can count on one hand the times I've wanted to quit a movie less than half way through. And I watch alot of movies. There are hardly enough words to describe the atrocious mess that is Beautiful Creatures. For the record, I've read the entire Beautiful Creatures series. It's a great, refreshing read. Its fantasty, adventure, drama and tragedy really appeals to a large audience. But I'm a realist. I know book adaptations are never perfect, and some miss the mark by alot. About ten minutes into this movie though, I wanted to press stop on the dvd player. FIrst, the entire cast is badly mis-cast. Everyone, from Ethan and Lena, to even Macon. And poor, poor Amma, one of the best characters in the series was reduced to a complete stranger. And where is Ethan's dad??? The whole thing is a travesty and frankly, it made me annoyed and frustrated that I even wasted time on it.<br /><br />Despite the length, the film felt very rushed. Explanations happen so quickly that someone who did not read the book may have some difficulty figuring out what the heck is going on. It is a hard book to adapt. Too much happens and it's not straightforward. It's not about a lonely girl who falls for a sparkly vampire. There is no comparison and actual effort has to be made. Important elements and plotlines have dissapeared, leaving everything a muddled mess. The entire film is a let-down. The southern 'accents' are terrible and even the enormously talented Jeremy Irons sounds off throughout the film. The only one who looks to be having any fun is Emma Thompson. The effects are boring and predictable, I didn't even notice the musical score and the costumes are over the top and out of place during certain scenes.<br /><br />If you have read the books and not watched the film yet, I advise you to stay far, far away. I wish I had.

140006922X|1.0|This book is garbage hate speech by a radical muslim with a radical agenda.<br />Therefore, naturally, the left will love it.<br />People with any sense will recognize it for the garbage that it is.
B0072GPPNC|4.0|A great film, no doubt, I was a little disappointed with it though. However, the ending is worth the wait. As a movie and a story it finishes very strongly.<br /><br />The scene where the German soldier and the Allied soldier try to free the horse from barb wire was reminiscent of the true life tale of WW I where almost all sides of the conflict put down their arms momentarily on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day of 1914 to exchange food, gifts, play football and participate in joint burials of their comrades recovered from no-man's-land during the two day truce. In that spirit, the movie faithfully depicts the story of WW I and all the modern horrors it introduced to the battlefield, machine guns, mustard gas and tanks and it tracks the descent of both the people and the horses from the honorable positions of cavalry-men and war horses to just cogs in a new, giant and cruel mechanized machine bent on crushing everything in its path.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Best book I've read in many months.  Excellent!  Explained an vivid detail how the discovery of one book, hundreds of years ago, changed the path the world was to take, led to the Renaissance, Enlightenment, various national revolutions, etc.
B00845MRKE|5.0|I got burnt some years ago buying the HD-DVD version of the 25th anniversary edition. Even though the edition was cool, the fact that I can no longer play the HD-DVD was a real bummer. Thankfully, the 30th anniversary edition gives me almost everything the HD-DVD edition had, except the cool Voigt-Kampff case and added the international release to my collection (in the 30th Anniversary edition). So all in all a damn good buy.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is my favorite Vince Flynn character.  This is a great novel about the corruption in and around Washington.  Having to deal with so many &#34;bad&#34; guys Mitch is almost killed.  There are many side stories and Flynn does a great job of putting the pieces together as the story unwinds.  It all comes down to a climactic end as good as Flynn always does.  Really enjoyed the book and highly recommend it to all Vince Flynn fans.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|I read this book after reading and enjoying Ender's Game. It was ok, but after finishing it, I decided I didn't need to read all five books in the series.
B009WUBERW|2.0|than watching an over 50 year old male, making noise and carrying on like an idiot. I turned it off after about 15 minutes. too muchviolence!
B008JEJOAG|5.0|My husband wanted something to wear around the campsite as well as in his kayak. He loves them. He wanted shoes that would breath but not leave his feet to open to the elements. For him they only fit in bare feet which is not an issue.
B00005RHGL|5.0|I love Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday and the rest of the crew of fantastic actors in this flick. The story line is good and Michael Biehn as the bad guy is awesome.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The more you watch, the more you want to watch.<br /><br />My favorite show since Eureka and X-Files.<br /><br />5 stars! Awesome!
B008B3MZNI|5.0|The picture quality and sound on this release are quite good, I didn't know what to expect after hearing how old the source tape was and that it needed painstaking restoration. Also appealing was that the show was a different show than the one recorded for the original Paris LP release. The addition of songs not on that release, especially a favorite of mine, \\"Child Of Vision\\", was a welcome surprise.<br /><br />I got into Supertramp relatively late, that being after they released \\"Breakfast In America\\", but that was 34 years ago (has it really been 34 years?). I saw them in Houston at the Summit for their \\"Famous Last Words\\" tour and also for the following \\"Brother Where You Bound?\\" tour, sans Roger Hodgson. I always preferred Rick Davies to Roger Hodgson and I am most likely in the minority there, but Supertramp works best with both of them. They traded songs and the juxtaposition of the two, with Rick being cynical and Roger being the exact opposite was what made the band and the music work. Another reason I liked Rick singing was because that usually put Roger on guitar and he was a very underrated guitar player.<br /><br />I only have two minor quibbles about this release. One, I didn't like the black screen between numbers, it ruined the flow of the concert. Two, Bob Siebenberg was barely shown, just briefly a couple of times. I realize that Rick & Roger were going to get the bulk of the attention and John Anthony Helliwell would be out front, but Bob's drumming is a big part of Supertramp and was certainly front and center at both shows that I attended. I did like that Dougie Thomson got some airtime on the bass, his playing was excellent for this show, as per usual.
1781162646|5.0|True to form Stephen King has done it again. The master storyteller spins a wonderful yarn and introduces us to a colorful cast of characters. I recommend this book to King fans and fans of pulp fiction.
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|My Kindle Kindle Fire fits in it perfectly.It is padded and compact.Zips nice and stores easy.Keeps my Kindle from getting scratched.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|My app keeps giving me a notification that it's an old version and needs to be updated. When I click on the notification it takes me online to the Google Play store. Why is there no Amazon app update? My news feed is all messed up &amp; friends' pictures almost never load. I barely use this anymore. Please update!!
B0030N3O8Y|3.0|I liked the subject matter and setting but this season fails to make one &#34;feel / care&#34; enough for the finale to have the impact that the series deserves.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing and addictive.  Can't stop playing!!!  I could play this game all day long.  Each new task is fun and I keep wanting to do more.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|A family classic, and we are very happy to have the Blu-ray/DVD combo since we have a DVD player in one room and a Blu-ray player in the other.
1781162646|5.0|A spooky amusement park ride, a broken hearted college student, a boy with psychic abilities and an older wiser narrator. Loved it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game. Many hours of fun finding<br />clues and getting out of the room and slightly exercising the brain.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good summer read, interesting voice, the protagonist  is interviewing survivors of a pandemic that turns it's victims into zombies &#34;Z &#34;s. the picture of a post Z war world, the origin of the outbreak, the reaction of individuals & governments are very compelling.  If you are looking for a novel that follows the movie starring abroad Pitt tou will be disappointed, it quite a different story
B0086QS7N2|5.0|You have to listen to this album a lot to figure it out.  It can be very depressing and sad, but the band is definitely making a statement about the futility of everything.  This album really shows Neil Peart's predisposition to trust in anything religious-like.  However, music-wise, I think this album may contain some of RUSH's best work.  It is not a classic rocker like Moving Pictures, but the complexities of this album will keep the listener constantly engaged.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is a powerful book. Rowling 's characters speak to you in flesh, blood and soul. Their torments and joys are yours, and you'll worry and pray for them between reading sessions. The Casual Vacancy tells a tale of gritty realities with wrenching compassion and humanity. With its depiction of the modern day distinctions between the lives of the middle class and the poor, it's likely to become a classic in the tradition of Charles Dickens. Although it deals with mature themes, it also belongs on high school required reading lists alongside The Catcher in the Rye and The Lord of the Flies.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|But I'm sure it works fine.  I just have never had a need for running Amazon MP3's through my phone, although I thought I would.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I think this book could open a few eyes into the familiarity of lives no matter how old or from where people may come.  Quite a captivating story I would recommend to both those of my generation as well as those much younger.  Giving anyone a chance to explain or to help could be insightful to every human being.  I enjoyed the story of the past as it entered into the present and brought people together.  Well written especially for my late night reads!
B0015O5XUM|5.0|Collection of old and new.  Sometimes you can't understand Van Morrison mumbling through his songs, but other times, he is very enjoyable.  Some really good tracks on this album.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Works great, easy to use! I would have rated it 5 stars except that once in a while and not often at all it hangs up. Other than that you won't regret having this app on your cell ! In fact I put it on my kindle fire hd also!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Amazing album. Really rocks out. Highly recommend this for anyone that wants a good jam out album way to much re
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I have played this on the computer and was thrilled that it could be on my Kindle.  It is fast paced and fun.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I can add notes from my mac, iPhone, or Kindle with no problems.  I can see my notes instantly on any device.  A &#34;must have,&#34; if you have things you want to remember.<br />I added a &#34;to do&#34; list for each month of the year, I can open that month and see birthday notices, annual renewals, and other issues that need to be handled.  You can add pictures and websites are stored and only a click away.<br />Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game that I think everyone should try!!!!!!!!!it's awesomeness.I love it you'll love it. Get the game today!!!!!!!!!!!
0064435962|5.0|This simple story identifies parts of the body, uses language that almost requires a child to answer, identifies different animals and encourages movement! A gem that I've read at my toddler's insistence over and over and over again!

B00821OX98|4.0|I am a sci-fi fan and have really enjoyed Falling Skies. It helps make my Prime subscription worth paying for.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Loved it. Lots of laughs and a good hearted musical. Characters and thier interactions with each other were hillarious. Worth the watch.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|it's cute and worth playing. If you want something to kill time, it's a good choice. And it is suitable for children.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is great. Really makes you think. I highly recommend this game to anyone. It can be so frustrating when you feel stuck and know you are missing a clue that you can not find. But boy does it get exciting when you make you escape.  It can be very addicting. I didn't want to put it down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The cast is amazing. Every character is well-developed and interesting. The plot and setting are from an earlier, supposedly gentler time, but there's enough real-world events to make it interesting.  What's not to love about British drama?
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It was cute and endearing. The characters are quite likable  I am looking forward to seeing Despicable 2 in the movies
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I expect that I will enjoy this  Denzel Washington is a favorite of mine and a consumate actor.  I loaned it to a friend and he loved it.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|It's Depeche Mode, need I say more.  The Godfathers of electronic music are back & this one is better than some of their previous releases since losing Andrew,
1476712042|1.0|THIS BOOK WAS DUMB!!!!<br /><br />Oh my, after reading all the reviews I was just ready to settle into a good fair book that would not have ridiculously unreal dialogues or lofty ideals. I wanted none of the cliche's I justed wanted to read and be transported to a new universe. Let me tell you not once did I leave earth or my bedside, cos I spent most of the time thinking \\"what rubbish\\"<br /><br />At first I thought it was because of my race, maybe I just needed to read a book about black people because this stuff was ridiculously unrealistic. But then come on with the come on this book is tedious and stupid and just when you think it's about to end you are only on page 108 and you are barely half way through. Honestly, not worth the stress... I could write better than this and my writing absolutely sucks.<br /><br />And no this does not appeal to twilight fans, I loved twilight. This is stupid porous rubbish. Time to find me a real book and purge myself of the memories of this rubbish
B00CL68BK2|5.0|At first we didn't know whether to laugh or not as the subject bipolar disorder.  As we watched, we became increasingly interested in it.  Soon we could not stop watching it.  The acting is superb.  When we finished, we both agreed that 'hey, that was a really good movie'.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is everything the Nexus Q should have been. At $35, this is an impulse buy that everyone should consider. It is cross platform, and turns every TV into a smart TV. Limited app support right now, but with HBO GO, Hulu, Vimeo, and Plex coming soon, it will only get better. I have one in every TV and I am looking forward to testing it in hotel TVs.
0802798225|5.0|Absolutely loved this book to pieces. It's my favorite book. Read it multiple times. Alex is so tantalizing. The chemistry Alex and Brittany have is great. This book is a must read! The suburb is a nice choice of setting and the characters are remarkable. Everything about this book is perfect! If you are into forbidden hot romances with bad boys, this book is the number one choice!
0761169253|3.0|As a fellow Texan---I'm still NOT going to<br />recommend this book. It has its &#34;chuckle&#34;-<br />moments, (a few) but not enough.  It has<br />some good insights--unless you're old<br />enough to have figured them out for yourself<br />20-25 years ago! It has more for the 22-40 yr.old<br />age group than for someone 50+.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Her work of art continues and the crossfire keeps you hooked. You will not be able to put this book down so keep your schedule clear. It only gets better with this 3rd book.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is one of the best art apps I have tried.  With choices for type of drawing/painting tools, different background, colors, etc...there are many unique ways to create high quality designs that you can save, publish or send to friends.  Simple enough for even very young children (my four year old granddaughter loved it) but also sophisticated and interesting for adults.  Whenever I'm in a public place and I start drawing with this app I always get lots of &quot;Can I try?&quot;s.  An added bonus is that there are no additional &quot;for more money you can get this feature&quot; questions.  I recommend this app to anyone who enjoys creating their own artwork.  FUN!
B004GXZ69W|3.0|My employer bought me this mouse, but it lacks anything super special.  I work on computers all day long and for 15 years and this mouse doesn't do anything for me but make it harder for me to use the computer with its crappy software that crashed on windows 7.  also gravity squishes my fingers together towards the bottom of the mouse.  just get a trackball mouse instead of this.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a very interesting and challenging game. I hope there will be a sequel because I burned right through the game in one sitting after I bought it! Completely addictive and I would recommend it to everyone! I just wish I hadn't caved and used clues when I was stumped! The game would have lasted longer!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I happened upon this app by accident. I was looking for animal apps my daughter could play and decided to let her try it. She fell in love with it so I decided to give it a try. It is really cute and the horse looks so lifelike! We are having fun playing together and would recommend this to anyone.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|After finding out about the humanizing of the characters (and seeing the god-awful prototype images) I was a skeptic about it at best. Like the Twilicorn issue, I avoided most conversations on it to avoid constant hate. This was the company that made MLP enjoyable in the first place, so they can definitely turn crap to gold.<br /><br />The film came, I saw, I enjoyed. I thoroughly enjoyed. The writing was as good as the show and the animation is still great. The human designs were not that bad. When the only criticism I could think of is \\"Why is Dash in a skirt and not shorts?\\" then the designs are doing something right. There will always be arguments about the \\"skinniness\\" of the girls affecting how children should view themselves. But they are modeled after ponies, and I don't see any girls walking on all fours snacking on daisies...<br /><br />The songs were...just okay really. Outside the VERY catchy \\"Equestria Girls\\" (aka. Helping Twilight Win the Crown) they were mostly there to provide a montage for things that needed to happen in the story, but would just stretch it out.<br /><br />There were some nice shout outs to the Brony fandom as well, from popular side characters getting a few lines to characters acting in regard to the fanon (Scoot's chicken dance was just hilarious). I also loved playing Guess Who with the background characters.<br /><br />The negative things I have to say are rather nitpicks than anything (timeframes, ease of Sunset's control, etc.) so I don't think they belong in a review.<br /><br />All in all, if you're a MLP fan, give it a watch. If you're not, it's still not a bad watch.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Who knew?  Geez, I'm sweating, but some of it is too scary.  Amazing this came from a female author. Will pep up your love life.
140006922X|5.0|And read other books while you're at it. Reza Aslan is extremely well spoken in this book and I feel it's quite narrow-minded to rate a book you haven't even read a 1 because you disagree with his background of faith. This guy is a scholar...a historian. He's spent more time reading the Bible and studying the culture of this time then most of you all have. He brings up scripture that is IN the Bible that causes the conclusions he has drawn. He's not making this stuff up. Believe it or not, most discredit can be done to the Bible simply by reading it closely (read it more closely if you don't understand what I'm saying and stop making it say what you want it to, or whatever gives you the most comfort or asserts your agenda) because it's riddled with contradictions. I'm sure you rate the Bible 5 stars though and you don't read that book either.<br /><br />The Bible commands you not to lie so if you want to serve your God, how about dont be dishonest and rate a book you haven't even opened.
0399162097|3.0|I'm stuck at 80 pages, because it's just been so hard to connect with this book. I've really had no desire to finish it. The pace is sloooooow, I almost envision the narrator's voice in a monotone. None of the characters so far are particularly likable - Rosemary seems without direction, her parents are oblivious, her brother is in his own self-centered world. Harlow is a major annoyance to me (who really puts up with people like this in real life?). Yes, the premise of the book is different, almost lofty, but there's also been a generally aimless, depressing overtone to the book so far - not really my cup of tea. I will say that there are some beautiful passages of writing, which may be the most redeeming quality of this book. But being able to put words together in a lyrical fashion isn't enough for me to see past the faults in pace, story, or characters.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I like the book.  It was a bit expected because it would have been weird that the main characters that had fallen so madley in love with each other were related.  It was a good twist and it worked well for the plot- but it had to end on a good note and it did.  I would let my teenage daughter read it.  (I read ALL books before she does to make sure they ok.)
B009RH9HDS|5.0|This case is very stylish and durable.  It was a perfect transaction and I couldn't be more pleased. I highly recommend!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|What is so appealling about a young woman falling in love with the forbidden and vice versa?  Everything I guess!  Essentially that what this book is about with a lot of action and OMG moments.  A coming of age story of sorts.
1400052181|5.0|This is the book assigned as the freshman read at UNC-G.  Read it to talk about with my daughter who will be a pre-med student.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Beautiful direction, camera work, and set design. Attention to detail. All the characters are believable and suitably deep. This cat and mouse game is one to watch.
B000A1SZ2Y|2.0|very very hard to use and get in focus.. it was not what i expected..it is just a large magnifying glass..
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book frequently had me laughing out loud. Jonas Jonasson is a master at weaving words together in whimsical ways.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Keeps your attention and is sentimental.  Great woman tear jerker.  Highly recommend this movie.  Love the actors and filming of this movie.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|Very good soundtrack.  There are some standout tracks, but the whole thing is very listenable.<br /><br />Zimmer is quickly becoming my favorite movie theme composer.  John Williams would be proud.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|i was really expecting more here due to all the hype but in the end it became a bit tiresome.
