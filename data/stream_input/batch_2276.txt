B003JTHXOK|5.0|I saw the movie trailer on television and, since i believe that the book is always better than the movie, I bought the book on my Kindle Fire.  The book is a must-read!!  I loved the book but have not yet seen the movie to compare the two.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Once again, Josh Groban doesn't disappoint and I loved this CD.  I didn't know that he had put out a new CD and was thrilled when I heard this and it's still playing in my head!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire.  Now, I never use my laptop computer.  I can now do everything I do on a daily basis on my Kindle.  This app is super friendly to use and easy to upload and repin posts.
0812415086|5.0|This is the true story of a young girl that did not survive the holocost but left a written memory of the things she suffered during the time that she lived.  No one should forget the murder of the millions of the Jewish people and the ones that survived their imprisonment.
096798467X|5.0|Kiko Denzer wants you to play in the mud, to express your artistic self and create a work of art that just happens to  bake the best bread you'll ever eat. My copy of the book has dog-eared pages, smudges and smears; it has been well-loved. I'm about to finish my first oven following the book's guidance. Other than buying some mason's sand and the firebrick, everything else has either been donated, scrounged, or dug out of the ground. The simple act of relying on cheap or free parts has taken a little more time, but has been a great experience and given me a sense of resourcefulness and accomplishment. And it's amazing how the same bread recipe baked in a earth oven can be so much better than that baked in a regular oven! I encourage you to buy the book, pour over it, enjoy the photographs, but by all means just go ahead, run out and get dirty.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Before the latest update I would have given a better review. Now it locks up my Kindle. When it does work, the interface is slow to respond and more complicated to use. Will be uninstalling.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Ordinarily, I don't write reviews here for stuff I bought elsewhere, but the rating here is too low due whining.  NOTE: this is a section for PRODUCT REVIEWS, complaints about Amazon's crap streaming service go to CUSTOMER SERVICE.  But, I digress.<br /><br />As many people have pointed out, this movie is not Tolkien's novel verbatim.  It's significantly altered.  The novel is a great adventure story, I read it about a decade ago.  However, it's not epic.  Lord of the Rings is Tolkien's epic story.  I guess, because Peter Jackson already did the epic trilogy, he wanted to make Tolkien's first novel novel into an epic trilogy as well.  So, there is a LOT of added content.  Unlike some people who have read the novel, I like the film.  It's different but good.  I saw it in a packed theater on Christmas and had to get the Blu-ray the day it was released. So, I bought it in a store instead of waiting for it to be shipped.  The Blu-ray is a great product, the picture is beautiful and the sound is great. The special features are nothing special, the production blogs put me to sleep.  Fortunately, I bought it for the film and not that stuff.  Ultraviolet is useless to me, so no comment on that.  Also, I didn't need the DVD but couldn't get the Blu-ray without it, so I gave it to my Dad.  Now he doesn't have to buy the movie (nice going, WB.)
B0098460O4|5.0|I found out about Jonathan and Charlotte while surfing YouTube, and was immediately blown away by their voices, the friendship, their story, etc.<br />While I agree that the music is at times loud to the point that it almost overpowers their voices, I don't think that it is a detriment to this CD. To see that these two are mere teens and have such amazing voices is simply astounding. The digital recordings do not do them justice. I have listened to their music on YouTube, GrooveShark, on iPods, etc, but only on the stereo at home played from CD can I fully enjoy their voices.<br />As for content, I like that there are a few cover versions of pop songs on here, e.g. Queen's Who Wants to Live Forever, Elton John's Your Song, which for a change were translated to Italian and arranged for orchestra and the Opera and Pop voices of Jonathan and Charlotte respectively.<br />The version of Andrea Bocelli & Celine Dion's \\"The Prayer\\" here is very nicely done. Boys Aloud's contribution is debatable, but again, Jonathan and Charlotte's voices are stellar.<br />Very moving, very touching, very much worth the purchase.
0307292096|5.0|I love the content of the book itself, and this is a great collector's item. I did accidentally bust the glue of the binding a bit while I was reading the book, but I wasn't being very gentle with it. I was bending the book cover backwards in order to keep the pages from flipping themselves and SNAP, the glue separated. The book binding still stayed together and looks fine, I just have to be a little bit more careful with it. I like that it has the box instead of a dust jacket and I literally squee'd when I discovered the ribbon bookmark.

B00BM9WM2C|2.0|I've been a Bon Jovi fan since '86 and will not think twice about buying their cd's. I'm one of the most critical fans of theirs. I didn't become a die-hard fan until the Release of the \\"these days\\" album (which I believe is their best album to date). That album showed their true talet musically and lyrically (it's their darkest album, but also came from the heart and experiences; which made the album so good). In addition, Richie's guitar is edgy & blues-ish and Davids keyboards are at his best. I never get tired of listening to that album (not to mention that it didn't get alot of radio play which keeps it non-dated. meaning, when you listen to the cd, it still doesn't sound as old as it is); which is how their albums should be. To be honest, I like most of the cd's from 1995-now the most. The music is more for their fans than radio and has a mature sound, but can still rock.<br /><br />The bad cd that they put out until now was Lost Highway (it was ok, but I never listen to it, to outside the box). This new cd (\\"What about now\\"), is a huge disappointment. Not at all what I was expecting, especially since the last album came out about three years ago and it was a pretty good album. Halfway through this new the cd, everything started to sound the same. Same tempo, same flow, and similar melodies. I felt that I should be in a coffee shop or elevator. It sounds to soft rock/adult contemporary. Where are the shout out anthems like of those past (\\"Have a nice day\\", \\"It's my life\\", and \\"Everyday.\\" Something is totally missing from this album (maybe it's Richie's drinking-LOL). It could be the producer that made this album so different; who knows (what were they thinking with this album).<br /><br />The tracks that I feel are the best on this cd/album are #1-3,8, 11, 13 (deluxe disc).<br /><br />With this said, I will always be a fan. Hopefully the next album will be better, heavier, and more from the heart & experiences (no politics) and some good shout-out anthems.<br/><br />Thanks for reading my review
B000G6R7B8|2.0|When I take the watch off and do not use for a few days, I have to re set the time, and date all over again.  Very disappointing
B000KITQK2|1.0|Worked OK for 2 shows (eats batteries like crazy), started making noise and was unusable. I contacted Behringer and was given an RMA number, and was told to send them the tracking number as soon as it was shipped and they would send a replacement right out. That was two months ago. Last I heard from them was they were out of stock(?!) and would check again next month, whatever that means. Sounds like I'm out the money and the item (it still actually worked as a DI box). If you can't afford to throw your money out the window, don't buy from this company.
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|Only one word can sum up this album: epic.<br /><br />I've been waiting for this release for awhile now, and it does not disappoint. The songs are well written and tell a compelling story. Definitely one of the best albums to come out for some time now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this at my son's request and he would quite probably play it until his battery died if I didn't make him turn it off.  He absolutely loves this game.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I love quartet music, and these guys are truely inspiring!! plus they have diversity, in language and genre. Their appeal goes beyond the norm!!!
B00A6L78YE|3.0|As Amazon review readers seem to only \\"find helpful\\" 4 & 5* reviews<br />I will start with the good news--here is a band of uncommon talent,<br />wit and irreverence.<br />  As an old-timer that still loves new music I am<br />glad to see a return to Psych/Garage Rock. Bands like the Black Angels,<br />The Black Keys, Jonathon Wilson etc. are making music that holds up to their 60s and 70s predecessors. Foxygen (lame name for a band--how about The Al Gore Rhythms, or The El Greco Legs or something less trite) on the other hand--when  not channeling say the Stones or Dylan seem to not be able to<br />come up with anything meaningful on their own. Take the Dylanesque song<br />No Destruction, if you don't listen to the lyrics it is a brilliant capturing<br />of early Bob at his most cool and sarcastic--but upon listening to the<br />lyrics one finds that they make no sense on a logical, poetic or associative<br />level. That may be the point, but it is pointless none the less-- it is<br />either that the writer does not really understand BD or is incapable of<br />writing on his level. On Blue Mountain channels some great<br />early Stones singles but as the song progresses it becomes disjointed and<br />loses focus, as if they were trying to mash up styles like Beck but can't<br />quite pull it off with Beck's panache.  By the end of the CD I am wincing at how annoying this band is. What a waste of talent, perhaps when they mature enough to realize that every little stoned thought in their heads is not genius and that it takes more than talent to come up with something brilliant they will be a band worth listening to. I do predict though that they will become the \\"darlings\\" of stoned/drunk college partiers.
B00466H3F4|5.0|I love the movie and the disc is in excellent condition. I am so happy that I did not have to buy all sorts of versions just to get the one I wanted, Blu Ray.

B00AZM7IQC|5.0|It reaches far beyond my expectations. James Camerons involvement brings a level of professionalism to the cinematography and lighting that has never been seen in other Cirque videos. The acts are great but the giant canting floor near the middle is simply amazing. The plot is interesting but the acts are simply over the top, cream of the crop. The sound track has a wonderful Beatles section near the middle. I really kept kicking myself for not seeing this on the big screen but it was still wonderful if you can view it in an environment where you can appreciate the sound and visuals of this wonderful piece of art.

B004H4XL7E|5.0|I think I have practiced this method at a basic level most of my adult life. I think most people probable do. However, I never thought of it as a practical, learnable method. This book has wonderfully brought it together, brought foward as a useable, repeatable tool. Tool is probably the wrong word. \\"Game\\" as the author says. I highly recomend this book to anyone.

B0024Y9EYS|4.0|I never watched when it was on TV, I don't know why not since I loved the Terminator films.  The show does do a good job, so far I'm in episode 4 only so it's still early.  John is still annoying at this point though.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|I hate writing reviews for music. I'm not a critic. I like what I like and usually can't tell you why. I recommend seeing the movie about this singer/songwriter, Searching for Sugar Man. You'll either love his music or not, but you won't leave the movie without being moved by his life story and his influence in South Africa. Amazing. Worth buying.
B00113N6KQ|5.0|I love this movie gun fights everywhere and most deaths by carrots in a movie. Just an awesome movie... love it
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This movie is great so far! I haven't finished watching the whole movie but by what I have seen so far the movie is great. I have only watched the movie in 3D which makes the movie 100 times better. There are some nice 3D effects as well. I would highly recommend this movie, I can't wait to finish it and see what becomes of their adventure.
006123141X|5.0|I love these Sigma Force novels, even though there are a few spelling, factual, and grammar errors in each one. In fact, I make it into a &#34;Where's Waldo?&#34; style hunt. I know it will be only a matter of time, each time I pick up one of these books, before I come across something erroneous.<br /><br />But seriously, these are great f***ing books. The fact that they're all based on actual historic and scientific research make them awesome.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I received this DVD very fast and was tickled to get it since I'm considering tickets to this Broadway show in NYC. The delivery was great and fast however, the movie itself, I thought was pretty boring.... :-)  Of course, that had nothing to do with the seller who was great!
0920668372|5.0|Love this book. The condition was excellent..All families should own a copy of this book. I read it to all three of my children, who are grown now. They still love this book and reads it to theirs.

B000JML7EC|4.0|Had never actually read this book, and being a classic, and with my love of sailing, seemed somewhat mandatory. Fun to read some old english and quality literature. Good times reading this. Interesting plot twists and just a good read. Checking this one off my list now. :-)
B0083ZRAJS|1.0|Thank you I love  your books Lyman Frank Baum  your friend and reader Mariana thank you again send me more
B0045NDVFE|4.0|Good, kind of traditional country music. Good harmony, lyrics, and accompaniment. (Outstanding fiddle and mandolin!) &#34;If I Die Young&#34; is worth the price of the whole album, but also includes highlights: &#34;You Lie,&#34; &#34;Hip to My Heart,&#34; &#34;All Your Life.&#34; In truth, every song on here is really excellent. Hope to hear more from this band.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|The story and the characters have no substance. It is a waste of time. EYou wold expect that something happened( from the many flashbacks) and it will be reveals towards the end but actually it is quit boring.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is a sweet story. Some people want more time, some are ready to end it. This is a story that brings the question of what is really important, time or love. The story is a nice in and of itself but like a parable, it has a greater meaning.
B006TVQU6C|5.0|For a case with two good quality fans (I added a third), this is a great case.  Did my own build and I'm very happy with this case.  Five stars even tho it is a bit smallish inside, but I knew that before I bought it.

B00AFEXRME|5.0|Enjoyed the movie<br />I am sure it is an accurate portrayal of some pilots and their associates<br />I would reccomend this movie to everybody who likes good movies.
1616550414|5.0|Very durable, big book.  It has the quality of a professional highschool year book.  Great for anyone who loves video games and anyone who's loved the Zelda franchise.  Anyone born in the 80's or after will appreciate this.  Also would be a great gift idea for anyone who loves to draw, color, or just loves to see other people's works of art.  Already I've seen other books come out similar to this one for other popular video games.  I suspect this to be a popular trend.
1451695195|3.0|I expected more. I don't doubt heaven I just expected more description in the book.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who wants to massage his gray matter a bit.
B000GWE44U|5.0|This film is what made Jack Nicholson a household name.  It also improved Stephen King's popularity as an author after other classics like Carrie and Salem's Lot.  Growing up this was one of the films my mother always told me I had to put back because it was just 'too much' for a child.  The zombie and vampire movies were ok though, &#34;those were obviously fake monsters&#34;.  If you've never watched this film please keep in mind the time it came out - you will appreciate it that much more.  Cussing, nudity, graphic violence, all big taboo things to see on one film during that era of movies.  Here's Johnny!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'd have no problem recommending this to those who like a mix of social commentary housed in a fantasy sort of adventure.  Those who reject futuristic fantasy types of literature might tolerate it for the adventure, which is quite good.  This is the kind of book I like, and my wife refuses to even try to read.  Books can be like that!  It is a good story, and I haven't seen the movie, but can see how the thesis could make a great visual story, so will check movie out one of these days, even though I always like the books better than the movies.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|As an author myself, all I can say is WOW! to Martel's masterpiece. What a master storyteller! This book is as much about the power of storytelling as it is about Pi and his life in India and his survival on the ocean. A must read of amazing literary fiction.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Another funny Greg hefley book that I really enjoyed because it was entertaining and fun. I would definitely recommend this book.
0756404746|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss, you are Awesome.<br /><br />There's so much good about this book I don't really know where to begin. The story, the characters and the magic-system is just really really good.<br /><br />That's pretty much it, 5 stars easily, would recommend to anyone!
0143118706|5.0|after reading Eat, Pray, Love.....i so liked the author and her style, i found she had written a follow-up book, Committed.  It was a natural, a continuing of her lifestory and events.  While the subject of marriage had been something i'd wanted to explore more, this was a beginning, a more familiar beginning..so far, it has not disappointed.  I love her style of writing and i find the information she has reported here in this book on marriage interesting, enlightening.<br /><br />the shipment of the book by the vendor was VERY prompt and book was in good condition.<br /><br />one thing though, and this is not just particular to Amazon.....if the book costs less than the shipping, some other arrangements should be made....

B0098460O4|4.0|They sound wonderful together on this recording. The only problem I had was that on some cuts the orchestra drowned out these spectacular voices.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Just a short review, mainly to add another 5 stars to this book!<br /><br />In many ways, this novella reminded me of Patrick Rothfuss and his brilliant Kingkiller Chronicles. A decent compliment if you ask me.<br /><br />It is nicely paced and the main protagonist is likable as well as believeable.<br /><br />Would recommend to just about anyone!
0061906220|5.0|My students loved the book & the song. They were singing it the rest of the day. The ability to download the song was great!
B002U3CBZM|1.0|I've seen a lot of people endorse this title, so been tempted for a while to read it. When finally my brother recommended it, I gave in.<br /><br />First off, I don't like first-person storytelling. As long as there is only one viewpoint, the book immediately tells you the narrator will survive until the end. Now, I don't mind the main protagonist surviving 'til the end, but I prefer to remain ignorant.<br /><br />Also, I don't mind curse-words, sex-scenes, viceral violence and drug-abuse - in my opinion, they tend to add realism to many extraordinary tales. However, when used excessively, I become bored.<br /><br />Now, over to the story.. SPOILERS BELOW.<br /><br />The book starts off with the main protagonist watching his lover/girlfriend/wife getting shot and killed right in front of him, then shortly thereafter, he's shot and killed himself. In this universe, you don't necessarily die when your body dies, your mind can be stored digitally. This is often used as punishment for criminals, their minds being suspended - which is also the case for our main protagonist, he's to serve some 120 years for past crimes or some such.<br /><br />During the book, we're given a couple snippets of information regarding the narrator's past - it seems he's former military, turned super-agent, who also happens to live slightly on the wrong side of the law.<br /><br />In subjective time, Mr. Kovacs is re-sleeved (given a new body) immediately after having been killed - normally, this is a traumatic experience, requiring several days/weeks (?) of recuperation. However, Mr. Kovacs's provider-of-a-new-body, demands his attention without any delay. It seems Mr. Kovacs has been hired by a very rich and powerful man to investigate a suicide, which must be solved as quickly as possible. In return for his efforts, his past crimes will be erased and he'll be a free man - hell, he'll even be paid handsomely. Oh, and he was also told to do this covertly, not to attract too much attention. With his super-agent training, that shouldn't be too much of a challenge..?<br /><br />So, he starts investigating, which is where things start to fall apart for me.<br /><br />Mr. Kovacs heads over to a local cathouse, to pursue certain clues he's attained. The witness he's after, is a prostitute, who, when he meets, is naked and quite attentive. Luckily, our protagonist has the ability to control his body, so he's not tempted by her viles. Later in the book, he uses yet another ability to resist temptation. Seems our Mr. Kovacs is a skilled and highly trained man. Which leads me to the following.<br /><br />When returning to his hotel room, Mr. Kovacs is surprised to find his employer's wife already there, in his room. They sit down and chat, which fairly quickly leads to several hours of sex (which happens to be described over the next 6-7 pages...). Now all of a sudden our wonder-agent-super-military-ex-con can't resist. He could resist a naked prostitute, but couldn't resist his EMPLOYER's wife.... Right... That sounds so dumb I'm aggravated by it. But I continued reading.<br /><br />So, after having screwed his employer's wife, which inevitably places him in a very weak spot, giving her power over him (and keep in mind, Mr. Kovacs is supposed to be former-military-turned-super-agent). But anyway, he decides to go shopping for clothes, to better fit in with the locals. He then goes on to spend several pages telling us how shopping is an art-form he learned from a female-colleague in the military.. I HATE shopping. Shopping as an art-form? Jesus H. Christ.<br /><br />Now, as a super-agent, Mr. Kovacs was taught how to dodge bullets.............. The instructor showed him how to do this, by giving a trained and experienced soldier a rifle, which she instructed said soldier to shoot her with, from a couple meters distance. She (the instructor) dodged the bullet, ran towards the soldier and disarmed him, then knocked him down............................. Dumb shit like that is something I find extremely hard to swallow.<br /><br />With his super-duper training, Mr. Kovacs decides to go on a rampage (the covert super-agent indeed....), killing some people who tortured him. Not surprisingly, he kills off a whole bunch of people, several of them armed and supposedly trained, without even a damned scratch. As an added bonus, Mr. Kovacs had just been tortured, but even in his weakened state, was able to do it all effortlessly. Immediately after, he easily evades the police, and then sits down to have a cup of tea with his employer.<br /><br />I was 45% done with the book when I stopped reading. This is some of the dumbest piece of crap I've read in several years, and can not recommend it to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A deceptively simple way to challenge & exercise the mind. And fill that black hole of time in the waiting room.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I have had my case now for about two months and it seems to protect the phone well enough.  I did experience the door that protects the plug-in area to break off; I should have probably returned the product but didn't want to go through the hastle and leave my phone without some protection.  The case muffles the speaker when it is on so I can listen but can't talk to participate in conference calls.
B002B55XGI|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I read it in two days.  The Seals are amazing. One of the most interesting books I have ever read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Liked it. I have a lot of fun playing this. My girl really enjoyed it too. Now I'm putting random carp so I can get pas  the stupid mom.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very interesting game my daughter and I both enjoy playing quite entertaining and. Teaches the importance of caring for a horse and how time consuming it is.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|The game is okay but when u get to a higher level and have a bigger park you tend to crash. Plus the aquatic park seems smaller than the land park. All in all its worth getting the game just needs some work.
0553229680|5.0|I've always been into short sci-fi novels, and this is definitely one of my favorites. It's a tale of how life could be if humans were to ever colonize Mars. Of course, as with any (good) sci-fi novel, there is an underlying message and theme to the Martian Chronicles. Perhaps the largest theme is that of colonization. It shows how the [Martians] are affected, but also the colonizers and the land.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Good  but the ending could have been more informative as to the fate of the kids and the  origin  and  fate of the creature.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Basic calculator easy to use and I can appreciate that. You can't beat it for free. I would recommend it!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Talk about sexy, A story of learning to trust as well as an all round love story makes you cry and laugh and wish you could find your own Christian Gray.

B008NABUU8|3.0|If they'd speed up the way it loads I would give it a 5 star rating other than that I don't have any complaints about the app. :)
B00005UWMX|1.0|Well, I tried to cancel this item before shipment, because after reading the comments on not being able to play this film in this region, I knew I had made a mistake.I could have sent it back but a family member had opened it before I got home.  So I`m out a few bucks.  Don`t order anything listed as Region 2.
0307895475|5.0|A great addition to a Skyrim addicted household - this contains so much information that fills in knowledge gaps.  The maps are very useful - particularly those of dungeons and cave systems - no more wandering around in circles! You can use it as much or as little as you like, but very useful and highly recommended.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Not sure what to feel about the last 2 chapters. Very descriptive and detailed book, read as if you were alive with the characters.
B009GEYX5E|1.0|Who sells expired film?<br />This company!<br />Look elsewhere for film!!!<br />Picture comes out brown and dark no matter the setting or lighting
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The grands like playing or watching this game being played.Was a great distraction on grammas Kindle Fire while on a road trip.
B000PMG16U|4.0|These movies are classic.  However, they need to be purchased one at a time.  also, the original trilogy should be offered instead of just offering it in  a 6 pack set.
B000Q67876|5.0|This movie needs 6 stars.  This movie does no wrong.  It has a great and interesting story, it's directing delivers powerful emotions that will suck you in.  You will feel the pain joy distress and true happiness during this movie.  The acting in it is all far above par, some of the actors giving their best performances in their life.  It looks great on blueray, and I don't even have to look at the other comments before posting this to know its gonna be nothing but tons of 5s.<br /><br />1994 was an amazing year for movies.  It's sad that this one didn't win best picture (it should of imo), but there was definitely some stiff competition.  This is easily as good a movie as forest gump (in my opinion better), and if you don't own it, you should fix that RIGHT NOW.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|first season kept me busy for 12 hours and when I am done with the 2nd book I will watch these. maybe save them for a rainy day.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I cannot BELIEVE amazon is doing this. I watched about 2/3 of this movie last night and was going to finish the rest of it tonight but no longer can because for some reason it's \\"unavailable.\\" I'm very disappointed and hope I can get some type of refund. This is horrible Amazon.
B006M4F67A|5.0|These are fun to play.  I love the variety of layouts.  I like the challenge. I just wish they were a little larger.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Not a bad start for Lee Child. If I didn't know any better I'd say he has the potential to be a pretty good action series writer. Jack Reacher an American super-hero created by an Englishman.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|This book was all over the place. I forced myself to read it because I bought it and didn't want to waste money. Not as good as everyone says. Bad ending.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|My son loves this, and honestly, so do I. This is the first time I've ever bothered to write a review of an app, and one of very few times I've paid to upgrade to the full version of something. These folks really need to be encouraged to do more cool stuff like this. Well done.
B007TK77QE|5.0|It is a little verbose at times, but I really enjoyed the book. I loved some characters and hated others. Definately a sign of a story that draws you in.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|As a long-time guitar player, it's mandatory for me to pick up any Hendrix material.  It's worth the cost of the CD to pick up a new lick or two.  However, that is the only reason to buy this CD.  You have to be a technical player or a Hendrix lover to appreciate this CD.  Most of it sounds like scratch versions, out-takes and alternate versions of other Hendrix material.  It's interesting from that point of view to listen to how some of Hendrix songs evolved musically and lyrically through different versions.<br /><br />This would be a poor introduction to Hendrix if you were not familiar with him.  The songs are weak, but there are moments of guitar brilliance.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|graphics were great, story line was good. price was a bit more than I usually like to spend but I enjoyed the game.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I need to find out how to rectify this issue/problem or I will not be purchasing anymore videos from Amazon to watch with my Prime account.  What a rip off for the price I paid.  My son in law got to watch within the first few hours of purchase but I came back to finish it the next day and it was not available.  I should have had ample time to view but did not receive it.  Unfair, I know for me to rate the product this way.  What I did see was very slow pace and boring for me.  I wanted to see it through because I am certain there is much about it that is amazing but I am now put off on two counts.  My son in law found it slowed paced and not very interesting.
B007FZ7QAA|5.0|I bought this for my GRANDDAUGHTER..and by the way..this CLEAN  version ain't exactly what I thought CLEAN would be..anyhow, I ended up LOVING this for MYSELF...I don't generally buy YOUNG ARTISTS' music..but, this young cat can sing..and write...and, I got a good PRICE on this compared to what it costs in stores...
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is fun to play and hard to put down. I keep thinking &quot;just one more time, just one more time&quot; and then two hours later....
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love John Grisham....great book, great story line. I'd recommend this to anybody who is a John Grisham fan. It will not disappoint.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|We have all heard it before from Dawkins, but it is a pleasure to read it again since he is a master story teller and a major intellect. This is a book for young people who want to learn something about reality. It is better than having a course in physics, chemistry and biology.
B008N9AASC|3.0|Unfortunatelly this beautiful movie is unable to watch on DVD in Europe because of its format (NTSC), only on laptop.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Great album by Rod Stewart.  Recommend this to anyone who is a Rod Stewart fan or anyone who would like some great Christmas tunes.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Takes a bit of getting used to so that the lines meet up and the cutter doesn't slip, but once you get the hang of it, the cutter works very well. I probably can cut a few hundred bottles before the plastic triangle comes unglued from the aluminum bar and the whole unit kind of starts losing shape. So I just order a new one after a few months and i'm good to go. I haven't found an easier solution to cutting bottles, short of a very expensive band saw....
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Many of us may recall this story, and in particular when the news broke about Jaycee Dugard being found after 18 years lost.  And, then there was the story in People magazine which gave us a few details about her life.  Now, this book written by Jaycee details the life she was forced to lead with Phillip and Nancy Garrido.  What I find quite incredible is how well the story is written by a young woman who had her formal education interrupted at the age of 11.  Especially moving, and showing a level of maturity and thought beyond her years, are the sections of her diary, written during her captivity, which were inserted into the book.  There is wisdom in those sections which many an adult should heed.<br /><br />The story is difficult.  What this young woman had to endure at the hands of these people is beyond imagination.  And, also, how in some respects there were opportunities for her to be found, but the authorities did not take the oppotunity to search beyond the surface.  Whatever possessed Phillip Garrido to take Jaycee and her daughters to his parole officer's office that day is a mystery.  Perhaps he simply was tired of living the lie and wanted the truth to come out.  But, thankfully it happened so that Jaycee and her daugthers could live a life beyond confinement.  And, Jaycee was also very fortunate in the help provided both she and her family from the authorities, therapists and others to help her reunite with her family and back into the real world.<br /><br />The story shows Jaycee to be a woman of very strong character and determination.  She is a remarkable young woman to have endured and survived what was forced upon her.<br /><br />Read this book to learn about a remarkable young woman with a will to survive.  There are lessons for all contained within this story.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Have been curious about this show for awhile. Was confusing it with The Wire in my mind when I turned it on though and was pleasantly surprised. Have only watched the pilot so far but that was enough to pull me in. Production values seemed a little lo-fi but maybe that improved in later seasons...
B008XBCJ34|5.0|A+ movie and vendor. Great service and price. This is a real good deal for a 3D Blu Ray movie.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I wish I could get a refund. It just loads then says &quot;Doodle God has stopped&quot;. It really is a fun game and I'll try to give it extra Chances. So I'll give it 3 stars for being really fun.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Great game! Would definitely recommend to anyone.  It is so much better without the ads always being in the way.
1616550414|5.0|This book is amazing.. I really had no idea the Zelda story could beput togather like in hyrule historia. This is a must have item for any hardcore Zelda fan
B008476HBM|5.0|To put it simply, it's a timeless relatable story that everyone should read. I've also been on a mission to watch every adaptation. So far, the 2005 movie version, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, and Lost in Austen have been my favorites. I recommend them all.
B005M68S4W|4.0|Several years ago, I reviewed the first \\"Duets\\" album recorded by Tony Bennett, essentially concluding that Tony Bennett performed his part of the \\"duet\\" at 5-star level, but for the rest of the various singers on the album, it was \\"hit or miss.\\"  Pretty much the same holds true here.  There is no doubt why the Duets albums were recorded:  to use Tony Bennett's star power as one of the last reigning crooners of the Greatest Generation--and one of the very best at that--to rub off onto to some pop artists, some of whom are quite popular in their own right, but who have not quite reached the long-life star power potential of a guy like Tony Bennett.  Bennett, as I noted in my review of the first Duets album, could cruise through these tunes with aplomb--most he has sung for years--and, besides, he has nothing about his singing that he has to prove to anyone.  In short, he is that star player of the ball team, still, despite his age, nearly at the top of his game, and all the younger players are still playing catch-up.  And, in many places, it shows.<br /><br />A truly successful duet requires two things: enough match of musical ability to keep the lesser talent from being completely embarrassed, and a \\"connection\\" between the singers such that they can both complement and meld their styles during a song.  Sadly, those magic moments are largely absent here--no fault of Mr. Bennett.  For brevity, it is easier to point out the match-ups that really do work.  It's obvious from the opening bar that k. d. lang and Bennett are on the same wavelength.  Not surprising, they have worked together before and obviously have great musical respect for one another.  Their pairing on the Duets II to sing \\"Blue Velvet\\" (though not one of my favorite tunes) is the best true duet on the album.<br /><br />Second best on my short list--and a pleasant surprise--was Bennett's very pleasing duet on a very pleasant tune, \\"Speak Low,\\" with Norah Jones.  Of course, Jones has already proved thatshe has some good jazz chops, but here she lays down one of her best performances.  A note about the orchestra and arrangements on this album--they are first-rate (no surprise there when Tony Bennett is involved) and the tight, but lightly swinging arrangement on \\"Speak Low\\" really adds to the mood.<br /><br />Third best on my list is Bennett's pairing with Faith Hill.  While I'm not a big fan of Hill's popular singing, she does have some formidable singing chops, enough to mostly keep pace with Bennett on \\"The Way You Look Tonight.\\"  They obviously \\"connect\\" on the tune, as well.<br /><br />Not on my list of great tunes on this album is \\"Body and Soul\\" with Amy Winehouse, but it deserves comment.  Unfortunately, Amy Winehouse pretty much squandered a blossoming talent in hard living and drugs--and the effects show clearly on her duet here.  As was often the case, her singing could seem \\"foggy\\" and affected.  During \\"Body and Soul,\\" Winehouse's singing roamed from lucid, on-key, and on-pitch to slurry and almost sophomoric.  Some have compared Winehouse's tragic life and her singing to that of Billy Holiday's.  The common theme was that both suffered the ravages of substance abuse.  The difference was the Holiday, even at her worst moments, had enough raw talent and gut determination to pull off, at worst, an acceptable performance, and often an excellent performance despite her addictions and demons.  Amy Winehouse was just not up to that task, and here her duet with Bennett, save for a few lucid moments during an iconic jazz ballad being sung with an iconic jazz master in Tony Bennett, just falls short.  A telling recording from a now fallen singer who might have had a bright future.  Knowing that makes this recording of \\"Body and Soul\\" a moving performance.<br /><br />I give \\"Duets II\\" 4 stars on the amazing strength of Tony Bennett's singing (and swinging) ability for a man in his 80's.  Whatever he's drinkin', I want some of it!  As for the other singers, enjoylang, Jones, and Hill, and just concentrate on Bennett during the rest of the tunes with the others.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This  game is SOOO much fun! In the game you can transport to the dark forest or whimsee woods, which I love cause I don't get bored of looking at the same background. It is a very challenging game but yet not impossible to play unlike other games. Plus it's pretty cheap. So ya I recommend this! :)
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Ordered the movie for rental via Amazon instant video. Now the movie is suddenly unavailable within my 48 hour rental period. No place to ask for refund. Apparently, after searching the web, a movie can be unavailable suddenly due to licensing agreements. So don't rent via Amazon instant video, unless you want to lose money.
B002N14GP4|5.0|It was really awsome!!!!!! It was really mysterious and love that every scene has a climax like whats gona happen next
B0086700CM|3.0|I like this game its fun but after a wile It gets really borring cuz all u do is turn slide jump and collect coins
B00005LOUP|5.0|Jim Carrey in the rest of the cast did a wonderful job in bringing this doctor Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas to a live action classic it's just a wonderful movie to watch with the whole family if you love How the Grinch Stole Christmas the animated version by Doctor Seuss you will love this Jim Carrey version did splendid job with the special  makeup its it's just wonderful
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I really. Really like this book. At first It seemed to me a bit dark and depressing, but as I continue reading I start to really like it, the narrative is soo good that you can trully co ect with mia and feel what she is feeli g! I totally recommend it for audiences 14 and on
1934451320|5.0|OMG! Haanel is an amazing writer.  He collected data, information, knowledge and other writings/books and brought it together in one book.  I was going through so much.  23 yrs. old, my mom suddenly passed while i was in grad school, I had no direction in life, I found out my boyfriend was (secretly) married to woman in another state, I was fired because I was too Black, the university i attended was pressing me to sue my job, so MANY things going on at ONE time! I wanted to die.<br /><br />I ran across this book while searching for Life's true meaning.  After reading the first page, I was hooked.  Every page read, my life started changing for the better.  I began to apply all of the principles to every aspect of my life and they worked, instantly.  First, I had to force-feed myself because I was so stubborn but then it became routine.  Two years later, my life is PERFECTLY PERFECT!  This book saved my life!
B009KEN87O|5.0|It's a great game it's sweet for people who were living when stuff like this came out  BUY IT  NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002HFP0QU|4.0|Recipient was very pleased with CD. Exactly what was wanted. Would use  this provider again. Very good service as expected.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover totally blew my mind with Hopeless. I had no idea what i was getting myself into when I started reading this book. I only knew that I loved her writing style and needed to read more by her!<br /><br />Hopeless was an absolutely beautiful story...I am still reeling from it, trying to form coherent sentences! :)<br /><br />\\"I don't know how to describe it. When I looked at him, I never wanted to stop. I could have stared at him all day. But then when he looked back at me, it freaked me out.\\"-Hopeless<br /><br />Holder and Sky...such a sweet story between the 2 of them. The struggles that they have overcome and still need overcome are huge. Just when you think you know where this story is leading, it surprises you.<br /><br />\\"Not everything is going to go my way and not everyone gets a happily ever after. Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\\"- Hopeless<br /><br />Heart warming and gut wrenching all at the same time. You feel everything these characters feel, you root for them and cry for them, I laughed at their quirkiness and one ego shattering text messages. I even found myself shaking it worked me up that much.<br />This \\"hopeless\\" boy and this lost girl are quite the pair.<br /><br />\\"Live. If you mix up the letters in the words like and love, you get live. You can use that word.\\" \\"I live you Sky, he says against my lips. I live you so much.\\"- Hopeless<br /><br />You have to read this story...You have to. There is no way around it, it is just that good!!<br /><br />\\"The only thing that matters to me with you are the forevers.\\"-Hopeless
B0076DELIG|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Michael Connelly and the Harry Bosch character but for the first time I was disappointed. The story never really \\"took off\\" for me. It was a slow read and I wasn't surprised by the ending at all. Not what I expected.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great you could play this every day You would be crazy not to get this. Subway surfers is a great game.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Every relationship has ups and downs, but not like Eva and Gideon. Eva's feelings flow right into you enough to cherish and resent Gideon the way she does. I'm hoping for more tenderness in the next book.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Very touching and romantic.  Kristin Scott Thomas to die for!  Hmmm, 10 more words.  A love quadrangle, horse, girl, mom, Robert Redford.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Amazing book that you can never take your eyes off of, very detailed writing that is very easily relate able
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a GREAT game!  The graphics are very clear. I am ADDICTED!  Please make more games for kindle like this one! This makes you feel like your on a laptop.<br />If you enjoy hidden object games, this is what your looking for
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I really like the fact that this album showcases Peter Gene Hernandez's musical / vocal talent without a lot of guest appearances. He has been very, very impressive to me. I can hear the range of influences in his work, from Michael Jackson to Phil Collins - and just love the fact that Bruno Mars stands out from other contemporaries.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This is a good mic, but it won't plug directly into the iPhone 4 or 5 because that requires a 4 conductor connector. Even with an adapter, though, this mic's impedance is too high to provide sufficient level for the iPhone. I ended up having to run it through a mixer. However, Audiotechnica makes a similar lapel mic with the correct connector and a lower impedance that works great with the iPhone. You can find it by searching the web for \\"Audiotechnica lapel mic for iPhone 5.\\" As of this writing it is not available through Amazon. It costs about 5 times what this mic does, but is worth the price given the ease of use and great audio results. And that one doesn't even require a battery.
B00A7ZXDLQ|3.0|Rihanna has been very impressive up to this album. It's simply ok - nothing that gives me goosebumps. Maybe next album.
B000FA675C|5.0|As always an awesome read the first time and the second. The book propels the reader Into the world of medieval mysteries and knights Templar. Masonic symbols that are familiar mix with Roman Catholic secret societies and the world of elite art historians. Add a touch of suspense aided and abetted by a chase by the French police and you are dear reader sucked into the books premise. I can highly recommend this book. I have a paperback copy as well that passed through many hands. Enjoy
1451627297|5.0|I bought this book because my aunt loved it and I saw how popular it was.  This was a great read, long but provided me with several weeks of entertainment.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|This  book was amazing. Definitely better than the movie. Ready for Catching Fire! I hope it is<br />as good as this one.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I love Shawshank Redemption. I ordered this for my SO who had never seen it before. He's a critic and loved it as much as I did.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This movie was awesome for a leadership debrief on teamwork and knowing when to rest and go to war...Time for Peace and Time for War was our leadership theme...a must see movie in that respect...that is why we used it...
0792839749|5.0|Get this for your grand kids. You've forgotten it's charm, but is a very fun movie to share with kids.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|In portrait mode the lines does not automatically go to the next line. A bit annoying. Otherwise the app is just perfect.
0525953728|5.0|This was a gift, so I can't say too much about it. No complaints. Not sure it's been read yet.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|I bought this movie for two reasons:<br />1. 3D<br />2. Need a movie to watch with the kids.<br /><br />The 3D was great! It wasn't abused like in some movies where they push 3D for the sole sake of selling the movie.  The storytelling was decent and the acting was reasonably done.<br /><br />I don't give it 5 stars because I don't think it will become a children's classic as many other believe.  However, I do believe it is worth watching and owning.  The characters have unique personalities and provide for an interesting combination. I personally found Santa Claus a little too unconventional. Alec Baldwin made him far more aggressive than I believe Santa would ever be.. but perhaps I am guilty of years of cultural indoctrination.  Regardless, I still found Santa amusing and worth watching.<br /><br />I also liked that the movie was not too scary. If you are looking for a &#34;scary&#34; children's reference, I would say Disney’s, &#34;The Black Cauldron&#34; was far more foreboding. I would rate the level of creepiness from the villain (The Boogie Man) as mild. I found other characters such as Cruella de Vil and the witch from Snow White far scarier.
B00005LK94|5.0|This is great for kids, but I've watched it a few times and loved it every time. Nothing in here you need to worry about your grand kids seeing. A very fresh story.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Continues the useful insights of his previous books with a fresh perspective on variability and its implications.  Brainy, opinionated and sometimes obtuse, a must read for any 'philosophic mind'.
1451695195|5.0|I bought this as a gift so I haven't read it. I did skim it and thought it was perfect for the person I bought it for.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was amazing. I love how the Pat is so open minded and thinks about the best ways to go about things. He is crazy. And he is amazing.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Everyone should own this film. There's something so irresistible about it, even as it's 80s style becomes outdated. One of our all-time favorites.
0141439513|2.0|Had to read for class but im just not a jane austen fan. It seems to just drag on and doesn't hold my interest.  I know many people love this book but its just not for me
B002VWNID6|3.0|This came messed up. We only saw about half the movie before it fritzed out. I should have returned it.
1593080050|5.0|Ordered for school and absolutely loved this classis book. Very interesting and keeps u reading from start to finish. Not jist for school its also great for fun read
B00005JNQA|5.0|I've seen this at least four times, and it's not something I often do. Great cast, great story. Very believable and intense.
B00BF11STU|4.0|As a war movie buff I found this movie to be exciting and on the edge, sorta, of the seat, more so with the,&#34;have they found him yet part of the story.&#34;  There are two movie's on this subject, this one and &#34;Seal Team Six Raid On Osama Bin Laden,&#34; both are good, however, this one tends to focus on the intelligence part of finding some one rather than the ladder which focuses on a more whole story.  I did like this movie, the cast was good the acting was good and I would definitely watch it again and recommend it to others. I think this movie encompassed the more dark side, not to say, cruel, but missions not on the books, part of our military and intelligence community.  A definite see!
B000683VI4|4.0|This is a great movie -- very touching, despite the afternoon special quality of it. I guess they thought the love scenes would make it seem more adult-like.
B002VECM6S|5.0|A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ALL!!!! Very touching story. Goes to prove....Hard Work always pays off!!!!! Sandra Bullock did an awesome job in her role.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Game is fun- could be better. serious issues with drag/lag. all in all- worth it! Reccomend for a more powerful device like an ipad or sanding tab.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|Hello, the only defect of this product was a dent on the packaging that held the discs.<br />The rest is okay.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I really like this album. I can listen to it on repeat without skipping a song. If you like Justin Timberlake you will love it.

0393343405|5.0|This is an absolutely delightful book. Full of great history and well written.  There was a ton of history that I never new about of this era in time. It is really amazing how ancient history was revived and also very sad how much is lost for good.  Doc Rich

1451675046|4.0|Sometimes Dawkins writes down to his reader and then two pages later writes as though for a grad student. He needs to expect that his readers have the basics, such as the Earth whirls on its axis and we rotate around the sun without explaining it as though we are first graders.  Plus his concluding chapter on Myths and Religion fails to address the problem of people believing in God think that the source of the miracles of their religion is rooted in their faith in God. Then no matter what our logic, we fail to convince.

B007MDB6L0|4.0|I absolutely loved this film so much, particularly how they re-visited the moment of Tink's birth. that I had to go back I re-watch the original Tinkerbell movie. When I did, however, I saw some glaring & contradictory flaws that I had to point out. Without getting into any spoilers, one of the major plot points of Secret of the Wings is that Winter Fairies cannot cross the border into the warmer seasons of Spring & Fall without ending up like Mr. Freeze without his suit, & that the \\"Warm Fairies\\" are no better off in Winter. However in Tinkerbell, there were several Winter Fairies present at Tink's birth, & she was even tested to see if she would be one of them (which, of course, she wasn't.) Additionally, as part of her introductory tour, Clank & Bobble take her through the Winter Woods. Now it may be argued that the part of the Pixie Dust Tree where the Winter Fairies were sitting may have been climate controlled to host them comfortably & that Tink and her guides only skirted the edge of the Winter Woods & didn't stay there long, but that doesn't explain how the Minister of Winter (who was not the \\"Lord\\" shown in Secret of the Wings) was able to take a tour of the preparations to bring Spring to the mainland without so much as breaking a sweat. The main reason I'm brining this up it that when you tell a story that's part of a series, you can't introduce contradictory elements in new installments without explaining why. Regardless, younger viewers are likely to be too engrossed in the film to notice things like that, & it is a great story despite its problems. I recommend it, but with hopes that Disney will be more careful in the future.
0307946711|3.0|This book is basically a series of snapshots that has a large cast of characters but is really about two people, Emma and Dex. It is difficult for me to quantify the book. It's very slow, agonizingly so and I almost stopped reading it several times, but the author created enough interest so that I presevered. The author's use of snapshots to tell the tale was annoying. This is because the reader finds out that a momentous event is about to take pace with one of the characters, but then, \\"snap,\\" the shutter clicks, and we are in a new snapshot, the momentous event has happened, like two or three years ago (so it's yesterday's news, now) and not only that, the POV (point of view) has changed as well, and the narrative is coming from another character. ANNOYING!<br /><br />Finally, I have to do a spoiler, because I know of no other way to critique this novel and conclude this review without revealing the spoiler. The author, more than two-thirds through the book kills off one of the two major characters. I felt cheated because I had invested all this time reading the book only to find out that my time was wasted and the book really had no point. To top it off, the metamorphical camera shutter \\"snaps\\" once more, and it is now two years since the tragic event. The book then meanders and wanders to an unsatisfying and meaningless conclusion. Why did I read this thing?<br /><br />I gave this book three stars, but only because Emma, as a character, really stuck in my mind--enough so that I actually took the time to write this review. I liked Emma because she had character and she grew better with the years. So for that reason, and also because the author wrote humorously enough to cause me to stick with it, it gets my three stars. But again, Why did I read this thing? And why did I come away from this book thinking that the author was consciously sitting in his chair as he wrote, playing God with his characters?
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I like it a lot, but I think the kindle fire should have DV guide.  That would be a lot easier.

The case does get dirty though and so far I haven't been able to get it looking like new again. It does have a lip on the front to help protect the front of your phone and pictures seem to come out nicely even with the flash on. Overall it was a pretty nice case.

B00BF123WG|3.0|Well made but lacked characterization with exception of Chastain's role which was way too unbelievably inhuman.<br /><br />Did not deserve hoopla
0811879542|5.0|I received this book as a gift and was wowed when I read it on my own. It's so cute and simple in its use of language and pictures (not typical for an interactive book), but beautifully executed and visually appealing. Other reviews have compared it to an ipad app and I agree, but what's wonderful about Press Here is that - it's a book! With pages that you can turn!<br /><br />When my daughter was 2, she couldn't quite get a handle of following the book's 'instructions', so I put the book away for a few months and took it out again after she turned 3. It's been one of her favorite books for a few weeks now. We read nightly, although she prefers to create her own set of instructions.
B003629IPW|5.0|I never saw Michael Jackson this way. I loved watching him explain his thoughts to the people that he was working with. He would go into his head and Jive to this internal concert that I so much wanted to be a part of. It made me realize, even more, how much we have lost and how strong that he was while never quite being understood. In this movie I saw people that loved him and tried so hard to be what he needed while he was teaching them to be the greatest that they could be.<br />This movie was so Great it will help you.<br />Please buy this and enjoy it.

B00BF11STU|4.0|I had been wanting to see this for quite some time because of the mixed reviews.  I had no idea the movie was carried primarily by the actress Jessica Chastain (Maya), who I thought did a wonderful job portraying her character.  I thought many things were believable throughout, including the &#34;lovely&#34; language they used (parents of small kids I would advise against taking your children to see), but guess it's typical for CIA employees? I didn't know James Gandolfini was in it and loved the one line he used to describe Maya's capability for this job and all the effort she had put into it.  The one part I thought was incredibly fake was where the Seals broke into the fortress and killed OBL and it showed the body in the body bag.  From what I read about OBL, I thought he was a fairly tall man (6'4), and what was reflected in that bag was way too small and not long enough to be realistic of his body. I thought the musical score throughout was excellent and really suited the action scenes well.  I'm glad I saw it and felt it was pretty well done.

B008WCP2PG|3.0|I love that people tried to pretend that this movie was good.  Seriously, how can you even attempt to do that?  I understand that the director inspired confidence in this film because, well, he's Oscar winning director Steven Soderbergh and people seem to think he's some kind of `do no wrong' genius of film.  I personally think he's a tad hit or miss, with films like `sex lies and videotape' and `Che' being major hits that then the mediocrity of those `Ocean' films being complete misses.  When this film first got announced it was labeled as some `drama heavy/dark' movie about male strippers and was supposed to be `more than that' despite being marketed as a flesh for all `chick flick'.<br /><br />It's just that; a flesh for all chick flick.<br /><br />LOL at the idea of this being dark.  Why, because Adam gets in over his head with a drug dealer?  Or was it because he gets in a fight with some college guys for slipping some girl ecstasy?  Or maybe it was because in some singular scene Dallas tries to act all tough and `controlling'.  Seriously, the darkest thing about this movie is the murky color lenses Soderbergh decided to shoot the whole film through.<br /><br />And still, it is kind of fun; right?<br /><br />I mean, the film is really stupid if we're to be honest.  Even the dance moves were somewhat uninspired, and the progression of character is so underdeveloped.  Watching Mike mull over his squashed dreams of having a legit job and not dry humping screaming bachelorettes is kind of hilarious and then his abandonment after going all `gangster' with some `new routine' is just so melodramatic and yet a total non-event.  The acting is completely one-note.  McConaughey's awards draw with this performance was so bizarre.  Like, how was this praised for anything?  All he did was smirk at the camera for the 1,000th time and act all McConaughey.  He charms in his branded southern way and that's about it folks.  Tatum is good looking yet vacant (which is weird since I usually find him undeniably charismatic) and Pettyfer is trapped in a ridiculous character.  Olivia Munn can walk around half clothed all she wants, but next time it would be nice if she were given something interesting to do.  I hope I never seen Cody Horn again.<br /><br />And still, it is kind of fun; right?<br /><br />I don't know, maybe, maybe not.  I enjoyed myself to an extent because it felt like a nicely crafted time waster that didn't feel like a complete waste of time.  Like, it was semi-interesting in all of its absurdity and it was pretty to look at (and I don't mean because of the flesh) and it moved with grace (the editing was flawlessly progressive).  Like, I hated this in concept and yet kind of liked it in construction, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />Brainless fun, or something like that.usually find him undeniably charismatic) and Pettyfer is trapped in a ridiculous character.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Ever since the initial trailer for `Prometheus' was released and the dynamic score (which is sadly NOT utilized in the film) overtook the scenes of apparent suspense and horror, I was driven by an insane sense of passion, to see this movie.  I'm a huge fan of the franchise, despite some of the later films falling off `so-to-speak', and Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors (the man has such range) and so to see him returning to the film that made him a household name (his 1979 `Alien' is still very much the best in the bunch) was something that made me really excited.<br /><br />But life is busy and this is NOT a children's movie and so I never made it to the theater to see this.<br /><br />That said, on a big screen at home with surround sound and the lights out, this is pretty impressive in its own right.  To place this up against the other films in the series is somewhat unnecessary but wholly expected and unavoidable and so to see the fans semi-disappointed and the critics throwing complaints at it, I wasn't surprised.  As a whole, I think `Prometheus' works well in the context of the type of film it is.  As for being something `more than that', I don't know if it was as successful.<br /><br />`Prometheus' flirts with the idea of delivering to the audience answers or explanations to life's biggest questions.  Why are we here?  Who made us?  What is the purpose of life?  These are questions that everyone asks and so few feel as though they have a genuine answer to.  This is a hefty undertaking for a horror film to try and take on, and for the most part `Prometheus' kind of drops the ball entirely and without unapologetically at that.  It just doesn't seem to care that it never even attempts to answer these questions.  In fact, it basically leaves off where we started, with a certain individual intent on finding the answers to those questions.<br /><br />And the journey repeats itself.<br /><br />And then again, maybe that is the point.  Maybe the point being made by `Prometheus' is that there are no answers, at least not easy ones, to those questions and so man's life is spent in an endless circle of a journey trying desperately to uncover answers they will never fully grasp or understand.  When confronted with the opportunity to find out, they are met with hostility and irrational behavior and, in most cases death.  In `Prometheus' we find a group of people with varying ideas of what these answers are worth, and varying lengths they will go to uncover them.  Sadly, the open-ending leaves the viewer feeling almost jilted; betrayed by a promise of closure (especially for fans of the series expecting something provoking for a grand finale of sorts) and left with a taste of unresolved differences in our mouths.<br /><br />And yet I don't hate this, and at the end of the day kind of love it.<br /><br />Like I said, for the mere fact that `Prometheus' only flirts with this concept and then entirely gives it up in order to focus on the more mechanical aspects of the genre, I give it a pass.  It doesn't really want to be something deeper, we just wanted it to want to be.  Instead, it really wants to be an effects heavy horror film, and it delivers in spades there.  The suspense built is remarkable (that abortion scene alone is ridiculously effective), the special effects are spectacular, the production department had a field day creating these sets (that stun, by the way) and the overall development of certain key characters (David for one) is pitch perfect.  Rapace, Fassbender and Theron are fantastic here, delivering beautifully crafted characters that reach out further than the confines of the genre would suggest.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the film works.  It may not be what we wanted, but it certainly should be what we expected.ng made by `Prometheus' is that there are no answers, at least not easy ones, to those questions and so man's life is spent in an endless circle of a journey trying desperately to uncover answers they will never fully grasp or understand.

I couldn't be any more wrong. while the storyline was fascinating there were some Characters  which just left me disappointed  Starting with Batman, Alfred, Catwoman and even Bane to some point and I don't think it was the characters or the actors but rather the way their characters story lines were written just a big let down I expected more. different but not the way it ended

The storytelling is great and some of the puzzles really are tricky and had me stuck for a few hours.

B000PAAJYW|3.0|Magnolia, a 1999 drama film written and directed by P.T. Anderson, is in Anderson's own words, \\"probably the best film I'll ever make\\", which is wrong, as that honor goes to There Will Be Blood, at least in my eyes. The film itself is similar to, and slightly better, than another film released just a year earlier called Happiness. It's also very similar, apparently, to a 1993 Robert Altman film called Short Cuts. It features an ensemble cast of well-known big name stars such as Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, and Alfred Molina, in a small supporting role. There are also relative unknowns such as Melora Walters, Phillip Baker Hall, and Jeremy Blackmon, in no less important roles. The vast majority of characters in this film are relatively unlikable, annoying, vulgar, and miserable people, many of whom have or are themselves bad fathers, cheating spouses, and incompetent workers. The film is three hours long and takes place in the San Fernando Valley of California, like all of P.T. Anderson's films. It follows all of the previously mentioned characters in search of love, happiness, forgiveness, and redemption. In addition to that all of the characters are connected, sometimes loosely, sometimes strongly, to eachother. William H. Macy plays former whiz kid Donnie Smith who was apparently struck by lightning and lost all of his \\"smarts\\", he was a contestant on a game show called \\"What Do Kids Know\\" and is now a miserable lonely man who seems lost and abandoned, in the beginning he gets fired from his job and it all goes downhill for him from there. Jeremy Blackmon plays Stanley Spector, a new \\"whiz-kid\\" on What Do Kids Know who has a sorry excuse for a father and seems to be heading down the same path as William H. Macy's character, he's also one of the most likable and sympathetic characters in the film along side John C. Reilly's character Officer Jim Kurring, who, believe it or not, is an LA Cop. His character felt far too naive and optimistic for a officer working in LA. Vermont or Alaska maybe, but definitely not in a place like Los Angeles could a cop be that innocent. However, for better or worse it's his character, and Jeremy's, that saves this film from a two star rating, so I guess he's not that bad. He has an odd romantic relationship with Claudia Gator, the daughter of What Do Kids Know host Jimmy Gator, who are played by Melora Walters and Phillip Baker Hall respectively. Claudia is a drug addict who hates her father and this is made clear in an intense early scene when he tells her he's dying from cancer. Tom Cruise plays Frank T.J. Mackey, a self help specialist who runs a seminar aimed at men that teaches them how to charm and seduce women into bed with them. In a different role from what he usually plays, Cruise as Frank is a vulgar, sleazy, and bitter man who seems to be running or hiding from something in his past,  and Seduce and Destroy appears to a consequence of it. This is made clear in an interview with a woman that he agrees to during one of his seminars. Jason Robards plays his terminally ill father who spends the entire film in bed attended to by his kind male nurse played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Franks hates his father for cheating on, and later abandoning, his cancer-stricken wife who later died, and him, who was forced to take look after her by himself. Julianne Moore plays Jason Robard's character's second wife who only married him for his money and wants to change his will to leave all of his valuables to her after he dies, and she also cheats on him. She is probably the weakest character in the film, as her performance is marred by over-acting and clumsy dialogue. She also has a vendetta against Frank, claiming he's not part of their family. In addition to these loosely connected plot threads, there is the common theme of chance and coincidence, best illustrated at the beginning of the film in a darkly humorous monologue focusing on three incredible coincidences that supposedly really happened and in a scene towards the very end which I won't spoil for you. Many people claim that Magnolia is a pretentious film and that Anderson was deliberately trying to be as obscure or confusing as possible to make it seem like a deeper or more profound film than it actually was. I believe there's a bit of truth to that, but not to the extent that some people here think. It wasn't all that confusing to me, the thing that bothered me the most was the overuse of melodrama and miserable, pathetic characters interacting with other miserable, pathetic characters. It felt almost like a soap opera, and the vulgar language was also overdone, to the point of actually taking away from the effectiveness of several scenes, especially one towards the end involving Frank. Overall it was easy to sympathize with many of the characters but hard to like them, which was a big negative for me concerning the quality and effectiveness of the film. It has a huge cast and a long running time, but it still felt oddly incomplete when the credits started to roll. Overall it was an okay film, but not great or a masterpiece, and definitely not Paul Thomas Anderson's best film.redible coincidences that supposedly really happened and in a scene towards the very end which I won't spoil for you.

1449410243|4.0|Its a really cool book, I enjoy it a lot, and cant stop laughing even I read it again..<br /><br />If you really love cats you should get this book, comes in beautiful full color pages, and a poster... the only thing i dont like is that its a little short, you cant read it in some hours, and that some parts of the book you already might have seen it in internet. but after all its a great book
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was hooked to this book the second I started reading it. It's a great love story and sort of a mystery. The author gives you guys as to what might happen next and it makes you want to read even more
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have not been able to stop playing this game. its fun, challenging and great way to stay busy.  completely worth it, even with upgrades.
B009SJ47XA|5.0|I NEVER write reviews but even I will make an exception. I had been wanting to watch American Horror Story for some time now and finally got the time to watch season one on Netflix which was so addicting i finished within three nights and then couldn't wait to get started on season two which again has just blown me away. I was also thrilled to see that they brought back a lot of the season one cast to play in asylum as well. as soon as an episode finishes i can't start the next one soon enough. I've never watched such an addicting show that draws you in from start to finish and there is never a moment that i wasn't surprised. I'm going to be extremely sad when i finish the last few episodes and don't have more to watch until season 3. I highly recommend the series to anyone who enjoys a nail biting, on the edge of your seat thriller, I only wish i could give it more than 5 stars. Outstanding.
B00B2064IY|4.0|I don't know where they found these recordings but the quality is very good! Anytime new music from a deceived musician is a special think! I am always interested when something unknown is released that has never been heard before! I hope they have more somewhere!
B000JMKNV0|4.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You want to keep reading to see what happens next.  I give it a big thumbs up/
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Really good! I loved the description and the imagery of the places and the characters. I was into it after the first two pages! Can't wait for the movie now. Great book!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I did enjoy reading this book. I recommend it to anyone seeking strength and motivation to move on with their life.
B002ZG999U|5.0|was good with humor and action.  Nice not to see just blood and that they have personality.  Glad I got it.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This app stinks who would buy an app that you can only play for less than ten minutes I mean it's just a waste of your time
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is my favorite current show. Can't wait for more. Hope to add the other seasons for my collection soon.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|My daughter already loved the book, and now she loves the app.  The best part is that there are several difficulty levels, to help her get better with her numbers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game I have its a fun game for any time place and more and its treat 4 car trips I think its a great game for my siblings and me
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I can't recommend this series enough. Excellent writing, excellent acting. As for so mant great series, they end way too soon. Highly recommend this series to all.
630471193X|4.0|This is a good movie with a good lesson.  I realize it's pretty old but it's hard to find a good movie in today's selection.  They are mostly either violent or saturated with explicit sex.  I have seen only two decent movies lately. I have resorted to the older ones for quality..
B003L77GGK|5.0|I never watched this series on television. But when I decided to buy seasin one. I was hooked. I just ordered season 6!!! I love almost all of the individual stories. Very Very creative writing. A shame we lost Kim Manners to lung cancer. Love this show.
1451695195|5.0|This is one of the most interesting afterlife publications I've read so far. In every way.<br /> I really recommend it.<br />  The author does a Great job of bringing the reader along each of the many days he was in coma.<br /> The clarification as to probable condition of patients after 3rd, 4th and longer days in coma helped to clarify.<br />  The description of his out of body journey beyond  - is in keeping with others' and tied in well with the medical dilemma in this world. After reading the book, I had a discussion group of hard core disbelievers. They expressed changed attitudes about this topic. It's not at all hard to see why it's best seller status. This book belongs on every family's end table and in every public library.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Excellent movie! Love the combo pack! I would recommend for teens and adults, some violence. A nice progression in the Bourne series
B004MNO0BQ|1.0|Purchased this app for my Kindle and it was awful.  Slow movement and reaction time, sort of a lag.  Made it very hard to play.  I removed it from my Kindle shortly after buying it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Good serious. This show will go on for a while. Better watch it now before it is on dvd. Season three intruduces a bunch of new characters.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Not only was this retro game done right, they improved the gameplay for playing on a phone or tablet.<br /><br />This is definitely a classic.  I think many of us used to play Space Invaders, and now this game, may years later, has almost re-invented the game to make this type of game fun again.<br /><br />Kudos to Noctua Software for making a great quality game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is game is REALLY fun!! It never freezes up or is never delayed. GREAT GAME!<br />I think it's much better than temple run because it doesn't go crazy after you've played it a couple times! Definitely worth the 5 stars!
B002M9WW30|4.0|Haven't watched all films in this blue-ray box, but the first one is in good quality, so the next ones should be the same or better.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think its an awesome game but they should add enderman and the end they should also add caves and herobime
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I really enjoyed the book.  I wanted to see the movie but missed it so I thought I would read the book since they are usually better than the movie.  I had seen the author of the book and director of the movie on Katie and found them to be very interesting people who had delt with the issues of the book with such grace.  Not one of those &#34;I can't put this down&#34; books but good.
1451696191|5.0|Great book. Beautiful copy, really good price. Totally worth it. Highly recomend it to anyone thinking about buying the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Fastest I have read a book in a long time.  I loved this story!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game but some times it gets a little to boring<br />Other than that this game is very enjoyable and I'm glad I got this game
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This is more of a response to the large number of negative reviews that have spawned on this product. First off however, I'd like to say that this is a very affordable automatic that for me, keeps time very well and has no problem staying wound. It looks very nice, especially if you swap the canvas strap for a leather strap.<br /><br />Now I'd like to address a few of the points brought up by other reviewers.<br /><br />Winding: This is apparently very inconsistent from watch to watch. Some have found the self-winding insufficient at keeping the watch powered for more than a few hours. I have a fairly sedentary occupation and my watch stays wound for more than 10 hours after wearing it for a day. I attribute this to issues of quality control in manufacturing. At the very least, if your copy of the watch fails to stay powered, use the warranty and get a new one.<br /><br />Accuracy: Another inconsistent property of the watch manufacturing. Some have fount he watch to lose/gain anywhere between 15 to 90 seconds in a 12 hour period. This again is uncommon (my watch loses about 1 minute every 3-4 days).<br /><br />Strap: This is pretty solid and I don't see how this could be a problem unless you are mangling the watch somehow. I was able to remove the strap with a spring bar tool and mount a leather strap with no problems.<br /><br />Hardlex Face Crystal: VERY easily scratched. I lightly against something (don't remeber doing this, but it must have happened) and it now has a nasty scratch. Hardlex is also notoriaously difficult to polish (worst of both worlds; easily scratched like acrylic and not easily polished like sapphire). Terrible choice of face crystal.<br /><br />Overall: This is the best deal on an attractive and inexpensive automatic you will find currently. Don't be angry if your watch isn't up to par (especially when you only paid 60 dollars)...just get it replaced. Also be very careful for scratches as they happen even without your knowledge.
B0063IH60K|2.0|This product allows way too many pop ups. Every time I complete a game I have to log out and then log back in because the pop ups locks up my tablet.
B008Y73940|5.0|Great experience on prime, movie was very good- it kept my attention.<br />Well done script and interesting plot to engage the viewer.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I just started using it so I haven't figured it out all the way yet. What I do use I think is great.
B00B9DTZWG|2.0|I am a late Downton Abbey viewer.  That is why I really wanted to catch up.  There were problems with the dvd's.  I corresponded with the company that I purchased them from ( not Amazon).  I was disapointed with the quality of the dvd's and that is why I have returned them for credit.
B0086700CM|3.0|I don't really play it . It is more for my grandchild and she does play it all the time so I guess it is great from her point of view.
B004RF2KAC|5.0|Very good mix of music. Love her voice!<br />That is all I had. I don't know why they require a large number of words to leave a review!
B008FRFN7A|3.0|Just ok. Sometimes it works and sometimes I am told that the printer will not respond. I wish it would work better.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book is different than what I normally read I almost did not want to read it I'm so glad I did because honestly  this is by far the best book I have ever read. The author Jodi picoult  does such a good job with describing the characters in the book that you forget that it is just a book .
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|I had seen the 1990 British version of this political drama first. It was so good I was keeping my expectations tempered for fear of a watered down American version. But this US version is very well done. Brilliant even. Full of detail and nuance. Impeccable casting. Kevin Spacey is one of the smartest actors in Hollywood and the script is worthy of his talents. The same can be said of the entire cast. This is a very different story from its British counterpart though. Yes, it's about politics and greed and betrayal, but from a different angle juxtaposed to what the Brits did. Both series are top notch thrillers in their own unique way.<br /><br />House of Cards illustrates the seedy underbelly of politics. If you really want to get a sense of how politics corrupts, how people can rationalize their corrupt acts -including murder- and still sleep at night, here is a great teacher. You witness first hand the enormous pressure elected representatives face in order to go-along-to-get-along. You come to realize that reform from within is made architecturally impossible.<br /><br />While viewing this series I was watching Kevin Spacey's character (an influential congressman) look his friends/associates directly in the eye and tell the most sincere of lies without a blink of his own eye. All to benefit his own personal agenda. I was reminded of another series about people in positions of power that portrayed the exact same behavior... The Sopranos. So, we have gangsters and politicians rendered as amoral liars that are willing to kill to get what they want. These fictions of course could not possibly reflect real life.
B005IGDW24|5.0|this movie was good for the entire family. it had lots of 3d effects and kept us interested in watching it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a great retro game with great retro feel. Easy to play. Starts off easy but gets harder and harder
B001F12J48|5.0|this movie was very good. it kept my entire family interested throughout the movie. lots of action to think about.
B000YDG6CY|4.0|very fast service and nice product. looks like timberland has gone the extra mile to give you a great fit.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|...which, historically, a lot of the best films do.<br /><br />For me, this film has two unusual qualities;<br /><br />1) Its greatest weakness is also its greatest strength. It takes pains to keep its distance, to stay neutral and<br />unemotional. It refuses to assign easy labels, to people or issues, even (as has been much discussed) being<br />ambiguous about the use of torture. It gives very little back-story, even of the lead character. It doesn't work to win<br />you to a point of view, to make you want to cheer your approval, or shake your head in shame, or even like or dislike<br />the characters.<br /><br />For most of the film I found the effect (as one might expect) oddly alienating. I was gripped by the story, but I didn't<br />feel strong emotions, or care about characters in the way a 'normal' film would have made me. And while watching,<br />this felt like a weakness. I felt distracted, disappointed, even bored at times, regardless of the dramatic nature of the story.<br /><br />Yet that same quality led me to feeling powerfully haunted by the film when it was over -- to ponder violence and its<br />effects on human beings, the thin lines between perseverance and obsession, the inability to ever have a clear morality<br />in time of war. By stubbornly, steadfastly refusing to spoon feed me it's own opinions,  it forced me to think, uncomfortably,<br />messily about a lot of things, for myself.<br /><br />2) It's also a film where, for me, to a large degree the whole movie is redeemed by its final images,<br /><br />Spoiler in next line!<br /><br />In finally dramatizing the lost beyond words state of our lead character, suddenly all the emotion<br />she never allowed herself and us is paid off in seeing that hard facade crack.  We are left with the terrible<br />emptiness of even righteous revenge and the realization that both the character (and by extension<br />perhaps the nation?)  are unmoored and at sea with how to deal with the world they find themselves in,<br />and in some ways helped to create. It's an image that defines the story with a question mark, not an<br />exclamation point.  A rare thing for a 'mainstream' film.<br /><br />End spoiler alert<br /><br />Ultimately a very brave, and very un-Hollywood film in pace, style and content. This is war,<br />and people in war stripped of easy answers and even traditional 'excitement'.<br /><br />There are flaws (e.g. a lot of very pretty people who look more like actors than warriors), but<br />these are minor compared to seeing an uncompromised and deeply challenging vision.themselves in,<br />and in some ways helped to create.

B0000DBJDM|4.0|Took the seller (not Amazon) longer than it should have to ship so I would consider that before buying from that vendor again. Hence the 4 stars vs. 5. Other than that, this is a must for any Pink Floyd fan. Simply one of the best things you can do to your ears.
0316056898|2.0|This book disappointed me. It lacks Fey's usual wit.  Didn't she have an editor to advise her?  Who is really interested in personal stories if they are not entertaining?
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game is great. I bought this game and couldn't put it down. I would recommend this game to all of my friends and family.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This had to be one of my favorite apps! I had it on my old phone.. It has many different versions to read from and the bible reading plans are great! You need to create a username an  provide your email to use all it offers. however, I'm having trouble logging in on my kindle to continue my plans and I can't seem to figure out why.. even if I create a new username it is not logging me in.. I have been trying for weeks thinking it might be my WiFi connection.. I have tried the &quot;forgot password&quot; option and I have yet to receive an e-mail for it! It has been weeks so It is frustrating but at least the bible versions to read from are available as long as I have  WiFi ? I have looked for similar bible apps with reading plans and devotionals and I haven't found one I like.. overall a great app! I haven't read about others with the same problem so it might just be me :/..  either way if you can log in it has great devotionals and lots of reading plans to choose from!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|I really like this game. It's fun and it's easy on the eyes.  BUT... I'd been playing it for several days and had amassed a lot of coins and jewels and had upgraded my shark to it's largest and most powerful.  Then I turned off my kindle fire hd.  When I turned it back on, all my coins and jewels were gone and I had to start from the beginning, with a tiny shark.  I came here to see if anyone else had the same problem and I see that it is an issue with others as well.  If only they would fix that, it would be almost perfect and worthy of 5 stars.
B004LP3AYI|3.0|I think the story line is fascinating.  The fight scenes overpower the plot and the retelling of the first book to get the reader into the second was too much.  I felt vested in the characters and especially enjoyed the relationships of Richard and the dragon and the gar.  Maybe at some point in the future I will read number three, but not now and not at the price.
B009RWRIKM|3.0|Der Film ist recht anstrengend zum Angucken, weil er diesen Wim Wenders intellektuellen Touch hat. Definitiv keine leichte Unterhaltung. Die Tanzszenen sind weniger mitreissend als ich dachte. Insgesamt bin ich ein wenig enttaeuscht.
1250012570|5.0|You know how sometimes you finish a book and you just lay there clutching the book to your chest staring at the ceiling and/or wall because you're just so completely wowed by the story and the writing and the book?  This is what happened when I read the last page of ELEANOR & PARK by Rainbow Rowell.  I closed the cover and just held it.  I wanted to absorb it.  It's just. That. Good.<br /><br />ELEANOR & PARK is a story of first love, and of overcoming perpetual outcastdom, and of dealing with a rough home life and not feeling good enough and still finding someone who makes you feel like you might be okay. It's realistic and raw and 100% unputdownable.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell is a brilliant new voice in YA.  Fans of John Green, David Levithan, and Maureen Johnson are sure to fall in love with ELEANOR & PARK...and with all things Rainbow Rowell.  This is an author to keep your eye on.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I did like the conceit of the filming of a theater set at the outset. I thought that was very creative and interesting. And the costumes and sets and cinematography were beautiful. I think Keira Knightley is a goddess. But as it became less stylized it became more boring. I suppose I was tired, but I did fall asleep at one point, I think it was one of the lovemaking scenes actually. I've never read the book, but the film character Anna became less and less nuanced, it seem to me, until she was merely selfish, and not in any way noble for chasing after what was supposedly &#34;love&#34; -- but really seemed to amount only to amazing sexual chemistry. Sex, no matter how good, is not the same as love, but she seemed to have confused the two. It didn't seem to matter to her even when her children suffered because of it. Hard for me to respect a woman who appears to sacrifice her own babies on the altar of her ecstasy. I guess I need to read Tolstoy's original version to see if I think Anna should have been portrayed this way in the film, but my hunch is that it wouldn't be considered a classic Russian novel if he had.
B001VNB54A|5.0|A must watch for all Americans to know what our brave men and women Veteran's did for this country. Very well done!
B000I3UMKM|5.0|If only we could take Mickey Rooney's parts out, it would be perfect. I admit I never read Capote's book, and he wanted Marilyn Monroe to play Holly Golightly, but I just can't imagine that. Audrey Hepburn is perfect.
B00821OX98|5.0|the series was fast pace and kept you playing the next segment until you ran out of segments. Loved it
B0043URV5U|5.0|Huge Bob Seger fan all the way back to the 1960s and the System's first hit. Pretty much all the greats are included here.
B009XTF8JM|4.0|is a very interesting movie!  I really like horror films!  So many good films are out there.  Can any one suggest new ones?
B0026NWBY2|5.0|Has most all the highlights included unless you are just crazy about the whole All Things Must Pass album. I just did not have any of the music on CD and no way to input the output of my old turntable into the computer.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Bonamassa is without a doubt the best guitarist I have ever heard. First heard him on the Live at the Royal Albert..  have been to two concerts and am still amazed at his abilities onj the guitar. I have listened to all the greats from Hendricks to Lee Ritenour. Hope he keeps it going
B00BRUYQFC|3.0|JT has made an album of love songs. Half the songs are good, easy listening the other half I couldn't get into. Props to them for the plethura of sound mixes. Each song has lots of different sounds. When the album dropped JT was on Jimmy Falon for a whole week. Now that was great!!! I would listen to every song live any day!!!
B003Y5H4YI|5.0|not a single thing wrong with dvd. Ellen Merrin is talented beyond belief. rest of cast were equally good. Got the same dvd as a gift two days after receiving my amazon<br />purchase.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Again, Nicholas Sparks gives a great read. This story is really good. Doesn't have the sad ending like some of his others. Read the book before watching the movie.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Reading the synopsis of this book, it is difficult to imagine how a man can survive being stranded on Mars for more than a few weeks. A few pages into this book and the reader is saying \\"wow!\\" that's some good stuff.  This author reaches deep into his scientist's bag of tricks and weaves a mesmerizing tale of how an astronaut does just that - survive for over a year on Mars!  This book will have you doing Google searches to refresh your memory of those old chemistry lessons, but is yet funny and not overwhelmingly complicated.  It is truly hard sci-fi at its best and becomes amazingly believable.  What a great story for the fan of hard sci-fi.
B004AKCME8|5.0|great addition to the movie collection loved it and worth watching over and over and good for the young kids..
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I am a HUGE Disney fan, and I LOVE all the classic animated films.  This movie is just as I remembered and looked great in the High-Def Blu-Ray.  All the extras on the disk were interesting to watch as well!
B005LAII80|5.0|Somehow, the 3D version and standard version are on the same disc. The bonus features like the sound tests (11.1, 7.1, 5.1) were able to help me identify some crucial errors in my AV system settings. The making of&#34; features were a good addition as well. No lengthy interviews with the cast members though.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Avast has been around for years and is highly regarded in IT security circles. I have used their free and paid anti virus on my PC for years. When I found it for free on Amazon I dumped my paid for app and installed Avast to my Android phone. Guess what, better protection.<br />Nope, dont work for them.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Many people are going to cry. &#34;to violent, bad language, unreal situations&#34;. You need to take a look out your window or stop walking with you heads down. This is the best production of the good and bad side of our &#34;Heros&#34;. the police.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Amazing, great memories, no regrets on this download, plus today was free, what else I can ask for, even if have to pay I think is worth it.

B004BEMC6G|4.0|Good film. Good mix of drama,action,suspense,and wise cracks. Nice to see a female in a male dominated role,even better to see a woman fill the role in A+ fashion.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I learned so much about the true nature of many animals; not just a Bengal tiger!  I enjoyed the first person narrative on this harrowing ordeal - through a child's eyes.  I'm glad I chose this one to read and have recommended it to others.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The Orcs were on the attack, riding the beastly Wargs. Radagast, with a smirk on his face, boarded his sled pulled by the mighty Rhosgobel Rabbits and the chase was afoot. Wow, could those rabbits run.<br /><br />Rented this two days ago and watched twice. I watched twice because it was so good and I wanted to watch the rabbits again. I love those rabbits.<br /><br />Cinematography is beautiful as always with these movies. I enjoyed the Dwarves, I think they must be circus performers in real life. There is action, comedy, great fight scenes and I really enjoyed the odd creatures, like the great Moose that the Elven King was riding. The movie is just a joy to watch.<br /><br />Such a great start to an adventure.
141694737X|5.0|Bought this when my daughter was almost two.  She loves the flaps and the pictures of the animals.  Such a great book to have in the collection.
0345803485|1.0|So, having read a lot of reviews on here about 50 shades of grey, I downloaded a sample, just so I could skim a few pages. I've never been sorrier. It reads like a 13 year olds twilight fanfiction and I can see, just by skimming the first ten pages or so that it was speedwritten to get to the sexy parts. That being said, all the head cocking, murmuring, muttering and blushing that goes on in the first few pages would drive me insane after a few chapters. And how does a girl go from literally falling into an office to suddenly being persued by the main male character in less than ten pages?? There's obviously no attempt in the first few pages to create in depth characters and obviously no plot, so unless you're looking for twilight fanfiction with changed names, don't waste your time.
B007FIY3VW|4.0|was able to easily convert my files in Open Office to the proper extensions and upload it<br />into my Kindle Fire.  For want of something better, it does work fine and I am satisfied with it.
B00AU15HPC|2.0|Generally just slow.  The Nashville produced remakes way too twangy.  The Out There Somewhere mixes just plain awful.  Spreading your wings out musically is fine, Justin, but remember your roots.
1400064627|5.0|I couldn't find a single negative thing to say about this book!! There are very few books I've ever read that I can say that about as I am quite anal about writing, even my own.<br /><br />Fannie Flagg has always been one of, if not my favorite writer. She doesn't write mind-boggling prose that keeps you on the edge of your seat or  makes you stretch your imagination to keep a step ahead of the story. She writes small-town, real-life stories that almost anyone can relate to. Opening one of her books puts you smack-dab in the middle of Alabama!<br /><br />My only suggestion is that if you want to read the book, do it before you see the movie as they are quite a bit different and you might be disappointed in the book if you watch the movie first. (I won't give any spoilers!)
B009KEN87O|5.0|fun fun fun fun Fun fun fun fun!!! Is all I have to say about this awesomely fun retro game!!!!!!!!
B009OYTAL8|4.0|I've never read the comic. Solid acting and good writing. I do like the back story and flashbacks almost more than the main plot line.
B000E9910W|5.0|this music is so uptempo and unique, some songs are mellow and quiet and some so fun and full of energy.
B009JZVT70|3.0|An entertaining show. Some fun acting and the earlier episodes were better but now that the characters have been introduced they are wearing a little thin.
0824835921|4.0|This book arrived very quickly and in perfect shape.<br />This is an interesting book.  The parts of kanji are broken down and learned from the simple forms using types of memory enhancing techniques.  Then these parts are used in making more complex symbols.  It seems to work, though I personally don't have anything in Japanese to compare it to.
0307895475|5.0|I am not a true gamer and have a hard time starting a game and with the help of the game guide, I was able to get past<br />being overwhelmed with the beautiful graphics and motion of the game which is fantastic, with the complex world and villains this<br />book is a must !
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Awesome. Box comes with Blu-ray, DVD and digital copies. Picture and Sound so much better than from HBO GO or OnDemand. Makes a difference.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I've been waiting for this to come out on Kindle and it hasn't been a dissapointment! It's the best game around.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I will seek more from this author. Good character good action. Some slow spots, but not too many.  Try it.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|My son turned me on the this band.  i like the upbeat songs best. I listen to the CD in my car.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|It was a good film. Actors were not over the top and the conversation with the Red Sox owner at the end is more than about baseball.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|A thoroughly moving read. A bit of a slow burner but ultimately a juicy, witty, controversial love story. Loved it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Murder mystery isn't my preferred genre but my book club chose this story and I want to be a good participant. The story didn't grasp me until around 60% and then I didn't want to put it down:  my qualifier for 5 stars. I liked the writing style and the pace. The characters were engaging and I felt actively involved in their emotions. The ending was a shocker. Good job Landay!
B000W91RUG|4.0|Great buy for the series.  I absolutely love this show and I am starting my own collection of the series.  Great price and shipping was great as well.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was skeptical when I first got this book because I heard it was more like a series of interviews instead of a typical book format.  But in the end it still tells a story and is very entertaining.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|It is what it is....a dvd series of Big Bang Theory.  Love this show! Great buy great value.  Will be buying the whole series...one year at a time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this. This app has plans on it for daily, weekly, monthly, yearly readings etc. I use this throughout my days on a daily basis.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I thought this book was full of information, sometimes too much but enjoyed it imensely.  I would highly recommed it to others. I can't wait for the movie.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great read. Many twists and turns. Could not put it down. David Baldacci is a a fascinating writer. On to one of this other books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was very happy with this Nicholas Sparks book.  Not a constant tear jerker which was refreshing.  A little predictable but would and have recommended to others to read.
0156027321|5.0|Although there are a few parts that seem to drag on, the book tells and original and engaging story, makes you want to keep reading to find out what happens, and has a very clever ending.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I first bought my husband the regular dvd, but he said it was lacking part of the story and the quality wasn't great. So I ordered the director's cut in Blu-ray and he ha watched it over and over again. It arrived quickly and has given him great enjoyment.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Nice vibe.  Like the acoustic nature of the CD.  Mellow, but not boring.<br /><br />Excellent lyrics.  Very good backup band.<br /><br />Worth the money.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Everything about this show is 5 star or better.  The actors, the writing, the costumes, the total design of this series is a great joy!!
B007L96SI6|5.0|We liked Haley because of her Jazz chops, but were still pleased on the different nature of all the songs & lyrics.  Many genres mixed in.<br /><br />She is quite talented and I hope she gets the backup she needs to be successful.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The DVD came brand new with outer plastic wrap still intact.  No scratches or damages of any kind; perfect condition.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Excellent CD overall, but the one hit outshines the rest of the numbers, so there was not as much enthusiasm during the rest of the CD.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is wonderful and does exactly what it says it will do.  I use it when I'm travelling from home and sleep wonderfully.  I love how you can mix sounds also to get exactly what you want to hear.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|\\"Yippie-Ki-Yay...\\" John McClane (Willis) has just found out that his son is in trouble in Russia. Rather then going through the normal channels he decides to go and get him out on his own. After arriving he learns that he doesn't know the whole truth and his son is working for the CIA. Now instead of a rescue mission he is teaming with his son to stop a nuclear weapon heist. I have to start by saying that I am a huge fan of the series. This is a series that everyone has a different favorite movie and when asked what the worst one is is one you have to think about. Until now. I'm not sure what happened with this one but this is the first Die Hard movie where I seemed to get bored and lost interest pretty quick. I own the other four but I really don't think this is one I will buy. Worth seeing to complete the series but that's about it. Overall, very disappointing, the Crystal Skull of the Die Hard series. I give it a B-.
B009MO5960|5.0|Alice is back, and no matter how many scenarios they throw at her,she cannot be stopped.<br />Not the best of the series, but it does quite a bit of covering some holes from the earlier stories.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If you like a book that keeps you wanting from each page, this is the book for you. The relationship of Alex & Katie, you want it also! It is written so perfect & how everything comes together, then falls apart, but then comes together again. Life can throw you so many things in life, but always try to find the good in it. Because at the end of the day, you grow from it. You have to believe in love & your heart will never be alone.
B00123LIPK|5.0|I just love where this music takes me. Maddona is very talented and with her music I can go all the way back to my high school days and feel the same energy and emotions now as I did then. Just love it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The price was Great.  The verbage is juvenille however it is written to reach a much younger audience.  That did not stop me from reading it and loving every minute of it.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|A wonderful story about a family that overcomes many problems with love. Despite that, and the old-fashioned language used at times, it is not overly sentimental.
B009KEN87O|1.0|How on earth (pun intended) is this receiving 4 &amp; 5 stars?  The graphics are abysmal on a tablet and the game play awful.  This isn't a modern version of 'Galaxian' rather it looks like something I programmed on the Apple II.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome read.  Can't wait to see the movie.  Kept me really engaged in the  story throughout.  Definitely worth reading for me.
B00004WGAF|5.0|Ian Richardson is wonderful.  His expressions are perfect.  I saw this years ago and loved it then.  Now I need to get &#34;To Play the King&#34;
B003O86FMW|5.0|Now for the final book of the Hunger Games..... Can't wait to see how it all ends... Now to get started!!!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app keeps me informed about my power usage. It has lots of great graphics and the information helps me make the most of my kindle. I would recommend.
0316228532|3.0|I read this book in 8 weeks. I usually take 4 weeks to read a book at a casual pace. The book is good but not 'gripping', hence the slow read. The author paints great detail in the characters and locations and sometimes this dragged out a little. The 'common' accents of certain characters were a little over the top. Everybody appears to speak perfect english in the book except the 'common folk' who live down the hill and from the 'wrong' part of town. Their words are hardly recognizable - over the top IMHO.<br /><br />Anyways, good book but a little draining.
B0074VA2T2|3.0|It's a cute app.  I got it on a day it was offered as a freebie, so that was nice.  I wouldn't want to pay money for it though.
1609611543|5.0|better that I had hoped for. loved it.....perfect...may buy more. . . . . most likely. . . . . .  :-)
B009AMANBA|5.0|Anxiously awaiting deliver of this movie. I have not seen it yet and am looking forward to deliver soon.  I have never heard anything negative about this movie and am excited about seeing it soon.<br />Thank you for movies like this.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it but they should add a radar to tell you where enemy's are. For now four stars. Bad job notch!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What's not to say about Downton Abbey? When I first heard about the series from a friend, I told her that I've just passed by it while I was channel surfing. I had never been fond of English movies or humor. It was during the second season my friend told me to watch it. However she said to either purchase or rent Season one before watching Season two. So... I purchased Season one.. I was and am hooked forever. Along with millions of people,  I fell in love with the series and now have all three seasons in my movie collection. I can't wait for Season four.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow don't know what to say. Great didn't know what to expect, then once I got into it I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Djmswan
B009CF7GRY|1.0|I love the Hough kids.  Because I grew up with the original this was a waste of the film they put it on.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Got this cause it was free, didn't expect it to be too good, but now I'll be playing for hours. The graphics are nice, the controls are responsive, and NO IN APP PURCHASES thank you. So far a very good game. Get it and try it out, if you like this try out Sector Strike. I know this will be in my top favorite apps. Have fun killing aliens :)
B0084670FU|2.0|this movie was just ok at best.  When I saw the cast I think I expected much, much more from the script.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is an excellent example of where someone who loves retro games took the time to do it right. Its refreshing to play the games that take you back.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a very good read. Very well written. I love Conner and Megan. Because characters are so real.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|We have enjoyed this game as a family. Its great to keep the kids busy when your at a Dr office etc.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|Very nice now I can take it to work and set it up on.my desk. The children in the classroom like it too. I can find something and show them.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Family enjoyed the game, and hubby has even played the game while at Dr. office etc just to help pass the time
0062238868|5.0|American Sniper is an eye-opening first account of fighting activity during Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Chris Kyle's account of his actions as a SEAL sniper is definitely not what one reads in the newspapers.  Some of it is a bit graphic, most all of it is scary, but unfortunately all of it is true.  Kyle's wife has also inserted how his fighting spirit and deployments affected her and their two children.  I found the book easy and interesting to read.  Kyle has somewhat of an arrogant attitude, but I believe that was necessary for his survival.  Kyle continued to serve his country after his military discharge by operating a training and security company.  Unfortunately he has been killed since writing the bok.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It is so addictive.  I can sit here and play this for quite some time.  Right now I have a high score that I just can't beat, though.  Then again, it keeps me playing the game, lol.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What a vision this writer. leaves us with! I was beginning to.think there would be no one left.  Stunned Reader
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I play this constantly.  At first, I was playing every few hours, after my coins regenerated.  Now I have more coins than the regeneration limit, so I can play at will. My biggest issue is that I have to pay to upgrade to go up to the higher levels with the prize awards.  Not cool.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app! Very user-friendly! I use it almost everyday!! Very nice buttons. My kindle didn't come with a calculator, so it is really  nice to have this one
140123755X|3.0|Fables vol I kicks off a series of graphic novels based upon fairy tale creatures rather than heroes.  Think \\"Shrek\\" without the influence of George Lucas.  I know--sounds promising, right? And it is.  However, the one bedroom scene seems contrived and merely thrown into it to appeal to older (I don't know, 12-year-old?) audiences.  So unfortunately, I have to torpedo this for my enjoyment.  It simply isn't appropriate for anyone.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Certainly a top 5 contender but not even daniel craig era best (casino royale holds that title) but very well done and hope he's got two more in him to finish out his saga ... great reboot to the series (makes watching the campier ones like Moonraker and the last Brosnan's attempt certainly 'Died another day\\"... yikes...
0440178002|5.0|The book is just perfect in all its complexity, a wonderful read, recommend for anyone and everyone!<br />I found it curious that the author chose to portray the characters as having both good and evil sides to them, they are just people. This is so refreshing - not seeing a tag! Or seeing it and then - surprise! - the person's got another edge to his/her personality.<br />The book is a great insight to the mind of Japanese and Europeans, to the great disadvantage of the latter, alas.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Maybe I was expecting a little too much from this movie, but still looking forward to see the next one. I figured it was going to be a little more action, still think Daniel Craig is one of the best James Bonds ever!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I enjoy the story and the characters - and I have read it more than once. A class at the library was given about this book which made the whole story more interesting - listening to others ideas and thoughts on the characters,
B009KEN87O|5.0|this game is awesome<br />when I looked at the pictures I thout it was weird but I downloaded it any way and its awesome
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Jane Austen is always a great pleasure to read and I never fail to enjoy this story. I am re-reading it at the moment.
B00005JNQA|4.0|I liked some of the plot turns. A couple good surprise twists. Similar to an episode of Lie to Me.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|A great series to watch one right after another and NO commercials
B00A89ITZG|5.0|I CrossFit and I am coming up on doing so for 1 year. I am very interested in how to become faster and stronger, but I also want to know how to be smarter about my movements. This book is amazing. I have it on loan to my trainer right now who is incorporating the knowledge from the book into my workouts. What I have learned from this book has improved my running and my form in lifting. The instructions and the all the illustrations are so well done. Even noobs like me are able to understand the movements and improve quickly.<br /><br />If you are like me and read MobilityWOD and follow SFCrossFit and their amazing team of trainers, then this book is a natural addition to your tool bag.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|A great season if you're a fan
0345803485|1.0|If only there was a BETTER writer behind this that KNEW the vocabulary and lingo of its setting....it would be a decent read.  Yeah, it was somewhat entertaining, and the characters were kinda interesting, but I couldn't get over how the writer kept writing the characters to say stupid crap that no one would EVER say in Seattle/Portland.  I almost wanted to read it with a British accent!  C'mon!  Not only that, every response of the main character was the same.  Change it up a little.  No one wants to constantly read a phrase a million times throughout the book and the series.  I'd read it over just to tally up how many times these phrases were used in the FIRST book.<br />&#34;My inner goddess&#34;<br />&#34;My conscience&#34;<br />&#34;Oh my&#34;<br /><br />Love the concept and the main plot of the story, but I'm sorry, the writing was poor.
0425252868|5.0|A great book for history buffs
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is one of my new favorite books!!!! I feel in love with Travis & Abby!!!it definitely has a lot of ups and downs... but that's what makes books so great!! Can't wait to read the 2nd part!!!!
142311339X|4.0|bought as a gift
B008ALAHA4|4.0|Does the job. I wish they had created a little plastic holder to attach this to the cord when not in use. They used to make these little plastic usb plug tops that attached to the cord. That would be perfect for this little adapter so it doesn't get lost.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|There are some great principles discussed in this book that I've already put into practice in my everyday life. I've recommended this book to everyone on my development team.
B000002GY9|5.0|The CD arrived in good condition and was an accurate order.I have enjoyed all of the music and play this alot on my cars' CD player as it makes for excellent travel and cruise music.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|At first I could take all the videos I wanted. Then it started to crash and wouldn't let me use the video. Now I can't use the video.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I can't get enough of this one. Even though the story doesn't seem that original, the characters and the music are really making up for it. I will never get sick of this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|all I have is 3 words BEST GAME EVER.I am I BIG horse lover and I think this a great game for anyone

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show,even though it creeps me out. Rick Grimes is my favorite actor for the show. can't wait for season 4
B008NMT684|3.0|This game is good but you are required to buy the rest of it. Takes the kids no time at all to complete. Not worth it to buy the full version.
1582406723|3.0|Awesomly written was delivered fast but there were small defects in the corners<br />Also for such a small order used a lot of materials with adhesive on it so there was a boy of residue on the product
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great App.  Wonderful for children to learn responsibility  for caring for any pet.  you have to earn your coins and diamonds by taking care of the horse.  the training is fun.even cleaning the paddock is a fun game. great for all ages. This will be an app I will enjoy for a long time.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is my opinion... it's a solitaire game. What's to complain about except reviews requiring twenty<br /> words... I could go on, but only because I am forced to do so.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. so far its the best one out there. its nice an simple. but really fun I highly. recommend. it if you love horse games
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|It took a bit to learn the new changes from the first edition of the game, but I did and I love it! Can't stop playing it.
B00101ZOTK|5.0|Simply, one of the best movies ever! Very intriguing. It has you from the start and the Ending--Wow! With a cast like this you can't fail with the support of the script. This is a movie I'll keep coming back to.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a solid solitaire game. Pretty much what you expect from a free game. Works fine and no glitches.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Rock Gods reunite for a one-off show that any die hard zep fan will love! Nothing else needs to be said.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|SUPPORT CLUTCH! Buy their album. It's good as they always were. Clutch rules. SUPPORT CLUTCH! Buy their album. It's good as they always were. Clutch rules.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I enjoy playing match-3 games, especially if they have an interesting theme or story line to go with play. Unfortunately, the game keeps going white and I've had to reload 2 times. I don't why it does this except it is a bug that should be fixed. Otherwise, I like the music and graphics. The puzzles are challenging but I'm not fond of the stamp collecting feature. Overall, I'd give this 4 stars.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Hi, I love it as I have been a big Bee Gee fan for years, I took my Grandson to see Barry Gibb when he came to Australia and I want to show him what they were like altogether, he love it too.From Sandra
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I will not give away the ending of the movie or anything else that could be considered a spoiler, but it's a good film to being with!  This is a film that makes you feel human, no matter what side of the earth you are from, how many movies now-a-days makes someone feel so human?  Probably many others, but this one is a treat!<br /><br />This is a great British film, although the British have many great films in comedy and drama, this takes the cake! It is a great film about a group of Brits that go to India for different reasons!<br /><br />Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a widow and seeks not only to take care of the debts left to her by her now-passed on husband, but she decides that maybe she might like it in India and might want to work there!<br /><br />Graham (Tom Wilkinson) is a judge, decides to retire in India, and he wants to look for an old friend he knew since childhood and meet up with him again.<br /><br />Jean (Penelope Wilton) and Douglas (Bill Nighy)  are wanting to retire in India, although as the story comes along Jean hates it there and Douglas is just happy to be there because it's different, its new and it's wonderful to him!<br /><br />While single mom Madge (Celia Imrie) goes there to find another husband, another singleton on the trip Norman (Ronald Pickup)  is going there to feel young again...yes feel young again, and not in the way you might want to think either.<br /><br />Muriel (Maggie Smith), a retired housekeeper who is in great physical pain,  goes to India to seek a less expensive service of doing it.  However, Muriel has some issues with Indians since she is so Anglo-centric in nature.<br /><br />Of course this is how the hotel comes into play!  There is a side story about the hotel owner named Sonny (Dev Patel), who does all he can to keep the hotel and convince the group Brits and everyone else that it's a great hotel!  He also plans to keep the heart of his beloved girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae) even though his mother and her brother prefer it not be that way!<br /><br />The story has a wonderful plot, a lot of funny parts, and a lot of sad ones too.  It also has great character development and a great ending!
0757302661|5.0|As a Doula, Perinatal Tech, and a Navy Corpsman working on L&D throughout the world that this really helps and it works for the mothers who prepare themselves for the “Marathon of Labor”. I feel every pregnant woman should read Hypnobirthing; it is a great book and is based on the work (1930’S) of Dr. Grantly Dick-Read, a British physician in the often called the father of natural childbirth.<br />Hypnobirthing: The Mongan Method by Marie F. Mongan is not mind control or brainwashing. Marie uses education to help decrease stress, anxiety and Fear.  Using her relaxation scripts, exercises and mental imagery (your Happy Place) the &#34;Fear-Tension-Pain Cycle” can be broken.  Hypnobirthing is easy to understand and it is well laid out for the women to help her give birth naturally and without pain.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I love the looks of this watch but it has the pro's and con's of being a automatic, you will either have to wear it all the time or have a automatic winder or reset it a lot.
B0045JEPXK|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Leona Lewis and I was NOT disappointed buying this live CD.  Her voice is absolutely amazing!
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I have all the soundtracks AND all the scores from each Twilight saga movie. Each one has a certain vibe that is reflective of the storyline of each movie. Lets all be honest to recognise that these books were all written to appeal to a younger audience. And we all know none of these movies would ever be academy award material. That said I think the mix of artists and the songs selected for each movie show a greater maturity than the books and the movies do. I was actually surprised and somewhat disappointed at the inclusion of more well known artists such as Green Day and a new current pop sensation like Elle Goulding and angsty Christina Perry. I have appreciated discovering newer less known artists featured on these soundtracks. That's part of their appeal for me.
B00962341U|5.0|This is Leona's BEST CD to date.  I just can't stop listening to it.  If you're a fan of Leona, you will not be disappointed after buying this one (whatever the price is!).<br /><br />P.S.  I got the Deluxe Edition and I love the acoustic versions of Trouble, Come Alive and Glassheart plus the additional three songs Colorblind, Sugar and Collide.
1608871088|4.0|This book is gorgeous!<br /><br />It has a few pages per character and includes sketches and the final cg look.<br /><br />The only negative (and this is with many art books lately) is that some of the sketches are a little small.<br /><br />Besides that, this art book is great! :)
B009KEN87O|5.0|Growing up the Space Invaders era makes this game the best. You never know how much you miss something until you find it again. While this is not Space Invaders, it is a very good Retro version. If this wasn't the free app of the day, and I knew how good it was, I would pay the $2.99 for it. Very good game. Great job Noctua!
B00AUA67GQ|3.0|I find myself frequently using this app.  That said I believe it could be improved.  The issues I've noticed:<br /><br />*I write fast and this app seems a little insensitive and slow to pick up my strokes.  Therefore it would not be effective to use in a meeting where I must take notes quickly.<br />*There is a very small, less than 20% (on the bottom no less) of the screen I can use to actually write on.  Then you \\"enter\\" the few words you've managed to fit on this screen so that they appear miniaturized on the notebook portion of the app.  This makes for an awkward and unauthentic writing experience. You also could not use this app to doodle or diagram.<br />*Moving around the paragraph or page you are generating is also not intuitive. God forbid you want to go back and edit or move what you've written.<br />*Finally, I've been told I have excellent penmanship, but my handwriting always looks like scribble on this app.  Similar to when I sign on a point of sale device.<br /><br />It looks like the premium version has loads of features.  This does the job for simple notes/lists, but takes some getting used to.  I'm still looking for an app that I can just simply jot down some notes.
B0091VTISO|2.0|After seeing the previews for this movie, I was really interested in watching it. However, the movie had poor dialogue and plot which took away alot.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I loved this movie! Awesome graphics and acting! I can't wait to see the sequel next! This movie arrived quickly and in the promised condition!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I've never been a big fan of 3D, but I bought a new TV that happened to have 3D and my blu ray play was 3D ready so I decided to give it a try.  The movie is OK, but I am a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy so I think my expectations may have been a little high.  The quality of 3D was great.  The landscape scenes is where I most appreciated 3D.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|If you are a fan of the books, then you will be a fan of the HBO series.  It's a little different than the book, but still very entertaining. Definitely recommend.
B007PKDW44|5.0|I can't say there is a bad track on the album.  I don't feel sorry for the purchase.  I also liked the fact that I got a digital copy with my pruchase.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Totally enjoyed this app. Hope there are more difficult levels. But great for road trips and passing the time. Very clear picture with the great option on turning the sound off.
B000GIXLO8|5.0|highly recommend for fans of the trilogy. extended edition adds many good scenes to the theatrical that enhance the movie watching experience.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|Quite a humble book for such a celebrity to write. This details Portia's teenage issues with food, her mother's disordered eating and the anorexia that almost claimed her life. The OCD side of anorexia was explained in detail and it was great to read the bit where she started hurling abuse back at the 'Sargent Major'.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|This is the first review I've written on here but felt I had to because the ending is horrible. The first two books were fantastic but I wish I would have never read this one. I am extremly disapointed.
B0082FPIY8|4.0|This book is very well written and I was captivated from the start. I'm not normally a fan of 'Oprah' books but this was really did surprise me.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I thought how stupid at first but it grows on you and you know you wont be able to set it down after you get aways into it give it a try and have some fun.
044661758X|5.0|Classic Harry Bosch in action...this was the second Michael Connelly book I read and after Angel's Flight it's the best also. Michael Connelly writes in a slightly different way to many other authors of this genre of book, and the books are always somehow more personal to the character of Bosch as a result.<br />Highly recommended read!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This has a bit of the touch of angry birds but a new way to move your characters it takes practice when you get farther into the game is a great twist you wont go wrong
0446582778|5.0|This was the book that got my addicted to the Harry Bosch series. It's an excellent read and even now I keep wanting to re-read it.<br /><br />Connelly's character of Harry (Hieronymous) Bosch really held my interest, as did the details of the plot. It's not your typical book in the genre - the author does not shy away from the dark details but doesn't write in a sensationalist way either.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|This is a helpful way to learn what is in the background and you just can't put your finger on it.  It will allow you to rest easy well worth having on your person to answer those fun ?s
0552154016|3.0|A much publicized and talked about book and it sounded great from the description. But to me it fell a bit flat somehow. I found the plot interesting but elements were quite superficial too. I wouldn't read another until there was nothing else in the house...
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Here is the original in a fun atmosphere.  I new way to play the old school you wont be disappointed and you will have fun getting into the holiday feeling
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I play this daily. like this for the most part especially cause its free. would recommend this mahjong to anyone who likes this type of game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Graphics are fun and the new birds and such make it fun.  Same as the old just a new look and feel it is fun and a great time killer
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is terrible. I heard from so many friends that I should read it. I read the reviews in the kindle store after my husband did. I should have listened when they all said how badly this book sucks.I'm pretty sure the author is some horny 16 year old girl. It's completely unrealistic which I could handle if the writing weren't so terrible. She repeats herself constantly with Anastasia biting her lip and scowling. Or Christian cocking his head to one side. The book may as well have been written by a group of middle school girls. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
B009KEN87O|3.0|If you grew up on the old school you will feel like you are lacking not haveing to fire and being able to move so much.  But you will still have fun but a bit lacking
B009KEN87O|5.0|Reminds me of when games were simple and fun.  I have always been a fan of Galaga.  This game is similar.
B00846WWVM|5.0|This is not easy but very fun and very very addictive playing angles moving rocks and so much more this is a must
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT IS GREAT! More people should buy it . Sometimes I think that minecraft pocket edition should update faster and a lot better updates
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Book was impossible to put down.  Very  easy to to read and to actually envision  this happening.  Would definitely recommend this to family and friends!!!
B002WIDRM6|4.0|I really liked this CD, great group, easy listening.<br />Great tunes to sing along to. I'm not a total country fan<br />as I like all types of music, but this one is easy on the ears.<br />Would recommend,jb
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I've played the original hungry shark and I was actually a little hesitant to download this one (the other on  wasn't as fun and you had to pay for it) but when I got this one I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. It had a great storyline and the graphics were really nice. What I dislliked about it was that a lot of the objects had to be clicked several times before they would be acknowledged and removed from the screen. This caused sarcastic messages to appear on the screen which made you feel that you were being chided for clicking on the items too many times. There was also the problem that some of the objects were practically impossible to see or hidden inside or under another object.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I got this app for my husband the day we received our Kindle. Now I think we're going to have to get a second Kindle because he can't put it down. Haha.
B00B7IJDMA|1.0|While there are some decent songs on this failed excuse of a \\"soundtrack\\" album, this release in an insult to the fans and the composer of the show. The artists on this album deserve to have their music released, but this should have been an accompaniment album or tracks of an actual original soundtrack album that features the terrific score composed by Bear McCreary. Whats worse, they didn't even put the original theme on this CD, but instead a horrific remix version. Listening to this album only makes me desire the music that truly reflects the exciting and emotional intensity of The Walking Dead, and that is the original score.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am hopelessly addicted to Pinterest. Now I have it with me where ever I go. This app is easy to use and I use it often.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Lost souls is a very relaxing game with beautiful graphics and a good story. On the easy side but challenging enough to hold your interest. I recommend this game.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was very good. In the end you really feel empowered and open eyed about Charlie and the rest of his friends. I recommend this book to everyone who likes stories that are good but also a little sad.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I did not how wonderful this is till just a couple days ago.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves crafts or anything one is interested in to find more about it this is the place.  I love pinterest more than I can say.<br />Janice P.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Logic dictates that the veracity of a statement is unrelated to the credibility of the speaker: something is either true or not, regardless of who says it.  Dr. Alexander's professional credibility does however, give one reason to take his analysis of his experience seriously.  If one can set aside the overt Christian assumptions he makes, the book makes an interesting, even compelling antidote for scientific materialism by viewing our brains as receivers of pan-consciousness, rather than organic generators of individual consciousness.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|I chose to read this book  because I was interested in the movie. I found it an excellent read,I couldn't put it down. It is an great story. I saw the movie halfway through  the book but still couldn't put the book down. My wife alerted me to the book after I saw a movie review which didn't mention the book at all. To me it is definitely worth 5 stars. The movie 3 stars
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Darren cuts straight to the point and plainly states what you need to do to be truly successful and why.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is a great sudoku game. Lots of options, nice display and very intuitive, It reminds me of the old version of &#34;Andoku&#34; before that game added ads in that update and changed it's name. I uninstalled Andoku and replaced it with this game. Definitely worth the purchase.
B00985E3UG|5.0|If you have trouble making wise food choices, you should read &#34;Salt, Sugar, Fat&#34;, &#34;The Omnivores Dilemma&#34;, and &#34;The End of Over Eating.&#34;  &#34;Salt Sugar Fat&#34; really brings into focus that the &#34;processes&#34; in &#34;processed foods&#34; is actually a manufacturing process.  In other words, the foods are not cooked so much as manufactured.  The salt, sugar, and fat are added partially to make things more appealing, and partly because they are a necessary part of the chemical process used to make the food.  It also points out that marketing of a processed food now costs the manufacturer more than the actual product in the box does.  It's impossible to cover everything the book says in a few words, but if you have trouble making good food choices, it's a really good book to read.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Paid $20 for the 3D movie.  Clean and crisp.  Can't wait for part 2!  You should pull the trigger on this.  You will not be disappointed.  I know I wasn't ... What more can you ask for especially for $20!?
B005EHILV4|5.0|I mainly use this mixer as my computer sound card.  Works great. I use this with my DAW's and they always recognize it. It is very easy and simple to use. Has a great solid build quality
B000067QMD|1.0|The sealing discs I received are different from the picture shown. They are NOT compatible with Natural bottles although Philips Avent's official website says they are.
B00062PN6I|1.0|These are the worst headphones ever. The materials are of the lowest quality.  The stitching came undone when I took these headphones off the very first time and the left ear cup went dead after a hours worth of listing to music. These are very un balanced headphones in sound quality
B0068THAGY|4.0|Good movie. Suspense and good action. A little slow in some parts but overall good movie. Movie that kids can watch.
B000062XFG|5.0|Purchased this so we can watch something with our 10 yr old son; We all enjoy the series, characters, and story line.
0817439390|5.0|I am just a beginner and have been learning about Photography as a hobby through you-tube tutorials and I came across this Best-selling book on Amazon. And, boy do I like it? Bryan really does an amazing job of explaining the stuff and makes it easy to understand. I almost feel that I am in a class with him and he is there speaking to me, explaining me. I haven't read the book completely but I really like the way he explained Depth of Field, Aperture, ISO - the key concepts. He explains how the same picture taken with different settings would appear and how the subject and background change - which I felt was  pretty amazing. I will update my review after I complete the book. But, this is one of the gems I'd like read and re-read and it will still give me new insight. Thanks Bryan!!
B000063V8R|5.0|Purchased this so we can watch something with our 10 yr old son; We all enjoy the series, characters, and story line.
B00BMR5HOO|1.0|I got 3 different weather apps and this one couldn't' find my city or even SACRAMENTO CA ITS THE CAPITOL OF THE STATE. That is really lame so deleted it and used another one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The actual story line of this book is amazing.It's a romance story after you look past the sensuality of the book you will find out that the characters truly complete each other.loved it
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game for teens and older kind of creepy without being gross. Holds your interest but not overly difficult. Great for casual game play.
B009KEN87O|5.0|this was an amazing game...no glitches and i thought it was really fun. i would suggest this game to anyone it is so fun
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love these books.  Everything about them is amazing.  The character development, the way he sets the scene, the descriptions of food!  An epic read!
B009G41CG2|5.0|This game is a good mind challenge. You have to have good eye and mind coordination. Highly recommend this to those who love a challenge without getting frustrated.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can take it to Bible study without having to carry my big Bible, My daughter, & sons gave me the Kindle for Mother's Day, Just can't afford to buy books to read.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I purchased this cover for my daughter. She loves the color and it look good but the standing up doesn't work as well as we thought it would but she's satisfied with it and that makes me happy.
B0063GORYU|3.0|The print is to small for my fingers to work, I guess I am getting old and cannot see it has well as I would like to.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This was a great, witty read and will be sure to entertain any reader, whether familiar with Ellen's style or new to her humor.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game. Simple to learn. Easy to play, yet challenging enough to be fun. Especially for us old school that grew up playing space invaders.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|To much detail. This could have been added to book two. This book had no substance do  me. Book two was the best.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was completely engrossed in this book and its characters from the first chapter. I have never read a book that was written in this format and I really enjoyed the story, as twisted and slightly ridiculous as it was. It even made its way into my dreams many nights. It was extremely interesting to begin l liking and rooting for one character, and then have that whole image flipped halfway through the book. I was sad when it ended. I wanted just a bit more.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|great movie! so fun and enjoyable. even the bf liked it. thanks. a a a a a a a a
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This Blu-Ray contains all of the Godfather movies, which we have loved since the first time we saw them. If you want to buy all of them, this is the collection to buy, with its extras included.
B004D20JP2|5.0|This is a modern version of Peter and the Wolf, I enjoyed this not totally for little kids, with the violence content
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Great album.  Great product and fast shipper.
B009KEN87O|2.0|seems like a great game but it crashes within minutes of playing. sometimes when I get a power up, sometimes when I get hit. disappointing!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Colorful fun, and addictive! I really enjoy the bonuses and special effects of the graphics. Totally addictive, a great way to spend a rainy afternoon! Really great app for my Kindle Fire.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Free game of the day. Good game not to hard not to easy.  Nice music good game play.  Easy to get addicted to
0670026182|5.0|I haven't made anything yet, but the recipes look great. The photography is beautiful--the food jumps right off the page.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|In 2011, I was awarded at work with a Kindle Fire, which got stolen,and recently I purchased a Touch/Slide Phon, downloaded the Kindle App and Amazon Mp3 Cloud Player and got EVERYTHING back that I've purchased! So, I LOVE it!
B002OQT928|5.0|We love this movie. I have a three yr old and the movie keeps his attention and isn't scary. As a family we can enjoy this movie, great for kids and adults.
6305320802|5.0|I come from Pennsylvania about 20 miles from where Shirley Jones was born and raised.  So any movie with her in it is a favorite of mine.  I also remember having a crush on Gordon McRae when I was young.  So, Oklahoma is not only OK, it is spectacular.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked it!<br />Easy read, story moves along and characters likeable.  Need to see the movie now, although I don't picture Juliann Hough as Katie.
B0007939NO|5.0|I have enjoyed Brigadoon for a long time, in both the movie form, and I saw the play in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania when I was in college.  The play was so fascinating then and I saw the movie a number of times.  I think it is one of the best movies around, far and above the movies being seen today.
B0074AGVWK|5.0|LOOOOOve Maeve. Always a good, clean read. Will keep her books for repeat reading agian, and again, and again. Love her!
0800141660|5.0|I love Emma Thompson and think she did a great job in this movie. I also love the movies made from Jane Austin's books. I have watched it several times already and will watch it many more times. I would recommend this if you like Jane Austin's books.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|i thought it was the most amazing thing ive seen. it was amazing to see something like that captured on video!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have this book five stars because I couldn't put the book down. I wasn't very happy with the way it ended, it was very abrupt. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B009MO5E10|5.0|One thing I couldn't remember where I saw this person, until some told me that he was the actor from a show called third rock from the sun and all so the 50/50 movie. This is such a good movie to watch and I would recommend everyone watch.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I found this edition extremely easy to use.  The different stories and chapters can easily be brought up in the index.  The stories, of course, are absolutely original and complete.  A true joy to read and reference.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|I have loved the Hobbit series since 1970 when I first read the books. I was disappointed that the entire first book was only half covered. I felt like there were too many flashbacks & too many lengthy dark scenes.Would loved to have seen more of the dragon as it was done it the book.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A phenomenal read. Seems to be more in depth and detail than its described. Los of imagery you can almost see everything that you read.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Washington was great as was the supporting cast. Very good movie. I was surprised at the ending which is refreshing. I would recommend it to others.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is the little critter you love!  Kind of tricky learning to get him to go where you want on a tablet since there is no actual joystick, but it's part of the fun.  This is just a mini-version for free,  but always enjoy it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It was riveting and met all my James Bond expectations. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone who loves Bond.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|With this CD I get to relive seeing him in concert singing these songs.  I am going to order one for my son in law.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really hope you get  finished with house of Hades early so I can read it good luck Rick Riordan
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is hilarious and I would advise anyone to watch it.  Especially if you work in the field of sciences
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun and like a smaller sim city. It is more involved than you would think. It takes time and planning to build your town and there are daily rewards!
B0028OF7TA|5.0|Good picks, essential compilation of MJ's songs. Box and packaging is dainty and would make a very nice gift.<br />Recommended
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The game can be a bit hard in the beginning but once you get it, your gold. The graphics are mostly static and I think could be more detailed but I didn't take stars cause it's still a fun casual SIM.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This collection of blog posts is a breath of fresh air everyday. Even though you could go through all the archives on her blog, who really wants to do that? I highly suggest this book to anyone interested in minimalism.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great game, the hidden object scenes were masterfully done and they weren't too difficult. The storyline of the game was intriguing as were the scene shots. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this game.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Ah the good old days just can't be beat. Brings back so much memories. My favorite game on my S3.
B008PWN0I4|1.0|First, the connection felt loose and \\"crackly\\". Ultimately, I kept getting a message saying that it wasn't compatible. I just returned it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Not once did I root for a character and I hated the ending. It might just be me and my selfish ways of wanting the ending to go a certain way but I was just not satisfied with the ending. I loved the plot but none of the characters appealed to me. I wanted to at least liked one character in the book. The twist was amazing, but I was left wanting more. The end was annoying because there was just no closure. I wanted more but was left with little. I definitely enjoyed the writing and reading it was enjoyable, but I was not compelled at all during the time I read it. I just read it at my own pace. I wouldn't recommend it to friends.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|We have seen several Cirque du Soleil shows in person and after three we were bored.  But this 3D with the fantastic music kept us watching and watching ,........wonderful show.  Have ordered several other movies...much better than the shows......No other ;people annoying, talking, etc.  Greatly rate this show as the best.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Beautiful photography, then nada! It was a movie that didn't move. The&#34;best picture&#34; advertising is balony. Don't waste your time.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Never thought I'd enjoy a novel centered in India.  Beautifully written.  Some parts unbelievable -- but I couldn't put it down.
B0000AOV85|5.0|A must for any Floyd fan. Celebrate the 40th anniversary of The Darkside of the Moon by going through the creation of the masterpiece with the artists that lived and breathed the experience. This rockumentary celebrates all the blood, sweat and tears that Floyd went through to create a sound so legendary, so unique, it can only be Pink.
1616550414|5.0|Love this book to death. Amazing information in a very well constructed hardcover book. A ton of information that really opens up the world that Shigeru Miyamoto created to everyone who has ever been a fan of the Zelda series. Definitely reccomend it to anyone interested in learning more about the world that their favorite Hero of Time inhabits.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I'd give this five stars if you could change the pictures on the tiles. But there's a lot of variety, it's fun and it's free. I especially love how the tiles automatically rearrange if you run out of moves. The goal is to beat the clock, and you don't have to worry about making every move perfect. I like this free version so much that I feel no need to buy the full version.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is so great to have all the entire series in one<br />place. No more searching on line for missing episodes.<br />The three unaired episodes are an added bonus for sure.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|App is great works really well with the kindle fire hd and whenever you put in the charger the app pops straight up and tells you how long it will take to charge. It's clear and concise and I would recommend to anyone
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|You can't come across a NA without it being compared to this novel so I finally decided to give it a try and boy-o-boy was I rewarded.  This is New Adult in all of its glory but without too much of what I find irritating.  Yes they both have some baggage but they are not \\"broken\\".  Yes their road to HEA has some up and down and misunderstandings, but all of which I completely understood and believed.  Best of all, these are some incredibly compelling and likeable characters and this had and honest to goodness plot, not just a series of romantic situations.  I can see why everyone seems to compare NA fiction to this Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0089CLOZQ The Inadvertent Thief (The Thief)]]
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think this book was the best I have ever read, it took my breath away. I couldn't put it down!It was so interesting it had so many details inside of it .
B0060ANZ2Y|1.0|was really looking forward to this cd , got it yesterday  VERY DISAPPOINTED ! this is the first time ever getting an EWF cd in a AC/DC cover what's up with that? do better
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was so wonderful. It kept me on my feet and so spine tingling God it was beautiful. Love it
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Ok maybe not beautiful. I read the reviews and it took me a while to read this book after reading the negative stuff. But when I finally read it I loved it.I cried and laughed and fell in love with all the characters. I couldn't put it down. Great book!!!
B005M0R4X4|4.0|This is the British Version of the second series. It's beautiful to look at, of course, in High-def.<br /><br />Note that this Blu-ray DOES NOT contain the &#34;Christmas Special&#34; episode which is the season 2 finale.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Fun read, characters are very well drawn, and storyline creative. Hard at times to follow the relationships. You will definetly root for your favorites!
B0091THDOM|1.0|Poor product design, the leather quality is great, is the difficulty of get the phone in and out, I used it for 2 days, and just left it on my deck
B000EHSN9Y|5.0|Title says it all.  Exactly what I wanted and works great.  Makes me wish this deal was around 7 years ago when I bought the original one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to use. Lots of options. Don't care for the popup's at the start of each game. Would like to see better statistical data.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This is a great CD! Gives you the best songs they made. Most are ones people have heard of so that is always a plus.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|it's different than other similar games but I like it.<br />I can take care of the horse I always wanted.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Complex characters. Excellent flow to the story. Loved every moment of it. Please continue writing - there are very few authors who can modulate their stories into a smooth flow.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I just got a 3D TV, so this is one of the first 3D movies I bought. I already had the 2D extended version. The 3D is not the extended version. My experience is that things that are in front of the screen on a 3D TV don't look as good as they do in the theatre. I also have Amazing Spiderman 3D and it seems to look better.

B009MF5BXK|2.0|Once again a large cast of aging action stars reunite for another assault on the senses.  The leader of the pack is Sylvester Stallone as Barney.  His \\"Robin\\" is the not so old, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas.  That last name will naturally be worth a few jokes along the way.<br /><br />The film opens with Barney, his crew and his aging airplane (symmetry there) are sent to rescue a Chinese (I think) scientist who has knowledge of blueprints of hidden uranium somewhere in a Russian mine.  Barney is a free agent working for the CIA headed by Mr. Church (Bruce Willis).  Church sends Maggie (Nan Yu) with the guys as she has knowledge of safe cracking needed to retrieve the blueprints.<br /><br />An opposing cadre of really bad guys lead by Jean Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) also want the information so they can sell it to more really really bad guys who want to make some bombs.  The movie directed by Simon West and written by Stallone never takes itself too seriously.  There are plenty of inside jokes that those of us familiar with the actors and their movies will all easily get.  Included in the action are Chuck Norris, a \\"lone wolf,\\" Jet Li, Randy Couture, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Liam Hemsworth (someone the younger generation will recognize).<br /><br />As I was watching the opening sequence of the boys attacking the compound to rescue the scientist, I kept thinking of last year's \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" and how that mission was quiet, well planned and stealthily executed.  \\"The Expendables\\" is none of those things.  It is however fun to watch at times no matter how stupid the story.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Enlightening in so many ways. Logically satisfying at almost every turn. Should be required reading for every high school student.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After some searching I came across this mouse. The price seemed right so I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />The build quality is very good. The cord is thick with braided wire so it doesn't get tangled. The USB connection is gold plated. The buttons next to the thumb are big, making them easy to feel which one you are clicking. There is also just enough resistance to these thumb buttons where you won't accidentally press them.<br /><br />The mouse glides nicely across any smooth surface. The lights on the front left are positioned nicely so you can take a quick glance to see what dpi setting you are on. I have long fingers and I think this mouse is very comfortable.<br /><br />I just ask for two things, a less slick body on the right side and software that controls all the LEDs in the mouse.<br /><br />Pros:<br />4 speed settings<br />Big Thumb buttons<br />Weight adjustment<br />A lot of Buttons<br />Software<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can't control all light colors<br />Slick surface on the right side

B0087IT8FK|5.0|An excellent balance of humor and tragedy in this man's physical situation.  Very sad that it didn't get a nomination at this year's Oscars.
0767821629|5.0|Has some of the same basic ideas as The Matrix, in which reality and virtually reality become indistinguishable.  The special effects are not in the same league as those of the Matrix, which I think is a blessing, since special effects have long since become tiresome in all but a few movies.  The acting in The 13th Floor is a bit wooden, but I thought the plot far more interesting then The Matrix.  It skips all the pseudo intellectual mumbo jumbo ( which is not science anyway ) of the Matrix and delivers a good story.  Better acting would have the film more engrossing, but it's still very worthwhile.

B000FC10MU|3.0|I really thought American Gods was going to be great. I've read other Gaiman books, and been facinated and delighted. Everyone kept saying - you haven't read American Gods!? Its his best book! And many claimed it was their favorite book of all time.<br /><br />So, with great anticipate, I began American Gods. It started out really slow. I didn't get much feeling about or for the main character, whose name is Shadow, of all things. For me, this non-name made it hard to relate to him. He was descirbed as having emotions on rare occasions, but I never really felt that he really felt them, and I in turn didn't feel them. Same with thoughts and opinions. I felt Shadow was just a dust mote blowing in the wind, ineffectual, along for the ride, driving nothing, making nothing happen. And I didn't care.<br /><br />In addition, the way Gaiman wrote made it hard for me to be involved at all with the story or characters. Everything was \\"told\\" instead of \\"shown\\". We are told a great deal about what people were wearing or what they looked like, often in gritty detail (or what I suppose is supposed to be \\"gritty\\" which really seemed to translate into ineffectual graphic displays of sex and/or violence), with many omniscient remarks about dark and twisted pass times people may have or whether the waitress is hiding anorexia (but she is really too thin to be attractive anyway). I didn't find these details gritty at all, and the impression I got was that these details were TRYING to be gritty without actually having that effect, in effect, trying too hard. Same with the graphic sex and violence. I don't mind graphic scenes, but only if they add or are essential to the plot, not just used for shock value. I read Game of Thrones, where violence and sex are used to great effect to explain and further the plot, its essential to Martin's whole story. Not so with American Gods. I saw no reason except as an attempt to shock, but mostly just had me rolling my eyes.<br /><br />But, the premise of the story, and the interesting take on gods, godesses and mythology is an interesting one and could have made for a very interesting story, but sadly that is not the case. I found it a long, boring story about Shadow going where the wind blows him, where I am told and told and told much, shown little and feel nothing. I never once felt emotionally involved, nor did I care in the least what happened to any of the characters. It took me days to slog through, where I can finish a really good book in a matter of hours, especially something like American Gods which is a easy read, but I kept putting it down to read - well, anything else - news articles, magazines, other books I've already read. American Gods was kind of boring for me. It was simplistic, predictable and I didn't see that this was advertised as a young adult book, and with some of the content, I doubt it is, but it read like a young adult book to me. I felt like it was trying to get an effect, trying to be gritty and adult, in a way that just didn't happen for me.<br /><br />I read another review that summed up perfectly what I couldn't put my finger one. This book read like something written by a talented high school student who was trying to create something symbolic and unusual, something that makes a \\"STATEMENT\\" (yes, a statement of the capital letters inside quotations kind of statement), but ends up with something that is boring, so distant as to be without substance, and something that just ends up reading like it is INTENDED to be deep and meaningful but isn't in anyway. It doesn't even have good characters or an interesting plot.<br /><br />I just don't get the hype I've heard for this book.e of the story, and the interesting take on gods, godesses and mythology is an interesting one and could have made for a very interesting story, but sadly that is not the case.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a great app and have had no issues on buffering or out of date stations.  Great for recording programs to listen to at a later date.  The only complaint is that there does not seem to be a way to edit your &#34;original&#34; favorites from the desktop version.  Given the use of desktops/laptops is becoming old technology, surprised that a paid version will not allow editing.  Full disclosure:  I received this as part of Amazon's &#34;Free App of the Day&#34; so in a sense by default I would like an upgrade from the free version.

B00BESIKWM|4.0|its a movie based on a video game that tries to fix problems from the previous movie (which reduced \\"the order\\" to a group of witch hunters and made people who never played the game think rose& co. were just dead). Its not Shakespeare people! yes it lacked the musical impact from the games/ first movie and they shouldn't have made it 3d (which meant they had to keep trying to make things \\"jump out\\" at you. But keep in mind, if they try to make the fans 100% happy then the common man will be confused and annoyed... if they ignore the fans, they might as well make some other movie. Is it worth watching? yes. no matter how they would've done it, people would have complained. i'm glad they made it.

0385523912|5.0|Wow. This book absolutely blew my mind. I came across it after reading an interview of Katherine Boo, author of \\"Behind the Beautiful Forevers\\", who recommended it. Having read that most acclaimed book, I bought \\"Nothing to Envy\\" hoping it would even come close. It was, in fact, infinitely better.<br /><br />I loved this book for a few reasons:<br /><br />*It made me better appreciate how lucky I am to have been born in a Western democracy.<br />*It helped me understand what it is like living in a dictatorship.<br />*It helped me view North Koreans as individuals trying desperately to find happiness in life, rather than mindless drones as they are often portrayed.<br />*It was incredibly well written and a true page turner, all the while being incredibly informative.<br /><br />When I was considering buying this book, I was surprised to see that it had a rating of 5/5 stars on Amazon. Few products have such high scores. I now see why. You don't have to be interested in East Asia, government, poverty, or anything like that to appreciate this book. It is so good that regardless of who you are and what your interests are, you will not be able to put it down.

1400069807|5.0|This book studies the processed food- industry and in speaking with many of its important contributors explains how it has led to the overall fattening up of America, and now the world. It describes the decisions made by scientists and business people in increasing the amount of over- eating in America. It explains the  meaning of such concepts as 'the bliss point' at which the pleasure given by intake of sugar is  at a maximum. It reveals how these companies in their bid to maximum profits by maximizing sales encouraged research to help find ways of inducing increased consumption of their products. It tells the story of food - industry legends like Howard Moskowitz who devised ways of analyzing taste and recreating  product. It too connects these changes with transformations in the American way of life, wherein people instead of eating fixed meals at certain times are jawing away every waking minute. It provides in the course of interesting insight into not simply human but animal appetite. When it comes to Pleasure the rats of this world too are willing to forego the insecurity of the blinding light and venture forth to get their super-sweet treat. It in effect tells a tale of greed and appetite, of damage caused to individuals and society as a whole  by Industry and Science.<br />It does not however offer any real way out of this.

B00BOLE7X0|5.0|I actually saw this movie at the theatre.  The performances of all the actors/actresses were the best I have seen in a long long time.  It took me going home and checking the computer to see who played the part of Lincoln since I didn't see the credits before hand.  It's a great movie well portrayed and I am so glad that Daniel Day Lewis won an Academy award for best actor in this film.  It deserves 5+ stars!

B002XTXG1G|4.0|This was a strange movie but no denying Tom Hardy is an incredible & intense actor.  There could be no real ending as Bronson is still in prison so it can't help but leave the story unfinished.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|ive played this game on the Ipad and I was really excited to see it now for the kindle but the difference in the two are the reason I'm giving it 2 stars. the concept is great and its a fun game but there is a considerable leg when you tap the screen do much that when the red alert mini game starts ive failed it multiple times because even though I tap the dinosaurs it doesn't register and the dinosaur escapes fix it and I will. rate 5 stars!!!
B0034G4P94|5.0|This was a great movie.  I can't believe it didn't get promoted when it came out in theatres.  Tom Hardy is intense.  The physical shape these guys got into for the film is incredible.  Make sure you watch the extras on the dvd.  Nick Nolte was very good too, nice to see him in a meaty role.
B00846REIS|5.0|Who cares if most of what is coming out now has similarities to 50?  I know I don't.  I think Ms. Day is a talented writer and have purchased other books with the same high rating as this one.  I love that I'm not constantly barraged with typos, grammatical errors and boring text.  There's a reason why she is on all the lists of hot erotic romance authors and you see these books when you walk into a bookstore.  Kudos!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Ordered this movie and it came very quickly.  It has been such a delightful movie to watch with our grandchildren.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was quite engaging and sometimes sad.  It gave an honest account of life for young women in the post Depression era.
1451695195|3.0|If you're looking for text that supports Christian beliefs or theology you may be disappointed. However for open-minded or alternative views of life after death, I appreciated the author sharing his experiences,albeit in a Zen kind of way.  For a more traditional (Christian)  treatment of a near death experience, I recommend Todd Beamer's &#34;Heaven Is For Real&#34;.

B006OOHYIC|4.0|Well, today is the day I catch up with all the free app's of the day that I missed and the first one I've tried is Quell Reflect.<br /><br />This is a gorgeous illustrated puzzle game in which you guide a small droplet of water through perils in order to collect pearls. The detail of the backgrounds behind the puzzle is astounding and the puzzles themselves, while simple (from what I've seen) are still detailed and loving rendered.<br /><br />I play this on a Kindle Fire HD and the touch response is fantastic and I have had no issues with lack of response or the little water droplet going where I didn't want it to go. Which is highly important when you're trying to avoid instant death traps.<br /><br />This game also has a tutorial which I'd like to give the developers a hearty thanks for. That is something that many games I have played seem to forget to do, or figure that with only a few controls it should be easy to figure out. It's nice to know what some things do, how to open gates or 'portals', unlocking blocks to get through, or that you can touch three out of four sides of a rounded pike. The tutorial guides you through as you play the levels to tell you what new blocks do or to tell you if you made a move that has made the level not winnable. Both are nice features and along with the fact it is unobtrusive and easily toggled on and off as you play through the entire game makes it one of the nicest tutorials I have seen yet.<br /><br />The menu system is also really nice and easily navigated though I do wish more developers would give you an option to actually quit the game.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is actually the music. The entire game is designed to be peaceful and the music is piano music softly playing. I suppose I have been spoiled by soundtracks from some other apps like Contre Jour (beautiful piano background) and World of Goo. It sounds more like standard piano background, perhaps something you'd hear playing in an elevator or a background to busy work when you need to concentrate. It's not that it's bad, it's that 1) The rest of the game is so good that it stands out as being slightly lacking and 2) Other games have done the same better.<br /><br />All in all I would give this one a 4.5 out of 5 and look forward to playing more of it in the future. The music is a slight nick-pick on my part and others may find it more pleasing or to their taste then I did but it is by far not bad.
B006UUK612|5.0|I like that amazon has a good selection of movies. Usually when I remember a movie that I want to watch amazon has it!
B004YXE438|5.0|This game is definitely targeted at those who enjoy puzzles and have been looking to take them on the road.<br /><br />I am one of those people and missed this game entirely the first time around. In fact, I didn't even know that a well designed game for this genre existed and was pretty skeptical at first when I first saw it.<br /><br />Happily it lives up to expectations and then some. You start off with their tutorial picture for practice to see how the controls work and then you're set off on your own.  You can work on unlocking the pictures (50 in all that come with the original game) or turning any photo on your device into a puzzle of your choosing. You can then select the number of pieces (12-48) and level of difficulty: Easy, Medium or Hard.<br /><br />While 48 pieces may not sound like all that much,on hard (especially depending on the picture you've chosen)it can offer a good challenge. While these won't be the most demanding puzzles you've ever put together they definitely do offer enjoyment for those who love jigsaw puzzles or even people getting into them. Easy and Medium are both very doable and if you ever get really stuck on a puzzle you can chose to make it easier.<br /><br />From what it looks like, you unlock each picture in order and it doesn't matter what difficulty or number of pieces you chose. So if you want to unlock all the pictures quickly you can chose the easy setting and 12 pieces and off you go. Then you can pick any picture after that for any difficulty.<br /><br />Fortunately the menu music doesn't follow you to the actual puzzle assembling which is a good thing since I could see that getting on my nerves after more then 10 minutes. I played this on a Kindle Fire HD and had no problems with responsiveness - in fact it seems too responsive sometimes. I accidentally brushed my finger on a couple of squares here and there, causing them to rotate when I really didn't want them too. Not a big deal though since you can rotate them right back to where you had them. The pictures look stunning at times in HD.<br /><br />While the instructions seem lacking at first (a small pop up window when you push on the tab detailing the very basics of the game) things like difficulty modes are explained in more detail as you come to them.  You are also able to view the picture of the completed puzzle as much as you'd like and can work with multiple pieces at once.<br /><br />All in all I would give this a 4.5 out of 5 and look forward to buying some the puzzle packs for the game that the company offers in the future. While it is free today there is one caveat for those looking at paying for it in the future: if you don't like putting together jigsaw puzzles you probably aren't going to like this game since it is essentially the same thing. In fact I'd say it's a little harder since you can't sort your pieces (you swap two pieces by dragging one to the other) and can't really organize pieces the same way you would when working with a physical puzzle. If that's not something you'd like or be interested in, best to pass this one by.<br /><br />Everyone else - I'd recommend giving it a go.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|I don't know why I am even reviewing this! Everyone knows it is a great flick! I wish I would have bought it rather than rented it on instant but that was my mistake!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I was very lucky to have grabbed this when it was on the free app for the day. I tossed it on my Kindle but put it on the side burner since I was going out of town at the time for the holiday's.<br /><br />I have come back to it recently and just finished. It is a rarity that I see a game as almost perfect and this is one of them. The only lacking aspect is their attempt to toss in a story on top of the puzzle challenges which in the end felt a little incomplete and a slight let down.<br /><br />*SPOILER* It does make you wonder who this corporation was, what happened to everyone else once you blow it up and why MOM was created in the first place. *END SPOILER*<br /><br />Otherwise you have a cute little game where you create things with tiny beings that you would normally see stuck to the bottom of your shoe and cringe. They make the cutest little noises as you build with them and seem to cheer you on. The way you blink, coo and cheer is masterfully done and you may end up feeling guilty when you accidentally kill them while trying to solve the puzzles to get them where they are going.<br /><br />For Kindle users, this game responds well for touch screen users and looks fantastic in HD. There is a whole musical score that was written just for the game which compliments it well. While working on the levels there is usually an option to skip and come back to them later (I skipped 5 during my game play). The puzzles themselves do pose a challenge, I found the ones trying to build in windy conditions the hardest as you're hoovering this massive complex of goo over spinning blades while trying to direct it to the pipe in order to drop off at least all the ones required to complete the level.<br /><br />$4.99 is more pricey compared to many of the apps that are available and one may wonder if the price is worthwhile when they could possibly get five games for that price. If you enjoy physics games and solving puzzles with little creatures that may or may not be all thatstable as building materials then it's definitely worth a try. I found it took me a while to complete the game and there is a challenge type mode available for those that have no souls...erm...who enjoy making puzzles even harder.<br /><br />Only you can decide if the price tag is worthwhile but for a well made, very responsive game I would heartily recommend it if it is your type of game.<br /><br />One last pro - you don't have to have an internet connection to play it which is so nice after having to deal with games demanding it even if you aren't doing anything that would require it.

But seems to repeat it again and again and again.<br />The only lesson I learned was believe in what you believe.

People who has problems to have a positive look on life really should read this book because I know it will help them.

1476733953|1.0|With a talented author, this thing might work as a good short story. Otherwise, it's just a skimmer that might get you through a plane ride from DC to Chicago. I do admire the author's marketing ability to be able to sell something this horrible. The people who love this book (the 5 star reviewers) are taking a stand for mediocrity and the possibility that anyone can write and sell a book even if you have no writing ability. You just need a lame idea that appeals to a lot of people who would otherwise be watching Storage Wars or heading for the shooting range. I do think the price is fair.

B000002B35|5.0|I am a huge Floyd fan but I am not usually a fan of live albums - it does not duplicate the studio production of recorded albums... so I  did not purchase or even really think about buying this album in the many years since its release.... I finally read some Amazon reviews raving about this album, bought and love it. the music is great, the production and quality is great.... and its thoroughly enjoyable by its own rights - another masterpiece ! The album art is incredible....<br />Floyd will always be #1 in my charts and nothing has ever come close.<br />If you haven't heard of Pinback ... I recently found them ... check them out.... most floyd fans will like them

B008JFUNQO|3.0|It seems like the animated films of yesterday were so much more tame compared to the animated films of today.  Yes, this a reference to the violence used in animated films, which typically goes overlooked and receives a free pass - because it's animated.  Apparently, animated violence must not translate the same way as authentic, realistic violence - because violence, whether it's slapstick or not, is clearly visible in the majority of modern animated films.  For instance, when one of the minions playfully hits one of his workmates in Despicable Me, it makes for a good laugh.  If you watch the teaser trailer for Despicable Me 2 (coming this summer), you'll notice one good punch at the end - and it's funny.  It's funny to adults, so children will find it equally as funny, but it's not exactly the proper message to be sending impressionable children.  DreamWorks' newest film, The Croods, also depicts much of the same playful, slapstick violence.<br /><br />The Croods is the story about a family of cavemen living their lives constantly in fear of anything outside of their home - a cave.  Eep Crood (Emma Stone), the oldest of the Crood children, is in her adolescence and at an age where she wants to explore outside the safety zone of her family's cave.  However, her father, Grug (Nicholas Cage) is the fearful leader of the family that believes nothing outside of the cave is safe, and everything leads to death.  One night, Eep meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds) - an adolescent boy (roughly her same age) that tells her the end of the world is upon them and they should be preparing for it.  True enough, a series of unexplained earthquakes destroy the family's cave, forcing the entire family on the run - thrusting them on an adventure to find paradise, which they believe is called, \\"tomorrow.\\"  Catherine Kenner, Clark Duke, and Cloris Leachman also provide voices for the film.<br /><br />Much like an Ice Age film, The Croods begins with a less than humorous chase scene in which the family is trying to steal an egg from some turkey/flamingo creature (as a source of food).  It's instantly reminiscent of an all too familiar squirrel that works tirelessly to recover his nut, only to be constantly thwarted by various coincidental interruptions.  Several similar occurrences take place throughout the film, providing for only a few outstanding moments of humor - one of which includes The Crood's first interaction with fire, where essentially everything in sight ends up being lit on fire.<br /><br />In the character development department, there are very few traits about these characters that haven't been established in other animated films.  Clearly, this is a film about family, featuring the father vs. daughter dynamic, not to mention the father dealing with losing her daughter to a male suitor.  As far as the supporting cast goes, they serve as nothing more than family clich&eacute;s - including the irritating mother-in-law, a moronic fat son, and a baby that acts like the family dog.  And, while there are moments where these characters provide a few laughs (mostly via the previously mentioned slapstick violence), there's still very little that's memorable about them.<br /><br />Early on, the film establishes itself as a theme driven film - depicting The Croods as fearful humans that lack any sensible knowledge about the world around them.  As the film progresses, the father and daughter clash about the nature of living life - with Eep arguing there has to be more to life than living a life filled with fear, hidden away in a cave, while Grug believes there shouldn't be a moment that doesn't include fear.  Over the course of the film, Grug becomes more of the focal point, since he is the one that has to learn to fight his fears, take chances in life, and accept certain risks.<br /><br />Overall, The Croods is your average animated film, yet severely lacks memorability.  Nevertheless, the animation is sharp, colorful, and eye-pleasing, and easily contains enough light-heated adventure to sustain the attention of most children.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  C-<br />FNDNreview.comnough light-heated adventure to sustain the attention of most children.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  C-<br />FNDNreview.com
B00BMVTTJ4|1.0|I hated the movie, the humor was cheap and the combat scenes were way too frantic.<br />Radagast felt like the second coming of Jar Jar Binks. Hey, actually Jar Jar Binks is sophisticated, clever and deft in comparison. Honestly, is there anyone simple enough to enjoy this kind of humor?<br />The dwarves don't look like dwarves, they look like punks with funny hairstyles. Thorin looks... Aragornish.<br />And don't get me started on the ridiculous goblin king or the cartoonish white orc.

B0043JDUNS|1.0|Another example of Disney's incompetence, particularly in the character development of the bad guys. Light whip is this random hobo in russia that just HAPPENS to be a genius that just HAPPENS to have all the parts and tools to make his own iron man suit; add to this cheesy dialogue that makes avengers(which was an even worse movie) sound decent. This movie is just another horrible attempt to earn cash rather than actually be quality entertainment LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE!!!

B009A87Z6U|4.0|It's a strange title, I'll grant you that...but it IS actually one of Ian Fleming's.  FYI: it was not for a novel, but a short story -- from the same collection as \\"(From) A View to a Kill\\" and \\"For Your Eyes Only.\\"  According to Wikipedia, Fleming deemed it to mean the absolute minimum amount of love one needed to maintain a relationship through strife and down times.<br /><br />And, while it's commonly regarded as the least of the three Daniel Craig Bond films, that's like saying it was your third favorite Christmas...I doubt most would give the experience back.  If one sits back and thinks about this movie, though, one discovers it does have a certain flavor unlike the others: it's darker, more negative (both in flavor and storyline) and, yes, it's a little more difficult to follow.  But what it does do well is advance the re-creation of this brand spanking new Bond.<br /><br />It's not going to hurt you to see \\"Quantum\\" as a stand-alone movie, but it works best as the second half of [[ASIN:B0020M99LC Casino Royale]].  This is particularly true in the sense of his avenging the tragic, emotional and traitorous betrayal that took place in the last half hour of that film.  But seeing both allows you to better see the arc of Bond's new characterization, one that already seems to traverse the third movie, [[ASIN:B00B5HQKNI Skyfall]], as well.<br /><br />In \\"QoS,\\" Daniel Craig's consummate portrayal is of a driven Bond--quite literally so, right from the action-packed start, as he's being chased down an Italian coastal highway by two Alfa Romeos full of automatic-weapon-wielding killers.  This, then, places \\"QoS\\" minutes after the end of \\"Casino,\\" which closed with his capture of the man who now lays in his trunk (or boot, as the Brits say).  This man -- the nefarious Mr. White -- was behind the theft of the money Bond won from LeChiffre during the casino game (but how he escaped all those bullets is beyond me).<br /><br />What follows is a somewhat involved trail of chasing the money, all of which places Bond and compatriots upon the path of financier and faux environmentalist Dominic Greene, whose nefarious plans are soon to be revealed.  And our spy is not alone: he's been joined by a woman named Camille Montes, who is seeking vengeance against deposed ex-general Medrano, whose organization Greene is helping to get back into power in exchange for what seems to be a useless piece of desert--though we are soon to know more.<br /><br />So, yes: \\"QoS\\" is a bit complex, and there is much I haven't even hinted at.  And, obviously, there are all sorts of exotic locales: Austria, Bolivia, Italy, Chile, Russia, and of course England -- to name a few.  And there are some vintage Bond-isms: (SPOILER ALERT!) not only does he seduce a sweet British agent named (gulp) Strawberry Fields, sent to keep an eye on him, but she is found dead by way of being coated head to toe in oil -- an ugly death reminiscent of Jill Masterson's demise by gold body paint in [[ASIN:B002BXRCV4 Goldfinger]] almost--eek!--a half a century ago.<br /><br />And CIA agent Felix Leiter is here again -- apparently the first time the same man has played Leiter two movies in a row.  Another returning character from the previous film is Rene Mathis, Bond's ally in \\"Casino Royale.\\" Unfortunately, Mathis has been living in disgrace after being blamed for Bond's kidnapping at the end of that film, and he needs some persuasion to return to action.<br /><br />But in this recent triplet of Craig films, Bond is being reinvented before our eyes: while he enjoys sophistication, it is no fey affectation; given the rigors of the job, he feels it is his due, and probably belies his own past, one that will be given more play in the third film...SKYFALL.  The first film fitted him out as a tough, dogged, and fierce agent, but this second one is painting him as a cold, vengeful man who understands the efficacy of violence and the price it can cost.<br /><br />As proof, when a close companion dies under Bond's watch, he hugs the dying man closely, tenderly reassuring him as he passes.  Yet moments later, when this companion succumbs, he coldly dumps his body in a dumpster, claiming it no longer matters.<br /><br />It is an existential act that displays him as a man who lives by a code outside of society or even religion. Sentimentality comes at a price, and it is one from which he is doing his best to wean himself.  Certainly, Vesper's love mattered a great deal, one even a freshman spy knew was worthy of a decision, and in \\"Casino\\" he stayed true to her and divorced himself from MI6.  But, when that romance ended bitterly, Bond returned, hardened against the \\"mistake\\" of such an act.  From now on, nothing matters but the case.<br /><br />A perfect example of the dichotomy this code must deal with is seen in Bond's loyalty to the cause. In other words, finding what evil action Dominic Greene is perpetrating supersedes all others at present including his own: finding the man responsible for Vesper Lynd's death. When his dogged pursuit of Greene causes big repercussions, he is ordered off the case...twice. And there is no doubt about it: not only is he called off the case, he has his status as a spy suspended and M actually has him arrested.<br /><br />But this Bond is more dogged than that: in each case he refuses to obey that order, shedding the entourage of agents who escort him into an elevator as easily as shrugging off a jacket.  Yet he still thinks enough of his duty that he leaves the elevator and waltzes STRAIGHT BACK TO M and tells her to include in her report that agent Fields did her job to the best of her ability.<br /><br />It is interesting that while Bond thinks nothing of the agency's stranglehold on him, he cares enough that another agent's file compliments her.  And he seems unwilling to hold a grudge against the very woman who would attempt to have him arrested; quite to the contrary, he reports back to her at every significant point in the story.  At the end, having performed his duties better than anyone could have hoped M tells him he is back on the force, and his answer to her says it all: \\"I never left.\\"<br /><br />So, while Craig's Bond shares many similarities with previous Bonds, he is no longer the wisecracking Teflon spy who slays his foes at most with difficulty, but never bears the scars.  No -- while this Bond may always get his man, his brutality is often matched by others', and he is often wounded physically, mentally and, as we have seen, romantically.  His wounds in this regard are obvious to all who know him well.  While he is told to forgive Vesper, as well as himself, for her betrayal and death, he still broods regardless, as if it is another order he cannot obey.<br /><br />I am an ardent Bond fan, and I love Craig's portrayal of him: he may be my favorite.  While the spy had undergone several humiliating transformations--particularly during the Roger Moore years, which I felt did him a disservice equal to Joel Schumacher's [[ASIN:B000GT5YWO Batman Forever]] -- I love where Craig and his screenplay writers (Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade) are taking Bond.  The concept of re-inventing him in modern times -- effectively wiping out the entire series up to this point -- was brilliant, though risky.<br /><br />They have transformed him into a gritty, realistic and vengeful killer who with this movie is two-thirds of his way toward becoming the man we have come to know him as: a consummate field agent with ice in his heart. While that particular quest is only a side note to this movie, its accomplishment does serve to give him a...well, quantum...of solace.ion dies under Bond's watch, he hugs the dying man closely, tenderly reassuring him as he passes.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I always like to read a book before I see a movie so that was my plan with this book. I find Life of Pi well written and entertaining. As I am reading I have my own movie playing inside my head and because the author writes so well that movie is pretty vivid. There are some excerpts that are pretty graphic and I find myself mentally trying to turn away as I would if I was seeing it on the big screen. I haven't finished the book yet, but each time I open it I look forward to hearing more of the story of Pi.

0553593544|3.0|I had reason to read this again after a loooong time, not really remembering much about it.<br /><br />First, forget the movie. The only things the book and movie have in common are the title and the names of the main characters. This can be both good and bad. The good part is that you don't know what's going to happen based on Matt Damon's adventures; the bad part is that it's not nearly as much fun.<br /><br />This is about as close as Ludlum gets to a semi-realistic espionage thriller. He'll never be mentioned in the same breath as LeCarre and Silva as someone who \\"gets it right,\\" and his taste for subterranean conspiracy and ultra-secret global cabals is what put me off him to begin with. Still, here he manages to rein himself in. Bourne himself is more sympathetic than most literary killing machines (his body count is far lower than Matt's), and even though his flashbacks happen in the most conveniently inconvenient times, you still get a good feeling for the angst he suffers from not knowing which of several competing histories is his. The twists and turns aren't always predictable (this is a good thing), and Ludlum is quite capable of vividly setting and managing a stage.<br /><br />Two aspects of this novel proved problematic for me. First is the heroine, Marie. She's presented as a smart, educated woman with a responsible grown-up government job...who falls deeply (almost irrationally) in love with Bourne after less than eight days together, during nearly two of which she's his hostage(!). Really? When you spend 4/5 of a novel asking \\"Why is she doing that?\\" and the only answer is \\"She's in lurve,\\" you know there's a problem.<br /><br />Second is the antagonist. When Ludlum wrote The Bourne Identity, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez - aka Carlos - was the hot flavor-of-the-week for global terrorism and not a great deal was known about him. So Ludlum makes him the invincible terrorist genius-mastermind who has suborned officials both high and low on every continent except Antarctica, has limitless resources and eyes on every street corner (that global cabal Ludlum was so fond of). It probably worked in 1975. Now, however, we know what a thug and clown Carlos was, that he botched many of his operations, and that he spent a lot of time scraping for money from one sponsor or another. As such, it's mostly impossible to take seriously his portrayal in this novel. We can still read and believe a period piece like LeCarre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy because we know the Soviet security services truly were formidable adversaries. Bourne, already saddled with some big credibility problems, struggles mightily to survive this sucking chest wound.<br /><br />Having re-read The Bourne Identity, I have no interest in going further in the series. It's very much a product of its time and should be read as such. I remain convinced that Ludlum's most entertaining book was The Road to Gandolfo, in which he mercilessly lampooned himself to great effect.
0785132619|5.0|A great book- the movie did a good job of recreating this dark, funny superhero comic book. A solid read.
B005HSL626|4.0|Muy bueno para ese momento de ocio. Si tienes esos momentos en tu vida , debes descargarlo y divertirte sintiendote un ninja.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a great game for horse lover's. I recomend it because its like a virtual pet horse. You feed it, you play with it and so on. I think you should get this app because it teaches you to learn.<br /><br />P.S, its also fun!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Realmente muy bueno para bajar videos y guardarlos en tu kindle. Musicales, de risa, de todo un poco. Lo recomiendo.
B001CEE1YE|4.0|I was always conflicted with the Matrix storyline. I though the first 2 were great movies but never felt the 3rd movie answered all the questions. I last the questions I had. Overall though it's a really good bunch of movies and would recommend it to any fans of sci fi!!
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Every song on this album is ripe with memorable lyrics and riffs. Neil's grizzled voice gives the album intense, raw power. Jean-Paul's jazz/blues, technical drumming is rock solid and makes every track interesting and rich. Clutch just keeps getting better with age.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is a great app and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves connecting with family and friends through social networking
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although I found this one to be more serious than his others, this book had me laughing, crying, and wanting more.  I couldn't put it down.  It is a must read, I feel it made an impact on me.

6305313687|5.0|American History X is one of the best movies ever made about racism and how people get to be like that.  It also shows how people can change after doing the wrong thing their whole life.  I definitely recommend this movie to anybody and everybody.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|One of the greatest apps ever invented. I love using the Facebook app. I use it every day, multiple times a day.
B00005JMCT|5.0|American Wedding is another great sequel in this trilogy.  I never cared to watch the others that were made except the first four.  Everybody came back for this one as well except for Chris Klein 'Oz' Ostreicher and  Mena Suvari as Heather.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is the best weather app ever created. I would highly recommend it to all weather geeks around the world.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is a great movie about how life can be sometimes.  It's a great dark comedy and probably Kevin Spacey's best performance ever.  I'll admit it's a little depressing in some parts, but it keeps you watching because you need to know what happens.  If you like movies with several storylines and like dark comedies that are a little slow, but really good then I highly recommend buying this and watching it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Where is the detail? Where is the romance? Where is the plot line? I guess if you don't have much of an imagination it is a good book, but if you have a good sex life and an imagination you will be bored.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This was a great deal. Got blurays, dvds and digital copy all for $40. The series is awesome. I've watched it twice already waiting for season 3 to come out.<br /><br />Don't miss out on this. There is nudity, blood and language but the story is engaging.
0670024813|4.0|This book has some good sections but it leaves out some areas of possible interest such as medicines and illness, religion, and discusses others overlong.
1439153663|5.0|Although the end was like a tornado of events to tie up, I found this book to be a fantastic read. Kathleen Grissom did an excellent job developing the characters. A definite page turner to the end!

158270208X|5.0|Happy I have a designated book to write my gratitude info in. The book seems so official, like youre really ready to take things seriously. Sure I could've gotten a regular notebook but I don't think it would be the same. This feels special.  It's made very well, hard cover with nice pages, very sturdy. Also has a red string bookmark so you don't lose your place. Also includes a few pages of words from Rhonda Byrnes.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Absolutely love the series - although disappointed at the loss of the main characters...looking forward to the next season to see how the writers will handle the tragic events.  Maggie Smith and other lead actors are superb.<br /><br />Quality of the Blue-ray is excellent.  Very happy with the purchase.
B008J34466|4.0|4/5 only because now I know what they bleeped out of &#34;Blow Me (one last kiss)&#34;; song not so thrilling but loving Just Give Me A Reason and Here Comes The Weekend.  P!nk is one of a few artists that you can truly enjoy the whole album.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show!  The characters and the actors who portray them are fantastic.  I found this show and started watching it without ever even hearing of it before.  Now I'm all caught up and can't wait for season 4!
0140564349|5.0|I have read this many times to my children, will hope to read to my grandchildren and other youngsters who love a good story.<br />In real life, I have seen for myself the loving care a mother duck gives to her chicks and have seen first hand a parade of youngsters crossing a street, stopping traffic while people watched the parade.  It is a wonderful book to keep.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I don't know which came first,  this or Dragon City on Facebook, but this is a jr. version of that. There are even a few things that I like better.<br />You will enjoy this game and your children between the ages of 3 and 13 will also.<br />I do wish that there were dragon battles like they have on Dragon City.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|love it!  one of the best series ever!!  stories about the British arostocresty is very intersting.  i hope they continue to brodcast this show.
140053271X|1.0|Yes, the Nook Simple Touch is a lovely little ereader - when it works. I bought one last year while living in the US, and soon after the screen startet freezing on a regular basis, requiring a hard reset to start working again. Then after a while the customer service kindly send me a new one, which soon after had the exact same problem - only even worse. Now I am back in Europe and stuck with a useless device, and there seems to be no repair solution! B&N; stop sending people defect products, it would save a lot of effort in the first place.
B002NZK5QY|5.0|My Hubby and I were discussed this movie.  It arrived on time a day before the delivery was being scheduled.  I enjoy listening to the music in the background of DVD movie.  I love it.

B009KEN87O|5.0|I think this is a great game. Simple and smart are the appealing attributes to me. It reminds me of galaga and I love that game. I was surprised how well I could move my pod. This graphics are not the main focus of this game, functionality is the best.

B009AMANBA|1.0|I'll only discuss the portrayal of Lincoln's character. First, Lincoln was a benevolent white supremacist who was going to deport every black person out of the country (he belonged to an organization dedicated to that purpose, and it's how Liberia got founded). It didn't happen because Booth killed him. Second, Lincoln didn't care if slavery was legal or not, as long as the U.S. stayed united. Third, Lincoln suffered from life-long depression, apparently after getting kicked in the face by a horse when he was 11 (his face was deformed and he had a wandering eye). Fourth, Lincoln showed no concern whatsoever about all the Northerners and Southerners killed in the war. Those killed and wounded came to over 620,000 people, which today translates to over five million Americans. Fifth, he showed no respect for the Constitution, which he ignored. Sixth, Lincoln was a wealthy corporate lawyer who wished to impose on America a managed economy run by corporations. Seventh, the War between the States was not about slavery (Lincoln didn't care at all about slavery). It was about the North trying to economically impoverish the South and the South trying to pull away because of it. Those who do not believe these things should look them up. They are a matter of public record. I'll stop here, and only say this is a extremely dishonest film.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  Not only is the acting superb, but the story is beautiful.  I love that the characters develop and come to know one another through learning about and serving one another...instead of rushing immediately to the physical aspect of the relationship.  By the time they actually are together, they truly appreciate and value what they have.  The kiss at the end has to be one of my all-time favorites--ever!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This is a well-crafted album with nice lyrics, retro synth, and an indie feel to the music.  It is quite pop without being baby-food.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game freezes up sometimes but its way better than the first. There are more obstacles and challenges. I give it a 9/10. Go temple run!!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is a great set up for my kindle. I can view all things that I could on my desktop computer.
B00B7IJDMA|5.0|Bascially, I am giving this compilation 5 stars because it's exactly as described, and of great quality. Read the track listing, and if you don't want the songs that are presented, don't buy it and just download the singles you are looking for instead. To me, it's really strange to buy this and then be dissapointed. Go on YouTube and check out the tracks before you buy it if you are not sure.<br /><br />Someone else posted a few of the other songs on here that you might be looking for that aren't on here. These probably include the Bear McCreary composed theme song and \\"Civilian\\" by Wye Oak. I just downloaded those ones on iTunes. The entire Wye Oak album is pretty good buy the way, so you might want to check that out.<br /><br />All and all, there are some very cool songs on here that do a great job for setting the mood in the show and are fun to listen to on their own. I am satisfied with my purchase.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great set up for my kindle. I am absolutely obsessed with Pinterest! Trust me you have to get this app if you are crafty person!!
B000001ESJ|5.0|.........for being elected to the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame. This honor was way overdue, but it's nice to see them finally get in. Now, for the review: A Farewell To Kings is one of my favorite Rush albums because it's pretty progressive, technically superior, and musically diverse. Here, all three members use an array of instruments, especially Peart on percussion. Throw in sound effects (birds, spaceships, etc.) and what you have are songs that are sophisticated and interesting. Lyrically, this is vintage sci-fi, fantasy and philosophy. Geddy's voice is stronger than ever, while Alex has some of his best guitar work. Standout tracks include the epic Xanadu, Closer to the Heart, and the explosive Cygnus X-1. This album isn't just for die hard fans; it's an album that should be appreciated as very artistic, polished, and intellectual. Don't miss out on this classic album that followed the highly successful 2112.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|How this guy slipped through the cracks of success is a mystery .His writing is better than Dylan .he never saw a dime of hundreds of thousands of records sold in South Africa. Somebody should be held accountable.,even now.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I enjoyed seeing the season 3... did not like the end and the main character being killed in a car accident!  Yuckky way to end a story!  If this is the end why was that necessary?
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I enjoy Dan Brown's style of writing, the intense pace he keeps with his story telling makes me feel I am running along Langdon. Fun book, being a Mason made the story that more interesting.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|Can't stop listening to it. Both of their voices are just so soothing and enjoyable to listen to. Highly recommend it.
B004UPAN6W|4.0|While this movie may not have the highest quality, it is very fun to watch and has a surprisingly engaging storyline that keeps you guessing.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|I love the smoothness of both of their voices. His voice reminds me a bit of the singer for INXS. Her voice is just incredibly beautiful.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love this book series but really fall is when the next one comes it makes me mad good book read it
B00425S1H8|1.0|The pins are fine, but the screw connectors on the sides are female & I needed male. You can see this in the picture, but I just assumed they'd follow a standard =/
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is an amazing insight into North Korea- My heart goes out to the every day people of this country!
055380684X|5.0|As a teacher, coach and parent this book gives more insight into success in activities.  Tennis is a way for me to connect with young people and this book gives understanding into what really works over time.  It also provides ways to communicate with individuals to help them improve their skills.  I will never tell another individual that they have or don't have natural ability, for fear of limiting their success.  Nothing is better than organized, dedicated hard work to create success.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like it but I wish that they would upgrade it more so then u would have more things
0062183591|5.0|This book opened up many doors to help understand dishonesty can be a part of an extremely honest persons makeup.  The scientific approach more than supports his findings.  The added humor and statistics make it a fun read.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|With this album, Justin truly expresses his love for music. Right off the bat, everything sounded original while also holding tinges of a sort of tribute to that old school R&B. Every sound drips in alluring resonance; reminding me of the stylings of fellow artists such as Prince, Genuwine, young Usher, and young Bobby Brown...to name a few. Yet even with those seeming inspirations, he wasn't afraid to experiment with sound and mold it into something that transformed into an almost trademark sound of JT.<br /><br />Being a fan of his particular sound, I think the only thing that could put this album over the top and add that glimmering cherry on top would be if he collaborated with Robin Thick. This, of course, is my personal obsession with these men. I strongly believe that if they made a song together, an atomic bomb of pure marvelousness would collide with every female on the planet, producing a mushroom cloud of estrogen filled with joyous tears and fluttering heart beats.<br /><br />With or without my addition, I love the album. He took it to another level, and it's amazing.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|The dvds are good quality, perfectly encoded (not rushed and no mistakes, no difficulties playing them). The insert showing the family trees of all the houses are actually pretty good reference materials to keep track of the alliances between the houses.<br /><br />Good buy.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Amazing game and an outstanding addition to the franchise. If you were a fan of the franchise growing up as a kid then you'll really appreciate this game.  Entertaining and good strategy this game will keep you hooked for hours. The only bad point is that you'll be forced to spend money at certain parts in the game to get ahead or to get unique pieces which is not so bad. Still a great game.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I love this book.  Everyone at work has read this so I figured I would see what everyone is talking about.  I read it in 3 days, because I could not put it down.  Very special indeed!  You will not be disappointed, such a story of hope, healing and love.
B004SKLD9A|4.0|Okay, but not great. I bought this after people raved how much better than the Matrix it supposedly is. No way. Never. Yeah, some cool action. Other than that, felt like an imitation, an attempt to cash in on the Matrix idea and action. Especially cheap attempt at a double twist in the story. Like \\"yes, I'm really an agent for the other side, fooled you, haha, then later, just kidding, really was just trying to fool you, I'm not working for the other side, then hey, sorry changed my mind again, just trying artificially to create some plot turns.\\" And what about the helmets? Really, people? They couldn't come up with better police uniforms? Just seemed cheap to me. And it's not just about the action. Every word that was said by characters in the Matrix has meaning. If you haven't caught that, watch the Matrix a few more times. This movie doesn't have that depth or dimensions. I expected much more and was pretty disappointed. Having said that, if not compared to the Matrix, I think it's a decent action flick, just not great.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Interesting book, I like the first person narrative style.  I thought the ending was a little abrupt.<br /><br />They are telling me i need three more words.  I'm not sure why a concise review isn't valued...
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Being a fan of the LOTR trilogy, I was afraid to watch the Hobbit, having heard so many negative reviews.<br />But I watched it nonetheless, not expecting much from it.<br />I liked it! It was far different in style from the LOTR, having much more silliness, but I think that is because it is supposed to be Bilbo telling a story.
B009G3TNIM|5.0|I love Converge, so I'm biased of course, but every time I get into a discussion about metal with dudes(it's usually dudes), I'm surprised at how few know about them. As far as arty metal punk noise goes, there's no one who even comes close to doing what they do so well and making it seem fresh every time they release something. A bunch of older-ish guys making younger dudes' hardcore metalcore nonsense sound like what it is, an uninspired posture. One of my favourite bands, easily.
B004EPZ0H0|5.0|Rebecca Skloot's book tells the almost unbelievable, yet absolutely true, story of how cancer cells taken from a poor black woman in 1951, without her consent or knowledge, lived on and still live on in their tens of millions throughout the world and in the process became an immensely important basis of modern scientific advances. These ranged from the polio vaccine through treatments for cancers to gene mapping and much more. What is equally as amazing is that while the scientific world knew a great deal about these cells and their uses they knew nothing about the deeply personal background story of prejudice and social injustice that existed as their background.That is until Skloot, over ten years of tenacious, patient and sensitive research, unearthed the whole amazing story. This book is a tour de force of journalistic research told in a manner that is very readable. I recommend it without qualification.
1933952806|5.0|This is not a book you read through once and put away. It gives step by step instructions on how to use this very complicated camera. You will use it, along with the manual that comes with the camera, over and over in order to get the best pictures possible. There are so many details and options one could use to take fantastic photos while using this book. But the writing is done in a very frank and honest manner. Easy to use and very well done. By the time you read a portion of this book, you really start to like Mr. Young. He has a sense of humor that gives the reader the impression that they are getting a real world view of the Nikon D7000. He really thinks it's a wonderful camera and it is.
B00ANYD2OE|5.0|CRICKET!!!!!!!<br />(I liked this a lot better than Anna, and I quite liked Anna.)<br /><br />1. (+) Lola, the protagonist - Admittedly, I liked Lola less than I liked Anna, but I don't think it's fair to compare the books just because they have such different characters, and since Perkins's stories are so clearly character driven, it makes for a completely different story.  (I think the reason why it was harder for me to identify with her over Anna is because Lola's quirk is her fashion taste and I've never really cared that much about fashion whereas Anna's quirk was her OCDness, with which I definitely can identify.)  Anyways, Lola is quirky, smart, fashionable, talented and dedicated to designing things... and also way more mature than I was at her age.<br /><br />2. (+) THE BOY, CRICKET - lovelovelovelovelove!  This boy is a personification of my type of guy ;p.  Nice, nerdy, brilliant, thoughtful, has that sort of inner passion which drives me crazy.  I think Lola describes it by talking about how he really uses his body, how he directs every part of himself to whatever he's paying attention to...ahh, and writing on his hands and his emotions written all over his face and his integrity--getting upset over his family name!  Cricket, why don't you actually exist?  (See, I stopped minding that his name was actually Cricket because this boy is that awesome.)<br /><br />3. (+) Her parents - I don't usually fuss over the role of parents in YA books, but I do appreciate it when it's portrayed well, and Lola's two dads and her homeless birth mother cut such an interesting family perspective. I liked the overprotective (but not too overprotective; my parents wouldn't have even let me date a guy like Max) behavior from her parents and the way Lola interacts with them.  There's a lot of respect there and for them to include her birth mother and to see how Lola's relationship with her also grows made me like their family dynamic a lot.<br /><br />4. (+) Cameos by Anna & St. Clair - SO ADORABLE.  Their relationship sets a standard for Lola and who she chooses to be with, but just seeing them from someone's eyes made me feel all giddy inside yet again.  (Also, I love how Perkins set the stage for all of them to have cameos in Isla, her third book.  So looking forward to that!)<br /><br />5. (+) The Writing - so much more lyrical and romantic than in Anna, but it fits, given who Lola is as compared to Anna.  In general, though, Stephanie Perkins does such a good job with her dialogue and creating characters who are so... alive.  Also so quirky and fun to hang out with & experience their lives.<br /><br />6. (--) The Pacing - At the same time... ah, this is just my problem with contemporary stories in general.  I feel like there are so many pages filled with the protagonist's thoughts when I'm just like, \\"hurry up! Get to the scene with them actually there!\\"  I mean, yes, Lola and the Boy Next Door has good character development, but sometimes I did wish it were shorter.<br /><br />7. (+) San Francisco - Admittedly, it wasn't as huge a part of the story as I thought it would be after reading other people's reviews, but it's still important and is still integral to the story (the Berkeley aspect & the cameos, the music festival/scene, the homeless surrounding the city, the transportation, etc.).  It was described really well.<br /><br />8. (+) Little Focus on High School - The pacing was DEFINITELY helped by the very few mentions of high school (it would've been unnecessary had there been more).  It wasn't like in Anna and how the two of them went to the same school so their assignments could be discussed and I liked that.  I liked that Lola had this other life on the side and that it wasn't the tortured romance at school, time spent during class staring at the boy's back, etc.<br /><br />9. (+) Random - This is a random category of little things I liked... like how the people who weren't so nice still felt real; they weren't really villains, but if you wanted to consider them that way, they were complex villains with believable ulterior motives ;p.... also liked the last line!!!  LOVED it actually.  I would post it here, but I'm not going to ruin it for the rest of you :D.... also LOVED the history Lola had not only with Cricket but with her birth mother.  I'd list more but really there is no end to how awesome this book and Stephanie Perkins's writing are.<br /><br />10. (--) The Cover - I have a couple of issues with this.  I do like Cricket's outfit and the star on his hand and the rubber bands--those work.  But Lola's outfit doesn't look as ... outrageous as I'd expect.  The houses in the background are kind of cool, but they look so painted and fake.  Also, the sky?  Why didn't they do it like a nighttime cover?  The book mentions the moon and the stars a lot so it would've made more sense to do that in my opinion at least.<br /><br />I loved Lola and the Boy Next Door so, so much.  Pretty much, I'll now read anything Stephanie Perkins writes.  She has completely won me over.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics. Challenging puzzles &amp; HOGs. I was conflicted about whether to rate it 4 stars or 5 because it's another game with a dark theme. But it deserves a very good rating in my opinion because the plot stayed interesting &amp; the HOGs weren't boring or too repetitive. It wasn't one of those games I downloaded and finished in one night.  Works great on kindle fire. It's intuitive enough that I didn't need to look up cheats on line  but not too easy either.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|A fabulous series.  Just plain great TV.  I wish I had recorded the entire 3 seasons.  The only problem is the British accent makes it a little hard to catch all the words sometimes.
B00846REIS|5.0|I mean lets be honest once I heard about Bared to you I thought no way its going to be good just a 50 shades of grey knock off. Let me tell you i couldnt have been more wrong. Well obviously theirs similarities in the fact of the BDSM factor and maybe the dominance of the male protagonist but seriously the realism behind these characters was enchanting. I should of suspected sylvia day would bring an amazing story to life since i had read a book or two of hers in the past. I didnt stop reading until i had finished both books eager to tell friends how i excited i was for the third one. Eva was so appealing as an independent strong willed young woman not taking anything from anyone and the love she has for Gideon is just simply surreal I really dont know what to expect since sylvia has brought such turns and twists to this sexy story truthfully anxious for june to arrive and read the next installment keep up the great work sylvia

B007ZXK08C|3.0|Took me about 3 chapters to get into it - nearly put it down as a 'not for me book'.  However, persisted and after getting into it found it to be a 'cannot put it down' book - curious to find out what the real truth was in the story.  Then I found the ending to be a bit dissapointing/believable. Enjoyed it, but would I recommend it to friends?!!!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Riveting. I stayed up all night reading it and I never do that. Wow. This book grabs you. Is it really a first novel? Can't wait for the next one.

B0089LOKHG|5.0|Read this and other reviews at [...]<br /><br />*Disclaimer: this is NOT my best review, not even close.*<br /><br />I find it hard to review books/series that are this amazing. The story speaks for itself and no words I say will serve any real justice to the story. Just know, the words, the characters and the storyline, they moved me. This is a fantastic series.<br /><br />{{This is the past: It drifts, it gathers. If you are not careful, it will bury you.}}<br /><br />This was one of my most highly anticipated releases for 2013, and it did not disappoint. That being said, it wasn't the best in the series, but it was amazing, nonetheless. Lauren Oliver's ability to craft words never ceases to amaze me. She's really almost in a league of her own, when it comes to the lyrical nature of her writing. It's insane how well she can weave a story and suck you in. Even though Requiem wasn't my favorite book in the Delirium series, it still blows most other books out of the water.<br /><br />{{Direction, like time, is a general thing, deprived of boundaries and borders. It is an endless process of interpretation and reinterpretation, doubling back and adjusting.}}<br /><br />Requiem picks up basically where Pandemonium ends, which if you've read Pandemonium, you know there was quite the revelation at the end. Very shocking. And exciting. But left a lot of questions. I am going to be incredibly brief on the overall plot, because well, I hate spoilers, as you already know, and really, I think this, as the others in the series, should be read blindly. I didn't read teasers, excerpts, or any other reviews or quotes before going into this. I wanted it all fresh in my brain.<br /><br />{{\\"You know you can't be happy unless you're unhappy sometimes, right?\\"}}<br /><br />There were so many changes taking place in The Wilds. The Resistance refused to be stomped out, but The Cureds weren't going down without a fight either.<br /><br />{{We wanted the freedom to love. We wanted the freedom to choose. Now we have to fight for it.}}<br /><br />This book, unlike the others, is told from dual POVs. Half of the story is from Lena, and the other half is from Hana. I thought this was great because it gave us a chance to experience life on both sides of the fence/wall. We saw what was happening in The Wilds because of Lena, but we also got the chance to see life from a Cured point of view.<br /><br />{{I like seeing the Wilds this way: skinny, naked, not yet clothed in spring. But reaching, too, grasping and growing, full of want and a thirst for sun that gets slaked a little bit more every day. Soon the Wilds will explode, drunk and vibrant.}}<br /><br />While there weren't necessarily many unexpected plot twists in the story, there were lots of heart-stopping moments. A lot of them I can't touch on without giving away vital parts of the story, so unfortunately, I have to be super vague. I think most readers' issue with this story was the realism to it. For that, I applaud Ms. Oliver. I think she wrote what truly should have happened, even though, at times, it wasn't easy to read.<br /><br />{{\\"And when it started to get dark you pointed to the sky, and told me there was a star for every thing you loved about me.\\"}}<br /><br />When I read the end, I cried. I had goose bumps, and tears were streaming down my face. It's not that the ending was necessarily sad. I guess, for me, it was sad knowing it was the end of an amazing series, but more than that, I cried because it was just so awesome. I will say, in retrospect, I do think the end felt a touch rushed, but even so, while there was enough resolution, there's still plenty left to your imagination. There was nothing overly tidy about the ending. It just was. And it worked. And was so beautiful.<br /><br />{{He who jumps may fall, but he may also fly. It's time to jump.}}<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the rest of the short stories in this series; so far, I've only read Hana, which totally threw me for a loop. I also cannot wait to see what Lauren writes next. She's up there as one of my favorite authors, and I will, no doubt, be waiting on pins and needles for her next release. I cannot recommend this series enough. I wasn't ever into dystopian fiction before, but this is so, so much more than that.<br /><br />THIS QUOTE RIGHT HERE! Among the others I included, just shows how AMAZING Lauren is with words. If this doesn't perfectly sum up life, I don't know what does. This gives me the chills when I read it, but it also gives me this sense of hope. I need to read it every single day.<br /><br />{{But maybe happiness isn't in the choosing. Maybe it's in the fiction, in the pretending: that wherever we have ended up is where we intended to all along.}}o doubt, be waiting on pins and needles for her next release.

B00BEFL5Q8|1.0|Tracks 8 and 10 are ruined by crackling and distortion. It's not Amazon's fault, the versions I purchased from Google and HDtracks are identical, and from what I've read even the physical versions are marred by a poor mastering job: [...]
B007ZI06FE|4.0|Kiss of Steel is a Paranormal Romance/Steampunk mash up which is set in London in 1876 and tells the story of Honoria a young woman who is down on her luck when her father dies.  Honoria has to take care of her younger sister Lena and younger brother Charlie.  She has been living in the rookeries for 6 months before she is summoned to meet Blade the master of the rookeries.  Honoria soon finds herself in debt to Blade for his protection and as payment Honoria is to teach Blade how to speak the Queens English rather than his cockney slang.  But Honoria's luck falls even further she loses her job and she once again finds herself at Blade's door where she offers him more than an elocution lessons for money.<br /><br />I'm not a great fan of Steampunk, I can take it or leave it and I don't normally get on with PNR but I did like how Ms McMaster put the two together in Kiss of Steel.  The Steampunk isn't heavy but it does have good inventive world building and the PNR isn't too mushy.  I liked the main characters and the secondary ones seem interesting enough that I want to read their stories in the books that follow.  I normally find the female lead turns into a whimpering silly mess in PNR books once she meets her beau however I was pleased to learn that isn't the case in Kiss of Steel so Honoria kept my interest throughout.<br /><br />I do have a bit of a gripe and that is I found the beginning of the book confusing.  Ms McMaster's world building isn't easy to follow with regards to what the blood craving disease is and how it manifests.  I could have done with glossary for the terms she used such as Blue Blood, Fade, Echelon etc.  You do find out what these are but it left me frustrated whilst I did.<br /><br />I found Kiss of Steel to be a really enjoyable book and I will definitely carry on with this series.  I am going to give it 4 stars.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Well written account of the air war in Europe. From the life of a German Fighter pilot and the life of a pilot and crew of the B-17.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I read it because I wanted to finish the series... and that's pretty much the only reason I finished. Ok, Collins does have some unexpected twists in the plot that kept me going, but overall I felt like the whole story-line was being advanced by sheer violence. Ending is cool, but in my opinion the first book better by far, and the rest of the series is downhill from there. If you read the first one and REALLY have to know who Katniss marries, just read the last chapter of the 3rd book. :)
B0053O89YM|5.0|I've never enjoyed soaps, so I'm delightfully surprised, with the clever courtroom cases and the hold-your-interest situations. Must have Season 4!

I can't wait for Season 4!

I lost about 5 pounds in the first week, and then it was up and down, but I managed to get off another 5 pounds in the next two weeks and have kept it off for the past two months. I am not an active person and my weight started out at 170. I like meat and veggies, am not much on desserts, so this was easy diet for me. I have a friend who lost 85 pounds on the diet and he is actually the one who got me interested in buying the book. It works, especially in you follow it exactly.  I did not get the oat bran.  I used a fiber drink, as I assumed that was the purpose of the oat bran.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|North Korean prison camps have tortured and starved their citizens for decades.  There has often been recriminations of the US and other nations for not speaking up during the Nazi regime but here we are 50 years later bearing witness to the atrocities that continue to this day in North Korea.

It's been over a week since my B-Day, and I have yet to use Autotune, because iLok is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever encountered.<br /><br />What possessed any company to opt for this instead of just typing up an alphanumerical key onto a box to install software is beyond me. I've been fighting with the iLok website for two days now just trying to get the device to process, let alone actually get my product. There should be a lawsuit against the companies that use this, since I'm starting to think we were scammed. It doesn't work.<br /><br />You can install an entire Adobe Creative Suite in less time than it will take you to figure out how to even run the stupid iLok, trust me, I did it.

B005LAII12|5.0|I can't believe I am writing a rave review about a stuffed, talking teddy bear and his heart-warming story, which held my interest intensely from beginning to end.<br /><br />Because I have loved every movie Wahlberg has ever done and am very familiar with the  particular twisted genius that is Seth McFarlane,I threw caution to the wind and  spent the money.  I  figured it would either be horrible or weirdly, wackily excellent....and much to my surprise, it was the latter !<br /><br />Within the first two minutes, you totally get into the 'world' of the movie and it becomes perfectly sane that Mark Wahlberg ( who gets hotter with age, btw ) and his childhood teddy bear are sitting on the couch, hanging out and discussing their lives, both with flawless Boston accents. And the story takes off from there.<br /><br />A wild, insanely funny romp of a movie, with a tender heart.  LOVED IT.

B008220BLG|4.0|Now that Robert Pattison's big series is over, and he has yet to make a successful film not associated with brooding vampires or hunky werewolves, Hollywood is searching for The Next Big Thing among the pool of eligible young actors.<br /><br />Enter Nicholas Hoult. Hoult has been around a while, he was literal Boy in \\"About a Boy\\", starring Hugh Grant as figurative boy and Toni Collette. Now that he is in his twenties, the studios are making a little push to position him as the NBT. He is currently in two big releases, which is a good sign, but only one of them is worth your attention, which is problematic.<br /><br />It makes sense that Hoult is being groomed for this new role; he's British, not hard on the eyes and he can act. RPats shares two of these three qualities. Slam! Any Twihards reading this review have no doubt clicked \\"Not Helpful\\" provided they understood the slam. Double Slam!<br /><br />But back to the reviews. The first and better film \\"Warm Bodies\\" tells a modern \\"Romeo & Juliet\\"-esque tale. But in this case R is a zombie (Hoult) and Julie (Teresa Palmer, \\"I Am Number Four\\") is one of an ever decreasing group of humans. A few years ago, a virus began turning humans into zombies and this created a society with three groups, humans, zombies and Bonies - zombies who have gone to the next level and will eat both zombies and humans. A group of humans, led by Grigio (John Malkovich) have created a safe haven in the middle of the city, living behind patrolled walls. Grigio is a \\"Shoot first and ask questions later\\" kind of guy, doing anything to protect the lives of the people in his care. He is also Julie's father. Julie goes out on a supply run with her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) and best friend, Nora (Analeigh Tipton). At the pharmacy, they are quickly overrun by R and a group of his friends. But R is instantly taken by Julie's beauty and feels his heart start to beat again. He pauses while eating one of her friends to appreciate her full Warrior Mode as she fights off his friends. The Bonies attack and R takes Julie to his home, an abandoned jet at the airport. R pleads with her to stay, for her protection, and they get to know each other.<br /><br />R quickly realizes he is changing-his expanding vocabulary is one sign-and he eventually convinces Julie of the change, hoping to gain her affection in the process. But they realize the change is happening in all of the zombies. Julie decides she should try to convince her dad of this, because the zombies could help the humans fight off the increasingly vigilant Bonies. R and Julie sneak into the barricaded area with the help of R's friend, M (Rob Corddry). All they have to do is convince her dad of the change, which is easier said than done.<br /><br />Directed by Jonathan Levine (\\"50/50\\"), \\"Warm Bodies\\" is a unique, amusing and entertaining film. There is a lot to like and appreciate about it and it just seems smarter and more involving than other tween romances featuring dark creatures.<br /><br />Much like \\"Zombieland\\", the filmmakers don't waste a lot of time. From the first frame, we meet R and listen to him talk about his current life as he walks aimlessly through the airport he calls home. As he introduces us to his world we see brief snippets of the past, much of it through news program headlines, giving us more than enough information to illustrate how the world got into this state. It is a fast and complete picture and doesn't slow down the narrative at all.<br /><br />The zombies are amusing enough because they are painted as victims, to an extent, who have to fend off attacks by both humans and Bonies. As they walk around, many still trapped in the meaningless jobs they had as humans, they are doing what they did in life, working to live. Now that they are real zombies, little has changed.<br /><br />The best thing about \\"Warm Bodies\\" is everything in and about the film seems very familiar. Two teens in love. Parents against it. But they fight for their love. It's a story as old as, well, Shakespeare. But Levine adds unusual elements and sets the story in an unexpected time and place. What this does is take the usual and make it different, exciting and unexpected. With so many cookie-cutter teen romances out there, it is refreshing to watch a film that takes the extra step to create an original and unusual story.<br /><br />It is also nice to watch a romance develop more naturally. It takes a long time, in the film universe, for Julie to accept R and fall in love with him. In so many films, it seems like someone flips a switch and the character changes. Julie is old enough, wise enough and weary enough to be resistant and make sure he is the right guy. Zombie or not.<br /><br />The addition of Rob Corddry is a nice touch. He plays M, another zombie who is R's friend, as much as they can have friends; he grunts in response to R's grunts and they spend a lot of time together. Given their age difference, it is a nice touch to make them friends, because their relationship seems borne out of convenience, another nod back to the human-as-zombie references populating this film. And when the change begins to happen, M is at R's side, ready to lead the fight against the Bonies.<br /><br />John Malkovich plays the leader of the humans, a no-nonsense type of guy who leads his people with an iron fist, unwilling to let anyone who may be infected into the compound. Grigio is a nice change of pace for the actor, showing once again he can take on just about any role and make it interesting.<br /><br />But Hoult is the real stand-out in the film. He brings a wide-range of skill to the role, giving R a lot of personality and interest. He always makes the zombie interesting, even before he starts to change and become more human. In the beginning he is more of a typical zombie, managing only monosyllabic grunts, moving slow, eating humans, looks like he just rolled out of a trash dumpster. But he is extremely introspective and we listen to him narrate his everyday existence.<br /><br />The more time he spends with Julie, the more he changes. As he grows closer to Julie, he tries to communicate and the words start to flow a little more naturally. It is much more difficult for actors to create interesting, viable characters without the use of their voice. Initially, Hoult has to use facial expressions to express his emotions. He can't even really use his arms or body language. It is an interesting involving performance making a good film even better.<br /><br />For every NBT to make it through. Hollywood history is littered with thousands of handsome young actors who didn't make a lasting impression. They are given a big push, star in two or three high profile films that flop and then end up starring in a show in the CW. The sad thing is that the failure of these films is not always the actor's fault. Those that can act often get cast in bad films, or poorly marketed films. Cast him in a period costume romance and then a hard hitting urban drama. The tweens who made his first film a huge hit will surely follow and the success will follow. Or not.<br /><br />I think Hoult can and will rise above the failure of \\"Jack\\"; he got many good reviews for \\"Warm Bodies\\", he had a small, but interesting role in \\"A Single Man\\", he was on the BBC version of \\"Skins\\". In other words, he can act. His agents and handlers just need to steer him away from some of the more iffy blockbusters. If a balance can be reached, Hoult can become a fixture of Hollywood. Hell, he might even end up seated next to Nicholson at a future Oscar ceremony.heir love. It's a story as old as, well, Shakespeare.

Julie is old enough, wise enough and weary enough to be resistant and make sure he is the right guy. Zombie or not.<br /><br />The addition of Rob Corddry is a nice touch. He plays M, another zombie who is R's friend, as much as they can have friends; he grunts in response to R's grunts and they spend a lot of time together. Given their age difference, it is a nice touch to make them friends, because their relationship seems borne out of convenience, another nod back to the human-as-zombie references populating this film. And when the change begins to happen, M is at R's side, ready to lead the fight against the Bonies.<br /><br />John Malkovich plays the leader of the humans, a no-nonsense type of guy who leads his people with an iron fist, unwilling to let anyone who may be infected into the compound. Grigio is a nice change of pace for the actor, showing once again he can take on just about any role and make it interesting.<br /><br />But Hoult is the real stand-out in the film. He brings a wide-range of skill to the role, giving R a lot of personality and interest. He always makes the zombie interesting, even before he starts to change and become more human. In the beginning he is more of a typical zombie, managing only monosyllabic grunts, moving slow, eating humans, looks like he just rolled out of a trash dumpster. But he is extremely introspective and we listen to him narrate his everyday existence.<br /><br />The more time he spends with Julie, the more he changes. As he grows closer to Julie, he tries to communicate and the words start to flow a little more naturally. It is much more difficult for actors to create interesting, viable characters without the use of their voice. Initially, Hoult has to use facial expressions to express his emotions. He can't even really use his arms or body language. It is an interesting involving performance making a good film even better.<br /><br />For every NBT to make it through. Hollywood history is littered with thousands of handsome young actors who didn't make a lasting impression. They are given a big push, star in two or three high profile films that flop and then end up starring in a show in the CW. The sad thing is that the failure of these films is not always the actor's fault. Those that can act often get cast in bad films, or poorly marketed films. Cast him in a period costume romance and then a hard hitting urban drama. The tweens who made his first film a huge hit will surely follow and the success will follow. Or not.<br /><br />I think Hoult can and will rise above the failure of \\"Jack\\"; he got many good reviews for \\"Warm Bodies\\", he had a small, but interesting role in \\"A Single Man\\", he was on the BBC version of \\"Skins\\". In other words, he can act. His agents and handlers just need to steer him away from some of the more iffy blockbusters. If a balance can be reached, Hoult can become a fixture of Hollywood. Hell, he might even end up seated next to Nicholson at a future Oscar ceremony.
0547569653|5.0|I sought this out after reading Christopher McDougall's &#34;Born to Run.&#34; Having my ultramarathon bug bit, I bought this book.<br /><br />Like the title says, this book is about Scott, his upbringing, and how he got to where he is. This book is full of triumphs, personal successes, heartache, and stresses. Scott chronicles the good times he's had and the bad. None of it is sugar coated. He details how he started as the skinny, lanky kid (not much good at traditional sports such as basketball and soccer) to runner (and a very good one at that), finding a plant-based diet along the way. And while Scott writes much about his plant-based diet, he isn't pushy, nor is their any holier-than-thou attitude in his words. It's more of a &#34;hey, this is what works best for me and my lifestyle.&#34; He tried raw, but he says flat out - hey, it wasn't working for me (too much time spent chewing and getting food into my body. He includes his favorite recipes at the end of each chapter, so that, if you're feeling inspirational and adventurous, you can give it a try.<br /><br />What I found in here is a guy that is very easy to relate to. He's watched his mom slowly withered away from MS. He's had his share of troubles with his father. He's been through a divorce. He's suffered injuries. He's DNF'd plenty of times. He's been in slumps. He's not a god. He's like you and me. He just happens to run ultras and he's passionate about them, and that's what's he's done in this book - he's shared his passion with the reader.
B00BEJL3IY|2.0|Now that Robert Pattison's big series is over, and he has yet to make a successful film not associated with brooding vampires or hunky werewolves, Hollywood is searching for The Next Big Thing among the pool of eligible young actors.<br /><br />Enter Nicholas Hoult. Hoult has been around a while, he was literal Boy in \\"About a Boy\\", starring Hugh Grant as figurative boy and Toni Collette. Now that he is in his twenties, the studios are making a little push to position him as the NBT. He is currently in two big releases, which is a good sign, but only one of them is worth your attention, which is problematic.<br /><br />It makes sense that Hoult is being groomed for this new role; he's British, not hard on the eyes and he can act. RPats shares two of these three qualities. Slam! Any Twihards reading this review have no doubt clicked \\"Not Helpful\\" provided they understood the slam. Double Slam!<br /><br />But back to the reviews.<br /><br />Bryan Singer's (\\"The Usual Suspects\\", \\"X-Men\\") new film was originally scheduled for last summer, but Warner Bros. delayed the release to \\"enhance the special effects\\". It is never a good sign when a studio delays the release of a film. If they liked the film and had confidence in it, they would have stuck to their guns and gone ahead with the release. Instead, they are \\"enhancing the effects\\" and the marketplace is \\"too crowded\\".<br /><br />It's easy to see why the studio lost faith. \\"Jack\\" isn't very good. A lot of money was spent on the creation of the CGI giants. They look good, but they also look like CGI creations. In a live-action film, CGI should blend in more seamlessly and not look fake and cartoony.<br /><br />In fact, none of the recent grown-up adaptations of fairy tales has been memorable. \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is a bad, blatant attempt to capitalize on the success of \\"Twilight\\", complete with two hunky male leads fighting each other for the girl. Both \\"Snow White\\" films were problematic; one is too goofy and cornball, the other is anchored by a starlet who can't act working with Charlize Theron who chews the scenery throughout. \\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" (sequel on the way, folks) is a gory revenge tale with a brother and sister with different accents fighting off witches throughout.<br /><br />The other big use of CGI in the film, the beanstalks, is pretty well done. Somehow, these creations, wild, unpredictable and massive, seem much more real because they don't have any human characteristics.<br /><br />\\"Jack\\" begins with a flashback - both young Jack and a young Princess Isabelle are told the tale of King Erik who defeats the cannibalistic giants and banishes them to their own land, in the clouds. His magical crown and the beans needed to grow beanstalks that can reach the giant's land are buried with the King. Jack is frightened by the tale which Isabelle embraces as a fairy tale.  Flash forward 10 years and Jack now lives with his Uncle who sends Jack into town to sell their cart and their last horse to help keep their floundering farm afloat. But he is quickly distracted by a young woman watching a panto show. When he realizes she might be in trouble, he tries to help, but the King's guards, Elmont (Ewan McGregor) and Crowe (Eddie Marsan), arrive to save Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson). Roderick (Stanley Tucci), the King's (Ian McShane) advisor, has uncovered the crown and beans and has a secret plan simmering. Long story short, Jack gets hold of the beans and one grows under his Uncle's farmhouse, trapping Isabelle there. Soon, the two world's clash and Wicke (voiced by Ewan Bremmer) leads his giants into battle against the humans.<br /><br />There is a lot of good production design in \\"Jack\\"; the prologue is illustrated with panto characters, much like the `Deadly Hallows\\" sequence in the last \\"Harry Potter\\" film. And the castle is beautiful. But this is definitely a case of the filmmakers putting all of their eggs in one (or two) baskets. Much of their timeand energy was spent on the look, leaving little left for character development or story.<br /><br />Once the film gets going, it is basically one long chase. The princess gets stuck in Giant Land, leading Jack, Roderick, Elmont and other members of the King's guard to begin climbing the beanstalk. Once there, they try to elude the murderous beasts as they search for the princess. Eventually, they make their way back to the kingdom but giants are fast on their heels and attack the castle, trying to extract their long-gestating revenge. This makes for a fast-paced film, which is good, but does nothing for the characters and doesn't exactly make a complicated or involving story. For instance, when we meet Jack in `Present Day', he is now living with his uncle, but there is never a mention about what happened to his father or how this might have shaped the young man's life.<br /><br />Princess Isabelle, as played by Eleanor Tomlinson, is completely forgettable. There is an attempt to make her a self-reliant, plucky young royal. The moment we first meet her is a good indicator of how her character is to be viewed; despite her independent nature, she needs to be saved by the Royal Guard, to protect her from an unruly man. Not exactly a great role model for the tweens in the audience. This unfortunately holds true throughout the film because she quickly ends up as a Damsel in Distress, hanging on Jack's arm.<br /><br />Hoult isn't given much to do. He runs around, trying to evade the giants before he realizes he has to stand up and fight. Naturally, he finds courage he never knew he had when the need arises. Not very interesting. Strangely, his costume in the film looks like it was purchased at Hollister or the Gap; he really looks like he is wearing jeans, a t-shirt and a hoodie. This lack of detail only serves to draw us out of the time, place and story.<br /><br />McGregor, Tucci, McShane and Marsan are all more interesting than the two leads, but they are also given more to do. McGregor has the swagger and confidence you would expect from the head of the Royal Guard. But he also has a twinkle to his eye that brings in a touch of the comic book superhero. Tucci's Roderick is plotting to overthrow the King while he plays along with King's plans to marry him to Princess Isabelle. It is a funny, strange and interesting role. McShane is perfect as the blustery, unaware monarch. And Marsan plays against type as a member of the Royal Guard.<br /><br />\\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" is a very uneven film. If the filmmakers had been as interested in the characters as they were in the special effects, this aspect of the movie would have been greatly improved. As a result, the entire film would have been much better and memorable.<br /><br />For every NBT to make it through. Hollywood history is littered with thousands of handsome young actors who didn't make a lasting impression. They are given a big push, star in two or three high profile films that flop and then end up starring in a show in the CW.

B0026S93C0|3.0|I only watched the ending dance that is very well done-the music is very good as well-3 more words required so here they are
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Well, the clothing is amazing. And Keira Knightley  Is good as always. But the movie is not good. Poor Lev Tolstoy is probably spinning like crazy in his grave. Was very hard to follow. If you didn't read a book, you will have very hard time understanding what is going on and who is whom. They totally ruined the story. I'm so glad I did not buy this DVD. That will be a waste of money.<br />I gave it two stars only because I liked the clothing. Other than that, it's Zero stars.
B005LAIISU|3.0|I can't really comment on the movie itself since I haven't sat through all of it.  The 3-star rating is due to the fact that the blu-ray will not play in our blu-ray player (which is less than a year old, has the latest firmware update, and plays other blu-rays just fine).  The movie arrived yesterday and was taken out of its packaging for the first time today.  The movie had not been playing for long when it froze and the blu-ray player became unresponsive.  The only way to get the blu-ray player to do anything was to unplug it to reset.  The second time this happened I took the blu-ray out and put the dvd in.  The dvd works fine.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Out is not the most fun game but it passes time....like if you are waiting for something play this it is like a story game sooooo......it is pretty fun.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I love this movie.  Very glad I bought it.  Can't wait for Iron Man 3 to come out.  Very enjoyable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I don't think that the 1st Temple Run was as good as this. A reason I think this is that they don't have as many opsticls, and it's notas fun.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|i rated this because of all the stars it had in it and the are older and can still get it done. I recommend it to everyone. great movie
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I have had this game before I deleted it because I was low on app space and I wanted another game but when I tried to reinstall it and it would not let me. The app is fun to play it just will not let me install it again. I have tried 5 times and it would not work. if you get it do not delete it and try install it again.
B004RC8NXI|5.0|I liked how they weren't going to be tied down  to each other . and how at the of movie it turns out. you will have to watch movie to find out.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This double album made me fall in love with the Bee Gees all over again.  I found songs that I hadn't heard and really like. I'm glad I chose this recording.  I recommend it to anyone who loves the Bee Gees.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Love the music, graphics good.  Can't put it down, challenging puzzles.  Plays smooth, reacts nicely.  Definitely recommend if you like match 3 puzzle games.
B009KEN87O|5.0|If you like the game, rate it five stars.  I like it and as FAOTD, why not? Here are some more words...
B007DIQC90|5.0|I just left it in my player in the car for a number of days and found the music totally engaging. Never stale.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best series. Have ever read although i would have ended it differently....but i never wanted this series to end its that good
B0064X7FVE|4.0|First I like the fact that I can zoom down to get the weather for my own zip code instead of a large coverage area where the weather can vary by temperature, sun status, or wind conditions.<br />Second I can set the app to give me the weather NOW, a 36 hour forecast, or a long range forecast.<br />Third I check the weather to see what it is going to interfere with my plans. I don't have to dig through a host of &#34;tech talk&#34; to find out it is going to be sunny or it is going to rain on my picnic.
0062238868|5.0|Didnt have to spend $20! Its smaller so its easier to carry around. Its in brand new condition so im the first to bend the pages back. Im just a little sad that I found out the author was murdered a month before I ordered the book and I didnt find out until I began reading it and someone told me :(
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I like a good twist in a movie. I rented this first from Redbox & decided to add to my DVD collection.
B00004YM0D|5.0|The sound track to this movie is awesome. Great choice of selections. Highly recommended for anyone who remembers the great Motown sound.
1616550414|5.0|I've long been a fan of the Legend of Zelda the artwork information is great for any zelda fan definetly worth owning
145210655X|5.0|I bought this as a Father's Day gift for my husband.  It's geared around Vader being the father of a 4 year old boy.  We have a 3.5 year old, so it fit our scenario perfectly.  Some pages are not jokes and do not have words, but show Vader in a typical father role and are funny enough for a smirk.  Other pages were down-right hilarious!  It's a must-read for any father of a 4 year old, whether a Star Wars fan or not.
B009KEN87O|5.0|If you loved space invaders this is a new version to an old game.  Way easier than on the Atari.  (:  Works well on my fire.
B005D0RDIE|4.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for someone, after we stumbled upon it playing on a demo TV in Best Buy. I could hardly get him to leave the TV. He has said it has an odd beginning; however, not to do with the quality, merely the artistry. He's really enjoying it!
B009KEN87O|4.0|this game is Free so I bought it and its not that bad. so if its still free y not get it
B0094K1QR8|4.0|This is a pretty funny movie, it kept me laughing all the way through with more than just a little chuckle.
B0000524E5|5.0|If you love Dance movies & movies with a good plot you'll love this one also. I will for a long long time! TY hope this helps someone out! TY
B008EEHRAU|5.0|Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. All over - acting, directing, producing.<br />Nothing out there like it.
B000067DNC|5.0|After the first problem was fixed it took two more times to finally get this set. But I am really happy with it.
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|Who knew the hunt for Osama bin Laden could be this boring?  The film is long -- almost 3 hours -- and you have to sit through two tedious hours of incomprehensible, seemingly pointless interrogation and torture before the story gains any real traction. (This would have been better served as a straight documentary, although even for a documentary it lacks punch.) It is nigh impossible from most of the proceedings here to ascertain how the CIA actually located Bin Laden.  Jessica Chastain was nominated for an Oscar for her role in the film, and does an adequate job, although basically she is miscast.  And the role doesn't allow for any dramatic latitude, and degenerates into melodramatic shouting toward the end.  James Gandolfini appears briefly, and is also miscast.  So after sitting through more than two hours that drag on endlessly, you must then be subjected to an overlong, protracted sequence in which the Navy SEALs storm the compound and kill Bin Laden.  Not surprisingly, even this sequence lacks a sense of tension and excitement.  Someone keeps forgetting to tell Kathryn Bigelow that a movie needs to have some sort of dramatic arc.  Although \\"The Hurt Locker\\" fared better than this, it suffered from the same lack of story arc.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really liked this story. It was well written.  It had a great plot. I would recommend this book if like romances.
0807014273|5.0|The book is excellent, deep, and thought-provoking. Recommended for all even if the ending is a little sad. Jo Ann Hudson
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I just talked to Amazon. People were complaining about audio and video problems with the rental version. Amazon removed in until they can get a new version.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have always been a fan of Josh.  In this album he goes out of his &#34;comfort zone&#34; and I love the new sound!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game brings a whole new meaning to space invaders.<br />Fun and easy to get into, this game will please any retro fans out there.<br />Don't believe me? Try it for yourself.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Every detail draws you in. I haven't enjoyed reading this much in ages. The suspense keeps you longing for just one more page.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|Very slow story development. Characters not fleshed out at any point. Had a hard time getting through the book and in fact put it down with only 40 pages left to read! Cannot recommend to anyone.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Latest update is a complete revamp. Layout is all new. Personally, I think the update is a huge step backwards. Will be looking for an alternative.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addictive game.  It's a great game that requires good hand-eye coordination.  Don't buy if you don't want to be hooked on it though.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|great organization tool. tagging is searchable. lots of space to upload.  pretty intuitive interface. lots of help and tips available online. plus it is free
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Truly one of the best books I have ever read.  While the reuniting of brothers in this manner is eye rolling unlikely the story as a whole was intriguing.  More than worth the read.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a different sort of Mahjong.  Although the tiles are familiar, the patent changes and increases in difficulty each time you play. I haven't run out of new patters yet...
0375842209|5.0|I wanted to know more.  I wanted to know what was in the \\"spaces\\".  The characters in this book were more than words, they were words with breath and soul and I feel as if I have parted ways with old friends now that the last page has been turned.  Thank you Markus Zusak for sharing these characters with the world.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a good game.you might spend whole day playing with it. I think that it would be better that play this game by purchase items.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I loved the movie, the ending was totally unexpected, I thoroughly enjoyed all the events. Great life lessons. I will watch it again and again.
0670033375|5.0|This is the kind of book which should be mde compulsory reading for History students and anyone interested in the path of how civilisations fail.

0679411585|5.0|If you want to know what real war is about in the Vietnam era this is it!  When all political handcuffs come off this is the essence of warriors.  God bless the US troops that gave their sweat and blood for this war, they are too often forgotten as the true hero's they were, despite the poor leadership they had in Washington!
B000063V8U|5.0|I LOVE Star Trek The Next Generation! My hope is to own all 7 seasons and I just have one more to go. The characters just seem to get better with each season and they explore the main characters in more depth. It's worth owning so I can see each episode whenever I want.

B009KEN87O|5.0|I really enjoyed this. One of the better quick pick up and play games I have on my kindle fire hd. Highly recommended.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a game that provides an enormous amount of mindless fun when all you need to do is shot up aliens and space debree.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Graphics are awesome but as I said WAY too many ads. It should be easier to get more diamonds too.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This story is truly the epitome of 'it's the journey and not the destination'. This book just got better and better as Harold Fry walks and recalls his life. I didn't expect the ending that Rachel Joyce had, but it really was the perfect ending. Now I want to just get out and start walking!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I am able to access my Yahoo mail to send and receive with no problems. No issues with syncing at all.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|I read Committed, A love Story, and was enthralled.  Elizabeth Gilbert researched marriage so fully, covering its customs in different cultures, its conventions, and how it has changed over time.  This should be required reading for anyone thinking about getting married.  Even if you don't have a partner, the information in this book gives you so much to consider, it's probably better to read it without stars in your eyes.  Marriage has evolved over time and will continue to do so.  Gilbert covers the history of marriage in the western world.  Looking at marriage from the point of view of women who don't have choices was eye opening as well. You don't have to be single to read it either.  I had enjoyed her \\"Eat, Pray, Love,\\" and so I read this one and I've been married a long time and wish I had read this before, but had many things to thinks about in this thought provoking book.  I recommend it to everyone.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this HBO series, I didn't read the books, but I will after I've watched all seasons. Everything about this series is super.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|You can't help but fall in love with this fabulous, wicked world that Martin has so cleverly delivered. The characters all have unique characteristics that make you love them or hate them. I had a hard time putting it down.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|It's always a treat when someone takes a children's story we all know and weaves it into a tale that feels as though it was real... this show does that, but with all the tales we know...  Anyone who loved &#34;Into the Woods&#34; for that reason will really enjoy this show!  It is definitely evening drama, but really well crafted.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|I enjoyed the talent and acting in this movie.  Also great stage settings.  Even my six year old grandson liked it.  We wished the story could have been told briefly in the beginning since parts of it we did not totally understand.  We would recommend.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|THIS IS A WELL WRITTEN SERIES THAT LIKE A GOOD BOOK WITH EXCELLENT CHARACTERS AND GREAT INTERACTION BETWEEN THEM, YOU CAN'T STOP WATCHING.  WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SERIES TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR AN EXCELLENT TV SERIES.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I felt like I lucked into a secret concert.  One of the most down to earth, &#34;real&#34;, concert experiences on video.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Stupendous!! Story line is always interesting and easy to follow. Characters and actors are always believable and very talented. Thank you for making this series addictive. Thought provoking, scary, but never over the top.
B00B7IJDMA|3.0|Where is Regulator by Clutch.  That was the best song of the year.  I could've easily done without the Emily Kinney song or the Bear Mcreary remix.  Why put his music in that format?  Put his individual songs on there.  Thats what people wanted
B000TENK4K|4.0|I'm somewhat new to daft punk, and I was a little concerned about the mixed reviews this album has gotten, but I liked it. It may be because I don't have a history with Daft Punk and I'm getting to explore their whole catalog at once.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app! Never lags and its very clear and realistic. I enjoy playing this. Its has very fun mini games and the contests are very life like. You'll always be entertained.
B0012UNWJ8|5.0|The honesty and communication in this movie is excellent. The actors are superb. A must see for all movie lovers.
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|ELO were at a creative peak with their 1977 double album masterpiece Out Of The Blue.  I just started listening to the ELO catolog about a month ago and started with the outstanding Face The music album.  After a little research, popular opinion let me know that Out Of The Blue was The definitive ELO album.  My first thought was how could it be any better than Face The Music.  I cant say that it is better, however, it is just as good, and a lot longer to boot.  Out Of the Blue is a Huge sounding album.  This is production to the max.  Lynne is the standard when comes to the craft of making great sounding albums.  His credits are basically a who's who of rock and roll artists.  One Critic commented that pretty much any song on this album could have been a hit single and I could not agree more.  Out Of The Blue boasted a handful of great singles that can be heard on regular rotation today.  This album however is so much more than the singles.  Every track has been well thought out and phenomenaly delivered by the creative originality of ELO.  It is to hard to pick a favorite moment on this album but Concerto for a Rainy Day is pretty hard to beat.  Lynne's influences can be heard throughout this album.  His ability to sound just like Goerge Harrison on the end of Its Over is amazing, as well as his ability to emulate the Beach Boys on Big Wheel, (a genuinely moving song).  Out Of The Blue is a lot more pop sounding than ELO's earlier records, however, I think this band was made for this style of music.  Im not really a fan of their first couple of albums at all.  That is not to say that this record is trite or simple at all, on the contrary, it is technically brilliant and far exceeds the \\"pop\\" music label that so many serious bands hate to receive.  I really cant praise Out Of The Blue enough.  Simply put one of the greatest albums of the entire decade.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book! I recommend it for anyone who wants a good book to read! Really great piece of literature.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I must first confess that I am the typical man. True to my kind, my favorite movies heretofore tended to be triumphant accounts of victory such as “Miracle”, “Invictus”, “Secretariat” and of course “Gladiator”, coldly avoiding romantic movies as a waste of time!<br />I only watched this film because Mrs. Douglas, my high school English teacher, required my class to read the book.  However, either I didn’t read it well or as a result of my failing memory I couldn’t recall what it was about.  I did, however, recognize the title as I clicked through the cable guide.  So, on a whim, I began watching it and shortly after the beginning I found myself captivated, frantically hitting the record button!<br />I adore this 2005 interpretation of Jane Austen’s novel.  Keira Knightly is divine and Mathew MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy compliments her charming yet feisty portrayal of Miss Lizzie Bennet perfectly.<br />Though previous renditions of Jane’s novel may be more faithful to the story line, the 2005 film boldly strays, offering a story deliciously saturated with laughter, riotous gaiety, humor and, of course, seething emotion.  I feel Jane herself would not have objected.  This version skillfully contrasts the grandeur and spectacle of Georgian England society through its display of the fictional estates of Netherfield, Rosings Park, and Pemberly to the earthy likes of Longbourn.  I know many criticize how Longbourn was represented in the  movie, but I felt it deepened the theme of the story.  So get over it!<br />As for my avoidance of romantic stories, I’ve been so blind.  This movie has bewitched me, body and soul.  It’s an entrancing film, most completely and perfectly and incandescently wonderful.  As for the number of times I’ve watched it, guilt ridden, I can hardly be expected to own to it.<br />It rises to the very top of my list!
B000TERFS2|5.0|This is a great album. I hadn't gotten around to picking up a copy on CD and when I saw it was on sale in MP3 format, I figured good enough. Most of the time when I get a reissue with bonus tracks I end up skipping the bonus tracks after I listen to them the first time. The extra tracks on this one are actually very interesting. Very early versions of some of the hits on this album, with a different feel, but still very good. The rest of the album is, of course, great. I'm just pleased that not only did the bonus tracks not lower my opinion of this album, they're actually a bonus for once.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game it is one of the best games I have on my kindle however like others have said the money . Gain is slow and every time you purchase something it takes a lot of the money you worked so hard for but I guess that's kinda like real life you work so hard for the money and in an instant it is gone.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|This manages to be both a romp and and essay on how anything we do has only the importance that we attach to it. Quite an achievement.
1601251505|5.0|I received this book in great condition and was extremely happy.  This is a great game I have been playing a while with pdf's of Pathfinder.  However, there is nothing like a real book in your hands!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really love this product for a couple of reasons. The price is right (free) and you have to think outside of the box to finish a level. Some levels are very hard, but not impossible, which is nice. I feel my brain is expanding.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was emotional and very easy to read. It had enough mystery to keep you reading. The twist that was thrown in at the end of the book added to my enjoyment of the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an excellent trilogy. I have read all three books twice and it is just as exciting the second time as it was the first. It is well written and insightful.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book; though different from the movie, they were both great in different ways.  Everyone should read this and see the movie; it takes away the stigma of mental illness in a funny way.  Society needs this.
B005TZFYNE|3.0|First off, this album sounds too similar to albums Loud and Rated R! Every year its the same routine! Rushing an album right before Black Friday. About half of this album is catchy and makes me dance while the other half makes me depressed. I admit i love Rihanna's music, i have all her albums so far (MOFS, AGLM, GGGB, RR, Loud, TTT, and Unapologetic) but Rihanna should have re-released Loud like she did with GGGB back in 2008 instead of rushing an album that has nothing new to offer.<br /><br />You Da One (3/5): This song is catchy yet annoying, i don't know why Rihanna chose this single after We Found love, this song sounds too sexual just like the rest of the album, she sounds like she is obsessed with her lover and wants to please him.<br /><br />Where Have You Been (5/5): I F***** Love This Song! It's so catchy, when i first heard this i was like &#34;Ohhh nooo! another ballad.&#34; but as i listened to this song i realized that Rihanna has found a man that she has been searching for all her life with and additional beat breaks to enhance the song. Too bad it only reached number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100, i believe this would had been a great follow up single to We Found Love instead of You Da One. A Must listen! &#34;I've been everywhere man looking for someone, someone who can please me love me all night long. I've been everywhere, man looking for you babe, looking for you babe, searching for you babe.&#34;<br /><br />We Found Love ft. Calvin Harris (4/5): This song gets pretty annoying after 10 weeks at number one. This song is Rihanna's best selling single since Umbrella in 2007. We Found Love sounds like Rihanna sang half of the song while Clavin Harris added beats and background music throughout the whole song. The music video for this song has a Chris Brown look alike stating, overall showing Rihanna and Brown's relationship before the 2009 domestic violence incident. To me, this song sounds like a dedication  to their relationship that failed. But whatsells, sells.<br /><br />Talk That Talk ft. Jay-Z (4/5) : Same name as the Album Title, this song is great until Rihanna's verse hits in. Jay-Z kills this song with his ego Jayghova, but once Rihanna's verse hits in, the song sounds so repetative. &#34;Whatcha Say Now, Give It To Me Baby&#34; Slutty! Stop depending on Jay for singles! Your Not Beyoncé! Leave Jay alone!<br /><br />C*ckiness (Love It): Not even going to rate this! Skip This Track! Too Rude! Reminds Me of Raining Men ft. Nicki Minaj in Loud.<br /><br />Birthday Cake (1/5): Really Rihanna? This song isn't a complete song. This song is shorter than Mad House (Rated R). I Don't know how an artist can pervert cake in less than a minute and a half! All i hear is &#34;Cake, Cake, Cake, Cake&#34; and &#34;Licking the icing off.&#34; Umm...too sexual you think? To make this song even worst the remix features Chris Brown! I thought &#34;I Licked The Gun When I'm Done Cause I Know That Revenge Is Sweet!&#34; What kind of message are you showing to your fans? Nobody wants to know about your past sexual life with Brown! First off in Rated R, Rihanna sings about her dark-side with edgy songs such as G4L where she threatens Browns for his actions, now she wants the world to know she forgives Brown because of her sexual desires. I Don't believe any radio station will be playing this song in 2013 or it will reach the top 10!<br /><br />We All Want Love (3.5/5): Finally, A Non-Slutty Song! After a minute and a half of horrible music, Rihanna sings a relate-able song that most young people feel through on a daily basis. It's a nice shift from &#34;Cake.&#34;<br /><br />Drunk On Love (4/5): Stupid In Love 2.0? This song talks about her addiction for love and affection, great flow-up song after We All Want Love because it shows what too much love can do to an individual.<br /><br />Roc Me Out (3.5/5): Rude Boy 2.0? What happened Rihanna? The two previous songs were great! At least this song isn't repetitive as &#34;Cake&#34; or disturbing as &#34;Love It&#34; but it sounds very similar to Rude Boy.<br /><br />Watch N Learn (4/5): This song sounds great until you understand its meaning. It reminds me of her early work like &#34;Sell Me Candy&#34; where you cant really understand the song but has a hidden-sexual message within. &#34;Imma do it do it do it on the bed on the floor on the couch. Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth. Just because I can’t kiss back doesn't mean you can’t kiss that.&#34; Umm how many more of these sexual songs remain in the album?<br /><br />Farewell (5/5): Finally!, the last song. Unless you buy the deluxe edition. This is a great song to end the album. &#34;Farewell, Somebody's gonna miss you!&#34; Congratulations Rihanna! Your finally forgetting about Chris Brown! Hopefully there will be no more CB dedication singles in future albums.<br /><br />The Deluxe Edition is okay if you are Hard Core Rihanna Navy but it sounds out of place.<br /><br />Red Lipstick (3.5/5): What happened? At least it isn't the version with Nicki Minaj's verse. Another sexual song *Sigh* what has happened to Rihanna's talent? Good Girl Gone Slutty!<br /><br />Do Ya Thang (4.5/5): Great Song! It describes how a girl feels when she is in relationship with the guy she admires. One of the best song from the deluxe edition.<br /><br />Fool In Love (4/5): Another song about her feelings towards Brown. Yes Rihanna, you are a fool in love! This song sounds to similar to Britney Spears' &#34;Criminal.&#34; What a coincident? Both singles were released late 2011 when the collaborated early in 2011 with the S&M remix. The single is still a great song to listen compared to the rest of the album.<br /><br />Overall, this album sounds like a sluttier version that Loud! If You Thought That &#34;S&M&#34; was to inappropriate, just wait until you listen to &#34;Birthday Cake&#34; and &#34;Love It.&#34; I have lots of respect for Rihanna, but she should just take some time off to relax and forget about Chris Brown and create evolutionary music as she did in 2007 and 2009.
1601252463|5.0|This is a very great game.  I have so far just been playing with the pdf's I have.  However there is nothing like a real book in your hands!
B004BSFC6Y|2.0|I had such high hopes for these adorable things when i first saw them.My then 4mth old was just discovering his feet and i thought these would be fun. But they are so loose they come off practically by themselves.He enjoyed them when he had them on, but i really wish there was a way they had been a little snugger. I wound up giving them away
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Was a gift for my son and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Will buy the 3rd season when it comes out for him.
B009KEN87O|5.0|good stuff reminds me of space invaders but more fun. passes the time like the power ups keeps things fresh each level gets challenging once and a while. youll love it hours and hours of fun  really like the 3d when your ship is traveling foward

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use it quite often and it was free. I would recommend to my friends. Very nice calculator...thank you...very good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why aren't there more 3D action/adventure games like this. It's graphics are not spectacular but they are better than many other pocket games. The computer and XBOX versions also have 16-bit quality graphics. It's a great Indie game. It is missing some things that the regular versions of the game, e.g., Endermen and the End. Those will probably be added later. I would recommend this to anybody who wants a really fun action game instead of just settling for Facebooklike games.
B00BN2CY7G|2.0|I've always loved Bon Jovi, and every song of theirs was my favorite, but this album is a sham!  The only song I really like is &#34;Because We Can&#34;, and I can deal with a couple of others.  The rest though really sucks.  It doesn't even sound like Bon Jovi (the band, not Jon).  I understand that times are changing, etc., but let's not do a 180! Ugh!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I like a twisted plot and well fleshed characters!<br />I also don't want a good story to end!<br />This fits the bill.
B009KEN87O|5.0|IT IS A TRUE CLASSIC! SUPER ADDICTING! RECOMMENDED FOR THE ARCADE GENERATION! GREAT THAT IT WAS THE FREE APP OF THE DAY!

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love the different options and easy access to sound options . Great game!. It seems you can play forever. I also like the pause options.,
B008476HBM|4.0|It was good to get Pride free on my smartphone and be able to have it with me at all times and read when I had free time.
B000XXGMU6|5.0|After reading how these boots have fallen apart, worn out easily and how quality at Timberland has diminished compared to the past, I was extremely skeptical when purchasing these boots, I actually removed them from my wish list three times.<br />I finally gave in since I liked the look and style.<br />I wear a size 13 and the pair that came in at size 13 resembled clown shoes at the extreme length and width.<br />Amazons great and fast return policy let me swap them for a full size smaller a size 12.<br />Once I received the correct size all I can say is that I have worn these boots nonstop for a month now and can't wait to purchase different styles.<br />These boots feel out of this world great right from the box.<br />I'm closely watching for anytype of wear and loose stitching for fray as well.<br />These boots have molded perfectly to my foot and feel like a natural extension of myself when going thru acres of mountain path or just casual walking.<br />They look great with my jeans and khakis as well.<br />I catch lots of glances towards my feet and have received a few compliments as well on the style and who makes them.<br />Thank you Amazon for your great service and thank you Timberland for a great product
0345529057|5.0|I haven't even gotten through book 1 yet, but it has already proven to be 1000x better than the show, and the show is already great. Great price. Anyone who likes sci-fi/fantasy will get into this series quickly.
0307473473|5.0|Too bad that none of the movies have come close to doing justice to the books. Exciting plot with numerous twists and great social commentary too.
B0090SI42Y|2.0|Iron Fists' bloody and hyper real opening title sequence is perhaps the best evidence of what RZA had in mind when he started developing his love letter to East Asian cinema, and there's no denying the film's clever use of wirework and sublime imagery to sell that notion. The production's use of authentic Chinese locations also offers a sense of visual grandeur.<br /><br />Where Iron Fists falls apart is in its contrived mythology. While it's obvious that RZA and co-writer Eli Roth spent a lot of time developing this complex universe filled with<br />warring clans, mystic ideologies and thorough backstories, none of those ever become fully realized over the course of the movie, even with the Unrated Edition's extended runtime. Instead of a restrained, balanced narrative, the director spends more time cramming in as many tributes to past works as he can, without establishing his own unique style. As a result, Iron Fists becomes less of a modern spin on a classic genre and more of a muddy, bombastic tribute video.<br />That's not to say the film isn't without SOME  entertainment value. Iron Fists' over-the-top fight sequences are among some of its strongest moments, and the choreography is, on the whole, impressive. Admittedly, RZA is probably the weakest link in terms of both fighting and acting. However, martial artists Rick Yune, Byron Mann and Cung Le add some credibility to the choreo, and Russell Crowe turns out a fun performance as the gunblade-slinger Jack Knife.<br /><br />It's just a shame none of these elements form any  kind of cohesive whole.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Dan Brown writes another amazing novel! Gives plenty of interesting facts about computers as the thrilling story progresses. I recommend this to anyone looking for an adventurous book to keep them on &#34;the edge of their seat&#34;, very exciting.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Normally when I hear so much good stuff about a movie I am disappointed. But this one was funny & still had a good plot. Definitely worth the watch. The singing is also very well preformed!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Just keeps getting better.<br />The Starks are spread across Westros while Dragons grow and Joffrey is despised.<br />Walkers,witches and winter is coming!<br />Pay your debts if you want to survive Season 2.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus is a fantastic story that engages the reader to really believe the magic that is portrayed.  I thought the book was incredibly well written and mesmerizing.

B00003CWOL|4.0|I love this movie a lot and I wish a lot more people knew about it and appreciated it. I was disappointed  when I went to a Half Price Books a few weeks after opening and watching the DVD I had ordered directly from amazon (to get super saver shipping) and found it for a 1/3 of the price.
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|WOTE are an incredibly talented and creative band producing a diverse range of music. Summer Vibe, Gang of Rhythm, REVO, and Red Hands are my favorites on this album.

B008N1V11U|4.0|Please can you at least change it to 0.99 because I will buy it and tell all my friends to buy it.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|I tried to view this episode but was plagued by delays and computer freezing. I tried downloading the recommended software but that was even more confusing.<br /><br />For something to work, it should be point and click.<br /><br />I don't recommend the Amazon streaming video. It is clunky hard to use and the search is very unfriendly. I have used several other services and none have been as painful as this one.
0765325950|3.0|What can I say...it was an ending, but there are no real endings, are there? It was marginally more exciting than Book 13, there were hundreds of pages of nearly meaningless text with obscure background characters and then a few lines mentioning a character that's had a major role in the series dies.
B00A83075M|5.0|Loved it in the movie theater and had to own it. We have watched it over and over and it was great to have it delivered to my door the first day it came out. Amazon even refunded a penny for the difference in amount from my pre order. Every penny counts !
B00338QENI|5.0|I love how it read like a novel even though it was a work of nonfiction. The book was carefully constructed, and it was clear that Skloot investigated and wrote with great care and concern.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I loved this story, the CGI, and the depth of the characters. It's not a cheesy kind of movie and I think children will love it!<br />They brought so many different effects and diversity that makes the story come alive and a thrill to watch!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham has written a great thiller with suspense and mystery, it's something I look for in a good book.  I  would recommend this book to all who have not read Grisham in a while.  Held my attention to the very end.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|What a wonderful story ,with a great picture, and wonderful sound in Master audio.<br />The war scenes gave my subwoofers a real workout.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|if you are a fan of the band get this set. It comes with a dvd/ cd set and what a show it is!
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I loved this book. I had watched the movie several times prior to reading the book and loved the movie so I gave the book a try even though I am typically against doing so. however, I'm glad that I read the book. The author blends several different stories together beautifully. This story speaks of friendship and race relations and issues. overall a great read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does everything that I need it to do quickly and accurately I have not had any problems with this app. I highly recomend this app. to everyone
0894803123|3.0|Loved reading about the two of them and their journey to success, but their recipes involve no cooking and with eggs, that's not a good thing. My sister is going to be interviewing them the first of April and touring and sampling all their goodies. They're even paying her airfare and hotel, so that's pretty cool.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I was addicted to the Eureka SciFi series but only after the first season, So, seeing how the foundation of the series began was a big delight. Eureka is one of the best Science Fiction concepts ever. I loved it, sorry the series ended.
B00AGKH45I|5.0|This is the Ultimate Fleetwood Mac Fan's Fantasy album. It includes never before heard demos and great photos from the Rumours era!! A++
B00BESCJII|3.0|I know lots of people in general loved this movie, but I found it somewhat depressing and not uplifting. The subject matter ended up being sad even though the performances by the actors were good. Just not my cup of tea. The title of &#34;perks&#34; and way the movie was promoted makes you think of a more positive story, but it ended up being a downer. Sorry to say I wasn't feeling perky about those wallflowers in the end.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I felt it was interesting, but not as all engrossing like American Assassin which held my interest from start to finish,
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Great purchase always wanted to read. Very strong writing and inspiration. Can recommendt to anyone of any age for historical insight.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I love both Meryl Streep an Tommy Lee Jones so I had to see this. It was funny and they suited each other well. I enjoyed the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|W hat a great ending to this dark and twisted tale. Heartbreaking and real. I read it twice and cried both Times. I so hope the movie doesn't make it pretty. This is real and true.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Clint plays his role well and the chemistry of the cast works well.  There's a lot a crap out there available to watch these days and this isn't one of them -- it's worth the time to watch.
0316044938|5.0|Fiction but written by a survivor of rape. She avoids detailed descriptions of the girl's assault and rape and instead focusses on the mental aspect and how it affects  those close to the girl. It draws you in from the start and it wasn't easy to work out quite what was going to happen next. Psychologically very interesting indeed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book.  It was so cleverly written.  I could not put it down from the time I started to read it.  Can't wait to read more from this author.  This book has everything you could want in a story wrapped up into one.
0307730697|5.0|If you like American Sniper you will love this book.  very well written and a great story about the life Adam Brown.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This was surprisingly fun. There isn't much conceptually that is original, and yet I'm still playing. I guess that is, in my opinion, what makes this a fun game. Nothing fancy. Just shoot, maneuver, and kill aliens.
034580404X|1.0|Will excite adolescent virgins.  That's about it. Not much of the author's grey matter was tapped for this.  Wait for the board game which is sure to follow.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I like the way John Grisham writes and this book was not a diissapointment.  Thanks for offering this book on your site
0446619078|3.0|I didn't think I'd find a Bosch book slow and hard to get into, but sadly this one is. It does have some interesting back story but anyone with a good knowledge of psychology will find the police psychologist character a bit lacking.<br /><br />Bosch goes back in time to investigate his mother's murder.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Price was very good, ordering process very easy, this is a great series my son and I really enjoyed it...
B008ALAHA4|5.0|When my company issued me a new MacBook air I didn't want to have to fork over another $80 for a spare cable, I didn't even know this existed but I'm glad it does for 1/8 the price!  This is an apple product so the quality is good, and it also changes the wire configuration from a T back to an L which I think makes it less likely to accidentally disconnect the cord.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|best movie next to &#34;Lonesome Dove&#34; I pick as one of my favorites. The acting, the drama, the music the history are all fantastic. It is  well done; ala Peter Weir, director of Gallipoli, and the Year of LIving Dangerously. Great films all. sak66
1451627297|4.0|Just be aware of # of pages to this book. I over looked that in the description.  Have not started to read it yet.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game was great with the better quality, and more areas of challenge. Though this was a great game, it gave me an idea that the next should be a jurassic park temple run, where it starts as you running out of the forest, being chased by velosorapters, the disien would be to the desieners.
1400067820|5.0|Nassim Taleb writes in a very authoritarian voice.  His tone is frequently at once both pompous and arrogant.  The man is brilliant and he knows it.  He is not shy about letting his reader know it either.  Taleb is brutally contemptuous of those he violently disagrees with being mostly what he terms charlatan and/or fragalista, highly-educated, academic economic pundits that prostitute themselves to business and/or government to perpetuate stupid, destructive ideas and outright fraud either knowingly or unknowingly.  The actual premise of \\"Antifragile\\" is quite simple in many ways and could essentially be explained in a couple of pages quite thoroughly.  Taleb takes over 500 pages to discuss the concept going all the way through the Index.  The man is multi-lingual and extremely well read, particularly in the classics.  There are hundreds of references throughout the text to works of literature from different centuries, cultures and languages.  Frequently, the connection to the main theme of the book seems a bit stretched but the vignettes are almost always quite interesting and thought provoking.  Taleb has strong opinions on a wide variety of topics and presents them as facts in a harsh, clipped fashion.  Much of what Taleb proclaims is quite outside the norm and at odds with conventional wisdom.  As soon as I started reading \\"Antifragile\\" I could not stop and read the entire book in one long sleep-deprived session with minimal breaks to walk my dogs.  I savored many passages with feelings similar to scraping the fatty delicious meat off the bone of a perfectly charcoal-grilled T-bone steak with my teeth.  I wanted to reread the book immediately but will force myself to wait a minimum of one year before doing so that I can think about the concept of antifragility using my own references and experience without the bombastic voice of Taleb pounding inside my head.  \\"Antifragile\\" is probably the best book I have ever read.  It is certainly the most important.  I won't attempt to summarize the main theme of \\"Antifragile\\".  I would prefer that people read the book for themselves.  I believe every rationale person on the planet should read this book.  If people applied the concept of antifragility as defined in great detail by Taleb their lives would become happier and more successful.  If the world were ruled by numerous city-states governed by the concept of antifragility our planet would become a safer more productive place.  Poverty and hunger would be largely eradicated.  The global economy would be much healthier and there would be little war.  The threat of nuclear holocaust would diminish exponentially.  Nassim Nicholas Taleb has written a book that could significantly change the world for the better.  There is no greater achievement available to an author.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I am spending a fortune on food  and went from level 35 to 0 somehow and it is taking forever to earn back like 200,000 xp and is a tiny bit blurry..... but nice and easy to earn gems
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Love this movie. I have watched it over and over since its release!! You will not be disappointed with this movie!
B008CX2A2I|5.0|Unfortunately it is not compatible with my Onkyo NR 809 which although purchased in 2012 seems to be a 2011 model!  As such the UBT-1 had to be returned as it simply did not work in spite of the Onkyo setup assistance which incidentally can be lousy or excellent depending on the person you get on the phone!  The first technician informed me that the UBT-1 was deficient while the second technician informed me that it would not work on my (2011) machine!  Looks like I have been had by Onkyo when I purchased the NR809!
B00407PNY2|5.0|If you like Steve McQueen and San Francisco, you will love the movie. It has a great story with a few twists and turns. The scenery of San Francisco is beautiful and the greatsest chase scene can be seen. The chase scene takes about seven minutes with some very unique footage of, I believe, Divisidero Street. This is one of the steepest streets in San Francisco and the action is ever-so-good. Along with the action, the story is also very good. Robert Vaughn also plays a nice role and appears as a nemisis to McQueen throughout the movie. 5 Stars!!!
B009GQ57ES|4.0|These boys have serious skills in both musicianship and rhymes.  I expected a recording full of Thrift Shop humor, but got an earful of real life commentary.  Impressed.
0385349947|1.0|... just what the world needs:  yet another elitist, rich bit** (with a millionaire husband to boot), telling us how to live our  pathetic lives.  Lean in, indeed.  Try living a life of dire poverty, crawl out of it by your fingernails by eating crap at your boring, mind-numbing 9 - 5 job (which you count yourself lucky to have because of the health insurance), then get back to me.  I read part of this book from the library and was bored to tears and couldn't finish it.  I do not get the hype at all.  I'd much rather read ANY book written by ANY woman who was NOT born into privilege, did NOT go to Harvard (dear Lord, haven't we had enough of name-dropping, braggadocious crap to last a lifetime?), and did NOT make elitist connections to get the best jobs.  I wouldn't take advice from this woman on how to cure a hangnail, much less waste my hard-earned money for her book.
6304698798|5.0|The Best Spaggetty Westrn, outthere. Great work of the Italian producer, and famous music by Italian composer. Great service to deliver it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy Majong and I love playing this game on my Kindle!  I pick up the Kindle at almost any time and play!  I have really gotten hooked on beating my score over and over!
B003F3NDWG|3.0|I bought this as a gift so did not review it myself.  I see the series on TV but my daughter does not have cable so she can't.
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|This is the epitome of all of Donna's recordings. There are 35 in all including the classics &#34;Hot Stuff&#34;, &#34;MacArthur Park&#34; and &#34;Last Dance&#34; just to name a few. There are two discs with disc one playing her earlier hits; disc two has the later hits like &#34;Unconditional love&#34;, &#34;There Goes My Baby&#34; and &#34;Surernatural Love&#34;; the rare &#34;Dinner With Gershwin&#34; can also be heard which I consider to be the most unique of all of her songs. Nonetheless, any Donna or disco fan will simply love this compilation for her whole career is enclosed in one great cd.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I liked the part when Joker and Batman were fighting at the end of the movie.  It was very exciting to see who won.
B0000041LL|4.0|Not only slow tempos, but lack of drive.  Not quite able to see where the emphasis should go.  Flacid, drawn-out notes where there should be some punch.  (Beethoven is not a moderate.)<br /><br />I appreciate a broad tempo where it provides better instrumental tone quality or more transparency between parts.  That doesn't seem to apply in these recordings.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|Good movie and a service to deliver it. Comparable with the previous movie, but in some way it is even better.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|its the greatest movie i have ever seen since Gone with the wind, Shawshank Redemption and the Wizard of oz
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The game is great,no contest. When you get over the qualms you may have about a game where you're essentially a bio terrorist, it's one of the best apps out there. My only issue is that the Necroa virus update will not work on my device. Please fix this issue.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Easily the best movie I have seen from 2012. Katheryn Bigelow is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. 4 1/2 stars from me. (5 stars, in my mind, are reserved for classics like The Godfather, There Will Be Blood, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, The Big Lebowski, Royal Tenenbaums, Unforgiven, Apocalypse Now, etc...)
0894803123|5.0|I used to own this book previously.  When we moved, it got lost.  I gave my daughter an ice cream maker for her birthday so I needed to make sure she would have some recipies to get started. Ben & Jerry's is a great way to get started.
1936608618|5.0|I have been a CrossFit Endurance certified coach since 2009.  When I first learned of the anaerobic endurance approach it resonated with what I learned as a competitive rugby player.  The seminar was eye-opening and opened exciting possibilities.<br /><br />The book contains everything I learned at the certification seminar, plus added photos.  I used to frequently refer to my notes, but have now replaced those with this book.  It helps to have a coach, but this is an added resource that if followed will revolutionize your endurance training.  No dogma, this stuff works.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not intrigued by the sexual scenarios as much as I am the general story.  It's the whole part of figuring out the other person and wondering why they are so messed up that I like.  I have the next 2 books on Kindle as well but have not had a chance to read them yet.  I look forward to figuring out 50 shades of messed up.
B001GMH8TM|5.0|Jim Carrey moved his career forward with this movie. It truly makes you question why he has been in some bad movies recently. This is Jim Carrey performing some great acting. This movie is touching yet hilarious and if you have yet to see it you should purchase it.<br /><br />Both the audio and video quality are excellent. AMAZING! MUST HAVE!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i thought this book was absolutely fantastic!  the characters were very believable and the journey they take is lovely, traumatic and real.  this was one i could not put down!
B009KEN87O|3.0|Wow...  Amazing gameplay, perfect permissions, perfect size...<br /><br />I would have loved to give this app 5 stars, but it force closed on me  twice in 5 minutes of gameplay.  I loaded it on my girlfriends gs3 as well and got force closes there too..  :(  (she's running stock and I wanted to make sure it wasn't the ROM I was on)<br /><br />Fix the gs3 issues and I'll be glad to try it again.
B005HI4LMS|1.0|When some friends were talking about this at work one day, he made it sound like a funny movie.  I didn't realize it was a horror movie.  It gave my son nightmares.
B004I744AS|5.0|I use this app  multiple times during a day while  reading,  doing puzzles to look up words,  people,  places  or any ingo needed at the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am enjoying it! I surprised myself and got attached to the first horse very quickly. This is a very fun and cute game.
