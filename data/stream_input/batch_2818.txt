B00AEFY5MK|5.0|I love the movie Grease I think John Travolta is a good actor. So is Olivia Newton John. Is an excellent movie.<br /><br /> I like the Blu-ray because the picture is much clearer than the regular DVD.<br /><br /> Therefor I will recomand it to the people and I will give five stars..
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This movie I went in to watching having not read the book or seen the Swedish version. I wasn't very familiar with Rooney Mara either but Rooney rocked this movies socks off. She really seemed to merge with this role and twist her part into a believable person. I felt for her but she didn't need my sympathy because she took matters into her hands and took care of herself. I admired her for standing up for herself. This is in my top 5 favorite films ever. Cast was exceptional, plot was wicked. Must see!
B00005QGAX|5.0|I like Michael Jackson he's my favorite singer. I like all his songs. My first favorite song is Heal The World.<br /><br /> Bad is my second favorite song. Therefor I will give five stars.
B008LXZFH6|1.0|Will Ferrell was very funny on SNL, and his movie ELF is a modern classic.  I keep trying to watch his other movies, hoping they will be at least bearable, and I keep being disappointed.  I'm not sure why all of Ferrel's movies (with the exception of Elf) are incredibly stupid and really dull, but there you have it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's so much fun....I'll start it and get lost in the game and before you know it 2hours have gone by...
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Awesome story and graphics. Clues and puzzles throughout out the whole games. Love the movie scenes and everything. Definitely a game to purchase.
B008NIS2SS|2.0|The music quality of the songs on these disks was quite good, to my ear anyway. The 7 original vinyl albums are split among 4 CDs. All the songs from the 7 original albums are included, though this set may not include some &#34;bonus&#34; songs included in some CD reissues of the individual albums.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the song &#34;Peace Piece&#34; (Disk 1, song #18) would not play; therefore I returned the set. That is the reason for the low rating. If all songs would have played satisfactorily, I would have rated the set 5 stars.
B005SH5K7I|5.0|Really good family movie, I highly recommend it. Really fun and funny movie, with a splash of a happy ending for the zookeeper :)
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Cheapest case I've ever bought for my phone and seems to be the best quality. Fits really tight on the phone and the material its made out of has a nice texture. Feels grippy in your hands but still slides in and out of your pocket easily. I also like the clear, the iPhone is a pretty nice looking piece of tech and its cool to see it instead of it being hidden behind a case. Great job Amazon. Might order another for my wife's phone.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A superb account of this trying time in our history. It puts brilliant perspective on the causes and impact of something that will shape the future for centuries to come.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|One of the best in the genre, looking forward to the rest of the series, why must I write so many words
0670024813|4.0|I have only just started reading this book.  It is well put together, as all of Jared Diamond's books.  I am hoping to pick it up again soon.
B003L77G2Y|4.0|Got hooked and so far I have purchased Season 1,2 and 3.  Enjoyed each of them greatly.  Will be purchasing Seasons 4 and 5 soon.
0062255657|5.0|If only for one day.  Or even an hour.  He has such a vivid imagination.  This story is short, and a fairly easy read, yet it's so descriptive and magical and will blow your mind.  I never even realized, until two days after I finished reading the book, that we never learn the boys name.<br /><br />This story is a great example of what it's like to be a child with no power, in a world full of adults who think they're always right.  It shows how much we, as adults, underestimate children.  They are so much smarter than we give them credit for, and also observant.  Kids can see things adults can't, and I love that about them.  The Ocean at the End of the Lane shows that adults can be wrong, know how to manipulate innocent kids, and we as the reader can see and feel just how powerless the boy is.<br /><br />There is a quote, not by Gaiman, but I feel like it fits with the story. \\"We spend the first year of a child's life teaching her to walk and talk, and the rest of her life to shut up and sit down. There's something wrong there.\\"  ― Neil deGrasse Tyson<br /><br />I love Neil Gaiman ... and deGrasse Tyson :-)
B008BQ8VOC|3.0|seems to be avoiding all the interesting potentials for these characters and taking all the superficial/sad routes.  i liked the setup of the first season but am disappointed in the follow-through.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is amazing and its first impressions are great. But the game takes some time to update, and for me I couldn't Host a multiplayer world. But it deserves all 5 stars.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I normally don't like pastiches, and especially Sherlock Holmes pastiches, but this on is an exception. Steven Moffat is a genius, and it shows. I was already a fan of his through Doctor Who, but this is even better, if that's possible. But enough superlatives.<br /><br />What makes it work is the fact that they turn it on its head, while still maintaining the essence of what makes Holmes Holmes. They haven't changed all that much, just taken the original and put it into a modern setting. In the original Watson was an army doctor, wounded in Afghanistan. Because of current events, Watson is still wounded in Afghanistan. That doesn't sound like much, but to the purist it can make all the difference. In the original Watson was wounded in the leg. Or was it the shoulder? It changed when Conan Doyle apparently forgot. In this version Watson has a limp and uses a cane, but his therapist and then Holmes tells him that it's psychosomatic. How it plays out is a wonder to behold. In the original the word &#34;Rache&#34; is written on the wall in a dying man's blood. Inpector Lestrade assumes it's part of the name &#34;Rachel&#34;. Holmes informs him that &#34;Rache&#34; is German for &#34;Revenge&#34;. In this version they change it just a bit. In this version they still go everywhere in London's famous Black Cab taxis, only of course they are automobiles rather than horse-drawn carriages. And wait until you see what they do with the famous deerstalker cap! But that comes later. In the opener Lestrade ransacks their apartment under the guise of a drug bust. When Watson talks about how silly that is, Holmes starts shushing him. But enough teasing.<br /><br />In the original Watson wrote short stories for the Strand Magazine. In this version he keeps a blog. They are close in this version, and call each other by their first names The result is the same. A big part of the fun is the portrayals of Holmes and Watson by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, both now famous for'The Hobbit'.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is the best Sherlock Holmes since Jeremy Brett, and if you can live with the updates it's well worth seeing.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Wuthering Heights is one of the great masterpieces of English Literature. It is a timeless story of obsessive love, racism, class conflict, and the oppression of women. The language is luminously beautiful. It is amazing that Emily Bronte wrote this novel at such a young age, under a masculine pen name, and then died several years after it's publication. Everyone should read it.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|It's all pointless really. Slow and drawn out. Go rake leaves in your front yard you'll have a better time.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun game I play it daily so do my kid's I like all of the bubble games fun fun all day
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's fun and smart with good twists and turns. The actors are all really good. We really loved watching it.
B009ARMS1I|2.0|I used to love this show with all my heart. It saved my life and that's something I will never forget...but that's no excuse for what it's become. Even when it started to get bad in season three, I watched faithfully every single week. But season four is nothing more than a steaming piece of crap. There were a couple of good things, though, so I feel like I can't just give it one star. The cast is, as always, amazingly talented and hardworking and they're the one saving grace of it all. The first four episodes are decent. But after that it goes downhill very quickly. Each week they handle a new issue, write a new public service announcement. The show has always been prone to preachy moments and controversial storylines, but the difference is that they used to pick a few and focus on them. Now they throw in something new each week, hardly try to write something noteworthy about it, and then move onto another topic the following week. And that would be fine, if they weren't writing about issues such as school shootings and child molestation.<br />In addition, Blaine has got to be the biggest &#34;Gary Stu&#34; on television. I love Darren Criss, but I can't enjoy his presence on Glee because he's shoved down the viewers throats. The show has very much become about pandering to Darren fans, at the expense of everyone else. Although I had a similar problem with Rachel in the first couple seasons, the issue feels much worse with Blaine. He sings majority of the songs. He gets whatever he wants. When I stopped watching, anyone who came in conflict with him was just jealous of his talent. Whenever he made mistakes, he didn't have to apologize because it was written out to make him the victim. Hell, him cheating on his boyfriend was all about how unfortunate the situation was for Blaine because it wasn't his fault he was lonely and made a mistake. Even when it was the Rachel Berry show, she was allowed to be the bad guy (storming off whenever she didn't get a solo, tellingFinn he was cheated on in order to try to get together with him...) but now everyone seems to bow down to how flawless and talented Blaine is, and it more than a little annoying.<br />Musically, it's my least favorite season. Although I prefer the top 40s songs Glee does over the older songs and Broadway hits, popular songs are best done when Glee does something new with the song, or covers a more obscure version of it (Poker Face, Dancing With Myself, Shake It Out, any of the mash ups, I could go on for a while). But now I often feel like they're just covering popular songs without any originality behind it. Many songs are so heavily auto tuned, despite the fact that this cast can sing really well and they wouldn't have auto tune while performing in a choir room. I used to download every single song they released, and I loved 95% of them, but now maybe one song an episode stands out. The fourth episode of the season, The Break Up, was my favorite musically in a while and their versions of 3, Whistle and Some Nights are amazing (although Some Nights isn't anything that Fun. didn't do, and makes me kind of a hypocrite on this point). The handful of songs I constantly find myself listening to are one of the reasons this is getting two stars<br />The New York storylines were a bit better than the Lima ones. I eventually stopped watching most of the show but continued with Kurt, Rachel and Santana's plots. Kurt is my favorite, and it was nice to see him doing so well both at Vogue and NYADA. Chris, Lea and Naya are three of the most talented members of this cast and having them all live together was a good move.<br />As for the newbies, they're all talented. Becca plays such a believable, crazy bitch. Jacob and Melissa are both fantastic singers. Blake Jenner...well, I stopped watching Ohio scenes shortly after he joined the cast but he's probably great too. But the writers didn't try to blend them with the soon-to-be graduating cast very well. It makes the characters seem pointless, especially if most of the characters are going to be in New York next year.<br />Overall, it's not worth watching this season on television, let alone spending money on it. I'm really glad that it will only have two more seasons, and then the cast can move onto better projects. It's such a shame to have to rate this so poorly and give it such a negative review, when this show was once the only thing that kept me going.<br />And I can't write such an awful review without feeling bad that I'm bad mouthing some of Cory's only work. I saw him in Kyle XY before Glee started, and he was truly one of the best actors on the show. He will be missed, and my thoughts go out to the entire cast.
140120841X|5.0|Initially I thought this was a silly endeavor, somewhere in the same category as inflating Batman to Dark Knight, an art form to snare young males into believing they were rebels with wallets. Then as I was watching footage of the protests in Brazil and Egypt I saw Guy Fawkes masks in the crowds and began to recognize &#34;V for Vendetta&#34; was a more important cultural event. The brutish dialogue, flat characters and images are a translator's dream day. It's culturally important as a bell weather of political desperation, much the same way screaming at professional sports, or pride in ownership of firearms, a love of a  'power' identity while the rest of the world appears to be excluded.<br />It's not a pleasant read. It borders on unintelligible, but it is important.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|The subject and its treatment were unusual, well researched and absorbing.  Narrator had a special, modern tone and perceptive observations. I have recommended the book to others.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis is phenomenal in this movie.  He had you sucked in as if you really thought he was Lincoln. Such a good actor.
B003719G40|4.0|Well written common sense. Serves as a reminder that it's not always about you. Put your spouse's needs into consideration and you will reap the rewards.
0345404475|5.0|Philip K. Dick is a master at science fiction and this book is his masterpiece.<br />Nothing like the movie, it has a depth only found in literature.<br />This is a classic that will never date. I've read it 3 times, and each time<br />I am amazed at how amazing this book tells the story of a possible future.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It was very easy to use. I like having more categories like holidays!  Seem to be spending more time pinning.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I memorized this movie as a child and use some of the sayings on a everyday basis.  My children thoroughly enjoyed it
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I was very disappointed in the script. Just a boring movie, really. The idea of the movie could have been great, just a complete waste of my time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so impressed with this series. I will say that I was quite disappointed with all the interruptions while I was watching it-it kept losing the connection-like 4 times in one episode.
B001GNRNQE|5.0|Great artist, great songs<br />Jennifer has an awesome voice<br />I love the album and recommend it<br />You will love it too
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Great classic movie! Timeless! Takes me back when my children were really young. We could watch over and over again.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Saw Alabama Shakes on a late night saw and feel in love with their sound.  Before you buy you can check out some songs on Amazon.
034580404X|5.0|fast shipping delivered on time. I purchased the books so that I could read the series without having to wait to get them from the library. Great price for all three books.
B00CAWUJAM|5.0|I'm a HUGE Sigur Ros fan and this album, in my opinion, is their best effort since the Untitled record. Start to finish is strong, and the last three tracks are some of the best they've ever done. This album is catchy, noisy, huge and their are actual SINGLES!!! Seriously, watch out world, this band is going to takeover.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This is a good game so far, I just started to play. Very good graphics. Love the battles. Will have to wait to see how it goes.
B009TO99TG|3.0|I liked some of their music so thought I'd try this set on-line.  But it seemed at least 3 of these were pretty much the same..not much variety.  Liked only most of what was on the last one in the set.  Maybe some of their others are better.  But it's just a matter of what you like I guess -- just all seemed the same...slow...etc.  I'd recommend trying one of the two others Mylo Xyloto & Live 2012 instead.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The style and the content are very engaging for anyone who likes this genre in my opinion. I recommended it to several other people and everyone found it very engrossing. I reread it almost immediately and am anxious to look into whether this author has other books
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent story, beautiful scenery and costumes, and a fabulous cast.  Each season is better than the one before; can't wait until Season 4 starts.
B009E20IB6|2.0|Was expecting a few Harry Bosch stories ..... all I got was some discarded stuff & a few chapters from Harry Bosch's next novel. Come on Mr Connelly ......at least keep me entertained for a little while ...... not these snippets from your waste bin.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Easy to use photo editing. Simple and straightforward.  Better than most other ones I have tried, and worth the money
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As usual, this book is awesome.  I have loved all of this author's books that I've read.  The characters are well developed and the plot is exciting.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|One of my favs!! I had the DVD then it went missing and I was so happy to find it here!!!
B00AHHODH2|4.0|Loved these women.  Good story  line and with surprises at every turn.  Never judge a book by its cover or a house by its inhabitants.  Can't wait for the next book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It keeps you engaged fully wondering how many more hidden clues there could be before getting to the next stage. My only complaint was that on two occasions, I could not get off of a particular screen and had to start over. Fortunately, having solved the problems along the way, it was easy to get back to where I was. It is a fun and interesting challenge, which I would buy again.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I liked the old version better.  It was more user friendly than this one. Maybe when I get used to using it I will be more apt to recommend the application.
B002KKCVOG|5.0|Not only ate they amazingly comfortable, but they can be word anywhere.  During the summer I don't go anywhere without them.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Mind bougling. You have to plan every move. Need to add an option of getting an extra bird somehow. Help.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|A wee bit confusing to set up, but once I figured it out, well it works pretty well and looks good.
B0076DELIG|4.0|While I enjoyed the book, the plots are becoming too predictable.  Harry's predicaments are becoming too similar to all the old novels and I am a great fan of Michael Connelly.  He needs to retire.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This is a message you can't miss. Also a visual experience that's not worth NOT having. Just watch it. You won't regret it, and it's great for all ages, too.
140006922X|4.0|Reza Aslan has a very easy style of writing. Zealot uses information from the Gospels and history to reconstruct the life of Jesus. In my opinion Reza did not go far enough to challenge Christian doctrine when it deviates from the evidence in the Gospels. I do not know why some think the book is &#34;controversial&#34; when it does nothing to challenge doctrine, which is why I give it a 4 and not a 5.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Me and my husband don't have HBO so I bought the series for us to enjoy at Home. I will also buy number 3 when it comes out and I have all books also.
B0058FOB2K|5.0|If you choose to buy this disc, be sure to buy the double disc version with the bonus disc.  There are some great selections on the<br />Bonus disc, that are not on the single CD.
B004GNFSO0|5.0|This work is an honest, forthright and riveting account of a group of men and one woman who valued their freedom over their lives.  This should be on the reading list of every school in our nation as a lesson in just how valuable our freedom is and how difficult it is to regain if it once is lost.
B00AGKHALQ|5.0|Any Rammstein fan needs to have this in their collection! If you don't have this gem yet, buy it now...you will not be sorry.
B009GED3HS|5.0|whew, I am all caught up now on the series.... Now for the final season right?  It's gonna be... wait for it...
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Or 9 on a scale of ten.  You know what to expect when you begin to watch it and it's all there.<br /><br />Of course it isn't for everyone .. it's a little less polished than the Ironman movies but it's still fun.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This is the 2nd Clarke book I have read and I must say that it was better than the first (Songs of Distant Earth). Without giving too much away, it offers a very interesting look at the purpose (or lack thereof) of humanity in the universe. I enjoyed it and would certainly buy another Clarke book in the future.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Its a nice relaxing game that others will enjoy. It very easy to reach next level in the game, so relax and have fun!
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I was reluctant to buy this record because some of the reviews i read. What a mistake would that have been if i didn't decide to get it!<br />This is definitively 30 Seconds, it is less rock and more electronics and ambiance than the previous records but in a really amazing good way. The lyrics as always deeply personal and meaningful and the melody is hypnotic.<br />While 30STM tend to do what i consider \\"theme\\" records, they were able to really capture the essence of the title in the music, not a easy feat since the title is Love, Lust and Faith, but as always they pulled it off.<br />Its it better than the previous records? That is a matter of opinion. If you are looking for guitar rock, this is not, but if you want an amazing record that shows the depth of talent and musical maturity of 30 Seconds to Mars, you wont be disappointed. Easily one of the best records of the past couple of years.
0981951252|5.0|Are you kidding, I did love it and love it so much, I'm getting one for my daughter.  It is practical advice no hokus pokus.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I love all the animals they bring fantastic learning game o f being responsible for you own little village it's very nice I really love
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Get your tissues ready! Amazing story! Hazel and Gus are absolutely amazing and such an inspiration. Every man should strive to be like Gus! Every conversation between Hazel and her parents had me bawling, super touching story! The ending does have a twist and leave you crying.
B000002OVJ|1.0|had this as a record when I was a kid, loved it, back then it had \\"Young Man Blues\\" \\"Substitute\\" \\"Summertime Blues\\" \\"Shakin' All Over\\" \\"My Generation\\" \\"Magic Bus\\" , it was good... on the re-issue they added more songs.. all of which, I think, show a very tired band playing at half their potential. they are not sounding good and really, that is the problem with the who, I saw them with moon and then Kenny all the way up to 1980.. and when moon was with them it could be a great show, but a lot of times it was not a great show, some good moments but a lot of bad. this re-issue has a lot of bad added, should have been left to what it was... sorry, just what I think
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a cute story. You instantly root for our main man. Great story! It's harlequin so you know they're going to end up together but this one keeps you guessing.
B000002J1Y|5.0|had this 3 record set as a kid and it usually got played 3 times a week.. Steve Howe, Chris Squire, Alan White ( mostly ) Rick Wakeman and of course Jon Anderson at their very best... bought it again a month ago here at amazon and I love it.. luckily the CD won't get as worn out as the record did
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|I am having difficulty in learning how to do everything on it.  I can use the computer fairly well but this seems to be harder for me but I am still trying to learn it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Very good app for being free, it's fun and a good way to kill time.  Havnt had any problems with glitches and I haven't been told to update so hopefully they fixed it

0316228583|5.0|The Casual Vacancy is the first adult novel by popular British author, J.K.Rowling. This contemporary fiction is set in the seemingly idyllic English village of Pagford, where the sudden death of Parish Councillor, Barry Fairbrother creates a casual vacancy on the parish council. As subsequent events are narrated from the points of view of various different characters, the picture emerges of a village whose inhabitants are not all satisfied with their lot in life, a village of simmering tensions waiting to boil over. Rowling's characters are easily recognisable as the denizens of the typical English village, but at the same time, show individual depth and appeal (or repugnance, as the case may be). And it seems quite a few of the characters have a secret (or two). The setting, characters and events will resonate with readers, and these same happenings drive the characters to desperate actions that ultimately result in tragedy for some. Rowling manages to pack quite a lot into this novel: she has an obese megalomaniac, drug addicts, computer-savvy teens, a fawning wife, a violent husband and father, an anxious teacher, and a caring social worker, to name just a few. There is domestic violence, rape, racism, corruption, self-mutilation, bullying, gossip, teen pregnancy, child abuse and SQL injection. But if this sounds depressing, it is relieved by the underlying black humour that fills the novel.  This all comes together to make a brilliant read.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|Definitely what I expected great action movie and I learned alot about an amazing man who has heart and determination to make a difference for mankind
B00A757EFW|5.0|I have this on my HP Slate 7, and it works without a hitch. Pac-Man is such a classic game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was very amusing.  I'm looking forward to more rooms being made available. It really makes you use your brain and common sense.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It's fun and twisted trying to figure out how to send the bird than activate its special effects. I personally have a difficult time but the men in my family can seem to stop.... continually having to nag them. Lol
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Where do I start....I absolutely LOVED this story...I enjoyed finding out more about Gideon &  Eva.  I am glad that the story didn't end cause I love reading about these characters!!!... Sylvia really outdid herself.... it was intriguing, sexy as hell, hot like fire... and the LOVE that Gideon has for Eva is immeasurable!!!... Loved it!!!... and can't wait for the next one!
B0092SQBJA|5.0|It is a mature album from tourist history but that's okay their music talent is still there and for me their whole album is good. I think someone else mentioned that some of their songs run into each other like its the same song, I agree with that. It's mature in a sense that their lyrics are more meaningful and has a sense of purpose. But overall I enjoy it. I have no idea why this review is so long haha if you want to know what its all about just go youtube it and see for yourself.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|The controls are clunky. Needs work to make it easier to play on phones. Large app that takes up to much space. Getting deleted
B004XMMSZG|2.0|Pros:<br />It works with Bose Lifestyle v35 which is why I gave one star<br />Connectivity Range is good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The sound quality is not good. The bitrate sampling is bad. If there is a way to improve the bit rate quality or if there is another device I would like to know.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|This game is so much fun and the outfits are so stylish. The celebrity boyfriends are great...classic Mr. Bean and Jacob or Edward. Don't upload this version if you have the original, you will lose some items.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I adore Josh Groban's music, but this one just makes me sad. The musical instruments that have always sounded so beautiful behind his voice seem to overpower him on this CD.  I have every CD that he has produced, and this one is my least favorite.  Sorry Josh, I don't know where your mind and heart were when you produced this one, but they were not working with you. Best cuts IMHO: Bells of New York City and Galileo.
B008602KQI|4.0|Although the premise is rather unlikely, if you get passed that it is a pretty good movie. It had a few contradictions, but they give themselves a lot of artistic license here. Good entertainment, you must leave all logical reasoning behind to enjoy it though.
B003ZHVJFK|4.0|It was a good movie in a lot of ways but also could have been so much better no king come on wtf only original characters are heiachi yoshimitsu jun who doesn't fight and kazuya oh yeah nina as well everyone else was more or less sept bryan after tekken 3 this was my only let down no king it looses a star good story good acting good movie
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Romola Garai does a spot on job portraying Emma. She is sweet and engaging. The whole cast is great and this version of Emma is such a pleasure to watch.
B007I1Q4W2|4.0|Zombie movies rock at least some this one is a good one worth at least watching once the only flaw the man actor over acts a lot everything else was great good story far camera great low budget just bought it glad i did
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've tried others but keep going back to Evernote.  It has mostly everything I need.  I wished I could get their food application on my Kindle Fire.
B002VJ0576|5.0|Don't take this seriously. At All. This was not meant to be a serious, oscar winning movie. It was meant to be a parody to cash in on the popular 2009 movie of the same name. So yes, the plot line is silly and unbelievable. Parody wise, it's along the same lines as Dance of the Dead and such.<br /><br />The best part of the movie was Gareth David Lloyd as Watson.

0345536886|1.0|Well, I have to write at least 20 words, and rather than maybe have Amazon not take my review because I wrote Crap 20 times, I'll blah blah and end with Pure Crap,haha!  This was my 1st grish book, and after reading so many neg review about even his so-called good stories, I can see he's just not the type author I will spend time on.  There's no style, no nuance, just a story told by a bad story teller.
0486282112|5.0|This is one my favorite classic books of all time. It was the one book that I really enjoyed in my AP English class. It of course has very Victorian themes of did God abandon us here and just because you can do something doesn't mean you should (why hello there Jurassic Park). First, if your only exposure to this piece of work is from the movies, then forget everything about that. Mary Shelley did something quite clever in writing this book. This book is told in a way that feels natural to the reader. It starts out of all things of this man writing letters about his arctic adventure to his sister. His crew runs across Victor on the ice and picks him up. Now this captain has wanted his whole life to find a person that he bonds with, in the words of Anne Shirley, a bosom friend. When he meets Victor he can feel the sparks fly, he has finally met his bosom friend; then Victor tells his tale.<br /><br />This is the story that most people are familiar with. A man starts researching into \\"science\\" and discovers the ability to create life. The references to grave digging and piecing together body parts is of a small reference in the book, if you are not paying attention you'll miss it. Sadly, there is no Igor. Victor becomes so obsessed with creating life that he doesn't give regard to if he should and after he does well he makes some mistakes with serious consequences. Upon bringing his creation to life, he becomes so scared of the horrible monster figure that he created that he runs away. The monster goes out into the world and eventually picks up a couple of books and learns to speak and read. He blames Victor for not staying with him and teaching him the difference between right and wrong, and so any vile acts the monster commits is ultimately the responsibility of Victor.<br /><br />The monster confronts Victor and says that he will leave Victor alone if Victor will do one thing for him, create a bride for him. The monster is lonely and wants to share the world with someone like him. Victor at first agrees but when almost completed he sabotages the project, leaving the monster in a rage.<br /><br />Sorry about this review being more of a summary of the book but the key highlights of this book are engrained to the storyline and it is hard to talk about certain themes without explaining where they are coming from. Did God become scared of his creation in man and run away? Did man essentially kill God and become its own monster? Do people have to be taught morals or is it something innate within who we are? This book is still thought provoking today and in my opinion will never go out of fashion. It definitely deserves it classic status and is a remarkably good read. Give it a shot!<br /><br />This book is on the Green Embers' Recommended List.omeone like him.

B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I like all of the Richard Castle books as well as the t.v. show. Very good entertainment. Fast, witty banter between Rook and Heat is wonderful.
0785153942|4.0|Only complaint is that i wish it were longer. Enjoyed reading since i loved the movie. Only wish it gave a more detailed background of the film.
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|suspenseful and mind twisting movie good movie for matt damon. the mystery of mr ripley keeps you wanting to know more

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use my note keeper all the time. It's my pen and paper whenever I need it. It integrates between my Samsung phone, kindle, tablets, and computers.
B005NQ5LSC|5.0|Excellent. I found the first Ip Man movie in a bin. Read the back of the case and  knew I had to get it, and it was worth it.. After that I started to get other Ip Man and Donnie Yen movies.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Keeps you on your toes. Like a puzzle, only more. Nice clear pictures. No need to squint. Never gets boring.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I watched all three MIB for a mini marathon. Movies are all good, kept my attention, didn't fall asleep. Will there be a number four?
0385341008|5.0|A gem. Witty and charming, this book will make you laugh and, unless you have a heart of stone, it will make you cry. Told in letters, it is reminiscent of 84 Charing Cross Road. Anyone who enjoys a captivating story, brilliantly told, should read this book. Anyone who aspires to write fiction *must* read this book which is as close to perfect as a work of fiction can be.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|I really love Arthur Christmas. First time I saw it was on the television.  Got the bluray, can watch to my hearts content.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is the best handheld MOBA style game. If you like pc games like DOTA 2 or League of Legends you will love this.
B004I11VZ0|5.0|I love martial arts movies. I looked up the other Ip Man movies and had to get them, and I did. Excellent!
B0006AAS5G|5.0|the watch is beautiful, starting with the deluxe box is spectacular and continuing with the clock, special finishes and weight are ideal, just what I expected.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|it was just like the classic carrier Sims that rortos has made. graphics, great. physics, powerful. a little rough around the edges but its free! you really pulled it of this time rortos.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book soooo much (also the other books) I wish she would.make more in the series!<br />Oh the hunger games
0061124958|5.0|My 9 year old daughter loves the movie and wanted to read the book for her book report. Very good book!
B0035JGYZS|4.0|The story line is a perfect continuation of the Star Trek legacy! The whole family loved it.  Definite much watch.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|Had to have this to go with ALL the other Bond movies. Grandchildren enjoyed except for the sex scenes (we fast forward) b/c they are not age appropriate .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have played several games like this. I will have to say this is one of the best if not the best games I have played on my Kindle Fire HD. The graphics are great and the game mechanics are also great. I recommend this game to everyone looking for a fast edge of your seat game and it's FREE!!!!!!!!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Remember all those things you were taught in history class. Well, the information in this book, as well as many other forms of information, were probably not part of what was available in this book.  How great it is to learn about real historical happenings which were never mentioned in our syllabus.  I was so interested in reading about the Orphan Trains that I continued to do research on the various aspects of this experience.  It was great to learn that a governor of Alaska (not Sarah) and a governor<br />of one of the Dakotas were children transported to a new life on these train cars.  They were the fortunate ones who did not end up being indentured servants or worse.  Do pick up this book and experience the existence of two wonderful characters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice game - mind stimulating challenges. Keeps your problem solving skills working. Definitely worth down loading for a fun way to chill.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept me interested.  However would of liked it more if the language was a little less vulgar. Would not recommend it to my granddaughters.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game was loads of fun need to give us a second and third i am a fan of bigfish mystery games and this one is tops
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great time waster! It is also free, can be a bit challenging without connecting<br />It to Facebook
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Once again, you are sure that much of the movie came straight from the written page of the book.  The continuing story allows the characters to age appropriately and watching them mature has been like watching your own children/grandchildren,
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|So I bought a cheaper non-apple brand cable about a year ago and guess what? It broke. This time I went with the real thing and couldn't be happier. The quality of this cable is ten times that of the cheaper one I previously purchased. In the end you do get what you pay for most of the time.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|J.J. does it again...against all odds.  From writing, directing, cinematography, editing, casting--and the best of the best acting by all (!)(and please bring back Khan)--special effects and music score; start to finish this movie delivers and exceeds expectations.  Considering the loyal following of Trekkies, I can't think of anything J.J. and all who contributed to the movie could have done better to honor and deliver the franchise to the future generations.  Wonderfully thought out with non-stop action mixed with human compassion, with nice spots from the former original cast, I saw this one and wanted to see it over again when the credits rolled.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me: minion rush is amazing. It has something in it that everyone will love no matter what age you are. Temple run and temple run 2 are great but they just don't have as much excitement as this game!!! Trust me when I say that if u get it u will love it.
B009EEQO08|5.0|Great classic action flick. The first is most definitely the best of the series so this is the one. Hell ya
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Enjoyable, hilarious, and entertaining movie! I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves comedy, horror, and science fiction films! And it's a Tim Burton film so you gotta love it!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's rocks but has 1 minor problem. You have TNT but yet in creative there is no flint and steel so you can set of the TNT. PEASE FIX
B009HUB40Y|3.0|Everyone shouldget this app. This is a very fun game. I Play it all day and it is a challenge for me.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie had been out for awhile but if you have not seen it I believe you will enjoy it.  We have watched it and had many of our friends to watch it as well.  What an attitude!  Great Movie.<br />Vol. n AL.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I've made 1st place 5 times! If I were you I would definitely buy this game in madder fact it free!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well subway surf is ok sometimes when I go to turn it will roll and when I roll it will jump so I like sub way surf

B001UV4XHY|5.0|The movie is a well worth watching the cast and movie are great I enjoy watching a very good action movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun for the whole family, from the youngest to the oldest!! Highly entertaining even when you fail! Every Minion fan will enjoy it!
B005UG542S|5.0|The movie is a well worth watching the cast and movie are great I enjoy watching a very good action movie.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book had me a blubbering mess! Forman is a masterful storyteller, pushing and pulling on the reader's emotions like a yo-yo. While the book was hard to put down, I had to force myself to stop reading at times for fear of drowning in my tears. I can't wait to read the sequel to this book as well as other works by Forman.
030758836X|4.0|Very good writing; I couldn't put this book down.  Others have criticized the ending, but I thought it ended similar to a \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode.  Due to Nick's mistakes and infidelity of the past, he ends up being totally controlled by Amy, a monster, with no way out.  He is in \\"prison\\" with a life sentence.  EVERYTHING Nick does, or doesn't do, will be scrutinized by Amy; if any \\"mistake\\" is made by Nick, and Amy will retaliate.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I enjoy it more than the last one. Good graphics. I would recommend to others to get, def since it is free and fun.
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|Doctor X med school is a horrible game! You do the same people with the same problems every time! The sound effects are annoying and the actions get repetitive after the first 5 minutes. This app is a waste of time and space!
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I really like this app! Im able to sync lists on my Android phone, PC, and Amazon Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Its helping me on a daily basis at work and at home!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|What marketing geek makes people write about something they have no passion for?  It's an &#34;okay&#34; movie.  There really isn't any more to say.  This is all you get for free.  Reward me (us) and you'll get a detailed review.
B00ACP3OOM|3.0|The first one was defective and Amazon exchanged - no problem.  I still haven't been able to use this one yet as I have been having difficulty downloading music.  I may be there now, but I believe my swiMP3 was easier to use.  I buy a lot of Finis products, and I have to say their (FINIS) customer service is some of the WORST.  Yo leave messages, you leave emails, they get around to you when they get around to you.  This experience with Finish has changed my view of the Finis company.
B00BF11STU|3.0|What marketing geek makes people write about something they have no passion for?  It's an &#34;okay&#34; movie.  There really isn't any more to say.  This is all you get for free.  Reward me (us) and you'll get a detailed review.
B001GQ2BNQ|4.0|I had the straight up one for a while and then tried this for freestyle - love it.  Can't swim without it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|What a great story of valor chivalry and honor. A story I will not soon forget. Will recommend this book to others for sure.
B0076NAVNA|4.0|Extremely varied album.  Some prog-rock, tending to prog-metal in places, mixed with other tracks that are lighter rock.<br />Drumming is prominent in the mix, as is usual for Mike Portnoy.  Neal Morse seems underutilized.  Everyone is technically brilliant, as you'd expect.  The song-writing is good, although some songs have several parts which don't seem to fit together as fluidly as they might.  The sound is hugely better than the live tracks on You-Tube.  I absolutely love 5 of the tracks and like most of the rest.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I started this season looking to find closure from the end of Season 9. Before I knew it I bought the whole season and was watching it all day and all night. I love that in this season the characters really develop well and start to expand on more family stories. I can't wait for season 11 to air this September.
B00014TJ7K|4.0|Strong music from George Harrison is on this album.  It is a pleasure to listen to him perform his rock and roll.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Thanks for a great new single. This monster has been waiting and is pleased with this butt shaker. LGG is like an air bubble in your blood stream. Gonna take hit you at the heart. Kunst she is!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I really like this sci-fi action flix. It's a great thrill ride of action and story. Tom and Morgan really set the stage and make Oblivion an enjoyable world to see.
B00CCX9DUG|3.0|Great story but it was so long winded and repetitious at times that it dragged a bit.<br />The ending was odd too. It just ended without actually having any real conclusion or finishing the story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|And so many games to choose from!  NEVER BORING!  I LOVE THIS APP!  You will not be disappointed, so get it now!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I liked it enough to start the series and have moved on to the next book.  Written in a different style and I like that.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Its ok. I think it will probably please action fan crowd. I found it to be competently told, but its just your standard action movie without much depth or meat to it. No real surprises and I thought the bad guys motivations to be weak. I think The Dark Knight was superior and the first Spider Man movie with Tobey Maguire was better and even the Captain America movie had enough surprises while maintaining the spirit of the comic to make it a notch above The Avengers.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Whether your a dedicated Chili Peppers fan or not, the lyrics, the instrumentation, everything about this collection of songs will grow on...well, just about any listener.  It's definitely one of their best efforts and should be a part of your CD collection.  I know I'm glad I have it.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This is the best gangster movie ever made. plus it has some of the best actors, Joe Pesci is awsome
0782008364|5.0|The movie is well-casted.  Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly showcase the right chemistry to make this plot absolutely believable. I loaned the DVD to a friend who also came to the same conclusions. That said, this movie deserves a top rating.  You won't be disappointed.  Sit back and enjoy it!
B00C2IJJDM|5.0|So apropos, given today's political climate. A must see for ALL Anericans and the rest of the free-world. Now Unintended Consequences needs to be made into a movie.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I know most styluses are like this, but I wish it had a &#34;pointed&#34; end like a Nintendo DS. I have a neat drawing app, and a pointed end would be easier to draw with. Otherwise, it's precise as it can be and works fine.
B0090SI4LU|1.0|I was so disappointed when I watched this movie after reading the novel.  I didn't even want to like the novel, but somehow Meyer was able to hook me with the relationships between the characters. The relationships that aren't developed well at all in the movie. I'm also very unhappy with the characters themselves. The strength of the main character is missing in the movie. Overall, if you've read the book, don't waste your time. If you aren't a reader, you might enjoy the movie by itself. Just don't claim to have read the book; too many significant events are missing from the movie to even make it comparable to the novel.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I got this app and i want to know how to download vidios i purchased for two dolars and i dont know how someone tell me in the coments please pleaase  over alk it is a good thing for a free app
B00004U8P9|5.0|i mean what can i say, it was delievered on time and  worked perfectly. nothing i can really say about the movie you shouldnt already know. lol
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Even though this was first released 9 years ago, I never had the chance to watch it....until now.  On season two and watching at least one episode a night til I am done.  Just when you think you have this figured out, they put a twist in the series
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Too hard to keep playing without buying aids.  This is not free bingo as far as I'm concerned.  It frustrates me.  I like the Bingo on Pogo much better.  You can play for as long as you want.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|I must admit I'd seen this movie years ago, but I didn't have it in my collection. When I saw it online, I had to have it. This is a classic. It's funny, it's scary, you must have it. Order it today!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a fan of science fiction I must confess.  But this is just a great book for everyone.  It is the type of science fiction that is very popular right now with readers and writers in that it is a disaster end of the world type story. As an aside I think a big reason for this is type of sc-fi being popular now is becuase of september 11/terrorism.  This is a great story set in a realistic if dystopian future but more then that Howey's prose i just find to be beautiful.  Thanks Mr. Howey for hooking us with that good good.
B00A83075M|3.0|This movie, is more for youngsters, even my niece thought it was rather childish. She is 11 years old. She said she would not have purchased it, and she is 11 years old.
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|This double cd set is very good. Some great guitar licks to digest here. Not crazy about song with Kid Rock but love the one with Keith Urban and members of Aerosmith.<br /><br />Like only  few albums I own, this one gets better the more I listen to it. Not only has Buddy Guy continued to grow as a musician, but he has revitalized the Blues. Good job!
B005LAII62|5.0|This is a good story, and it holes up well to the end.. My only complaint is because so  much of the movie takes place at night, the screen is very dark, and for this 73 year old, it, was difficult for me to see all the action. All in all, a very good movie.
B000002UVX|5.0|Wow, this album blew me away! If u love great rock with a funky twist, u will love this. Get it!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Yup it's pretty fun .. I like the cool pictures used for the cards ... easy to learn ... I are chicken yup
B0039TD7PY|5.0|While I HATE James Taylors' politics, I have to admit I like his music. It reminds me of that book a few years ago, Shut Up and Sing. Well, he is a big Lefty who feels comfortable campaigning for Barack Hussein Obama and other Libs but I prefer it when he sticks to music.<br /><br />Carol King is just wonderful. PBS has showed the concert DVD many times. You wont get tired of watching/hearing them together.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Solitaire is a blast and this game makes it more fun by choosing 1-4 suits to play with. I play this while waiting and the time passes so fast you don't want to stop until you win!
B000002P5R|5.0|Man, this is a great album lovingly finished by Experience Hendrix team. Get this and hear what Jimi was working on when he died. It is a marvelous album of varied tunes that will carry you away to a good place.<br /><br />We miss you, Jimi!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these types of games so keep them coming! You really have to look everywhere - twice or more so enjoy!
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Hard to keep puting out good albums for long but she has. This has lots of fun, meaningful music. Just get this cd and leave it in your car.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I love these puzzles even though they can be hard to get at times but hey that's the fun of them to me!
B0000C9ZSV|5.0|Another fine concert from Jimi that was recorded perfectly. Some older and newer tunes. Wish I was there. I bet you do too.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|If you are looking for a complete collection without added extras or a commemorative box, then this is highly recommended. We simply wanted the movies and were very pleased with the price and the packaging is just fine.
B000002P5W|4.0|Not his best album but some good material here. I recommend this to all classic rock fans. We love u Jimi!
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Great story.  Every time you think you have it, you don't.  Grabs you emotionally.  I could not put it down.
B00328G4V6|4.0|Another JH product from Experience Hendrix. Not every song interests me but as a collection of songs, it is a wonderful addition to my growing JH library. This album really one for those of us who must have everything he did.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|DA is in my top 10 BBC favorites.  I missed first episode, Season 3, so just decided to wait til DVD came out.  Watched every episode in a 2 day marathon. Now the challenge is waiting for Season 4. I brinking on a spoiler, so all I can say about last episode is it's a cliffhanger.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Wow, has she got pipes! Every song is a classic in it's own right. I was shopping at CVS the other day and heard her version of the great Cure song, Lovesong.<br /><br />Can't wait for what she comes up with next...hopefully not a cd for children!!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I've listened to this album so many times that my cd is starting to skip, so yeah you could say I've enjoyed it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's enjoyable to go on the site and find any &amp; everything. I got my sister hooked. I spend hours just looking at very useful information. You can pin several different things to your boards. It's just an awesome app. Keep pinning!!!
B0095J0AL6|5.0|One Direction's sophomore album is equally as great as their first!!  If you don't have this, get it; you'll be happy with your decision.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Have almost finished the game.  I have really enjoyed it.  Give it a try.  It is very interesting with a few different changes that i havent seen in other games.
B006ZZANDI|5.0|This album does not disappoint!  There's not a single song I don't love, plus you get pictures of the boys and some sweet stickers.
B003Y74KAW|5.0|The case fit the phone snugly. It offers excellent support. I have dropped the phone a few times, no damage done even if the phone landed on its corner. The case is not slippery yet it slides into my pocket without any problem.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I loved everything about this movie!  They portray all the characters so well, it's like Emily Blunt really is Queen Victoria.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You have to get this game. It's so awesome. If I could of given it a 100 stars I would of.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I absolutely love the sigma force novels. They get better and better. Can't wait for the next one! Seriously hurry!
B00BHMF578|4.0|Very good movie.  It deserved the Academy Award.  I would watch it again.  The acting was excellent and the action was very good.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game reminds me of COD but I like it I can play with my friends now and I don't have to pay 50 dollars only 99&cent; which is the best 99&cent; I have eve spent!!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Love the movie, so I of course bought the soundtrack. Includes all songs including &#34;Cups&#34; and &#34;The Riff Off.&#34; It's a great buy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best with every update it gets closer and closer to the Pc version / One problem the update system if it doesn't work then just uninstall and reinstall but you have to do it in a set peirod of time or all worlds will be deleted and you will have to start over. also download the pockeinveditor it helps and you can switch between survival and creative.<br />  If this helps then send a thanks to kyresmith98@gmail.com<br />  signed: kyre smith
0762451319|3.0|This package was a little of a let down. Love the temp tattoos but the necklace is so small I can't even double it over as a bracelet. Unless you have a VERY small neck be prepared to get a longer chain.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Great game the controls are not sensitive enough. But really fun if you like mystery at grisly  manor you will love this.
1608871452|5.0|This was an amazing buy. This coffee book covers up through season 7 and has several detachables (post cards, stickers, etc) I HIGHLY recommend!
B000026OW3|5.0|Brilliant recording of just wonderful music.  Great value for the price.  Would have no hesitation in recommending this to everyone.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Best ever seen as a result of duty black ops zombies extra content of duty black ops zombies extra content of duty black ops zombies extra content of duty black ops zombies extra content of duty black ops zombies extra content of dirt
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I think it was to big but I like it  it's pretty good after all it looks like it took forever so I think it's 3 out of 5
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is User friendly. It is fun to play. It can be addictive. It is the best free spider solitaire I have played.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|This is a wonderful and timeless love story that I have read too many times to count.  I have never understood why the author's sister's book, Wuthering Heights, was the required book in school.  I think they prohibit anything with a happy ending.  In contrast, after many twists and turns this story ends most happily for Jane and her beloved Edward.  This book,  that I first read as a pre-teen, remains one of my all time favorites.  A note on this ebook- in places a phrase is repeated where it obviously should be but once.  This does not unduly mar it though.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|It's like a self help book that works out and is in shape. I have been thinking these concepts for awhile but talked myself out if them because they aren't normal/culturally excepted ideas. Enjoy the read
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|I prefer contemporary jazz and new age to traditional jazz, but I love to hear this album, year after year.  The opening bars of \\"Blue Rondo &Agrave; La Turk\\" just are electrifying each time I hear it.  Each song is a classic and they have such a clean uncluttered sound.
141694737X|5.0|I got this book for my 1year old niece and she absolutely loves it.  She loves opening the flaps and making the animal noises.  Few words, so she's able to learn them easily!
B007N8RULO|1.0|I like to play Spider and I can say I have nothing against the game itself. But the way it's centered on my horizontal view, the last two cards - ace and duece - in the pile can't. be placed because there is no more room. There seems to be no vertical view but I wouldn't use it anyway. There are better Spider games out there. Will delete this app.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|This was probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. That is all there is to say
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed the game.  It exercises the brain.  However, The requirement for 8 more words is not smart.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Flowers for Algernon is an amazing book. Creative, and the character development is awesome. It's like the Inception of bildungsromans. Or maybe the Benjamin Button of them. Not really though. A truly happy, a truly sad, and a truly worthwhile book to read.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I know this movie is dated, but I still love the long dance scene in which Baryshnikov and Hines interpret the music in their own styles.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Es muey bien pachuco! Donda estoy bien , every bodie say i t gooder dan before day udder won . I tank dats rite fall.. sew. Ewe cane bye it two, ante thyme you ti k u cane foe s um monyies.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I first learned of Neil Gaiman after seeing Coraline.  My son is into all things Tim Burton and \\"Burtonesque\\", and loved the creepy clamation version of Gaiman's book.  I read Coraline to see if it was appropriate to read to my son, and felt the movie was much more entertaining than the book.<br /><br />I had no intention of reading another Neil Gaiman book, but I stared at the cover of The Ocean at the End of the Lane for what felt like months.  I couldn't explain why I was so intrigued by the cover illustration, but I was.  Finally, I read the description and all the accolades and decided that I could afford to indulge my curiosity for a measly $7.<br /><br />I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane is far superior to Coraline.  While Coraline felt a bit disjointed, this endeavor certainly did not.  It's hard to describe what's so great about the book, but it's the type of story that grabs you from the beginning, and suddenly you realize you've been sitting around all day, doing nothing but find out what happens next.<br /><br />I am not a big reader, but I read this book from start to finish in one sitting, in a matter of a few hours.  Absolutely fantastic!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cant wait for more rooms to escape from. Love the little puzzles I gets you involved in. Keep the games coming!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Quite the ending....was definitely expecting a picture perfect ending, not something so odd and vague... book was awesome. Greatly written.
B00969PR18|4.0|Not too bad of a map. I like it. so far in my uses it has been helpful. I'd recommend it to others
0618001905|5.0|Great value, great service getting a used text book. This one is like new. At less than half the cost at he book store.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My 11 year old grandson, Luke, wanted this games so badly. He did not ask me for it, but I said we would check on line and see about it.  I had never ordered on line before so Luke told me exactly what to do!  He was so happy to receive it. I was watching him the day the game came in the mail. He said it was more fun for at least three to play so..... Luke, my 8 yr. grandson Ty and I learned how to play &#34;The Settlers of Catan&#34;.  Guess who didn't win?  Thank you so much..  you made it so easy to make an eleven year old boy's wish come true.
B00005RDSM|4.0|We received it in the mail and it was like it said. How ever I never noticed that there is smoking and adult themes in the movie. Like peter pan kissing all of the girls. How ever it is a disney classic and a must have.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is  a fun game and it is like temple run nd subway surfers so it's like y'all did them toghether
B000VBJEEG|5.0|The movie was bought used, but was brand new looking. We loved the rattatouille movie, wonderful disney movie. We still watch it repetitively.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|Plays well and smooth.  Excellent physics.  Online is a bit hard to figure out, but once done, works flawlessly.  Guides work very well!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I got this because I thought it would be fun. well it's just ok. I like plain bingo, and this has a lot of other features that go along with it.
B004SB60OC|5.0|The lyrics and rhythm of Christina Perri's music will likely touch your heart.  She puts such feeling into the music, it almost becomes personal to you.  I haven't come across anyone like her in years.  It will be a tough album to top.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It has excellent character development and a very tense story.  I can't wait to start the next one!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|The most addictive tower defence game ever. I can't stop playing it.  I wish they would add more levels and towers.
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini - weaves another fabulous novel! This is a must read once again - hard to beat the Kite Runner - but it is close!
B008JFUO4U|3.0|This is not really a review - many previous posters have done fine work in that area. What I wanted to comment on, since so many have commented on its lack of originality, is what I felt the protogenic sources to be.<br /><br />Here goes - in no particular order:<br /><br />Independence Day - ending's almost a rip-off - nuclear weapon smuggled into the alien mother ship for big bang ending. Not as much jaunty camaraderie as its precursor, but replete w/ verbal jousting vs.the captor(s).<br /><br />The Time Machine - remake w/ Guy Pierce in which the moon is destroyed, causing all sorts of natural calamities.<br /><br />Star Wars - the living quarters \\"Towers 49 & 52\\", are somewhat reminiscent of Bespin, the city in the clouds. The \\"scavs\\" are reminiscent of Ewoks w/ their distorted voices, and the Jawa, w/ their illuminated eyes; also evocative of the Tusken Warriors (Sand People) from Tatooine.<br /><br />Alien/Aliens - Ripley was in cryosleep for 57 years; the Odyssey crew was in cold storage for 60 years.<br /><br />I'm sure other viewers will see other antecedent films; maybe some Star Trek, Terminator, and of course, other Tom Cruise films, wherein he plays a similar character.<br /><br />One brief comment about a somewhat confusing scene - having already met her, why does Morgan Freeman bother to introduce himself to Julia after his second-in-command, Sykes, in a previous scene, has already held a gun to her head, in Freeman's presence, and seemingly w/ his approval? Did this simply not make it to the film editors' attention?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|You can beat this game in a couple hours, but it's a great ride and a compelling story. Definite 5/5.
140006922X|5.0|I recently came across this book and was interested, and my wife surprised me by buying it for me.  It actually was even a better book than i expected.  The best way i can describe this book is thought provoking.  Mr. Aslan has researched this topic extensively and it shows.  That does not mean i agreed with every conclusion he draws, many i agreed with him, and a few i differed.  This is a history book, not a religious book, and he is only looking at the historical evidence, not matters of faith so if you want a book that teaches the traditional Christian view of Jesus this is not it.  But if you are looking for an unbiased look at who Jesus the man may well have been historically I highly recommend this book.  One final note, a few reviewers have inferred the author is biased because of his Islamic faith.  I assure you this book would be as rejected by fundamentalist muslims as it would fundamentalist christians.  This is not Jesus as taught in any faith, be it Christian or Islam, this is constructing the historical Jesus based on sources of the time.  Again, great book and well worth buying.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|I chose this rating because I am a huge fan of the Lethal Weapon series, and it is now in Blue Ray. Along with that, the price can't be beat.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|all I can say is awesome!!!!! the game is definitely great for Kids and adults.and again all I can say is awesome!!
B00BCV3HGU|5.0|Every song on this CD is great! Will.i.am is an incredible artist and it seems like everything he touches turns to gold. This CD is one of them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|A great game it's definitely worth the 7.00 dollars. The only down side is you have to wait a few days after the iPod to get updates
B00CFA222M|4.0|Nice job by Ewan McGregor in one of his less 'heavy' roles.  Nice entertaining family style flick.  If you liked Ever After: A Cinderella Story with Drew Barrymore, you'll like this.
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|Works great for what I needed it for. Just bought a kindle and needed an app that i would be able to use for note taking. Probably not the greatest, but it gets the job done.
B008JFUO36|5.0|I'm not a Tom Cruise fan but I am a sci-fi addict so needed something new.  This one is great - nice twist at the end, Morgan Freeman is great (as always) and even Tom managed to be believable and not too cocky like most of his movies. Recommend this one.
B0036G8IQS|4.0|I wanted to read this after seeing the second film and now I want to read the entire series. It was fast paced, action packed and very educational. Kind of reminded me of Sherman Alexis and Harry potter mixed together. I felt like I had to have an encyclopedia with me at all times!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|One of the greatest movies from the 90's. I would highly recommend this film to any one who was a fan of the God Father or The Untouchables.
B007NESBK2|5.0|best thing to ever purchase. loved the live concert and loved the dvd even more because it gave me the chance to relive awesome memories
1904920209|5.0|I first got this book from our library, one of the first to check it out. When I realized I was embarrassingly overdue with it, because I just couldn't stop making bread, I bought my own on Amazon! This has changed bread making forever for me and comes with a DVD for even better understanding. Nothing like a man with a French accent giving lessons in French bread making! Ooolala!
0399255370|3.0|My toddler thinks its funny, but there is a level of sarcasm in the book i would hope is above her head.
0670026638|5.0|This book defies description.  So many topics are explored (including Quantum physics!) all nested in a surprisingly suspenseful tale.  It is drenched in Zen and teenage multifaceted Japanese angst.  I truly hoped that the book would just simply continue with new pages magically appearing each time I opened the book.  My favorite book of 2013.  Highly recommended for reading groups.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This is a really fun game, but after a few weeks, I couldn't get into it anymore.  I tried removing and adding again with no luck.  I will miss this game.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This book is a combination of twilight and Harry potter written for an older audience.  Great easy read!  Loved it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is an awesome app its fun and i lov how u can really change The game  To personalize it from cards to settings to rules to difficulty
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I enjoyed the Secret Garden.  I thought the Distant Hours was even better.  Interesting characters and a building towards the end.
159448385X|5.0|This is a wonderful historical fiction about Afghanistan and is so current with all that has occurred since 911 and the ensuing subjugation of women
B007OIKE34|5.0|Wonderful story of hardships in adolescents especially w cancer. Great characters! Would love to see this as a movie, maybe for hallmark channel!
B000002MUN|5.0|It is Tom Petty, what more can I say?  I actually purchased this because the one I had had since college was damaged.  It is good enough to replace all of these years later!
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Was hesitant to read a Vonnegut after attempting Slaughterhouse Five decades ago, but loved this one!<br />It is a very quirky story written in a unique voice.  If you have ever wanted to try a Vonnegut as he is considered<br />a preeminent American voice particularly of a certain time frame in American history this is the book for you!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its toataly worth the money they keep making updates so it gets more and more like the pc version its amazing!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never even considered watching this until I picked up on a conversation among coworkers. So, I figured I'd give one episode a look.  I was hooked.  Over three weekends I binged on Walking Dead, going through all 3 seasons. My wife thinks I'm nuts, and I might agree. Some characters are compelling and I root for them; others, I just hope they'll get bitten so they can get the deadly head shot. It's more than the gore; that gets old after a bit. Character evolution for some characters is kind of cool to watch.  Guess I'll have to exercise patience and watch each season 4 episode as it's dribbled out to us.
B004QX07G4|3.0|This book was a little difficult to remain focused on while reading. All you have to do is watch Ellen on t.v. and it will be obvious that she is all over the board when it comes to topical conversations. I love her and think she's amazing but to read the way she presents live made it hard to stay focused, in my view. Funny book and great stories. Definitely not a book I couldn't put down but enjoyed it in small doses.
1451695195|4.0|This book is much more than a record of an event which changed the author's life. The fascination is the objective research into the subject of near death experiences. It is how the author used his personal experience as the springboard to find the meaning of the event. This made something that is very mysterious and outside of most people's understanding something we can enter into. He made it accessible to the understanding of an ordinary person.
B00992CF6W|5.0|u can make a fire that never stops burning<br />it fun u will have fun get this game might be crapy about money but its worth it don't take it from me all friends have it
B000BW7QX6|5.0|Came in and played just fine and I have always liked this movie and could watch it over and over.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This was an unexpected treat. I hadn't heard much about this movie and was skimming through Amazon on night and title jumped out at me. I decided to see what it was about and to my surprise it was a great story of love, family, healing, understanding, and tradition and non-traditional mind sets, beliefs and values. This is definitely one of my new favorites.
B00ECBA9JK|5.0|Came in and played just fine and is a fantastic movie with a great storyline. Sci Fi fans would Love it!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series - a typical well-done British series - is interesting from start to finish (and I have viewed all four seasons). I find that I am completely engrossed and enmeshed in the lives of these people and that their joys and sorrows become mine. I would recommend that one begin with season one and continue through season 3 for one good human story.
B009DT424Y|3.0|I got this microphone for podcasting, but it's tinny sounding. I tried lots of different things including downloading some software recommended by the manufacturer. It's still only okay.
140006922X|5.0|Very well done by someone who has done his research on the subject. It was good to read specifics about the topic and to see how the story created in the bible so differs from the man who is it's focus.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I got this one to type up the zillion ideas I get for creating crochet, crafting and knit patterns. I really like it, it works like my msword and I can save documents, open and rework them and send them to my computer later to complete my Blog posts. It's very similar to working with msword. Just what I needed... Birdie Gee
B003G4W49C|5.0|If there is one novel I could force every child in America to read, it would be enders game. That is how deep and profound this novel is.<br />Orson Scott card will never write anything better than this, no matter how hard he tries.
0142410314|3.0|I think most children and adults would love this book. Like many children's books, it could be read aloud to infants and young children, read independently by older children and adults, or shared. However, it does demonstrate many extreme bad behaviors so that is something to consider.  Summary: The main character is Charlie, an ordinary boy, who has a home and a family, and rather poor, so he is hungry all the time, and cold in winter.  Then, one day Willy Wonka announced about Golden Tickets. And, one day he bought a chocolate bar (if I recall correctly he found money on the street) and there was a Golden Ticket in it!  Charlie was joined by four other children - they are all extremely bad-behaved and spoiled. Though Charlie is an ordinary boy, the contrast between the four other children make him seem especially well-behaved and poor.  In the end the four other children receive their punishments, but, still, especially as it is fantasy fiction please do consider the effects of their bad behaviors on young readers.  Overall it is a great humorous read, and I have greatly enjoyed it.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|The only drawback for an American audience is the pacing.  As it is a British show, the plot moves slowly and cinematically.  Lots of focus on minute details that we don't see in serial cop dramas.  Beautifully done.
B0090SI56Y|1.0|Corny anime Japan junkfood cliche version of the American badass, (spoilers) - although its hard ta spoil what's allready rotten,... all ya gotta know is there is a giant adamantium transformer like samurai with a heated sword that he fights at the end, ugh seriously, bad asian ninja choreography, no character development, especially with the venom lizard biddy, worst antagonist ever, one dimensional and completely bland, watch out she'll lick her fingernail and poke you with it, no real explanation of wolverines motive for protecting this chick throughout the whole movie, I guess he was bored, and the supposed intrigue is he's in a different culture and he's losing his mutant ability, ...  Kinda like watching Hugh jackman visit Japan.....
B001NN413K|5.0|I like Mary Poppins great movie I recommend it  I t is a great kids movie  watch it great movie
B00006CXSS|5.0|Likes it partner The Pacific the mini-series presents a realistic picture of what it was like to fight in the European Theater during WWII.  In contrast to the pacific theater there is no jungling fighting and the Germans did not come in droves  in front of machine gun nests to kill their enemy.  Both sides fought for each inch of land not with out casualties.  I played close attention to shifty powers a good old country boy from Southern VA who was a crack shot and saved many lives.  All were brave and from different backgrounds and this is what I think made the 506 th the division it was, different skill were brought in by the city boys and different skills were brought in by the country boys.<br /><br />Excellent miniseries.
1936608898|5.0|My doctor prescribed this book/whole30 plan to me to help with several autoimmune diseases I have.  I bought a book for myself and another for my sister who is a breast cancer survivor.  We both just wanted to feel better. Although we both had weight to lose that was not the purpose for this \\"not diet\\".  Reading the book gave the education and purpose behind the food choices and why to choose or not to choose what to put on our plates. Both of us are so grateful for this experience the whole 30 food plan. I have lost 14 pounds my sister lost 12 pounds but even better we both have energy and feel great!! No calorie counting no portion control just follow the plan for 30 days! No regrets at all. I am going to continue on for another 30.<br />I recommend it to anyone who wants to feel better.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Although not quite as popular as its predecessor, it is still based on a book detailing one man's experience in combat in the Pacific.<br />The physical conditions of rain , having supplies cut off and eating rice that the Japanese left over that had lice in it is the least of the hardships of the marines battling the Japanese.  The Japanese did not value life as the Americans did and that will show up in this mini-series.  These were brave men just as the men were at Bastogne during X-mas 1944.<br /><br />As I am into WWII history I learned by reading the book then watching the miniseries and I was not disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great free app. Very fun and challenging.  Even my young grandson enjoys looking for clues.Bring on more levels!
0345803507|3.0|This book is overrated. I read this book only to see what this is all about. I had problem to finish. Boring .
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Be ready to dedicate time to this book! Once you start reading you will not be able to put it down.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I got this game for my ten year old and ended up playing with him. We both enjoyed it very much.
B009AMAGXK|2.0|If you are a fan of the book series... do not watch this movie.  There were so many changes from the storyline it is not even the same story!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Considering that this movie was made in the 1970-80s, the quality of the Blu-R is great! I just bought the Blu-R for Lord Of the Rings & for me, the BR quality wasn't any better than DVD version, so for $70, was kind of disappointed. But for this item, my $46 was worth it. Now debating if I should get SW 1-3 saga, I enjoyed saga 4-6 more, luv Harrison Ford, R2D2, Chewbacca, Luke, Leia, just the whole damn cast, I thought this version had more humor betwn them. Overall, I'm a Star Wars fan for life, only if the Lucas guy can make up his mind on whether or not to cont the saga. There was rumor for a movie maybe out in 2yrs, but now, its on hold again - 10yrs of uncertainty!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|great app. i<br />I read my kindle every night before I go to sleep. So it makes sense to have it as my alarm clock also.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I am a Philippa Greagory fan but I am always amazed that she coninues to write such great historical novels with characters that have depth.  All of this is done while she is working for historical accuracy, as much as can be done.  She does a wonderful job of presenting history as seen and experienced through the eyes of women.  Waiting for her next book!
B0064MGU98|4.0|Great show and cannot believe it's taken me all these years to realize that. Have been binge watching to get caught up with the upcoming season.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie especially for the kids that have grown up with video games. This movie has a great story with a ending.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have liked the field watches for years. Basic, light weight, and tight fit. This watch is very durable as well I have been wearing it to work for two weeks and it has taken a beating without loosing one minute of accuracy. I own and operate a landscape and home improvement company and this watch has Held up great so far. I like not worrying about battery life either. Having several watches its nice to know I can just pick it up and it will work. The only complaint I have is that the strap isn't NATO style. If it were you could easily change colors or have one for dirty work and one for after work.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|I thought this book was funny and loved how quirky Emma was. The plot is light and fun and it had me laughing out loud. I compared Emma a lot to Becky Bloomwood. I've read all of Sophie Kinsella's book and this one was a good one! If people have read her books before than they know its a good happy quick read. For people that haven't been reading her books, they should start. I love the way Sophie writes and I love her likable characters!
0545265355|4.0|A lot of thought, time, and research went into this. It's ovious. I love the packaging almost as much as i loved the story! :P
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved how this book was written. I also love that it is different from the movie, so people that have only watched the movie can still read the book without the entire thing being given away. I loved the dynamic of Pat and I love how the narration is written. Qucik paced, well written and entertaining. I was even laughing at parts. Very good read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it!! Love the horses!! Love the mini games too! Please get this game! Tell me if you liked it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the story especially the twist! I just don't like that the characters are so unlikable. Neither of them can redeem themselves and at the end of the book I can say I wasn't rooting for either of them. Hated how the book ended. I wanted to throw my kindle at a wall but overall I really loved the story. Can't wait for the movie!!!
B006S01GH2|5.0|It was a great surprise to my French-speaking son and myself that this movie was as good as it was!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love that Katniss and Peeta have to go back to the arena. Drags a little in the middle but the ending had me flipping pages! Can't wait for the movie!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|\\"Adult stories never made sense, and they were so slow to start. Thy made me feel like there were secrets, Masonic, mythic secrets, to adulthood. Why didn't adults want to read about Narnia, about secret islands and smugglers and dangerous fairies?\\"<br /><br />As I've been in adulthood for the last nine years I've wondered about this same idea. Are adults destined for a life of boringness with a subtle serious overtone? No wonder their hair turns grey so fast. Why put stress upon oneself if you don't need to. I will forever grasp onto whatever child imagination I once had and hold onto it tight as an adult even if it means reading books that take me to fantasy worlds instead of reading \\"why so serious\\" books that make me feel like I'm in the middle of a boring English class! Thank God for Neil Gaiman!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Been playing for over 8 months now and I log in every day to get my credits! It's great to try completing rooms for more daily credits, playing in the free daily tournament and making new friends to help each other out. No need to make purchases if you have patience.
030758836X|5.0|This is the best kind of suspense novel because it's character driven and the stakes become bigger as the story continues.  Even if you figure out the plot twists, the story is written well enough that it's worth the read.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I am a huge Joe fan. I have all of his music. It is sad that he doesn't get much airplay or much recognition commercially. Because he is a great singer.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Great for all ages. Great story for the kids and enough subtle humor to keep adults laughing.  The minions are, hands down, the best part of the series!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i read the hunger games twice and it really is a great book. there is nothing i didn't like about it.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Own this and wanted to share it with my bother in law.  Glad it was on instant steaming.  The second one is even better!
B008AIGWVA|4.0|This application is really a cute one and fun to mess around with. and the kidos just love it a lot. I would recommend this to everyone.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Playing this game brings back some wonderful childhood memories. Although I realize now I was playing the game all wrong before.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a great show.  This show is like a good book that you can't put down.  You want to read it all nite.  You want to watch episode after episode of this!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I also am unable to save or upload to Facebook as stated by a few other users. Pick another app.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|In my top ten list. Really gets you thinking and at the edge of your seat. Must read if you are a nerd!!!!
B008YRVW0I|3.0|This is the first Plarix game that I have been disappointed with. The game play is great (as with all of their other games that I have played and eventually bought), but I have to give it 3 stars due to the size of the graphics. They are way too small. I play on a Kindle Fire and there seems to be a lot of wasted space on either side of the actual game board. I would upgrade my rating and probably purchase this game if they enlarged it.
B00E5BQ9SW|1.0|Damn shame, I know a lot of people that would buy this, but now we'll never see it on blu ray unless Criterion Collection releases it, which would probably be some time if ever, but it does feel like one of the campier titles they'd go for. I hope they just release it again, not limited, but then they're stabbing their customers in the back who paid over $100 for this. Why limit a release of a film that drives the price up to $100? Only the crazy and the rich would pay that for even the best of films, you could probably manufacture 3,000 copies of Body Double for a little over $100. So these 3000 have almost completely sold out in a week, they could sell many more times that over the years, what a waste, shortcoming their own company and all fans of this film besides the 3,000 most diehard, which apparently there are still many more than that. If you bumped the price down to $10, a reasonable 10% of its current price, you could easily sell 10 times as many within a year, who knows how many more in that year and the years to come. What other films are going to be lost to time with this scheme? What other films will we never be able to enjoy on blu-ray unless we happen to have an extra few hundred bucks and check every few weeks to see if there'll be a limited release?
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Nesbo is absolutely one of the best mystery writers. I love his characters, especially Harry Hole who always sobers up to solve the murder.
B0040I09RM|5.0|we loved season 1 and the HD quality is perfect.  is is a great way to catch up on missed seasons!
1592407889|2.0|Another child of a star who gets herself publicity and tries to make some cash by playing on a famous parent's name. While no doubt Shirley MacLaine is not Mother of the Year material (who would let her 2 year old child go live on the other side of the world?), Sachi Parker seems determined to make all her shortcomings someone else's fault. ** Spoiler: I was particularly annoyed when the 27 year old got pregnant, but didn't have any money and ultimately had an abortion. If I had been in MacLaine's shoes I would have helped my daughter financially if she wanted to keep the child, but by the same token it is ultimately Parker's responsibility. She was not some 17 year old who got lured into the back seat of a car. She was a grown woman. After aborting the child, she then somehow a few years later has money for breast enhancement surgery. Not sure how I see her choices as superior to her mother's.<br /><br />I do think that MacLaine was an absentee parent who put her career first and that's sad. I'm still not sure why she felt the need to tell the world this. We all have issues with family members and things that have happened to us. I resent offspring of the famous using the publishing world as a therapist and then letting us pay for the privilege of listening to their problems. I also found that, without the MacLaine stories, Parker herself is not very interesting. She also, in my opinion, doesn't have her mother's gift for storytelling. I was very glad to be done with this book and while it may not have increased my regard for MacLaine, it left me with a really bad feeling toward Parker. She seems to insinuate that had it not been for MacLaine sabotaging her, she would have been this great actress.  Every mediocre actor can find someone to blame instead of looking within.  That seems to be Parker's problem all around.  It's someone or something else that caused her problems -- her mother, her father, her Japanese upbringing, the men in her life.  Time to put on thebig girl panties.
B00364K6YW|5.0|You can never go wrong with Jane or Colin and but them together and it is fantastic. I am very happy with the purchase, the DVD came quickly and I had a great time watching it.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Well written! I get lost in the story every day. It is a long book but worth the time. Cant wait to read day 2!
0425266060|5.0|Enjoyed the books.....can not wait for the next one!!!!!  Characters were great....Gideon and Eva just love them...can not wait to see what happens in their next journey.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Fun to play! Really enjoyable, very good quality. You have to pay to get coins and that kind of sucks
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I tried to play my video on this and it wouldn't load. When I tried to go back, it would freeze and not respond. This messed up all my apps and made them not work. I give this a negative 200,000,000,000 if I could. I am very angry.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book takes you on a strange journey from the perspective young Jack that is every bit worth reading! Would definitely recommend it to friends!
B005544V6A|5.0|Very interesting Dynamics in this program. Interesting engaging storylines. The actors are interesting in the characters they play. Each episode is different,
B004SIP6QI|5.0|First loved the book.  Didn't particularly care for Nicole Kidman or Renee Zellweger (sp?) but tried the movie anyway because the book was so good.  Well, come to find out that Renee received an Oscar for her performance and there's a reason for that - she was fabulous!  So were Nicole Kidman and Jude Law.  For the first time ever I can't decide which I like better, the book or the movie.  I have decided to love them both equally.  Movie was beautifully shot and Philip Seymour Hoffman has a great secondary role also.  I have given away at least five sets (book and movie) to friends and relatives - GOOD STUFF!!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I liked it.. it wrapped up all the unknowns from the first 2 books as well as kept the suspense coming
B000NGTJTY|1.0|Perhaps a record in the number of F-Bombs per minute category, which *might* be endured if the rest of the sentences made sense. No such luck.
B004NSULHM|5.0|Just listen to this albums with your eyes shut on a Saturday afternoon. You'll get the beauty of it: it's not easy, it's not immediatiate but it's so totally worth it.
0887081770|5.0|My husband ordered them and seemed pleased and happy  He never gets toooo enthusiastic but I loved all the books  the wife
1563899426|5.0|I read a summary of the story online and the low price made me take a shot at the story. Better than expected I tell you what. Definitely a nice departure from the regular DC titles. Vertigo really does take its stories seriously. Usually I like to stick to an epic story and thought for a bit that 140 something pages would be way too short; and again I'm glad I was mistaken. Each of the six issues really moves and holds its own nicely. I liked it so much, I ordered the next 9 volumes. I'm also glad I only recently heard of Fables because if I had heard of it sooner, I would gone crazy waiting for prices to go down to a comfortable level. I got all mine for $5 each $1 + 3.99 shipping, I made a deal with a great seller and recommend anyone interested to do the same with others as long as you are planning to buy in bulk. Good luck!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was one game that I actually couldn't put down! Great graphics and every part was challenging. Look forward to the next one!
B001NFTZPM|5.0|It's no mask but, a mask container. 2 DVDs, 1 for the movie, one for terrible special features that don't really count as special features. There is a 3rd dvd that does NOT fit in the case, it comes in a paper sleve. There is only 1 documentary in the extra dvd, I really think it it could have fit in the second disk seeing as it isn't much really. I recommend this version of the dvd over the regual 2-disk special editions, they suck. No holographic slipcase will make crappy special features in the 2 disk edition worth while.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|This product worked well initially in two different vehicles (Nissan truck and Lexus SUV).  It was a life saver on a long trip up the east coast.  However, on the third occasion I tried to use it, it does not charge my iPhone 5 at all.  The ring around the 12v outlet connector illuminates but no longer charges the phone.  I even tried a second iPhone 5 with no luck.  Both of these phones are easily charged by other chargers so I can only believe that the problem is with the PowerJolt SE itself.  I am very dissatisfied with the quality of the product and I want my money back or a replacement at no cost.  Seller, if you read this, please contact me.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I liked the connections she made in this book but it really didn't tell about any horrible things that happened or fights....
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Enjoyed The Tudors four season historical drama very much. It was a terrifying look into the political and personal life of<br />a king who defined his time with the upheaval of the balance of power both in religion and politics.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|I love the Bosh books.  Harry has all of the flaws of humanity ... just like all of us.  Not the untouchable superhero ... just a 'grinder' who finds ways to solve complicated crimes.  Not so much a tough cop ... but someone I can relate to.  I wish I could have dinner with him someday.  And .... I will read every book Michael Connelly will write.  Thank you Michael for your gift.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Love the show and the game.Have had bug issues on my phone  version; but it is free and very show-realistic.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I love this band, and this album is my Fav.  It's one of those albums I still dig up and add to my jogging playlist, etc.  original, chill, and rocking out at the same time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was cool. I wish there were more levels. I got threw it pretty quickly. Can't wait for more levels.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Just like every Johnny Cash song/album, this one's no exception, awesome, powerful, pure music.  At Folsom Prison is probably my favorite - tough decision though.  Highly Recommend.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The dirty little secret of this well-written zombie story is how many very clever geopolitical observations Brooks works in to an old-fashioned horror story. Which societies would thrive in a global disaster? Which would fail?  (In various points, you could pretty much substitute Spanish Flu pandemic for zombie infestation.)  Still, at its heart, this is a great series of vignettes built around believable characters.
B0000508U6|5.0|Perfect Chill-out, go to sleep music.  I still love this album, no matter how old it is.  recommend to anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Very disappointed to learn that I was not able to use this item. I was not made aware that uPnP had to be enabled and that AT&T routers do not have the uPnP feature available.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Just like every Johnny Cash song/album, this one's no exception, awesome, powerful, pure music.  I love all of the songs, a smattering from throughout his career, all awesome.  Highly Recommend.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Giving this five stars despite the countess comma splices. As a copy editor, that sort of thing usally ruins a book for me. It caused some pauses, but overall, this is just such a great story, it didn't matter. Could've used a cleaner ending.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|The book was good up until the climax then it became long winded and predictable.  I did very much enjoy the historical events.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very entertaining read about a 100 year old man, his life and adventures.  Witty and fun.  You won't be disappointed.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Love this app for my Kindle Fire.  Just needed something to wake me and not drain my battery!  Great app for free!
0783231032|5.0|This movie is a very well cast and very, very funny. Every actor did his and her part, Very well worth seeing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I wish it had more levels. Can't wait for the update!<br />I would recommend this as a great time killer and brain teaser.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|its a really cool app and I like it but the worst thing is that it doesn't update when the other appstores do
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I completely enjoyed playing this game. There were a few things that made me a little angry while playing the game, but overall did not distract from the whole game. Good job Big Fish dev!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Pretty good game to play. Some of the items are hard to see because they are so small. But overall not bad.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|rather than just the simple act of buying animals and then collecting as you grow bigger you must also release and redo great fun
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Fun. Keeps me busy for hours!!!!! BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only thing wrong is that there is only limited amount of special missions.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Love Mahjong! This game keeps my mind constantly moving. My only complaint is it's a little less challenging than I expected. Other than that love it!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Crazy hard to beat but hours of fun. Takes more than one go to beat the levels. Worth the time.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|A very good sequel to something borrowed! Didn't want to do reading!! Emily Griffin does a great job in all of her books making you feel like you're one of the characters.
1623420148|5.0|Can I first say that Emma Chase is brilliant!  I have never laughed out loud before while reading before this book!  I ended up reading most of it out loud to my boyfriend who also laughed!  I hope the typical male does not actually think like this character but I know I dated my share of those who do.  So goooood!!
B0026IUXME|5.0|In one of the most-needed \\"comebacks\\" probably in movie History, the director-\\"Auteur\\" Roman Polanski shows off why he is the scion of this much-deserved title. Movie-goers may remember him from his days as the Ultra-literal Interpreationalist of such films as \\"Rosemary's Baby,\\" \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles,\\" etc, but in this epic he really does show off his force. It sucks you in and is compelling, from the very fist shot, as the Warsaw family \\"Celebrates,\\" thinking they've evaded a German offensive (huddled around news-feed pirated in through BBC radio.) But, alas, the Bombs and machine-gun fire come in the next scene. Based on the Auto-Biography of a \\"Piano Player\\" in Warsaw, Poland (whom Brody portrays w/Oscar-Winning tour-de-force), this Masterpiece displays all the horror and cruelty of man's mismanagement of man w/detail and tear-jerking effect. We are swayed, and bought to disbelief, as the \\"Piano Player\\"'s family is carted off to Treblinka (so much for a UK \\"Reconnaissance!!!\\") No-where in this film is there any semblance of \\"Affect,\\" or anything, at all, of it somehow trying to be any kind of an \\"Art-House\\" -movie. At not one single moment are we \\"bored,\\" or left not rooting for the poor protagonist. In Polanski's homage to his own time consigned to the Jewish Ghettos, we cannot be diswayed from what the Central Theme of this film really is:  That, yes, man actually is capable of these kinds of things . . . and, that, yes, there is Salvation in the Forever-Documenting of them, for the future . . .
1565113306|5.0|My favorite book and movie. The story of an insomniac who meets a guy whom he ends up starting a fight club with and all this chaos ensues around him. Very psychological. I am trying to write this without spoilers, hence my vague description.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Twilight Saga Eclipse is such a great Movie that I have watched it over and over again the extras were awesome
B00843TZJ2|4.0|I cannot believe that everyone is watching and listening to the same DVD?  I think that this performance is marginally short of remarkable mostly because Stills' voice isnt what it used to be, but I dont think it is shot! Hell, even Sinatra had issues later on in his career.  About the only rock and roll vocalist who hasnt lost much in the aging process is Roger Daltrey, because he took care of himself.  Stills didnt.<br /><br />The harmonies for the most part are nice and tight.  Stills' playing is hot!  Nash and Crosby are awesome.  And the band is just excellent.  Some great organ licks, and the lap steel on Learn to Live is simple but elegant.  I agree with Crosby, Learn to Live is probably Stills' best tune.  Crosby himself wasnt a slouch when he wrote Cut My Hair which is probably the only disappointment since it evidently was not played that evening.  Other high points are the Carry On/Questions opener, Wooden Ships and Guinever.  What makes this evening so special is that they genuinely appear to be enjoying playing together.  Attitude, in my opinion, is a big factor if a band is going to have to together on any given evening.<br /><br />I would have preferred a little more bass on the production side of the DVD.  Otherwise I agree with the reviewer who is irritated that it is not surround sound, therefore four stars.
B009AMALLM|5.0|Very good movies! Great series that will keep you on he edge of your seat! The 4th one is just a good as the first three!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This is a very confusing game not sure what to do. Need better idea of what to do and how to get to play longer per session.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 is another masterpiece.  The twists and turns of Downton Abbey will leave you longing for more.  It's entertainment at its best.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|This game is fun when it works. Game is coin based and it gives a chance at lives evert 40 minutes or so when you get 2 to 4 lives. Each game is 2 coins to play.  With that said..... sometimes when starting a new game it glitches out and goes back to main menu. Yes coins are then lost. I not so brightly bought coins to play. Big mistake. Half. The coins are used on games that dont start and the other half on games you get half through and they freeze. Then today i got coins and it said taking longer than usual to process..... charged my card and never showed up. I have contacted amazon and game developer...... might as well have talked to a wall..... basically..... fun game but dont spend extra money on it.
0553593544|2.0|Bought all three of the bourne books, skipping the fourth not written by ludlum. I'm not a ludlum fan and these books are an excellent example of the reason why. The writing is tedious, needlessly convoluted, overly complicated, difficult to read and follow. This first of the three is the best of the three, and it's not good at all. If you'd like more of my observations, get in touch. Til then, unless you like needlessly tedious prose, skip this one, and the next two.
1401938906|5.0|Finally a book on metaphysics that's fun and easy to understand!  I'm going to give this to friends and family.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|This movie is entertaining with a few interesting plot twists. Combine that with the fact that Amanda Seyfried could probably get the interest of a gay eunuch priest, and you have a winner.
0812550706|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for required summer reading.  She procrastinated and put off reading till 3 days before school started; but once she started she could not put it down, and is looking forward to reading more in the series.

B002PEP4SC|4.0|I love the tv show so the characters were very real in this book. I am starting Naked Heat next
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is incredibly fun and addictive! I've had it for a while now and I still love it and it is always up to date which is great. It takes time to unlock things because certain characters, boards and upgrades are costly!  All n' all ...it's an amazing game
B003M696QS|5.0|We were blind about what happens after we die, this books is a serious study on the subject made by medical community about life after death and the NDE (near death experience), a subject of grand interest for many. Many other books and research are being done today. Death will be an obsolete subject in the future, it will be understood by all and fear of it will be no longer.
1416955070|5.0|I feel in love with this book!! i would recommend this to anyone who likes action, romance, and amazing authors. Cassandra Clare is amazing! when finished this book i had to order the next one as possible! i just couldn't turn myself away not a second. anyone tried to talk me or get me to move from where i was a gave them like an evil glare ....... i did apologize but the book was always at a good part and i just it was a fantastic read!

B0042TV4IW|5.0|... you'll enjoy this.<br />The acting is fine, the situations interesting, great sets and costumes.<br />There are plenty of actors you'll be familiar with and some new ones you'll enjoy - a great ensemble show
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I just started playing this but as of right now I'm enjoying it.  I would definitely recommend this to someone and I don't even really like killing games.

B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Akin to a bildungsroman, this novel is a first-person narrative relating events in the life of Dell Parsons.  The time focused upon is during Dell’s fifteenth year and is told fifty years later by him.  Dell has an intriguing voice that  captures his teenage self.  Interspersed with this voice, however,  is the wisdom of the older Dell.  Divided into three parts, the first is spell-binding, focusing on Dell’s family in 1960.  The second part continues Dell’s story during the same year but in a totally different environment. This part is weaker than the first because some of the newly introduced characters in Part Two are not as deeply drawn as those in Part One.  Part Three, which is brief, ties some loose ends together and takes place in 2010.  Ford’s creation of setting, from Great Falls to sites in Saskatchewan, is vivid and adds a supporting dimension to the telling of this tale.
B0057URWSQ|3.0|This show would be better if the inaccuracies weren't so obvious. Instead, it just looks silly.<br />To start:<br /><br />1. Harvard Law School is not on Chicago's campus.<br /><br />2. No law firm only hires from Harvard- Why would they when Stanford and Yale are higher ranked?<br /><br />3. Associates are not in a cubicle. Even summers get an office.<br /><br />4. Don't get me started on the interview process and that sassy, unprofessional paralegal.
B00C28J2VQ|1.0|Let me begin by saying that I did not expect a deep, thought-provoking film.  I expected an entertaining action flick, short on plot, with plenty of fight scenes and explosions, just brainless fun.  G.I. Joe Retaliation has plenty of action, but there's something missing.  I found myself bored, easily distracted, and not entertained at all.  In fact, it was so tedious, that I couldn't bring myself to finish the movie.  I wish I had paid more attention to the Rotten Tomato ratings, where nearly half of users were disappointed.  Rent it first, before spending the money on the Blu-ray.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Wonderful plot, intriguing characters and medicine and architecture and history woven throughout. Long, but I'm sorry my read is over.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|After buying our PS3, we were impressed by everything but the controllers. I know, millions of people like the Dual Shock style best. For a long time, so did we. But now we prefer the concave sticks with textured nubs of the 360, as well as its stick placement.<br /><br />Frankly, we didn't expect much from the Pro Elite. PowerA has always made the kind of controller you pull out when your friends are coming over, not one that you use every day. I also wasn't too impressed by their [[ASIN:B00BV742SW MOGA Pocket]] controller for Android, so we bought this one only because it was cheap (under $20 when we bought it), wireless, had Sixaxis motion detection, and had the left stick in our preferred location.<br /><br />How surprised we were to find that we liked the Pro Elite better than not only the Sixaxis/Dual Shock, but the real Xbox 360 controller too. It's weighted nicely, charges quickly from any USB source (and you can keep playing on the PS3 while it does), the buttons, triggers and sticks are really responsive and placed nicely, and the textured grips feel great. Yes, other reviewers have complained that they're hard plastic, not rubberized. We consider that a plus, since hard plastic with the texture cut into it is a lot less likely to attract dust and get slippery than a rubberized coating. After over a hundred hours of combined play since buying it, neither of us has had the texture dig into our hands as some have described. It feels great.<br /><br />While it's a wireless controller, it comes with a USB receiver that must be plugged into the PS3. For us this actually a bonus, because it turned out to also work as a standard PC gamepad with our laptops and with our Tronsmart Android TV stick. (We've only tried it with D-pad-and-buttons games on those machines so far, though.) We haven't tried plugging it into the PS3 through a USB hub, so we don't know if you can use more than two at once. But most of the time, it's just the two of us playing, anyway.<br /><br />So, just before writing this review, I ordered a second one. Now the spare controller we pull out when we're playing with friends will be the Sixaxis that came with the PS3.
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|This app is very sloppily done, it constantly kicks me out and is hard to navigate around in. It gives you access to all Google accounts like drive, gmail, calendar etc but the visual format is sloppy and difficult to use. I see no reason to change the appearance of it yet again so that if you use this app it looks completely different than the Phone app and the regular web access so now you have to figure out three different looks. Combine that with the app always kicking me out I won't be using this much until they make it all work.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Screens too hard to navigate.  I don't want to try an earn an advanced degree.  I just want to see if it's going to rain tomorrow.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I had resisted reading this series for years. However, I was recently standing with a group of my coworkers when one started to giggle at another woman's necklace that was made of little silver balls. The other women all started in unison to giggle as well. I was confused but then one looked at me with a shocked expression and asked - \\"you haven't ready Fifty Shades of Grey\\"??<br /><br />My curiousity got to me and I decided to download book one to my kindle I was hooked. The book's sexual themes were shocking to me but the \\"love\\" story between Christian and Ana really hooked me and I was engrossed. I could see where a naive young woman would be captivated and charmed by a successful, handsome and charming sexual predator. She fell into his world but I was so proud of her at the end of book 1 when she walked away. You go girl!  I could have ended there, but I continued on.<br /><br />Book 2 was better than book 1. I did enjoy how Christian appeared to be re-evaluating his lifestyle and was so into Ana that he was willing to throw his past away to be with her as his partner - his love partner.  The scene where he submits to her caught me by surprise and I thought it was the best exchange between when in all of the 3 books. I really felt that the past was the past and that these two people were ready to live a wonderful life together. I loved the ending and felt very satisfied with the story. How I wish I had not moved onto book 3!<br /><br />Book 3 clearly shows that controlling Christian is still very much in the present and Ana at this point is so into him and his riches that she will do anything to remain with him. Early on in the book, I knew it was over for me. In fact it was almost as if a different writer had authored this book. We all know that the series won't be up for any literary awards but this book was very very poorly written as so many others have stated. The flow was slow, the repeated words got old (holy cow - who says that?) and I honestly wasn't sure of the plot line. And the sex scenes grew oh so boring. I mean really, who has sex 10 times a day?<br /><br />***** SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />But my break up with Christian began with the horrible sex scene after Ana was caught sunbathing with her top down. She knew she was going to be punished and really throughout this book, I felt like she was just pulling Christian's chains to see what \\"punishment\\" he could dream up for her. But the book went too far for me when he left marks all over her breasts, wrists and ankles. And then bought expensive jewelry to cover up the marks on her wrists so others would not see. I have known women who were abused and one once told me that her husband only hit her where the marks could be hidden. So this scene was just so so sad.<br /><br />The next scene that I found utterly disturbing was when Christian decided to punish Ana with the practice of \\"orgasm denial\\" . Once again, Christian was in full control. Yes Ana broke down but at this point, we all knew she would run back.<br /><br />The rest of the book was just plain boring. It could have been so interesting. But the storyline was clouded by Ray's accident, bar scenes and the constant threat of being killed or kidnapped by some stranger (even though we all knew who it was at the end of book 2).  And the pregnancy was so unrealistic. As controlling as Christian is, is the reader really suppose to believe that Christian  A. Didn't set reminders for Ana to get her shots? or B. have the doctor call him directly if she missed a shot?  And Ana really didn't expect his intense reaction when she told him? Quite frankly, she was lucky he didn't order an abortion that day.<br /><br />The epilogue made me sad. The initial scene was of a happy family enjoying their time together on their beautiful property. But then the reader learns that the night before, Christian had taken a very pregnant Ana at her request to the \\"red room\\" to pleasure her as she bowed her head. So really inspite of all the relevations that Christian shared about his past and the hope that he was willing to put his demons to rest. He hadn't. He still was the Dominant. The only one who changed was Ana. Who was now thoroughly engaged in Christian's lifestyle.<br /><br />I really wish I had stopped at book 2.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Got this as a gift for my dad, and he loved it.  He had heard a few songs on it before, but he liked the other songs, too.
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|I enjoyed Oblivion and was simply blown away by both the film and the very cool soundtrack.  I was so impressed, that after I watched it, I immediately went online and checked the score out further.  I downloaded it on the spot and have played it so much that were it not electronic, the physical media would be worn out!<br /><br />The film definitely added significance to the music, and I'm glad I didn't pay attention to the vicious and undeserved (bad) review on RogerEbert, which made no mention of the great musical score. The music is a perfect match for the futuristic theme of the film, both compliment each other well.<br /><br />The title track, the only one with vocals, is awesome and moving.  Norwegian singer Susanne Sundfør's powerful vocals combined with M83's upbeat musical excellence makes this hands-down my favorite track of the CD. I would have bought the CD for this song alone.  Her strong siren voice reminds me of another Norwegian singer, Frida from the 70's pop group ABBA.  My second favorite track is Starwaves, another powerful score, able to stand on its own, yet certainly enhanced by my mental connection to the moving love scene in the movie.<br /><br />Like any soundtrack, there are highs and lows and with such a dynamic range, it is not ideal for every listening environment.  Also, I must point out that electronic music like this is not something I normally listen to, so I was not familiar with M83 before.  I know who they are now!  If you liked the movie, I think you will also like the musical score.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I bought this after my computer starting overheating after a session of gaming or two. I didn't know what was wrong, and my first instinct was to check the video card to see if it was overheating. Lo and behold, when I checked that my CPU's idle temps were 70+ Celsius, I knew I had to get me some thermal compound.<br /><br />Application was very easy, and I have barely used any of it at all. With this much thermal compound, I will probably be using this for my next 5-10 computer builds!! Great value, and definitely a must.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|I must truly hate myself for sitting through this glitzy piece of garbage. Perfect for a self-hate fueled binge-eating depression spiral. Pairs well with any available alcohol and cutting yourself.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|What's to say. This is a good on line pin ball gave that distracts our grand kids. It certainly takes up less space than the real pinball game we had in our home when our children were growing up.
B003OAL58E|5.0|was very impressed by the depth of those characters, very haunting, kept me hooked to the end. Extra ordinary movie
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great ending to a really screwed up man's life.  Christians love for Anna finally made him as whole as he would ever be, and completely in love with the only woman he ever needed.  I loved the whole series.
B009439HEY|4.0|When I first heard that Steve Hackett was going to do another album of re-hashed Genesis songs I can't say that I was overly enthused.  Hackett has been putting out some of the best original material of his career in the last decade and for me, going back and doing what is essentially a covers album seemed pointless.  Nonetheless, Hackett has recruited an all star cast for this 2 CD set covering both Genesis and a few of his better known solo works.  The track list is impressive as there are a lot of great songs on here.  Are they improvements on the originals?  I guess that would be a matter of personal taste.  I am not sure that all of the vocalists really fit the material, even though they are all more than capable singers.  The material selected for this one is for the most part better than on Genesis revisited I to my ears.  Again this will be a matter of personal taste for many, but I think that the selections from the \\"Trick Of The Tail\\" and \\"Wind And Wuthering\\" era of Genesis especially stand out on this collection.  Including \\"Suppers Ready\\" is also a stroke of genius with Phil Collins son Simon on vocals; it does not sound all that different from the live version on \\"Seconds Out\\".  Hackett's re-workings of some of his solo material is effective although I am not sure that much is added to the originals.  \\"Camino Royal\\", \\"Tower Struck Down\\", and \\"Please Don't Touch\\" come off well for the most part.  I guess the bottom line to this whole thing is how much do you like a covers album.  For what it is, the music is fantastic and I find the album an enjoyable listen.  Would I choose this over the originals?  That is a tougher call.  My hope is that Hackett continues to put out new original music once this flirtation with the past is over with.  This is solid 4 stars, but working with already great material certainly helps.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Some are really hard. I enjoy a challenge and this is a good one. I have been playing for a week and only add it to level 10.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|can't put formulas in. very user UNfriendly. very hard to set up spreedsheet. wouldn't recommend it for download at all
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book that is all. It brings you back to memories of how you were at that age . Not only that but the characters are so beautifully written.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|this is a fun game for my tablet. I really enjoy it and would recommend it for download. easy to use
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|I purchased this product around June 2011. I remember it was tricky to get it into place at first.<br /><br />After about 6 months it stopped working because I see that I initiated a support email correspondence with the company. I guess we got it working again.<br /><br />I use it every day for 8-14 hours. If I know I'm going to be away for a significant period of time, I place it on the charger while I'm gone, and of course every night. The only time I have a problem with it holding a charge all day is when I have forgotten to charge it over night. Otherwise, no probs.<br /><br />Recently, I would say within the past 2 months, I've noticed an annoying thing. It has started to pop out every so often while I'm using it. And I have to \\"click\\" it back it to place and get it to re-recognize the connection. Somehow or other it just isn't a tight fit anymore. It's starting to become more frequent and affect my productivity.<br /><br />That's why I'm on this page. I'm here to buy another one. A whole new setup: magic mouse + mobee. I figure why not have a new mouse and keep this one as a backup. My other backup mouse isn't as comfortable, plus it's wired. Before getting the mobee, it seemed like I was going thru batteries very quickly. I'm a designer and I'm on my computer all the time.<br /><br />So, it's not a perfect product, but it does a pretty good job. I would give it 3.5 stars if we were able to give halfsies. I'm giving it a 4 since I'm actually buying another one.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|works great.  Just like office excel. easy to set up and also add formulas. first downloaded olive phone and it and it was a disaster to use
B000I3P3EM|4.0|The original cast are still going strong in this movie.  The story line was interesting, and each character did well.  Entertaining.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|ok fir Keeling notes cries platforms ( I use android and ios. but the Mac version is always updating tbr software - seems almost every time I open tgd program on mu image it wants to install sn update.<br />and here I read about privacy issues - to be honest aneroid is far better than apple in thus respect for notifying users.
B000ICXQU6|4.0|I have seen this  movie before and I do like it.  The plot which is based on true story is very good, but the language of Erin is pretty bad.  The acting is very good, I would have given it a 5 if not for the language.
B00DMKFN34|3.0|FOREWARNING: This review contains spoilers on the plot.<br /><br />I feel conflicted about this movie. After watching it, I couldn't decide how I feel about it. I didn't think it was amazing, but I didn't dislike it either.<br /><br />The story is very similar to that of Cars, yet the main character isn't already a famous racer when the movie starts. Instead, it starts with Dusty Crophopper wanting to get away from home and join the Wings Around the World race. Nobody believes he can join because he was built to be a crop duster, not a racer. He also has a fear of heights, something you wouldn't expect from a plane. But with the help of a military veteran named Skipper, a gas truck named Chug, and a mechanic forklift named Dottie, Dusty is trained and gets into the race. The majority of the movie follows the race around the world and how Dusty overcomes some of his fears and steadily begins to climb up in the rankings. However, he faces stiff competition from a three-time champion plane named Ripslinger. Ripslinger begins to get jealous and does everything in his willpower to keep Dusty from winning. Dusty faces some major challenges, but he eventually overcomes his fears and wins the race.<br /><br />While the story isn't exactly terrible, the similarity to Cars is definitely present. Heck, the setting of Planes is pretty much a fusion of the settings of both Cars movies! The similarities exist even with the characters.<br /><br />Dusty is very reminiscent of Lightning McQueen. Dusty and McQueen are both racers and both end up learning an important lesson in the end. Dottie is similar to Sally, as both characters are doubtful at first (Dottie about Dusty's racing, Sally about the road getting fixed). Chug is all too similar to Mater in almost every way. Ripslinger is similar to Chuck, in the sense that he is determined to win and he would do anything to achieve that. But, the biggest similarity is between Skipper and Doc Hudson. In fact, Skipper is pretty much a carbon-copy of Doc, only as a plane and not a car. Skipper is a cranky old plane who refuses to assist Dusty, but ends up helping him anyway. Skipper, like Doc, has a rough past, as his profession led him to getting into an accident. This was the most obvious similarity out of the whole movie.<br /><br />The jokes in this movie aren't very good. The puns are even worse. For example, \\"For flying out loud!\\" But the worst was the name of the aircraft carrier Dusty lands on to refuel: \\"USS Flysinhower.\\" The stupidity of that name is almost too much to bear. This movie has little emotion, and I found it hard to get attached to any of the characters. The most emotional sequence was the part where Dusty crashes into the ocean, but even as it is, it's nowhere near as emotionally gut-wrenching as the ending to other Disney and Pixar movies.<br /><br />In the end, though, I didn't entirely hate Planes. It's still a decent movie, but it's too much of a Cars rehash to stand out as a great movie. It's not the worst spinoff I've ever seen, but it's not the best either. In the end, Planes is a decent movie...it will entertain the young kids, but it will most likely disappoint older viewers. I give it 3 out of 5 stars.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it for everything. It is easy to access over all my devices. Great for organizing my down loaded patterns. I can clip articles to it to read later. Evernote is a must have as well as skitch!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this app. you can change your vehicle you can change your background I just love it you need to get this app its AWSOME!!!! Just get it you will love it to. its a little hard in some parts but the u get addicted to it its soooooooo cool!!!!!
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|This a great app. Have your kindle vertical to avoid the white screen. Having it horizontal will cause a white screen, this does not mean the app is broke. Just turn it vertical and this will fix it, then click connect, then you can turn it horizontal.
B009MYARIK|1.0|Full disclosure - this is the first Sophie Kinsella book I've read. My book club girls chose it (some of them are huge fans) and told me that the author was great so it should be a good read. None of the characters were likable or believable. I knew exactly where it was going from just about the first page. I like a good fun book that doesn't make you think every once in a while but this one actually made my brain hurt it was so stupid. The book club gals also didn't like the book and some of them had never finished it - they swear this is not how the author's books usually are. I definitely wouldn't purchase another book by the author - maybe I would give her another chance at the library.
141659521X|5.0|I love the thriller genre.. i dont think this book will disappoint....<br />I like ones that grab your attention and keep - i hope this book will..
B003O86FMW|5.0|Sooooooooooo in love with these books<br />They are Great kudos Suzanne Collins well done =) I love it!! No doubt
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Hysterical movie--so shockingly funny.  Not for little kids.  This movie over delivered the humor and still had a good story line.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I really like feedly as my replacement for google reader. All my google reader blogs were easily transferred into feedly.  You can then organize them by categories, favorites, etc.  So, you can easily see any new posts and read as much or as little as you want.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I thought the movie was great.  I loved the original and I thought this was a great way to tell the story of how it all began.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|Interesting app, gives good info on basic battery status ; however, the stupid app requires that you log into Amazon before you can open it. That prevents usage on airplanes and other places with no Internet coverage. It's a real pain.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|This CD is a must for Neal Young fans.  Every song on the album is one of his greats!! Very happy with it!!
B004QIG7CW|5.0|It bought this for my 9 years old daughter. She loves music, as Lemonade Mouth is musical movie, she loves the movie very much. She can memorize and sing all the songs in there, her friends are all impressed, even asked her to write down the lyrics for them... wow! I didn't know a good movie can give such good impact?! Maybe my daughter will start her own band...??? Just kidding, but wait! who knows??
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I was very unsure of this film when I went to see it and was pleasantly surprised that it was nothing like I anticipated! I found the explanation of how the &#34;Wizard&#34; ends up in OZ very believable and what transpires upon his arrival very cool!
B00280LYIC|4.0|Very fun. I love Greek mythology so this was a fun spin. A little lame at some points, but it's young adult so that's understandable. Still liked it a lot.
B00A3SGWYC|3.0|Not a huge fan but wanted 2 of the songs on here so decided to go for it! It is okay to listen to in the car when you feel the need to turn it up and feel the bass!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The first 17 levels are  very fun then from there it gets frustration challenging. You can stick to the easy way of winning by just using cheap plants and plant them all over the place or you can get creative but that comes at a risk since they only give you enough sunlight to make a few big plants but if you plant the wrong one than things can take a big turn as you are left with no money and a plant that you will have to dig up but you  can recover like 4 mins later. So it's fun if you play the easy way of planting a lot of cheap plants but it gets too easy and it's fun when you decide to plant you big priced  plants but that's usually a hit or a miss with the. Wave of zombies depending. So problem is I think they should had out a lot more sunlight so you will want to use different plants
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 is definitely as good or better than season 1 if only because you know and care about the characters so much!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I love it. The less time you have to do a specific seed, the more time you have to try out different seeds. Also, my personal favorite seed is Stumble. Try this out. The game itself is amazing. This game has impressed me beyond belief.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This app has nice editing features, but it won't even save the picture. It also didn't allow me to use a photo from my gallery to edit it. It would only accept pictures taken directly from my camera. Very weird, dysfunctional app. Devs need to fix these problems!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I was having the same trouble with the new update. By accident I figured out how to fix it. You have to restart your kindle for the update to finish. Hope this helps.
B00CBRADU2|2.0|I'm a Knoxville fan so I thought I would watch the movie. He was the only highlight in this poorly written movie. This might have been a bigger movie in the 80's when people weren't expecting much but 20 years later we would at least question why someone would escape the police in a helicopter only to get into a car to run away from them. Unfortunately that was the part that made the most sense. Jesus, this movie was horrible.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much, although I got pretty upset at times about how Tesla was treated by his contemporaries, especially Edison and J. P. Morgan. A good read if you like biographies.
B00457WZEI|5.0|It is a very good book well written, (if you saw the movie you would love to read the book)  there is also a sequel that you will love also.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|makes you realize that your life is not as difficult as many others. Very good book, I would recommend it
B00BEXB18M|3.0|Mustaine has written some excellent new material here and continues to innovate with songs like Blackest of Crow and Beginning of Sorrow.  As others have pointed out Kingmaker is a great tune that comes closest to traditional Megadeth from the golden age.  However the elephant in the (mixing) room cannot be ignored: whoever oversaw the recording, mixing, and technical production of this album did a poor job.  The music generally sounds synthetic, instrumentation is not distinct in any way. It's almost like elevator music in some ways -- and I think it is the production. The guitar riffs seem like computer generated sound bits.  Let us hear the instruments, guys! And so a mixed bag which deserves 4-5 stars for songs craftsmanship and performance but a 2 star effort on production.  Get the album -- we Megadeth fans are lucky that for nearly thirty years we've gotten new material essentially every other year.  No other band I know can come close to that.
B006S01GH2|3.0|This movie's format was quite different from the usual fare. It appeals to one's sense of intimacy, humanness, and sociability. In a French kind of way. The video cover pic of Audrey Tautou for &#34;Amelie&#34;  is hideous, IMHO. Don't let that throw you. Try this flick if you are in the mood for a quirky, sentimental, off beat movie.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Often we talk about the \\"First Four\\" Megadeth albums (possibly adding CTE as the \\"First Five\\") as the golden age of Megadeth.  Beyond that, there is a wide range of fan opinion on the various releases, but little universal acclaim for any one individual effort.  I say this because UA I believe belongs in the same league as the classic albums. There is nothing weak on this album. One could argue that Set Me Free (A Tout Le Monde remade) doesn't fit, but Dave has made it clear this was added by the record company execs. And it's a good song anyway.  But for pure thrash and controlled anger, UA is more than solid.  The title track, Gears of War, Sleepwalker, and Washington is Next stand out for me.  This belongs in the collection of any Megadeth fan or Metal aficionado.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Was working fine when I originally downloaded it months ago. Tried playing it again, had to uninstall and reinstall like three times. Its working kinda slow right now but hopefully its only b/c I'm downloading other apps. Otherwise its pretty fun and can keep you busy.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I found the book difficult to read yet equally so to put down.  A good read and a great choice for book clubs.  It should be read and discussed among friends.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Love the game, it brings back some great memories of childhood &quot;game-wars&quot; my brother and I had but the small amount of initial tokens left me hanging, waiting for the next scratcher. I don't like to wait!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The best version of this type of game that I have played yet. It combines elements of two of my favorite types of games, solving puzzles and escaping from rooms. The levels are just challenging enough to make it interesting but not so hard that you can't solve them. I can't wait for more rooms to be added, I just hope that we don't have to wait too long.
1400069807|5.0|Read thru the entire book which is not something I ever do. But not one word of this book is worth missing. I even bought it and am glad that I did, I would like to read it again in parts.It should and will change how you LQQK at processed food and how you will never eat it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love pocket edition becauce of the new update which makes it alot like the real minecraft and ads large chests
B005PK553C|5.0|I heard alot about series. It lives up to its reputation as a scary thriller. Great story line. I would recommend.
B008Y73940|5.0|Great movie. Matt did a great job. bad lawyer to good guy. pretty predictable but still very interesting. See it.
B00000I8UJ|1.0|I 'll commend on the last shipment I got. Of the four cd's I got, one in a carton case was ok, the other 3 in a jewel case were severely damaged, luckily without the cd's being damaged. Apart from this I payed for the shipment and then again I had to pay for the handling by the dutch entrance, which made the whole price way to expensive. I can assure you I will never again buy anything via Amazone again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Outstanding!  I read it twice to consume it....I will be excited to see the movie....  Hope that won't be too long..
0345529057|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this series. Started off watching the HBO show and couldn't wait to read the books.<br /><br />In my view, the first three are really great, but the fourth one lags a bit. That could be due to the purpose of the book being to &#34;set the stage&#34; for the next three, but I guess we'll have to see.<br /><br />Can't wait until Season 4!
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I liked the fact this was how it really was in the 50's and 60's. It made me think of how people were treated, be prepared to laugh and cry, the film was fantastic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved this book! My teenage daughter also loved it and told all her friends to read it also. A different and sweet love story! Easy to read and I was into it from the 1st few pages!
B001GKJ2FM|1.0|[[ASIN:B001TKUXVG Universal Mamma Mia The Movie W/frame [dvd/ws/gwp]]][[ASIN:B001GKJ2FM Mamma Mia!

I would suggest that these DVD's (all of them sent out that are fullfilled by Amazon be checked)I have read this happens 7 out of 8 times.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|I was thrilled to find a follow-up to this heart wrenching story.  The realities of moving on after losing the love of your life and the details of Yossi's owns truggles with who he is were well depicted in this film.

0375847227|5.0|I ordered the 'His Dark Materials' (3 in 1 omnibus volume) after seeing the movie \\"The Golden Compass\\" several times and needing more.<br />  My son, who is a picky reader and I both love this book. We are taking turns reading it. The fantasy is wonderful, we just get lost in it.....and time goes by so quickly because it feels so real.<br />  Lyra is a hero who is very easy to relate to. Phillip Pullman is an excellent story teller.<br />As for the book's size. Yes it is 933 pages, but since the volume is as large as the average size hardcover book, it isn't too bulky at all.  Great Purchase !!!!!!<br />  ......edit.......I have just finished reading 'His Dark Materials\\"....The best thing I have ever read....There were days that I couldn't put it down. The characters are amazing and the action is non-stop. What a beautiful fantasy!!!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game play it everyday faithfully. The free prizes are awesome but the only downfall to the game is the give aways and how difficult it is to place in the top four the daily tournament.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Enjoyable and a fun read, but not up to the author`s usual standards. It was a freebee, and so it was fine.
B00001W9G0|4.0|Nice story about 2 people who fall in love. Nice dvd but picture quality could be better since it was enhanced.

B005JTAP4S|5.0|This is a very creative, wish-it-would-never-end kind of story. The author has created a remarkable character in Peter, not to mention, Slip the elf, Arnica, Hally, Mrs. Kipple, Wind Sail, Mr. Twindle Twoondle, etc. Perhaps even more impressive is how he created a bizarre and whacky world, it's as if the book was written through a kaleidoscope. Well written and imaginative - you'll have a great time!
0060574216|3.0|Well, with 10 cats to try and control this is difficult. I've sprayed the stuff where a couple of the cats go pee and it doesn't seem to discourage them very much. Gives 'em interesting 'sniffs' though. So I still have to clean up pee and the occasional poop. Keeps me busy and agile. My poor old 75 year old Navy SEAL body stays limber though. &#60;SIGH&#62;
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Oria is a wonderful character who suddenly has to deal with incredible responsibilities, find and understand her power, all while falling in love . . . typical teenage girl stuff but this is no typical story. The reader is taken to an extraordinary world, one we could explore forever. The pages speed past and I found myself trying to slow down to make it last longer. Along the way there are surprises, wisdom, magic, excitement and much beauty. What a pleasure - can't wait to read the next one!
B0047N0Y52|5.0|This is marketed as a kids' game but it is one of our most played at Game Nights.<br /><br />Huge groups of grown ups, grabbing, fighting, swearing...all in good fun, of course.<br /><br />If you enjoy speedy games, this is one of the best.

B00DYOOGYK|2.0|I enjoy most gameloft games.  I like every gangstar game released to date...while the graphics are good, the gameplay and controls are terrible.  Driving is hard to get used to...tilt left to go right and right to go left...I played for 10 minutes before I got annoyed and stopped playing.  That shouldn't happen for $7.  If I could get refunded I would.
0316113514|5.0|I refer people to this book when they ask me what herbs they can take to keep from losing their memory, sinking into depression, or getting paralyzed by anxiety.<br /><br />I say, take exercise, exercise, exercise. And I wrote a book on herbs. If I knew of some substance that worked anywhere NEAR as well as the research suggests exercise works for the brain, I would take it. There just isn't anything that comes close.<br /><br /> But then again, exercise is so much fun! The trick is finding the type that you enjoy. It is play, and all the smartest animals play.<br /><br />\\"Only a mobile creature requires a brain.\\" Ratey quotes Rodolfo Llinas--and that is a great line to think about.<br /><br />I most enjoy reviewing the proposed biochemical mechanisms behind the link between exercise and brain health.

B0067TQQI8|4.0|Solid package.  Happy, but wish it had a built in cord to charge my phone with, as its competitor Powergen has.  Having said that, the Powergen 's light button is too easily pressed accidentally in the case.  So not sure which problem I would rather deal with. Probably having to carry and extra cord around.  At least I will know that it was not accidentally discharge already when I go to use it.

0756404738|5.0|Rothfuss didn't miss one beat when writing his 2nd installment if the king killer chronicles. Kvothe keeps the story meaty pulling you back to the inn keep's table to hear more each chapter(with the exception of one which drudged through one problem and ended so sharply that you thought Rothfuss got so sick of the segue he decided to just lop it off at the head, swiftly killing the mood). Overall, well worth the time. I'm eagerly waiting for book 3.

1423107233|5.0|While I enjoy watching the end-result, I also deeply appreciate the hard work that goes into making an animated film. This book gives me a behind-the-scenes all-access pass to do just that. The book beautifully presents artwork, sketches, storyboards and more that are normally secured safely away in the Disney archives vault. The quality of the reproductions is excellent makes it look like they were drawn right in the book by hand. Beyond the visual, the written passages are truly fascinating to read as well. I can't wait to get more of these books in the series!
0143122010|1.0|Hey, Stevie Pinker (I hope I don't sound too rudely 'empathetic' for your  taste),  here's a little  suggestion for the next sabbatical year paid by your Masters: pick up your suitcases or your backpack (oh you old crazy hippie!), leave your books and your lab and get away from campus for a while; hit the roads of real life for a change (no, Stevie, no, just watching the news on TV won't  do!), and take a good look at the (oh, so distant, yes, I know, Stevie, so discouragingly distant) real world out there. You could visit some of your country's prison highlights for a start, maybe you'd even get to exchange some interesting anecdotes with death row mates over tea and biscuits; then get your visas ready for a step into the paradise outside and look around, eyes open wide, mouth a little shut... how about tagging along behind a team of marines on one of their 'tours of Duty'? Not many travel agencies can offer tours as exciting as those: you'll surely get a hell of a kick seeing how this old brave new world of ours is kept so tidy nowadays... Take your time, don't  be shy, mingle with fellow humans and visit some posh museums abroad...may I suggest you visit that cute one in Hiroshima? ... There are so many options! ... After you go back home, I assure you, you will be able to churn out a much better and dignified book than you have this time (though maybe not as funny). In any case, science-fiction does seem to be your forte... And I'm sure the world will be by then an even better place than it was when you cashed in the paycheck for writing the first one! Congratulations in advance. Never let anyone tell you that YOU have DECLINED.

B004LWZW9C|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed Valentine's Day the other holiday themed film Garry Marshall directed. He has a knack for using real life experiences and moments in these holiday films. I was actually late to the party and did not have the pleasure of enjoying this film in the theater but in the comfort of home on New Years Eve with my family. Its amazing how one production could have such a large cast of current top name actors. It was nice to see some fresh faces added to the roster since the Valentine's Day film but good to have some of the familiar faces too.
0307476073|3.0|I'm an experienced hiker, and sometimes I don't filter my water when the spring is high on a mountain and looks protected from animals.  Well this book drives home the point that you should always treat/filter water no matter what, because someone (Cheryl) might have been soaking their ass in it a couple hours before you got there.  In the book, two hiker get sick after drinking from a spring she was in.  They should have used a filter.  That aside, this is an interesting book.  It's was hard for me to root for her because she has done so many destructive things to herself, but  I was reckless in my youth as well.  In fact this book reminds me of the hardships that I had on the AT years ago.  Whatever doesn't kill you, well doesn't kill you, but maybe you learn something for next time.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|At first bought the album just for the &#34;Remix (I Like The)&#34; track but as I listened to it more and more all the songs grew on me. Yes, I could have just bought the single of the track I liked but I was looking to rediscover my love for this group. I am bias since I have been a fangirl since childhood. This being their tenth studio album (pun intended) the overall sound of the group has grown and matured as has the fan base. I do enjoy their songs from the boy band days but I no longer would classify them as &#34;boy band&#34; with this album I now refer to them as a grown men band. It is also refreshing to hear all members of the group each have spotlight moments in different songs, Jonathan Knight really does have a wonderful voice.

B001AKPEKA|5.0|This is a review of the disc, not the movie itself--as for that, if you like the sci-fi action genre and/or X-Men then you'll probably like it, but if not then it might not be your cup of tea.  I was a bit confused when I ordered this DVD because the ad says it's \\"X-Men,\\" but shows a picture of X-Men: First Class, so I wasn't sure which movie would actually be arriving.  It is indeed the original X-Men, which is what I was hoping it would be.  The ad details weren't very informative, so I'll tell you about the copy I received.  It's the single disc, anamorphic wide-screen (aspect ratio 2.35.1), English edition (5.1 surround sound), with subtitles in English and Spanish.  It comes in a hard cardboard case, rather than traditional plastic case--it's a nice one with artwork and a sleeve with the typical original X-Men cover art.  It features interviews with Bryan Singer, Hugh Jackman screen test, still gallery, Animatics, trailers and 10 minutes of extra footage.  It's essentially the same DVD (other than the case) as others offered, but it was much less expensive at the time I purchased it.  All-and-all, I'm quite happy with my purchase!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Having never watched a soap opera, I could only guess about the way a soap would unfold.  Detail by excruciating detail, each soap episode would unfold a minutiae of the overall plot while involving the viewer in the endless drama of the characters' lives.<br /><br />Welcome to Fringe!<br /><br />At this point in the series, I'm heavily invested in the characters - I care deeply about them and I want to know that it turns out all right for each of them.  Nonetheless, this third year continues to put the characters at ever greater risk - and I couldn't keep myself from watching yet another episode!<br /><br />There are a couple or three episodes that this year could have done without.  One in particular seems totally redundant to me . . . and this is my big complaint about the series.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I'm hooked -totally.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|This has been one of the most enjoyable novels I have read in many years, both in terms of the narrative and the various ways in which it is told.  It's hard, in fact, to disentangle the multiple narrative strands from the overarching wheeling structure necessary to tell them, and the book is consequently a very satisfying and engrossing whole.<br /><br />I enjoyed the piecemeal construction of the mystery through the reappraisal of the same events from different perspectives, followed by the formal legalistic elucidation, and then the rounding out via the examination of the interactions of the parties.  That sounds awfully dry - believe me, the book is anything but, as the process of drawing you in is more or less irresistible.

B005U9QVPE|5.0|I remember this movie from when I was a kid.  My guys now love this movie and always want to watch it b/c they LOVE the puppetry involved along with the characters.  Not too scary.  I think it has a better storyline than most of the garbage the kids watch today. The Amazing World of Gumball.... enough said.
B009AMAJPA|4.0|DEAD MAN DOWN is about Victor (Farrell) and Beatrice (Rapace). Victor's a high-ranking enforcer on Alphonse's crime syndicate, and Beatrice is a lonely Spanish lady who still nurses a grudge against the drunk driver that scarred her pretty face up in an auto accident. Both of them nurse revenge fantasies against those who did them wrong, and as the movie develops, those fantasies intertwine as they come close to being made real.<br /><br />The film is boldly and artfully shot, and edited with equally impressive skill. This helps make up for some slow pacing; the film could've been about twenty minutes shorter had it not been so aggressively introspective and even repetitive in some parts (let's just say there's a whole lotta mulling going on). The story's not bad at all as far as these kinds of revenge thrillers go, although it's not trying too hard to be terribly creative, either. The soundtrack and the film's patient reveal of certain secrets (the less you know about the plot going into the film, the better, although it seems like every single review keeps trying to give away vital information that viewers don't learn until something like forty minutes in) keeps the slow-moving plot from feeling too labored, as do a handful of very tightly wound action sequences.<br /><br />There are a few other problems beside the run-time and the unequal balance of drama and thriller (and the film's horrible title). Farrell doesn't seem to do much acting at all in the entire film, opting instead to keep a neutral look of dull surprise on his face for most of the movie. He's supposed to be a man of quietly brooding inner passion, but you'd think maybe once or twice we'd get a shot of him showing some other kind of emotion. Likewise, Beatrice's character is initially driven by rage over her mangled appearance (little kids constantly taunt her, calling her a monster), but the scars on her face are barely noticeable in some shots. If they really wanted her character to make sense, they should've really disfigured her more than they did. As it is, it's quite obvious they wanted viewers to still find her pretty (her scars do little more than highlight her cheekbones and jaw), which makes her part in the story seem pretty contrived at first.<br /><br />Get past those little hang-ups and be prepared to deal with a handful of stretches where characters engage in silent, soulful reflection, and you should have a good time with this bang-em-up.hey should've really disfigured her more than they did.

This is an excellent platform as a prelude to Judy Garland's &#34;Oz.&#34; You learn a lot that carries over and explains some of the Judy Oz. They really did an excellent job on this movie. I'm a tough Oz fan and they won me over.
B002ZG983M|4.0|You know,the great thing about being an independent reviewer here at Amazon is that I don't have to follow the latest edition of the Hollywood Reporter,or be at the next L.A.soiree for the premiere of some movie,or attend the latest film festival in Timbuktu.Instead I may,or may not have heard some movie hype before hand,just like any other person.Well I did not hear squat about Kick-Ass(released Mar/10) except for it being shown at the local theatre where I live.So what a pleasant surprise to view a film that has combined the super hero genre with the human condition and wrapped it all up in a film with a big heart.It is NOT what you might expect,as this is one film that should not be judged by its derivative and simplistic title.<br />The film stars,among others,Aaron Johnson,Christopher Mintz-Plasse,Chloë Grace Moretz,Mark Strong and Nicolas Cage.<br />The story finds an ex policeman who was framed by the local drug lord in New York City.He is back and has been slowly seeking revenge on the king pin who did him wrong,Frank D'Amico.In his preparation,he has brought up his pre teen daughter to be able to handle herself physically and mentally in dangerous circumstances.She knows everything from kung fu to shooting an AK-47,and everything in between.In a parallel plot we have a young high school student who fantasizes about fighting crime.He actually orders a form fitting blue uniform one day and starts his perilous journey,which has more than its share of bumps.When he confronts three bullies beating up on one man he becomes an instant You Tube sensation and his life and new moniker,Kick-Ass,turn upside down in an instant.His girlfriend tells him about some guy who has been hassling her and he goes to his apartment to warn him off.Instead he ends up getting a bad beating,but there is a sudden intervention.It comes from the ex cop and his daughter,who are Big Daddy(dressed like Batman) and Hit Girl respectively.They tell him that they will be around should he ever need his help.<br />D'Amico's son comes up with a plan for his dad,who blames Kick Ass for his problems.He asks him to buy him a tailored costume of his own,and he will assume the name of Red Mist.That way he can befriend Kick Ass and deliver him right to his dad.The plan goes better than expected when Red Mist gets Kick Ass asks to meet with Big Daddy and Hit Girl.When Red Mist enters the room he shoots Hit Girl who falls right out the window.Kick Ass and Big Daddy are taken hostage and paraded on camera,on line,before countless viewers,who will witness their execution.Both are beaten badly and just as the two are to be set on fire Hit Girl enters the scene and starts a one by one campaign of kick-assery.She rescues both,but her father succumbs to burns he suffered.<br />Back home Hit Girl is out for revenge.She and Kick-Ass take the fight directly to D'Amico's office tower and floor.Hit girl is a virtual dynamo and mows down all who oppose her,until one of D'Amico's henchman brings out a bazooka.Just as it looks like she's headed for heavens gate,Kick-Ass appears outside in a hover suit,loaded with two machine guns.He does some housing cleaning and saves Hit Girl.They finally get into D'Amico's office and while Kick-Ass fights Red Mist,Hit Girl takes on the don himself.Kick-Ass ad Red Mist fight to a draw,while Hit Girl is down and out and just about to receive the coup de' gras.Kick-Ass enters with the bazooka originally intended for Hit Girl and blasts D'Amico out the glass window.The film ends as Hit Girl has enrolled at Kick-Ass's school and we listen as D'Amico's son plans revenge.<br />This movie has multiple in jokes with past movies and its' soundtrack at times is very clever.For example,when we first see Hit Girl's fighting abilities the theme song to the old cartoon the Banana Peels,is playing in the background.As I said this film has a ton of heart and the girl's hutzpah,moves and,dare I say,language,are something to behold.She may be around 11,but sheis more like 31 in attitude.Cage plays her loving father and at no time do we not know that.Although I should qualify that by saying when we first see the pair together,it is Cage firing rounds into his daughters chest at close range,so she can get the feel of what a bullet impact feels like.It tends to make you scratch your head and say,\\"wtf?\\",but soon all is revealed.Oh,and she does wear a Kevlar vest at all times(dad taught her well!).<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary,and featurettes on its making and art and the trailer.<br />All in all a VERY pleasant and surprising diversion of a film(I love it when that happens).It is a nice twist and mix of different genres and has great heart.I highly recommend Kick-Ass.And kids....don't try this at home!is more like 31 in attitude.Cage plays her loving father and at no time do we not

B004LWZWGA|4.0|I really like this &#34;Batman&#34; movie in the final installment of the recent trilogy. It is one of those movies where you need to go through the trilogy of movies in order or you will get lost. Christian Bale does a good job but he has a lot of tough competition from other actors who have played Wayne/Batman. I like the classic Batman movies and TV shows. Anne Hathaway was difficult to accept as Catwoman. Too many actresses who had played Catwoman were more exciting. Michelle Pfiefer was great as was Lee Merryweather. Absolutely love Morgan Freeman and his inventions. And since Alfred had to be replaced, Michael Caine was the perfect choice. He is more vocal and strict on Batman though.

They're not people. They're dead! Ain't gotta feel nothing for them cos you know what they do? They kill. These things right here. They're the things that killed Amy, they killed Otis! They're gonna kill all of us unless we do something. Hey, Hershel, man, let me ask you something. Could a living, breathing person, could they walk away from this? Three rounds in the chest! Someone's who's alive, could they just take that? Why is it still coming!  That's its heart, its lungs! WHY'S IT STILL COMING! Yeah, you're right man, that is enough... Enough, risking our lives for a little girl who's GONE! Enough, living next to a barn full of things that are trying to kill us! ENOUGH! Rick, it ain't like it was before! Now if you all wanna live, if you wanna survive, you gotta fight for it, and I'm talking about fight! Right here, right now!\\" -Shane, 2.07 (Pretty Much Dead Already)<br /><br />It is a rallying call to do something about evil in this world.  To not wuss out, to not be an ostrich.<br /><br />If the perpetrators and their descendents are \\"good now\\" ALL better - why are they still coming?
B005DC68NI|5.0|After reading just the first half or so of this book, I realized how awful my formatting was and how easy it would be to change it. On the issue of formatting, this book provides some excellent explanations and a wealth of great resources. A week or so after I got this book, all my self-published Kindle books finally look clean and orderly. It was a sharp learning curve, but I realized that trying to format MS Word was just too cumbersome. Some simple HTML clean up works much better. I am no programmer (English major!), and I could do it. But it doesn't just cover formatting, it goes into the whole history of publishing and the evolution of self-publishing. Fascinating.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I couldn't get enough of this book or this series. I recommend this book completely and is one of my favorite series of all time!
1451648537|5.0|Despite the slim odds of anybody ever seeing this review in the thousands here, I just had to say what a great book this is. Steve Jobs is a fascinating character, but the book is not just about him. It's about his company, his personality, his friendships and affiliations, and his genius that is still changing his world after his death. It doesn't hurt that the book reads like a novel, either! Highly recommended even if you are not an Apple fan. It's not about a brand name, but about a personality that revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I couldn't get enough of this book or this series. I recommend this book completely and is one of my favorite series of all time!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is one of those books you long for when you start a new book. You can't put it down, you connect with the characters and you dread actually finishing it because you never want it to end. The characters are supremely written and that becomes apparent in the first few pages. The story itself is heartwarming, and also realistic. I have been highly recommending this book to everyone!
B009NTNHJU|5.0|Nikki Minaj is fantastic.  She keeps coming out with new stuff under the same Pink Friday logo and re-up reloaded stuff but the new songs on here are the BEST she has put out.  Nikki is creative and has her finger on the pulse on what's hot.  She keeps r and b/rap fresh and her voice is awesome, the beats are dance and borderline hip hop and her lyrics are strange funky yet cool intense and totally genuine according to her true self.  I would have never thought Nikki could pull this off for as long as she has and she is the definition of a true artist, right up there with Prince and madonna.  I love the song Freedom and Va Va Voom, but the re-up is a total package, no skip-overs.  I haven't watched the vidz yet, but cd is a generous offering from Nikki, can't wait 2 see what's next, u go hooker!!!
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The movie is to predictable. As I watched the movie I waited and waited for something to happen that was not predictable. The movie was a bore and over rated. Please don't waste your time.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|I just listened to this after a couple years and forgot this cd has 2 of my fave eagles songs on it.  How Long and Busy Being Fabulous.  I love those 2 songs and that's all I need off this cd.  Eagles are classic, Don Henley rocks, nuff said.

0812992784|5.0|This book adresses one of the most important issues in the world today; the freedom of thought, opinions, and expressions of the same, without having to fear for your life and health through terrorist attacks from people who see as their right to force others into their own way of thought.<br />AND it is extremely well written!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Amazon Prime gives us the chance to see a great show. I didn't think I would be interested in this but I am glad I gave it second look. Very compelling! Great characters. Even some humor at times.<br />If you like a complicated cast of characters, great acting and a look into the &#34;uber rich&#34; of days gone by, don't miss Downton Abbey.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I won't be reading another 'cancer book'. Life has enough of this playing out in front of my eyes without reading it too. But still, even though I kept putting it down, I kept picking back up and wanting to read on.<br /><br />There were times reading this when I was crying from sadness and laughing at the wittiness, both at the same time.<br />Maybe most teens don't speak in the same way Hazel and Gus do - but wasn't that the whole point of the star-crossed lovers. Two people that, due to circumstance, gave up their path and left their old friends, and started another path without compromising who they really are for the sake of what the world says is normal teen behavior and normal teen-speak. Two kids who, due to circumstance, would analyze and philosophize in ways they wouldn't usually. And two people, quite different from others around them, find themselves drawn together. The question occurs, if they didn't have cancer and had been their 'old selves' would they have even liked each other? In hindsight, which life would they choose?<br /><br />These aren't the first tragic star-crossed teen lovers, and they won't be the last (in fiction or real life) but this version of that story was contemporary, real and well written. Was everything accurate? No, but it doesn't matter. The message was clear: that we are fleeting in this life; relationship and friendship means more than how much time we have or than the heroics that the world tells us we need to perform.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Gr 8 graphics and perfect if u luv horses as much as I do. I would definitely recommend it for people wiv young children who like horses as it is simple to use aswell as realistic.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|If you are admin on a facebook fan/ business/ community page then this really is a must if you want to manage the page on a mobile device. The regular facebook app doesn't permit decent page management, other than basic posting, so this fills the gap nicely.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love  this game. I think that it I  amazing because u can defeat characters from the movie and advance to the next level and you can complete mission with gru and his daughter.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I watched a few episodes early on in the second season and fell in love with the series. unfortunately I missed the entire fifth season. I picked up the series at an excellent price for a truly epic series. The final season was incredibly well done and brought the entire tale of Merlin full circle!
B005QYKE2Y|4.0|it was okay but they would have probably died in that building. this movie was pretty good<br />it could have been better
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 8 year old grand daughter plays it very frequently,  Is absorbed in building houses for animals and others.<br />I have not played it, but her friends are also playing it and talk about different levels they have achieved.

B004SYP5WC|5.0|This app has made it very easy to keep track of my monthly expenses. It's very user friendly and super easy to use.
B00E3IZIM0|2.0|When I saw that Guillermo del Toro was creating a giant robot movie, I was all in.  But much like Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch, Pacific Rim is a slick movie that doesn't live up to it's premise.  And like Snyder, del Toro gets sidetracked from telling the story at hand.<br /><br />You see, two pilots are needed to run these giant robots and the pilots must under go a mind meld in order for the robots to work.  Because of the mind meld, we lose 20 minutes of story time learning how the mind meld works and another 15 on our hero selecting a compatible partner.  That's some serious time that could have been spent on monster butt kicking.<br /><br />I actually like the robots and the monsters when they are on-screen.  The CGI is outstanding and blows away anything we've seen so far from the Transformers movies.  The hero isn't anything special but works ok for the movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, way too much time is spent on the female lead who has zero personality.  She talks in this annoying whisper and of course ends up sucking up another 10 minutes of screen time with her backstory.<br /><br />The rest of the characters are right out of Might Morphin Power Rangers including two annoying clowns who serve as comic relief.<br /><br />There is an audience for this movie but most of them saw it in the theater. If you are a hard-core robot fan and somehow managed to miss this in the theaters then by all means, check it out.  Otherwise, give this one a pass.
0143036424|5.0|I love this writer' style, his choice of words and verbal pictures.  The suspense is great.  I have even given up TV to finish and discover the murderer!  I am from NW Colorado and love the Wyoming setting.
140006922X|1.0|I don't know if Amazon will let us link to another site but there's an excellent review and analysis of this book and its author at [...]<br />If you can't go through the link its at Jewish Review of Books, August 11, 2013.  The reviewers name is Allan Nadler.  The conclusion is brilliant:<br /><br />\\"Finally, is Aslan's insistence on the essential \\"Jewishness\\" of both Jesus and his zealous political program not also a way of suggesting that Judaism and Jesus, no less than Islam and Mohammed, are religions and prophets that share a similarly sordid history of political violence; that the messianic peasant-zealot from Nazareth was a man no more literate and no less violent than the prophet Mohammed?\\"
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Enjoyed this movie lots of action, and some witty humor.Like the costumes and the why behind the story.. Good movie for the whole family
B00003CXCQ|5.0|The first full-length animated feature. It out sold every every movie that year COMBINED! A great story, great songs, a -true- classic.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|It is The best metal gear solid collection That I have play really nostalgic you neeeed  to buy it right now
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Amazing fix-it girl Irene arrives looking to become a junior member of the magic council or whatever it is. Along the way she becomes involved with a lame-o plot involving her sister Annie and some intrigue. Fabulous graphics are interspersed with puzzles of varying degrees of difficulty. Some are possible to be solved by a grade-schooler, some are rather fiendish as you first have to figure out what exactly is wanted.<br /><br />If the plotting portion wasn't from some sort of teenage girl's romantic magical fantasy I might have rated this game higher.<br /><br />But try it, you might like it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game, it is so fun and I think that the animals are so cute and I love playing with them.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dexter has provided countless hours of entertainment for my wife and I and this season didn't disappoint.  Dexter always goes right up to where you'd never think they would continue, and then they do. Like when they killed off Rita. Never thought the show would do it and then they did. Bold and wonderful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best running game I've played. It's seems more fun than temple run, subway surfers, etc. This game is also very unique because it allows you to switch worlds that you can play in whether if your in the middle of a run or not. It also has power ups that you won't find in any other game. I recommend this unique awesome game because I enjoy so do my family and friends and I know you like it to.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I liked this game until the new 7.3 update. I have a Kindle Fire and I will go into my game only to be booted out 6-10 seconds later. I am tempted it re-install but do not want to lose my multiple worlds. Hopefully this will be fixed soon... thank you.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game but wish it was easier to gain city points.  You have to spend too much$!!!  Still enjoy the fun it's a free download
030758836X|5.0|Twists and turns that was scary good.  Surprised.  I didn't like the ending but definitely enjoyed the ride.  It was a quick read but not appropriate for young kids or teens.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This is a pretty good app first time I used it, just got my kindle fire HD I love it. Just needs a few more things on it like more stickers, more options to fix your pics but it is cool.
B008VVT51U|5.0|I don't buy a lot of movies...only those I know I'll enjoy viewing over and over and over again.  This is one of those.  Excellent in all categories...cast, script, locations, direction, filming.  A great movie that leaves you feeling good...something the world certainly needs.  And I'll be watching - and enjoying - The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for many years.
B008JFUO36|4.0|This film is a post-modern take on &#34;Mother issues&#34;, masquerading as the sci-fi. Freud had argued that the original sexual object for both sexes in the mother. In this film, our couple receives the orders from Sally, played by Melissa Leo. Sally is their commander and is stationed on a space station that orbits the Earth (or so it seems). Sally is an older woman, a thinly-veiled representation of the mother. The ordeal of Jack (Tom Cruise) is to go through tests orchestrated by Sally and to become a man. He is to become Vika's &#34;rescuer&#34;. Psychoanalysts know that a man can lose all sexual attractiveness for a woman from the moment that he shows some sort of complicity with her mother. Vika's case is complicated by a love triangle, but the essence of the movie is this: Jack had to quit any compliance with the mother (plus mother-in-law, Sally was actually both) in order to become a man and a husband, albeit to another women. I recommend this film.
B0044BIZXU|1.0|the dvd would not play due to wrong region code. tried to send it back but it would cost more to send back then it did to purchase it so we decided to take our loss on this product. not happy about it. we need region code 1 not 2.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I've loved this album since it came out in the 70s. I even love the cover. Every time I hear any of the tracks, I am immediately transported to the person I was in 1974. So much has changed, but not my love of that time, or of Carole's voice.
0307887448|4.0|This was a fun book to read. It's not heavy, or massively thought provoking. It is the geek version of a beach read.<br /><br />A well-researched (or remembered) debut novel from the author. The characters could've used a little more depth and the ending was predictable but I didn't regret reading this.<br /><br />It's set in the future where the entire world is basically a collection of introverts. A current day gamer's paradise- living is done solely online with avatars. Only online money matters, quests are real, and people rarely meet each other in person.<br /><br />A billionaire, brilliant game designer that created this way of life has died and left his fortune in an Easter egg with only a few lines of a clue that no one can seem to figure out. After several years a teenager in school cracks the clue by chance and embarks on a quest to find the fortune before an Easter-egg-hunting corporation company can.<br /><br />It's worth a try. You can tell in the writing that the author truly enjoys what he writes about and I love how that comes through in his story.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|I had read FLYLady in print several years ago.  Many life changes got me off-track.  Picking it up on Kindle meant I didn't have another book added to the clutter.<br /><br />I am figuring out my zones, have got the basic weekly routine down now, and had morning and evening routines already, so just needed a slight boost of enthusiasm.<br /><br />This is a person who understands what it's like to fall behind, and helps you get going, without one iota of judgment.  Love her!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Christopher Eccleston is so underrated as the Doctor, thanks to \\"O.M.G. 10 and 11 are sooooo hotttt111!!!11\\" fangirls.<br /><br />Don't let that sway you. Ignore Pinterest's obsession with 10 and 11. Nine is fantastic, in his words and mine. He's the perfect mix of an angry and bitter person who has lost everything and yet still fulfills his self-given obligation to rid the universes of evil forces. You can clearly see how Rose begins to change that in him and that's what makes him so wonderful as the Doctor.<br /><br />This season is so campy and low-budget compared to the future seasons but you have to watch! It's not like the why-am-I-watching-this True Blood campy-ness, it's honest true ridiculous sci-fi campy. And it's great.<br /><br />This season has everything- Captain Jack Harkness, the Slitheen, Harriet Jones, the Daleks, Cassandra, and \\"Are you my mummy?\\". You absolutely can't go wrong with this box set. It also sets the stage for David Tennant's arrival. . .\\"It's just, someone told me I was going to have a great year.\\"<br /><br />Buy this. Now. You need it. And you know it.

B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Since i was blessed to find this gem about 2/3 weeks ago it has been my go-to game since. IF YOU LIKE PUZZLE/RIDDLES (challenging your noggin') This game will do it for you!!! It's not easy by any means but it's not punishing either. Definitely do-able! I personally got up to level 17 my 1st sit!!! I was sooo proud! You can challenge your friends, your parents, and give the kids a try....they'll eat it up. It's not a boring mind blunder. The first few puzzles they'll definitely have fun with, even if they don't get it! It's a lot of fun and shall i warn, a bit addicting especially if your good and appreciate the puzzles....<br />From your #1 five star friend=)  &raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;Have fun!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My grandchildren love this Temple Run and I must admit so do I.  It is fun for all  Still trying to beat the clock.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|My normal forays into music occur with metal, electronic or progressive rock. I'm far more picky when it comes to Indie music because I find the pretentiousness of the genre as a whole is hard to get over. I stumbled upon Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds' Push the Sky Away when it had been playing at a cafe. The song was Finishing Jubilee Street. I was immediately hooked.<br />Nick Cave has, historically not been the first artist I go to, to get any sort of musical kick, but I admit I was wrong. This album is brilliant, artistic, emotive and meaningful. Cave's ability to mold stories into his spoken poetry is amazing, he is seemingly a limitless supply of creative expression with his words. It was enough to impress me and buy the album a second time - the Limited Edition hard-book version!<br />So, if you have heard one song from the album or if you are beginning with Nick Cave, I think Push the Sky Away is a perfect place to start. A beautiful gem of an album that may go under-appreciated unless given the proper attention it is due.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Great acting. Clever plot lines. I hardly watch any television, especially episodes this long, but I thoroughly enjoy every minute of Sherlock.
0399536108|3.0|I read the e-book twice while on vacation. I'm actually torn on what kind of review to write because if I write I don't completely buy what he's selling, Chris considers me to be a vampire so my opinion is irrelevant to him. That's how he comes across-with a lot of attitude. So I will not criticize what he's done and the life he's created for himself. I just don't know how many people can realistically copy what he's done. That's partially because he leaves out a lot of detail especially about how he survived financially during the lean years.<br /><br />I read books like this to be moved, not just to be entertained. Many reviewers say they are moved but in the end their life hasn't changed so they haven't been moved, they've been entertained. The best parts of this book is the ideas that apply to the widest audience. They are in Chapter 2 which talks about goal setting, Chapter 6 which talks about blogging and writing and working to become an expert, and Chapter 7 which talks about how to create a following for your writing and blogging and area of expertise. I do plan on trying to implement some of his strategies in those areas.<br /><br />The overriding theme is try to make every day an adventure and stay focused and figure out how to make your dreams into reality. But much of the book feels like an introduction to Chris' brand and website. Plus it's poorly organized and written and it jumps from topic to topic. It feels like a collection of blogs. If you want to think outside the box, go elsewhere. If you want to learn about starting an unconventional business that makes you happy and you might get lucky and make money, read Chris' other book The $100 Startup.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This was actually a very good film! It was basically a metaphor for the embeddemit of religion, but, still, very, very good and worth watching! It was worth the money to see it. It was good.
B005C0DHIK|5.0|The only annoying thing is Josh's voice at times.<br /><br />What is going on behind the scenes of the fracking industry is frightening. Air quality, water degradation, etc... Nice expose'. Looking forward to Gasland II. Also want to watch &#34;Truthland&#34; which is the oil industry's response.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This has some cool graphics and neat puzzles. The best thing is that they didn't create a game with just a few puzzles presented over and over...each puzzle was different...<br />On the down side, it had some glitches which got a little frustrating...such as having to click on a hidden item several times in order for it to register...or the opposite...clicking for one item, but another item being found.<br />Other than that, pretty good game!
B00BJW6YW6|4.0|The place this record feels like it's coming from is somewhere along the lines of pop music these days is very sexual, but not very sexy. This record focuses on fixing that problem. To compare it to the sound of another artist would mean bringing up Sade, but I must stress there isn't anything cheesy about this album. As a whole it is a bit samey, but you can't fault them too much for staying true to their concept.
B008I43DYU|1.0|It hasn't been installed on my Kindle. So I don't know what to think of it. When I get it then i'll may know
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Anadarko is an interesting game with a variety of puzzles that need to be solved to win the game. Looking forward to beating it.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|Seems the devs do listen and has fix a lot of the bugs in the game.  I almost didn't try this because the features that people were saying is missing made me not want to give the app a chance.  Lucky did test it and I find it enjoyable.  My only complaint is the air factory logo on the bottom left looks out of place.  I rather seem a smooth all around clean user interface.  The logo should match.  Otherwise it just looks weired but that is small details not really a bug.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I have quite an imagination and find David Baldacci's books feed this.  I very much enjoyed the thriller, and caN't wait to start the next Baldacci book.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Running time approx. 2 hr.  7.1 HD-DTS. This move gives subtle spoofs on Tom Cruises late movie (TOP GUN), and is a (half-baked) twisted modification of the late (2001 Space Odyssey). This movie is both stunning and disappointing at the same time. I think this movie could have been a huge hit, if it was more hardcore, bloody, and had strange creatures in it. Furthermore, the drab, dull and boring love story portrayed in this film did nothing for the movie, accept destroy it. Morgan Freeman is way too powerful of an actor to be in a movie like this. This is why his roll was short lived. Morgan Freeman practically cancelled out Tom Cruise, and seemed out of place in a movie like this. Overall, the cutting edge CGI effects in this movie were stunning! And the sci-fi (futuristic other worldly) panoramic sky, land, and sea scape's were also very stunning and brilliant. There are some dull, dry and boring areas in this movie; however its sheer sophistication will hold your attention. Based on the impact of the high quality production of this movie, I have to give it a solid (5) star rating, even though its really a disappointment in the end. The storyline has numerous holes, and leaves you with more questions than answers...in actuality the movie really doesn't make any sense at all, and will leave you scratching your head. However, for the sake of pure entertainment, its great. This movie has NO similarities to Star Wars, Tron, and Transfromers...at all! But you (WILL) see profound influences from 2001 Space Odyssey...I can promise you that. Those are the facts. Thank you.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I rated 5 star cause is one of the best batman movies ever done. I would suggest anyone these movies
B007NESBK2|5.0|When I attended this concert in August of 2011 at the Pond of Anaheim (Honda Center where some of this concert was recorded), I said at the time that if they make this a concert video, I'm going to buy it.  You see, I had treated my mom to this concert and we've been talking about it every since.  When the concert was over, everyone was just looking at each other because Sade gave us ever hit and the video backgrounds were outstanding.  We all knew that we had experienced something very special.  I generally hate concert videos but this one was a must have from day one.  My only regret is that the background videos shown don't truly reflect the quality of what we all saw in person.  Not sure if that aspect can ever truly be captured.  I would highly recommend this video to any Sade fan.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is the true story of easy company of the 101st Airborne. These guys jumped into Normandy on D-day and were pretty much in battle most of the rest of the war. Not a whole lot of star power here. But the ensemble cast is solid and do a great job showing how these men lived and died. Watch for Donnie Wahlberg( Blue Bloods) as one of the platoon sgts. He is solid and compelling in this role.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|While the fundamental, underlying premise bears some similarity to the X-men, the detailing is so original, it doesn't matter. This was not at all what I expected. It's much more mythological and much creepier. Character development is outstanding and all the details are beautifully and vividly wrought.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|It is hard when you have a screen persona to totally got against that and keep your fan base. Eastwood for most of his career has been that western anti-hero who basically killed everyone who wronged him. In this movie he is a retired killer living with his kids on his farm and doing poorly. He is offered the chance to make some quick money by helping to kill a couple of cowboys who(cut up whores) What follows is not your usual Eastwood. Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman are stellar in supporting roles.
B00EKITVXK|5.0|Tired of reality nonsense during TV summer reruns. Then give Broadchurch a chance. It's a murder mystery but spends about as much time focusing on the devastated community as it does solving the murder. David Tennant and Olivia Coleman have fine chemistry as the 2 polar opposite police detectives and Olivia Coleman should be better known in the US. Two episodes in and I'm hooked!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This movie is awesome. The computer generated apes look so real and it has a very believable plot line. James Franco is great as the doc trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's because of his dad, played by John Lithgow.
0142407542|5.0|I was given this book by a colleague who visited England and found it there. My second graders fell in love with the book at the first read aloud. In fact, we never could find the copy as someone was always reading it and stashing it somewhere. This is our second copy and I am in hope that we can find at least one of them!
B000I5XOW8|5.0|It is sometimes hard for a movie to do justice to a great TV series. This is not the case in this classic thrill ride.

What follows in a credit to the acting and talents of Ford and Jones.
0553296981|5.0|This book made me shed tears. It was a heartbreaking account of a decent girl who loved life, and believed in a better mankind. She represents an era in which the underworld and fear of world war two has consumed Europe. The more i read the more i cried because i knew the bitter end. She is the voice of all the children who died in that horrible war. The saddest yet the best book i have ever read about that hard time and horrible place.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel is vivid and descriptive. The stories intertwine. It does leave me with a lot of unanswered questions, and I wish all of the stories had been resolved. Overall, it was a quick and enjoyable read.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It's all about Tom Cruise as usual. If your a fan of his you will love it. I thought the story line was just ok.
0770437400|5.0|This book is essentially a compendium of short stories, observations and vignettes that -- taken together -- form a deeply disturbing yet ultimately hope-fueled account of a fictional worldwide zombie apocalypse and its aftermath. I found the book itself much more layered and absorbing than this year's action-flick, popcorn-muncher movie version. In fact, in many ways -- except for the fact that both versions contain zombies -- it's hardly even the same tale.<br /><br />The book is filled with sly yet savvy social commentary throughout, and because it's divided into short, essentially first-person accounts it's very easy to put down and pick up. The horror also creeps up on you -- it's presented calmly, in commentary form and after the fact, but if you really stop to think about some of the scenarios being described they're quite horrifying. The only drawback I'd note is that the short-story format lends a unique (and not ineffective) patchwork-quilt effect that makes the concluding wrap-up section feel oddly disjointed. I occasionally found myself flipping back to earlier sections, thinking &#34;who was this character again?&#34; I think this mutes some of the story's impact, but in the end it's still quite a powerful interweaving of human frailty, strength, tenacity, weakness, greed, compassion, corruption, and spirit.
B0014O1ODS|5.0|I first read this novel in 1963 when it was first published, and it brought me to a whole new world of art, impressionism and the Paris art scene from 1840 to 1917. it was a life changing experience for me. Through this book I 'met&#34; Rodin, an incredible sculptor, and was lucky enough to see his work at the Rodin museum in Paris and Philadelphia in my later travels. Although this is a novel because the author has invented the dialogue, the research that went into this book is in depth, accurate and exceptional, and used well in moving the story along. Something recently brought the thought of this novel back to me this year, and I decided to share this with my co-ed book club. Everyone has enjoyed reading it, and also found it well worth the read and a wonderfull learning experience about that period of time and of the arts, and going to art museums was made more interesting. Although Rodin did not treat his women well, this book does get into the soul of the artist, and I highly recommend it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Set in the South when slavery was in place, this books story closes the gap between how we're all the same on the inside, and that the heart must always win.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Slower than book 1 but still excellent. Clash is clearly building to huge events for the third book. Highly recommended
B0083Z614S|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book as a child...after reading the author's &#34;A Little Princess&#34; I felt sure nothing could measure up.  I was wrong.  This story is delightful and charming, and there wasn't a single purely hateful character in the whole book.  I highly recommend this story to anyone of any age.
B0018OFN1S|4.0|This is one of those movies that should go in a time capsule sent into deep space, so that aliens who want to know more about us can get just a glimpse of what we are all about.  It has a diverse cast, the theme of family, and of course, hot fast cars powered by tons of testosterone, including in the women.  I'd say that about sums up our human civilization in a nutshell.  Happy viewing, aliens.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is easy and intuitive to use. If you can operate a pocket calculator, you'll have no problem using this app.  I have had no problems with it running on the Fire HD.  Perfect app for its purpose and a bargain at its price.
B00AOQ8MOQ|3.0|An OK movie.  Glad to check it off my list, but it was a little on the silly side.  Best part was watching the ending.  Like, who saw THAT coming?  Me.  I kinda did.  Because nobody puts Swayze in the corner.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Since I picked out my own present I am happy to say that these screwdrivers meet my expectations for the price.

B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I wish there were more puzzles.  I enjoyed the game at first, but it is the same thing over and over.
B00846REIS|5.0|It's hard not to compare to Fifty Shades, but this series doesn't have the &#34;red room&#34;.  What it does have is a solid story line, plenty of &#34;train wreck&#34; drama and enough raw sexual content to secure at least one X.
B008K8U13K|4.0|Fun game with fun tricks and sound effects! 4 & 5 year olds love it.  Sound effects, vivid colors add a nice touch!
030758836X|3.0|...Yeah, that's what I was saying as I read the last line of this book.  I Just finished reading this book...like literally finished it 2 minutes ago!  And all I can say is, \\"Really?\\"  After sticking with this book through all the twist and turns, waking up in the middle of night just to get through another chapter, to see what happened next, and she(Gillian Flynn) leaves me with \\"I don't have anything to add. I just wanted to make sure I had the last word.\\"  I find myself, thinking \\"Am I being punked?!\\"  and quoting the father in the story \\"Bitchbitchbitchbitch\\"<br /><br />The ending was so ill written and didn't make any sense.  I found myself asking questions like, \\"Why didn't they check where Desi was on the 7/5?  What about all the purchases and cash advances, they had to be in her script and not his, they'd have to have her/him on camera purchasing things,  even if she purchased on-line, she couldn't do cash advance on-line and there would have to be an electronic \\"finger print\\" of when and what computer the purchases were made and he could prove he was at work, etc....just too bazaar the way it ended...not as thought out as the rest of the book.  I hope that she(Flynn) doesn't expect to add a sequel this book, I don't think as a reader there's enough \\"meat\\" in this story nor the characters to carry an entire sequel, as a reader I just need about another two chapters to wrap this thing up and Im good.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Awesome  game yeah I guess it wasn't until the dead free hung up on the dead free action and Rancho and Rancho and Rancho and Rancho and Rancho and Rancho and Rancho and Rancho and Rancho and Rancho and the same thing with good game I have adult life and

B008JFUO4U|5.0|I managed to finally view this film On Demand one evening through my busy work schedule, I was looking forward to it because most of my friends gave it positive reviews. This film is absolutely beautiful, the films backdrops and settings are gorgeous, the plot (while kind of predictable halfway through) seems quite original to me even though many critics have panned it for being derivative of other science fiction works. The musical score is absolutely brilliant, great blend of bombastic brass sections and electronics (M83 is to thank for that). I highly recommend this film to science fiction fanatics and just movie goers who are interested in action films, it's quite an energetic ride and as always, Tom Cruise delivers a very good performance and so does the remainder of the supporting cast, especially Morgan Freeman, whose character is quite an interesting one. Enjoy.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Unless you have some sub woofers in your car this album blows the tracks are not easy listening at least have some nice beats for the ride but nathin here.
B001QFZADA|2.0|The Concept of five love languages is very interesting. It teaches you what your 5 love languages are and it also teaches you how to interpret the love languages of your significant other your friends and your family.<br /><br />If you take the test on Gary Chapmans website it will give you almost all the information that you need to understand the five love languages. I think Mr. Chapman had a minimum number of words that he had to create in order to write this book. It is clear that the book is just jammed full of insignificant information.<br /><br />My advice take the test, read the description of the love languages and don't pay good money for this book
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Super addictive and fun. I go a few of my friends playing as well. I also downloaded doodle devil and farm. Equally adictive
1400049628|5.0|So I love this book. I take it every where I go and every chance I get to open it I am nose deep in it!
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Really a great app. All of the guns look very realistic and sound great as well. I suggest this to anyone looking to learn about WW 2.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|As indicated in my review on Season 2, this is an excellent Star Trek tv series.  In my opinion, of them, it's only 2nd to Star Trek: TNG.  If you missed it, watch it!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I love Criminal Minds, and this season more than lived up to my expectations. The package was in great condition, as it should be, considering it was new. I was very happy with this purchase, and would recommend it to anyone.
B00B7H3OFI|3.0|Was hoping for \\"funk\\" like, 70s style jams, its more of a smooth jazz. Once you get past that it's ok.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I have enjoyed this game so far.  I have had no trouble and have had some challenging levels also.  I recommend this game to any who like bubble games.
B005R32L66|1.0|I paid 18$ and it still does not work<br />I thought this was supposed to be so easy! I will continue to wait to see if I can ever get it up and running.
B00821OX98|5.0|I love being able to watch the whole season. I would recommend watching from the beginning. I am now watching season 2 to get caught up. I hope season 3 will be online soon for free.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I was half expecting to be disappointed. The picture doesn't do the G13 justice. You can store multiple profiles (keymaps), and because it simulates key strokes, it can be used on even old games that use a keyboard to play, and you can even customize the color theme (the keys and display light up). In the picture of the product, it shows a black and white display, but it's color, and several very handy apps are available to use (free), such as a stopwatch, countdown timer, RSS feed reader, POP3 email retrieval, CPU usage, and others. If you are thinking about getting it, stop thinking and do it!!! =)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like the scalable font size and navigation. This is so much better than the old fashioned book. Kindle purchasing site is very easy to use too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love being able to have and race my own horse. I recommend this game. no clean up involved! and its free!
B00D6QUJ6U|2.0|I love this Bee Gees concert, I consider it their crowning glory.  I was excited to find this in Blu Ray at last.  Eagle Rock should be ashamed of the conversion they did on this concert.<br />THE BAD:  Unfortunately the picture is actually worse than my standard DVD copy.  Converting to 16:9 just makes it cropped and grainier.  The best picture I can get is on the original standard DVD played at 4:3 ratio.  The color is much more natural on the standard DVD as well.  Compare the two directly and I find the standard DVD has a much richer color than the BR copy.  The Blu Ray has a washed out look to it.<br />THE GOOD:  The sound on the Blu Ray is much superior and richer than on the standard DVD.<br />Overall it was not worth upgrading to the BLU RAY for picture quality...... but it may be worth it for the better soundtrack.  I wish I could watch the standard DVD and listen to the Blu Ray. LOL<br /><br />55\\" Samsung LCD w/ Yamaha digital 7.1 receiver and speakers.
1781162646|5.0|I loved this book.  It's been a while since I've read one of his books in this genre and I could have kept reading and reading.  I hope he writes more like this.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Easy to learn. Game play is a bit slow though.  Increased energy regeneration would be helpful and could impact my long-term gameplay.
1400062756|5.0|Easy to understand, easy to apply, extremely insightful. I've shared Mindset with my family and friends and they all love it as well.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I LOVE Video Games and I LOVE Disney, This movie combines the best of both worlds!! Now if only they include more characters from other well love/known video games in the sequel with the already featured ones in the first film... or give the already featured ones (in the first film) more screen-time or more critical rolls in the next film.

B009DCOU9S|5.0|good graphics and nice storyline with many different puzzles to figure out to include finding hidden objects and matching.  provides many hours of playing.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|Best dark comedy about the cold war.So glad I was informed about the plan to sap and impurify all my precious bodily fluids. Just think , Mandake, they put fluorides in children's ice cream.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just finished rereading this book because the series was so good I blasted through it in a week. I decided to take my time on a second reading to make sure I didn't miss anything. I think this book is the best in the trilogy with a mix of drama and action. The plot thickens, we get to know characters deeper and the bigger picture becomes more clear. Loved it.
B008JFUNYG|1.0|Evil Dead original is a classic, Evil Dead 2 is a must see, Army of Darkness is worth seeing, Evil Dead remake sucks! Evil Dead remake is all gore and a confusing story. The group who went to the cabin had no idea what's going on, even after the one girl gets possessed they still were not convince. Evil Dead 1,2,3 had a story that a person can understand, this movie story was going one way then another way and nowhere. Then they had this one girl who was just in the movie for no reason, she didn't say anything for a long while and she cuts her arm off. The one girl gets possessed then dies and she's ok to fight off the other demons. I'll say this the movie did had some good gore, but I still couldn't get into it, it's time for Bruce and San too retire from horror.
0596805527|4.0|As a beginner with JavaScript, I couldn't believe how good this book is.  It has great examples and is very well written.
B000TWUTZ0|5.0|Great read on a rainy day! This book along with Pride & Prejudice and Persuasion are Austen 's greatest accomplishments!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Action packed new instalment is just wow! It's provides more insight into the past of Christian and the influence his family has ha don him. Elena is a mor frequent visitor in this book but realistically the relationship between Ana and Christian is solid. I love the constant fight for affections on both parts but the underlying relationship and love demonstrated is amazingly well developed. Love it!
B0036R92V2|5.0|Lots of shooting and body count if you like that sort of western, I darn sure do. Franco Nero kills 98 bad guys himself with his never-runs-out-of-ammo machine gun and pistols. Again, this movie is bloody but isn't that what you wanted see?<br /><br />Keep in mind that even though this version is Blu-ray, you're still watching the old unrestored original film, not sure what benefits this version versus non Blu-ray brings to the viewing quality.<br /><br />Arrived quickly and undamaged.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Te conclusion to this trilogy is just.... AMAZING!!!!! The author must be commended on their ability to bring both action and drama in this conclusion. Loved the future view of the story with Ana and Christian, but my ultimate favourite is the small portion of story told from Christians view. WOW and can't recommend this highly enough!
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Fantastic collection of ZZ tops work.  The free mp3 download option makes this an even better value.  It is truly great to be able to listen to my favorite band and I can keep the disks in the original packaging.  A great deal and fantastic product.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Holy moley! I love this book. The strength shown by Christian is inspiring and the innocence of Anastasia is portrayed delicately. The inside thoughts shown by Ana are typical responses to situations that arise. Credit must go to the author who has found a way to gently introduce a typical social voodoo topic. The research undertaken is evident and the written prose is fluent and well rounded.
1439153663|5.0|What a marvelous book! Taking a totally opposite view of a white indentured (mostly) child vs the more traditional role of the black slave in the Old South, Grissom writes of the lives and souls of all those on the plantation. The story is full of pathos, pain, and spirituality, yet is a page-turner from start to finish.
B00B9366VO|4.0|Dave Grohl being Dave Grohl.<br />Interesting look at Sound City Studios and the records recorded there. Be warned though that the last 1/4 of the movie drags a little.
B000K3HTRY|4.0|I liked the movie.  I saw the first half on the Sundance channel and decided to buy it on here.  Weird parallels between this movie and fifty shades of gray though...I mean, his name is Mr. Gray in the movie...Besides strange parallels between this movie and whatnot, it was an enjoyable movie. ^-^
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love it. I use it for everything. I would say buy it(: its a grate way to pass time when I'm in the car(:-
0316017930|5.0|During a discussion during a recent checkup, my doctor recommended I read this book.  It gave me a totally new way of looking at life and success.  I now understand more clearly why some people seem &#34;luckier&#34; than others in their lives outcomes.  Very eye opening.  The Author is fantastic, and I love the way he closed with his personal story.  I will read more from Gladwell!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Like little brain teasers like this because I love puzzles. Just wish more levels were available. Tried similar games with more levels that just didn't measure up.
B005MMZ63C|4.0|Still not sure why this is considered the best movie/masterwork ever made.  I respect Orson Welles wrote screenplay, directed and starred in this classic, but frankly it was pretty boring by today's standards.  Enjoyed the black & white cinematography, and it was pretty cool Welles cast two newbie actors who went on to be big stars; Agnes Moorehead and Joseph Cotton.  The message of the movie, Rosebud, is what I liked most.
0393338398|1.0|Watched the movie and loved it. Have not been watching baseball for a while, so I thought the guys behind the Moneyball strategy were genius. Started reading the book. Saw a lot of names that I don't really remember seeing on ESPN, so I looked them up. Wow, the A's really signed some horrible players that did not last long in the league, thanks to the Moneyball strategy. Like others said, the A's were successful because of their other future big name, expensive players, not the stray dogs they found on the side of the road. As the book went on, it got more depressing, and looking at the stats today, honestly, on-base percentage is nothing revolutionary. This is one of those books for numbers geeks that think they matter more than they really do. I dropped this book very early.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome , classy , and fresh. Love the show. Very addictive.  Cast is very integrated and their chemistry is great. Writer are witty and story keeps you intrigued keeps you wanting more.
B007N85POS|5.0|It's free angry birds. IF you like the game then get it. If you are not a fan of the game this version won't change that.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|A sci-fi movie that transcends the genera. A truly original spin on allegory that lives the viewer contemplating what/who should be deemed as important in society.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It is customizable. The snooze function is nice. With previous alarm apps the snooze function was not effective. With this app the alarm makes sure one wakes up.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|GOOD SIZE CORD FOR MULTIPLE PURPOSES!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interesting at first.  Very challenging as game went on.  I enjoyed the search for tools and the challenge that came with trying to figure out what and how to use them.
B00005O438|5.0|Love this movie. Saw it as a kid n still love it as an adult... Got it from amazon and no problems.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I'm a huge fan of horror movies, and I can honestly say that this is the best one I've seen in quite a while! While the beginning may seem a bit cliche, it gets better.  Storyline is not too deep, but I liked that---just some good ole creepy scares!
0142410314|5.0|One of the best books ever written for children. It is good, old-fashioned, fun, magic and fantasy and children will be swept up in the story of Charlie and the other weird and wonderful characters.
0142410314|5.0|Dahl's delightful story about the five lucky children who found the highly-prized Golden Tickets inside his candy bars has captured the imagination of kids of all ages since 1964. The thin, only child of very poor parents, Charlie Bucket is the gentle darling of his family, which includes four invalid grandparents. It's bad enough to be nearly starving all the time, but he has to pass by Willy Wonka's world-famous candy factory going to and from school! Suddenly the nation--as well as the world of kid-dom--is swept by Wonka mania in a frenzy to locate five golden tickets, which will permit the lucky finders to a private tour Inside the mysterious factory behind the locked gates--not to mention a lifetime supply of candy. Well, if anyone deserves to be included among the Fortunate Five it is surely unassuming Charlie.<br /><br />Owner of the amazing confectionary of sweets curious Willie Wonka has many marvels to share--not to mention his own unique method of child therapy, which he casually works on the other bratty kids who present the lucky tickets. Each child may be accompanied by an adult so Charlie picks spry and peppery Grandpa Joe to be his companion on the tour of marvels. What wonders await them with the tiny Oompa Loompas as obliging, scurrying workers? What traps and pitfalls lurk for the unwary or the greedy? And can the owner himself be trusted to keep his word to the naïve winners? Although different from the wonderful movie version, this book is the original literary source of the dream of the Golden Ticket. Child or adult--there is no limit to indulging your imagination in the sweet riches in these pages!
0451532082|4.0|Younger readers may find it hard to read an 'old-fashioned' story such as this. It doesn't move with the hype and drama of some more modern tales. But that is the point. Children should learn to read all different types of literature, and many of the characteristics of the characters are still relevant today.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|I was initially reluctant to go see this movie seeing the director was responsible for what I consider one of the worst movies ever but the trailers were too much so I ended up at the imax theater to watch this movie.  Boy was I surprised by this one.  If you love scifi you have to see this movie.  Well done on all accounts it has displaced Star Trek as my favorite movie so far this year.
B0096HFOZO|4.0|I liked the book and I wanted to be nice.<br />The Twits were silly and mean.<br />I have one question and one question only,<br />Who would put the word gun in a story along with a pic of it?

B0083B3KOQ|1.0|Amazon rip me off<br />kindle Fire sucks. Wish I had gotten  something else,even a I Pad would do better. . Paid for an app that  does not work @ all
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Yeah, it's a complete rip-off of Mystery Manor, but you know what?  I don't care!  It's a beautiful game that seems to have a bit more &quot;polish&quot; than MM with the same mechanics and a more-interesting story.  Although they could have held off release until the &quot;Social Interaction&quot; part was ready...  4/5
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|We will watch it tonight. Both hoping it will be great. Thanks for asking. You can check back and ask again if you wish to do so.......We watched it, mesmerized. Have a hand to hold while it unfolds. No wonder it won the academy award for best film, etc. Terrific and scary.
B00CPTUN5G|2.0|Well, I'll give Hasbro credit for at least trying something different. but lets face it, this was, in baseball terms, a swing and a miss.<br />The look of the film is ok (Anorexia is Magic nowwithstanding), the music does sound good. But that's about all the good stuff it had going for it.<br />The story is too easy to follow (You can guess whats going to happen and be right 99% of the time.), most of the jokes are stuff you heard before, and some elements can get left out of this and you wouldn't miss them.<br />I guess if you Must have everything with MLP:FIM attached to it, go get it. For everyone else, rent it first and see if its your thing.<br />/Oh and if your weren't a fan of the show before, there's nothing here as far as i can tell that'll make you wanna dive in. Go in the episodes first.
1476712042|4.0|Was very hesitant at first, however I picked up this book at a duty free store at the airport. Very addictive.Thank goodnes I am on break. Very interesting story line. Few but great characters, just dropped walking disaster in my cart! Lol highly recommended

6304779607|5.0|Good service, great shipping, and excellent condition. I was highly satisfied and very impressed. I would definitely recommend buying from this company. The one thing that I wish they would have said was that the DVD case was slightly different than standard.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|A very immersive...<br />WARNING: Hours of your day will slip by without notice of the outside world....<br />Do not read this book, while attending to anything important....<br />Time will move on WITHOUT YOU.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I NEVER KNEW THAT I WOULD EVER FINISH THE WHOLE SAGA! I usually don't read often especially not in the summer. When I picked up the first book I was l like Damn this book is great wow!!!!!!!!!! And for the first time I feel proud of me for reading this book#!!!!!!!!!! Hope u will be encouraged to read this book too!!!!!!!!!!! ·!·
B004H4XJW6|2.0|The second disc was a waste of time and my money . When I had viewed it and realizing it was just short films . I am disappointed .
B00EKGXA84|5.0|This has always been a lifelong favorite of mine. The cast includes a sinister Boris Karloff. But, did you know that Boris Karloff played not only a sinister doctor, but also was made up by Jack Pierce as the Frankenstein Monster! That footage of Karloff as the Monster, was actually filmed yet removed prior to release! The scene took place in an office setting with the Monster trying to operate a typewriter. This film fan's dream, is to see this Technicolor footage placed in the supplementary section of the DVD release,at the very least. Hopefully the powers that control the wonderful films of Sam Goldwyn, will give us all that cinematic gift.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This is all what I was specting since I pre ordered it. It came with 10 items: 8 games - 2 movies. It basicly comes with the whole franchise but mgs rising and portable ops. If you want to know about this amazing game you better buy this now!. totla worth every penny
B000JMKQX0|5.0|omg - I literally had to take breaks from reading this because of how well-written it was.. my dreams were filled w/non-stop action thanks to this book.  Everything from beginning to end was just as creative as can be imagined... with great research into making it &#34;realistic&#34; by everyday standards.. if there is such a standard for this.  GREAT read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show, but my boyfriend thought it was kind of boring. However, as the second season went on we both got more and more into it, and the show really starts to move at a faster pace. On to season 3!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|no complaints whatsoever - liked the switch in character perspectives - continual character and storyline development -IN LOVE with this series... and don't know how to treat the incoming withdrawals once this ends...
B009AMANBA|4.0|The Speilberg lighting did not sow well with my DVD player.  The fault is probably with my player not being light enough wile the lighting is effective in carying the mood of the fillm.  Don't try to view in other than a dark or dimly lit room.
B003B02O0U|5.0|Such an exciting read.  I've never watched the movie, but now I must see it.<br /><br />The story is a testament to the adage \\"small but incredible\\".  The package may be small, but it could be a bomb inside.  Who'd have thought that a brief written by one gorgeous law student would be the downfall of many powerful men?<br /><br />Grisham did a good job on playing out the whole story.  Nothing was missed and cut; I didn't have unanswered questions. This is one of his best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome I love the updated version of Subway Surfers. As a result of my experience everyone should get this app.
1592402038|4.0|This is my second attempt reading this book, and it went well. I found the writing style to be very flowing, with lots of adverbs, adjectives, nouns, and verbs. Even though this is not the book to use for dry grammar classes, it can be a great read for students of all ages and levels. I sure enjoyed the author's writing style and vocabulary, which is very refreshing.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It works for attaching the Kindle to the Mac.  Haven't tried to download pictures or music yet.  That would be the true test
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I love SIFI and SG Atlantis was a good series.  A second evolution of the series would be great with new computer graphics technology applyed.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|It always freezes and turns off and buffers it sucks I would give it zero stars if I could<br />It can be good too I guess.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly was one of the very best SIFI series ever and I am sorry it was canceled before the viewing audience became fully aware of it.  I sincerely wish the series could be generated again with good writers and cast.  By the time the potential audience was becoming aware of it, the series ended.  Now,  with tremendous viewing audience knowledge of the series, like the original Star Trek series,  the fan base is there.
034580404X|3.0|I should have researched these books before I purchased them. They are very X rated and I would not buy them again.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a fast paced game. Good graphics . I like the storyline.  This is not your standard hidden object game. Good job.
0679731725|5.0|I recommend this for more advanced readers. I had to read this for my AP Lit class and a lot of people hated it. I, however, greatly appreciated the tragic yet beautiful tale of this butler. I finished it in a single afternoon. Gripping.
0440244412|5.0|This series was probably written for younger readers but I'm a grandmother and I loved the entire series.  I have the series as e-books - bought the paperback books to give my granddaughter and she loves them as much as me.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I couldn't put this book aside and shed some tears reading it. Unlike others I don't think it makes it sound like it's not worth living beinging in a wheelchair! It sure makes you think about it and realise that for some it might not be worth living! Who are we to judge? I think it's a great book and surprisingly well researched!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Neat twist on an old story. It was great to see the bad guy die. Where are the Giant's wives; how do they make more giants? Or are these eternal giants who just appeared and stayed the same age and numbers? The special effects were great. The &#34;happily ever after&#34; romance with the princess and the farm boy.was nice.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|You have to wait normal time for things to complete but its worth it! its fun and has good graphics and close up interaction with different horses.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Good action and special effects. Those weapons were unbelievably advanced for the era this movie was set in. I wish that they made semi-automatic self-loading cross bows in these high tech modern times, but such an instrument would be quite large, complicated and require a huge power source. But that's just me. Otherwise the action and plot were still very good. Gretel is hot.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I love this app.  I also have it on my cell phone.  I like being able to see what's operating in the background.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Super fun and crazy addictive! Everything I love about Uno... I wish I never ran out of game tokens!  Great time killer
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Mindless entertainment.  If there are other things to rent then rent them before spending the movie to view this movie.  Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman was a better vampire slaying movie.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Stuck on 5th fl no hint button. Now what? Do I on install it? go to someone else for help? I hate not knowing.
0606257616|5.0|I'll have to admit there isn't much...if anything Stephen King has written that I didn't like.  His ability to make you feel you are experiencing what his characters are going through is a real talent.  If you want to read the best horror/terror book ever written read King's, &#34;IT.&#34;  You won't be disappointed nor will you sleep peacefully either.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|It was a great story. I spent some time working in Karachi, Pakistan and was able to visit India.  I watched the film twice and will probably watch it again.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Entertaining.  Good special effects.  The story certainly took a lot of liberties with &#34;Jack and the Beanstalk&#34; but I guess it had to, to make it into a feature length movie.
B00B8M4IMK|3.0|I can't review this product, as I have not been able to use it yet, unless I transfer my charging cables from home to the car. The product does not come with any cables only the power plug.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Keeps you guessing.  Well written.  Certainly not an analytical read.  Read it on a cruise.  It was a quick read. Recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The only thing that works well with chromecast is youtube and netflix. casting tabs is terrible, extremely glitchy and slow. You also cant play videos through chrome and cast them to your t.v the quality is terrible and rarely works without freezing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Read the trilogy.  Got really involved with the characters.  The sex becomes secondary and very repetitive .  Worthwhile read.  Nothing like the publicity it received.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|In order to set up your kindle app you have to have an amazon app, which I do. But Amazon mobile/marketplace won't  recognize my Amazon password and there's no \\"report a problem\\" option.<br /><br />And it takes my phone way longer to open IMDB now! (which had problems 're-downloading')
B008JFUO36|3.0|For the first 40 minutes or so it was sort of dole,and plain it starts off tom cruise telling that there was an alien invasion that tried to take over the earth,and the humans won.Then as always something comes falling from the sky then it gets interesting be the lest.things start to fall into place and the truth what really happened long ago is not what he thought or told.There are some twist in the film and some surprises.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Too cluttered, video is much smaller and the app stops working every couple of days. Bring back the old version!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love the classic game... I even remember the first time learning to play as a kid... This is way better but love the memory! Great new look and tons fun with online friends or complete strangers.. I have only had the game 3 days and played for the first time 7 hours ago and I am hooked!
B00C0UHGLO|4.0|Good game. A different sort of marble game that challenges without being overwhelming. Functions well. Music OK. Graphics good. When you are bored with words and arcades, a good choice.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautifully cast, designed, and written.  Sometimes the plot lines are predictable, but I don't mind because I find the world of Downton Abbey so completely absorbing.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|I usually get bored and delete these types of jrpg s soon after the install but I'm really loving this one.  It just seems more fresh and the maps are easy to navigate. Ive been playing for 2 hours straight since install and am enjoying it a lot. A very good $2 game no glitches or issues at all on kindle fire.
B00003CXGG|5.0|This had Aaliyah in it and this is what made Romeo Must Die Mesmerizing. This Movie was all about a &#34;ride or die chick&#34; and I must say &#34;if first you don't success pick your self up and try again&#34;. I be your romeo if I had to die. &#34;One In A Million, well,<br />Oh Boy!! One for the books.....
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A really synchronistic and accurate finding. I needed some practice besides all this how-reallity-works theory. Just what I needed. Thanks, Pam!
B005OK721G|5.0|This is a movie to watch back to back and one more for the road. Never have I seen a story of  this magnitude and for once I didn't guess the ending. And of course Zoe Saldana is  Angel of Mine. Yeah!!!
B00B9LNK5G|5.0|He's a comedian. Many of the songs are laugh out loud funny. That combined with the voice like warm honey and a cleverly pared down music that possibly relies too heavily on spacey synthesized interludes to provide a comfy couch for the lyrics is a fresh and instantly lovable package from start to finish. Plus, Sinead O'connor loves him so much that she offers herself as a backing vocalist. The whole thing is odd and crazy good. Buy it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I thought long and hard about giving this book a 4 vs a 5. I decided on a 5 because it is just great story telling. But usually I save 5s for a book that changes me in some way. I have not discussed this book yet with my book club but I think I need to do some more thinking about why all of the characters were in this book. While each character's story was interesting on its own, I found the connections a little too weak. For example, did we really need Roshni? The answer is probably yes, but why? I hope for some good discussion in the book club.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think dragonvale should make it easier getting rare dragons and bring back the spinner in the race track also show how to get rare dragons when you look at them
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love Kindle...my wife bought me one for x-mas a couple of years ago and it re-introduced me to reading novels, so when I got a Tablet for her it was a no-brainer to add the Kindle for Android app. It's great, just as I expected.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|No excessive push to spend real money. Wait times are not excessive. I would have given 5 stars, but the enigmatic seed mission killed that. At 10,000 sand dollars, 6,000 algae, and 3 hours to grow, the player should DEFINITELY get a rare plant, not maybe. It should not be 1 in 10 or 12 like the mystery seed, especially for a mission.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome!!! a good seed to use is the seed Juan just a good starting tip from a pro like mwa.
B002WN8IQQ|5.0|Had this in DVD and decided to upgrade to Blu Ray because of the soundtrack.  I listen through Pioneer<br />DIR SE 800C wireless Dolby Digital 5.1 headphones.  This allows me to take advantage of the excellent soundtrack and great T Bone Burnett musical arrangements.
B008OOYALE|5.0|totally addicted..great atmosphere..great players. Will be playing for quite a while. Love the ability to make your island unique and the interaction with the other players.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I am really enjoying the TED Talks.<br />Some of the classic talks are the best.<br />A high speed connection is best for viewing and downloading the videos.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was enjoying this game until two days ago when I had to download the updated version.  Now I cannot get into my account.  It took me weeks and real cash to get to the level I am at now and I will not uninstall/download this game again.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|This is a great app that does exactly what I need it to do so 5 star. I'm a excellent singer and my voice sounds great on here it sounds just like me.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This was awesome! I didn't like level 2 but I did level 1 and 3 combined and lost a lot of inches and felt stronger. This DVD made abs and my butt look great! I did Atkins diet with it and no added cardio.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|An explosive, action packed film with a great cast surrounded with humor.<br />It starts off a little slow in the beginning but draws you into the action rather quickly after that.<br />I found it to be very entertaining, it was well worth the rental and I will probably purchase it in the near future.<br /><br />5 Stars
1476734941|5.0|Easy good results, no difficulty in fasting.  Very easy no stress. Both my husband and I, are very pleased, with the plan and it fits into our life style.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Perfect for a party. Looks nice in a pretty glass. Will not fit in small glasses. I like the globe in a glass pitcher of water. If you drop a frozen one it will break. I have the big silicon on for cubes.
B001EBYMB2|5.0|This movie is just grand, comedic yet an action flick for those who enjoy any war movie, be it anti-war or pro-war.
1594744475|4.0|I have to give it five stars because I've never created bento boxes before. This has opened a entirely new culinary creative avenue for me.  The book is beyond basic. I am talking pre-teen to teenager basic, but since I had no previous knowledge I found it so useful from the ground up.  This book is something that you can easily reference, and practice with for a few months. It is by no means a build upon technique book. This is meant as showing you the very basic skills needed to make very simple bento boxes.<br /><br />Where you choose to go from there is up to you.<br /><br />I would have liked to see more instruction in this book and more products geared for the American population. (I have looked far and wide and cannot find anything that will double as fish paste or any palatable fish paste for that matter). The resources listed in the book are lacking at best and provide minimal if any help finding tools, supplies, or products.<br /><br />The book sparked my interest and held it. Provided me with basic training that was easily followed for the most part and fun.<br /><br />If you are starting out. Good book. If you already know what you are doing, I can't see how this book could provide you with any knew information.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a pretty nice looking puzzler that challenges your skills of exploration to move on. I would suggest this game to anyone who wants a nice challenge for once.
B00EBBQXZ0|4.0|Wow! I found things about Scarface that I never knew before. I am familiar with Scarface but after reading this, I feel like I know it like the back of my hand! I especially liked the background information on the creation of Scarface, as the modern day movie we know. I also found it interesting to hear what some celebrities had for commentary about the movie, as well. A good read for any Scarface buff!  -Dallas Adams
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I like the characters and the family.  I enjoyed the small town effects.  And the abusive husband, he was a psycho!  It chilled me to be reminded that there are women who actually endure this kind of treatment.  The book needs much better proof reading, but I would recommend it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Stellar read and lots of fun practicing the experiments. Bonus, they work!  I now use some of the excercises on a daily basis.  I cracked up when I said \\"Right, show me the money, I want to find some money on the ground.\\"  Two hours later watching the ocean, my daughter said \\"Hey mum, look, there are some gold coins in the sand.\\"  sure enough there was. lol.
B00338QENI|4.0|I found this story very interesting and really liked learning about it. It dragged a little to me in a few places, but was still overall a very good book.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I have had a lot of fun playing this game .Good game. This game is fun for all ages to play from the youngest to the oldest.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|It was okay, but I was just sitting here trying to remember the details... Didn't really stick with me, but was definitely a good, easy read. As a parent, some of it definitely had me challenging my own beliefs.
B0037BB00I|5.0|Adele has the voice of an angry, bitter, broken-hearted angel. I guess, really, on 19, she sings about the pre-broken heartedness. but let's face it. We all knew it was coming.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|enjoying the variety of locations and puzzles.  some environments seem much harder than others.  like the developing mystery.<br />looking forward to updates!
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|This album feels like a soundtrack - but you get to write the movie yourself. It's pretty dang fantastic if you have some mindless work to do.
081297381X|5.0|Brilliant book!  A little obtusely written, however.  Witty, not dry.  Very glad I read this book.  Taleb does not like normal distributions!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This story grabbed me from the start. Tragic, but woven through with a dark and poignant humor. Knowing it could only end with Hazel's death, it's a celebration of her love of life.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|A very handy keyring knife sharpener.  Don't let the small size fool you:  a few swipes will sharpen blades to razor sharpness.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun and I play it with my brother all the time! Who new an eight bit blocky world would be so fun!
B006FE83UE|5.0|Fantastic condition!!  Another one that seeing repeatedly is never enough.  Extras for 50th Anniversary are great and unexpected!  Recommend it for all to see.
B000MV8AE0|3.0|I can't even go as high as four stars. This is about the movie not Beethoven's music as there isn't anyone who can rate it under a ten! It is simply the top of the classical rung. I gave it a three due to the fowl words used in the movie. There just wasn't that kind of cussing used back then. It is just a CHEAP Unhollywood way to ruin a possibly good movie from the get go. I cannot for the life of me understand how adding disgusting cuss words to any movie will somehow make it better let alone even worth sitting through. I owned (past tense) this one but after listening and watching it closely, I cut it up and tossed it. It grated on my nerves as nothing else had in a long time. I hated the nephew, I could not stand Anna (total fiction) but Harris was terrific as usual. So the three stars go to him alone. NO ONE ELSE! Forget this and move on.
0060594896|5.0|I have only read this book half way because I am taking my time to implement the suggestions, i.e. I'm using it like a workbook.  But I absolutely love how it  teaches you to focus on your goals. I suggest to give it to your college bound child to read, or an adult who is embarking on a career change, etc.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This can be a challenge at times but good for brain activity. Hoping it keeps the pace all the way to the end!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The mini games are not the best but it's some challenging can't complain because it was free the best thing about this game is that it's a great way to pass the time and if you ever played this game before on any other device it's basically the same pretty cool no complainants
B006Z00R1Q|4.0|Did not see that ending coming. Subtle spookiness leading up to a horrifying finish. This is one I would not want to watch at night alone.
B009PMB3CI|5.0|You get to dress the puppy up in different outfits and accessories. You earn the accessories by getting twenty stars and you get to dance with the puppy, take a bath with the puppy and bounce on the trampoline. You earn the stars by taking care of puppy. This is a good game for kids.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I can't believe that this is a free game. Watch out though it can be a serious time killer. Check it out!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun game like Temple Run but there are more obstacles and you get to smack the other minions trying to get the prize. This is a hard game.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Great non verbal humor, plus both my daughter and my 2 year old grand daughter love it - she keeps asking for sheep, sheep..
B00992CF6W|4.0|I've been waiting patiently for the wolf and cat update....the update came in today but there are STILL no cat or wolves. We payed 7 dollars too!! Like the pc minecraft but we still don't get any wolves or cats??? PLEASE MOJAING FIX THIS........
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Same thing is happening to me as soon as I updated it stop working any one know how to fix this?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My son is 6 and did well with this game. He was able to figure most of the clues out and I think it&quot;s a good tool
1451673442|5.0|THIS BOOK CAME VERY QUICKLY AND WAS IN GREAT SHAPE! I didn't read it because it was for my boyfriend but he loved it!!
B00415Z9Y2|5.0|I love David Garrett.  I'm hoping to get tickets to see him in March 2014.  I ordered this Blue-Ray from Germany because it has more songs than the PBS DVD.  So excited I did.  The shipping was very reasonable and fast too!  It was fun listening to the dialog in German even though I don't speak the language.  Very excited to receive this and the audio and visual quality is outstanding.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I listen to this whenever I'm feeling down and it can always lift my spirits. Some of my favorite songs of all time are on here, I kid you not. Probably one of my most prized possession, and I regret nothing. :D So much emotion, it's amazing.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|It is sad that opportunities for historical movies are squandered in the interest of politics and personal assassination attempts.  How can actors and directors have so little respect for their own professions and for themselves?  It is my hope that the English will finally provide a historical program on Margaret Thatcher's life and contributions.  The English have already produced some of the best mystery serials for television.  And every time one is offered the opportunity to see new English talent on the screen, one is almost never disappointed.
0375842209|5.0|Amazing book. A must-read. Had a deep impact on my thoughts and feelings. I'm glad I read this book. Markus Zusak, I'm a fan.
140006922X|5.0|Very easy to read, and most informative. It has picked up where my Judeo/Christian studies left off. He is very knowledgable about the Greek/Aramaic/Jewish histories and culture which is most helpful.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Almost like sitting at the table with friends, all that's missing is the popcorn!<br />Everyone can enjoy. Great for all ages!<br />Get ready to become addicted
B00C5WR6JE|1.0|I relied on an organization who promoted it, and I could not be more disappointed! It is not professional or enjoyable.
0425266060|5.0|This is a great series. Eva and Gideon had a very steamy relationship. It was hard to put the books down. I enjoyed it more than the Fifty Shade series.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|it's a marriage of music and art and I cannot wait to see the video. The song is infectious and jubilant!
B000RD0RDU|4.0|This fan is an excellent, small sized fan. Very quiet and moves enough air to cool my aquarium light. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars was that the mounting holes were a bit small and I had to drill them out to fit my standard size fan mount pegs on the fan mounting bracket. Can't beat the value of this fan.
B003L20ICE|2.0|This could have really been a good movie, but sadly the crude language, present in most scenes, and the less-than-attractive characters and not-very-credible characterizations really took away from the journey this film could have taken.<br /><br />I have really wanted to see this movie for some time and I hoped for a well-deserved honest portrayal of a women-centered family, complete with life changes and challenges. But parents and grown children who speak to each other with \\"f--- yous\\" and other crude forms of expression quite regularly certainly didn't represent any people or families that I know (thank goodness). I was so hoping for a fair and interesting portrayal of a modern family, one that started differently than many, but persevered and survived, regardless of its internal and external challenges. Yes, families face many things, but foul-mouthed, somewhat insecure women changing their preference (temporarily) as well as easily chucking (or changing) relationships when a man enters the picture seemed rather inappropriate as well as somewhat silly.<br /><br />While new ground may have been broken in some ways, and the story did try to offer a glimpse into an established women-centered family, something that we rarely see in movies or television, this portrayal left me feeling that I didn't want to see this movie or revisit these characters again. Their journey was one I wanted to forget and that was not what I was hoping to feel after viewing this. A Hollywood ending was not what was expected, but more respect for authentic journeys of the characters portrayed would have been appreciated.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|...Best calculator I have found. Kindle Fire HD. I have tried quite a few. I think I will keep using this one.
1250010403|5.0|I am a big fan of the author but this series really is good. it catches your interest so you must know more!
B00ANDPGJE|4.0|this is a great set with fine extras  the commentaries are excellent ,the picture and look of the show<br />aren't  in a league with the newer U S version which they spent a lot more money on,
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|IT works<br />Simplicity,it works,what can I say,20 words? Is not be necessary, is pretty much an automatic thing, it tells you when is needed even.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|From opening scene till films end ; it was a wild G.I. Joe movie ! Must see movie ! Bruce Lee would be jealous !
B006S08RLU|5.0|I love this movie and Amelie's character.<br />It was very amusing, and it just has that simplicity of ideas that keeps you glued to the screen. It can be a little weird at times, but hey, I love weird.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was such a good read. I couldn't put it down. If you love a good suspense/mystery read this book!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A bit too slow at the begining but very good through out the entire book. Fascinating story. Now i can go see what the movie would be like. 😁
B0016YBFZ8|1.0|Goodfellas is filled with bad language, gruesome killings and probably a somewhat realistic way of life in the mafia.  The message is you can get whatever you want no matter who you hurt when you are a part of this group.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|Good premise. Interesting inclusion of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and its maddening rituals. Otherwise, it's Sleeping with the Enemy in England.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|This has the best search that I have used. I have friends who are adding it to their ipads that need a quick flight reference guide
B000HF702E|5.0|It's an older movie but great for kids I'm 28 I bought it for my self and my 7 year old to watch I remover when I was a kid watching it
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love  Hoseseini, and while this book is somewhat less compelling than the first two, the character oriented stories are worth reading. He writes very well, regardless of whether it's action packed or not.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It's boring to read in your free time, but I guess it's an ok. Dictionary. Zoey Campion, have a nice day
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I purchased this to replace the stock fan for my Intel-5 4670K CPU. While using my stock fan for about a week or so it ran at about 50 degrees Celcius according to the motherboard stats. My system began the habit of \\"blue screening\\" which I believed had to do with the temperature and that's what made me look for a reliable after market heatsink fan.<br /><br />Cooler Master has been highly reviewed here at Amazon and just about any other merchant site there is. Since this was my first PC I built I wanted to make sure I got the best ingredients for a great running PC. I came across the Hyper 212+ which is said to be no different than the EVO and was more affordable. I was concerned if it was compatible with the MSI ATX LGA 1150 motherboard because it doesn't directly say so, but after researching online I found that it is comaptible which finalized my decision to buy it.<br /><br />I will say that I'm happy with this purchase. I have a NZXT Phantom 410 mid-tower case and it fits inside. It's very effective and since installing this fan my statistics says it's running between 30 to 40 degrees Celsius. Since installing the fan my PC has not \\"blue screened\\" since. As a novice, it takes a bit of patience installing the fan unless you're an expert. It's a bit tedious, but it's worth the effort in the end. Very good product. I will definitely keep Cooler Master in mind for possible future builds.
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|This was a faotd and I almost didn't get it because I usually don't like these rolling ball games. For some reason though, this one is alright.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|This is a great love story with a little different twist to it. It is also a great comedy with some great lines in it. This is one of our families favorites/
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|Surprizingly fun and challenging game that involves nothing more than parking various vehicles. Some are more difficult than others, but it's a good timewaster.
B00407PNWO|5.0|This is the greatest Robin Hood movie ever made. I would think any one that likes the old movies would really enjoy this movie and the color is beautiful in it. We consider it a classic.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|what can i say I'm pretty tough on TV shows but this is a good show, excellent characters and story line always had me guessing where it was going and truly had a shock valve for the ages!
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|This is a great follow up to Brino's first album. Most music is all in bad fashion now a days. Most artists talk about money, sex, violence, strippers and cars.. But Bruno is a breath of fresh air compared to others. This album is a perfect mix of current music that is clearly inspired by classic oldies. I love the 80s and 60s touch and I'm sure everyone else will too. Chances are, if you liked the first album, you'll definately love this one. The only problem is this record is only about 35 minutes. With music this good, I wanna hear more!..... Otherwise, this is just great! Bruno is definately the best out there :-)
B005LAJ23A|5.0|well it definitely beat out the first season by a mile, good twists and turns,  cant say much more than that.
B00271HAK8|5.0|Things always go right for Ferris. No matter what situation crops up, Ferris always finds a way to overcome it. My wife and I are teachers, and WE would love to skip school sometimes, too! That's why we like snow days. :)  One note: PG-13 back then is not the same as PG-13 now. There are a few instances with some bad language. Regardless, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer strikes again, coming off his Batman music didnt think he could do any better but he did.  totally felt an emotional connection to the Man of Steel with his music.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Having both the disk and digital copy (which I used through iTunes but there are other options) is a great deal.  Now you can watch at home on your bluray and on your iPad while traveling.<br /><br />And the movie is the best MI yet.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Well written and interesting. The characters are much more relatable than you'd expect .  I especially enjoyed the peek at the darker side of Japanese culture.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Started off very slowly and took a bit to keep your interest. Visually very appealing, but the story lagged for the first hour before you cold really start to enjoy it.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Great book!  Loved the character development and how close I felt to each character. If you read this, you have to read the next book as well for the ending, but both are great reads.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching this show a little late so I needed to catch up. Getting it through Amazon was the perfect way to get up to speed.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|This is the entire cast I saw in Knoxville years ago!I love it thank you!!!!Great price and sounds wonderful!It's just as I expected!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is an interesting role game with lots of things to do. Leveling up is a bit tricky earlier in the game. If you don't have the mana it is rather hard to do. Otherwise it is a fun game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Ms. Flynn doesn't need another 5-star review, but she deserves it for writing this virtually flawlless nove. The novel is written in the form of a mystery, but at heart it is a study of human relationships. The characters are sharply drawn and credible. Even the minor characters who have only small parts in the story are carefully drawn and memorable. The plotting is very clever. The writing style is very professional and never gets in the way of the unfolding story. However, IMO, the best feature of this novel is Ms. Flynn's very insightful observations about human relationships. I think we're all interested in what makes other human being tick, and Ms. Flynn explains exactly what made these human beings tick. (Yes, I realize they were fictional human beings, but they seemed very real to me.) My only question is how did the author acquire so much wisdom at such an early age. I always thought that wisdom comes with age, when it comes at all, but Ms. Flynn apparently aged quickly despite her youthful appearance.<br /><br />I had not heard of Ms. Flynn before I noticed Gone Girl at my library, but now I will have to buy her two earlier since my library doesn't have them.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Interesting science fiction story.  Not a rehash of the usual alien takeover.  My girlfriend enjoyed it too,  making it a good film for couples.
0553385445|5.0|Not overly well written but the story more than makes up for it! Makes me wish I grew up in NYC!
B00E8B1358|2.0|It went on and on,  and on and on, and on and on.  It's perfect for a juvenile who didn't get enough fireworks as a kid.  Even little Johnny who blew his hand off on the fourth of July would again suffer from PTSD.  Just turn the volume down and you mind off.
B009186JYI|5.0|How wonderful to be taken back in time to when the Rolling Stones first hit the scene.  I was taken with Brian Jones immediately and was so glad to see all the footage of him in this DVD.  It shows what an incredible impact the group had on their audiences.  What heady days those were and this film gives the viewer a sense of what it was like back then.  I really felt like I was that same teenager again who was swept up in the British Invasion.  It seemed like every day something new and exciting in music took place.  I was never without my transistor radio.  This film was an absolute delight.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I love 90% of this album and play it a lot.<br />I really enjoy both of these artists. It rocks!
B00CNIDIBA|4.0|The 4k transfer was weak and at times looked like a DVD.  A little disappointing because some of the other 4k mastered movies have better sharpness and color.
B00000IOSU|2.0|I wish I had not purchased this album.<br />I love Sarah's voice but think this group<br />of songs is poor.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Author should have quit when she was ahead - even my husband thought this was dumb.  Don't bother buying it!
B00CTII57Q|5.0|This was my first season finale as a supernatural fan, and it didn't disappoint. With some seriously unexpected turns, like falling angels and the abnosome sight of Crowley having All The Feels, I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Can't wait for season nine!
B0080CKGZE|3.0|The movie was kind of drawn out.  It seemed like Edward (Robert Pattinson) was pulled out of the Twilight movies and dropped on to a new set.  The character needed different mannerisms or something.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|Technically I bought this CD after it wasn't &#34;new&#34; anymore, as it's been out for a couple years. I love it! I loved the old Avril with her spunky rock songs, but I love love love this CD! Her songs are definitely a lullaby-type music and I love it. They're great sing-along songs and the music behind is beautiful. The lyrics make you stop and think for a minute. I just loved it!
B00942Y4IY|4.0|I loved this movie when it first came out.  I watched it with my son this time and he also loved it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I was very happy with this last book! Seemed the best way for it to end in my opinion. Great work Charlaine!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It's an oral history from a number of the survivors - some are very interesting, some are not, which effects their believability.  There is very little continuity, which for me presented a problem since some of the survivors have stories that should have continued.  This is a book you can read a bit, set it down for a day or two, and not have to try and remember what the last thing was that was happening.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Another Sookie Stackhouse novel that you can't put down. Sookie once again has many crazy events going on in her life. She debates once again if opening her life to so many supernatural beings was the right choice.
B00DHNJGCU|3.0|good movie good action good story line. not the best suspense in the world but god for a quiet weekend
B000065V42|5.0|it's honey, I shrunk the kids -  if you were a kid when this came out how could you not have loved it and still do?
B008YU0AOE|4.0|It's easy to use and big enough to see. I really like this app. I would recommend it to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's my favourite game on the kindle and I play on it for hours at a time I recommend it to children under ten but in sum cases older..... thanks for making a amazing that entertain most people in the family... can't wait for the next update
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I was very impressed with this blu ray version of the original Godfather. The visuals and the sound were great!
B002RVCD0U|2.0|The movie is a decent entertainment but I feel like the soul of the previous terminator has been lost in this one: Arnold is missing, but the movie is just not there.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|Enjoyed the new version of Sin City.The Visuals and the sounds were a definite plus for seeing the  movie again
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. It's amazing!! It's fun, creative, easy to do, and great for all ages! The only bad part about this game is that It's 6.99!! Overall great game though!! I totally recommend it!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall was fantastic to see in this Blu ray version. I was very impressed with not only the plot but the visuals.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can't wait for more levels. Had a blast with my son putting our heads together time figure out each level.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Decent Acting, but then, it wasn't that much of a challenge.  Decent story, and to me, there was a metaphysical, deeper meaning.  Great special effects.  Very hot leading actress.  The ending was interesting... I don't want to spoil that for you!  If you like Sci-Fi, Watch It!!!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|As a trekkie fan, this is just what I needed at a great price!! It was a great deal and I now own one of the best movies ever!! Awesome! &#60;3
B009LH1WLO|5.0|Sometimes a show is just so abnosome the world can barely contain it.  Supernatural has always fallen into that category!
B00101ZOTA|5.0|One of the best movies for the era, suspense and mystery roled into a Hitchcock style movie.  A must see movie.
B000EOTAM6|5.0|The previews and one scene (same scene) feature a very immodest look at Chalize Theron.  That is why I did not see this movie for a long time, but as usual, when I browse, I study and re-study using resources like screenit.com.  I discovered that two immodest scenes (the other involved a married couple in bed), some gun violence and a constant attire of tights was about the worst the movie had in it.  I subsequently saw it with my family (my mom is a very science-fiction-fan) and was greatly impressed with the positive direction of the story line (obviously minus the antagonist) and the graphics/performances/imaginations of the entire film. Impressive, even if you are not very much into science fiction.
B002RKRGQ2|4.0|Anything written by P.G. Wodehouse is good, clean, funny. I have some of his stories in paperback, but glad to have them on my Kindle.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Have enjoyed so much bought the boxed set of all 5 in the series.  Look forward to seeing more books by this author.
B009JBZH54|3.0|Parts of the disk were marred by scratchy sound.  This was on &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34;. Video seemed a little less than sharp.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Don't even try other bands, Savage Garden is the best. Darren Hayes rocks my world. All day long. Sweet Susie.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|John Ford and John Wayne did an excellent portrayal of Cynthia Ann Parker's kidnapping by the Comanche in Texas.  John Wayne did an realistic job showing the prejudice against Indians that was common at that time.  Ford showed Texas a Monument Valley but that added beauty to the story.  Buddy Holly was so influenced by John Wayne using the line over and over &#34;That'll be the day&#34; he wrote a hit Rock Song from it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Love all his books great writer. Never a dull moment. Keeps you on your toes wondering where he's going with this.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|I like the app alot it is simple and easy to use but all the effects cost way too much
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|If you like action, romance, intrigue, you'll love Red.  It has it all plus an outstanding cast of players.  You'll not be disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app. love realness. keeps kids occupied and teaches them to love their animals.I love this app so much. you should get it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My kids love this game. They can build new homes keep track of money to get more land. See many different creatures and identify one's from the movies.
0345529057|5.0|thing took over and they learned nothing.  Now they have the joy of actually picking up a book its great.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I am a big fan of Mitch Albom's books, so I had high expectations for this one.  I have to admit that the first half of the book didn't flow very well for me.  I like the concept of jumping between the sub plots, but it was excessive for my taste.  However, the build up for each of these characters really paid off in an unexpected way. Thanks for another great read!
1250027624|5.0|Even though we come to understand a lot from the characters’ personalities thru the development of the plot of the series, many interesting details are left behind due to the lack of history knowledge or missing background information on the upbringing and former life of the characters. I believe this book is a good aid to getting hold of the whole picture and leads us to enjoying the series even more.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|what to say about this one mmm,its brilliant,smart,gory,real,,one of the best horror films of this decade in my opinion,its very well made,the acting is top notch.This is one of my favorite horror films ever,other movies should be measured against this one.If you have not seen this one watch its worth your money
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius is extremely tallented and this collection only reinforces that observation. His crossover to Country, based on this release, is one of the best decisions he could have made.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I would try and kill the skeleton and nothing would happen three times I had direct hit and I was killed and lost all my stuff
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|One of thier top collections, if not thier best. Some of the songs take a differenet directions from thier ealier works, but over all are great.
1476727910|5.0|What a wonderful study of humanity and the human condition!<br /><br />From the first few pages it is obvious how well this book was thought out.  The characters are real, the humor is poignant and appropriate.<br /><br />We are a unique race.  If you do not believe so, read this book and understand why; if you do believe so, read this novel and feel comforted by the fact that you are not alone in your point of view.
0062238868|5.0|Great read, could not put it down.  A must for all professional Warriors.  Honest, truthful and real.  I give it 5 stars.  Thanks brother.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Although some critics panned it, this is an excellent movie that follows the story of four main characters through the war in the Pacific. If you have seen the Ken Burns epic documentary &#34;The War&#34; you will see two of the characters in the Pacific (Sid Phillips and Eugene Sledge) are featured in the Burns documentary. The quality of the Blu-ray is incredible. Lots of features and other goodies. Money well spent!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|... Headline pretty much says it. Made me think something from the past. Choises made, words said, acts done. Good
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|I expected this fan to run quietly and cool my computer. It does! I am happy enough to give it a perfect 5.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Enjoyed his latest offering, but still feel this artist is at his best when he turns to his &#34;pop-opera&#34; ballads and standards.  The voice, however, is incomparable!
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|This movies is one of my all time favorites. When I got it on the mail my father in law was visiting and he was so excited he made us all watch it right away. I didn't even know he liked the movie. So it's safe to say that everyone, young and old will love this movie.
B006RXQASA|4.0|I'd heard only good things about this film, and every person I've encountered who has watched it has told me to definitely see it. So after renewing my Amazon Prime subscription, I ran into Clerks in the Prime Instant Video section. The streaming service is very intuitive and simple, and if you didn't already know it, you can watch something on one device, and switch to another device and continue streaming from where you left off.<br /><br />Due to the hype, Clerks didn't quite live up to my expectations. But, it is truly a classic must-see movie, and it's jokes and scenarios are frequently referenced (at least that is what I have experienced).<br /><br />In short, if you haven't seen this movie yet; you should. I have heard that this is the best of the bunch, but I haven't gotten around to seeing any of the sequels myself.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was Magic!  Read the book to define a very special meaning of Magic.  It was simple, refreshing and philosophical.  Enjoy!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Intelligent, witty, and funny.  We love this show. My husband and I don't often agree on what to watch, this Suits both of us. There are some fun quotes from 80's movies and the banter is great!  You will fall in love with Donna!
B008ZDC7M8|3.0|I'm watching the first episode of this series -- which seemed brilliant, if more poetic than objective --  and suddenly it mentions the first feature film in Hollywood. But something's wrong.<br /><br />Yes, Cecil B. DeMille made the first feature length film in Hollywood, and it was \\"The Squaw Man\\" but this documentary makes a terrific blunder, one that is inconceivable to have been made by anyone who knows anything about film.<br /><br />Instead of noting that it was the 1913/14 version by DeMille, it shows the 1918 REMAKE by DeMille and proclaims IT as the first feature! By the time this was made, DeMille had directed 32 features!!!! What kind of fact checking was done here?  Anyone, I repeat, ANYONE, who knows ANYTHING about the early history of Hollywood would know this stupid inaccuracy totally precludes this series from being taken seriously. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?<br /><br />Yes, I really enjoyed what I saw, and found it provoked a lot of serious thought about the art of film, but after this error... FORGET IT!
B002T3PZS8|5.0|This is a really great film. A little intense for younger viewers and definitely not one of the kids.  Watched it with our teenagers and then had a long discussion about how the story mirrors apartheid.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|its fun but i got bored of it after a while and deleted it. so im just sticking to survivalcraft and minecraft.
0307719774|5.0|This is a great little journal for people like me who have a ton of journals sitting on the shelf getting dusty. This is the first journal that I bought that I'm actually motivated to write in it. It's very easy, just answer the questions. I always had a hard time with the blank journals. I would sit for 5 minutes thinking of what to write & it never worked. In any case, this is an awesome journal! Buy it now!
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy. You need to be very open minded to read these books Very easy read that made you want more!!!
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|it is a cool game with landings but I wish I could see the type of air planes. if you you get all the missions good on the landings. I give the game 5 stars. Have a safe flight.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Who doesn't love Huey??? I had lost my original cd and it sure is great to listen to Huey again. Enough said!!!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I love it and can't wait for the video and the rest of the album.  It's a great song to start a comeback with.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I love Macklemore's stuff so I might be a bit biased, but I absolutely love this CD, every song has heart and soul in it. His music hits home and would be motivational to anyone.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|The show is great but the DVDs quality is not too good...<br />I miss the soundtracks and a better image.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|No longer need to hook up my phone or tablet to an HDMI cable to watch movies or listen to music... Works well... Currently has limited apps, but that should change when the SDK is finalised and released...
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Though I found this story moving and quick to read, it was not one of my favorites. It lacked the gut wrenching plot lines of his previous books and as a result I didn't find much satisfaction at the story's end.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|While initially this series animation wasn't my favorite, it grew on me by the second. Story wise, part 2 was far better than 1 and really was truly enjoyable.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|This is an all around good game my only complaint is the time allotted during tournament mode is a too low in my opinion.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|The animation style is a little off-putting compared to other movies and the various TV series. Closer to Batman beyond's representation. While the story was good, it seemed to not be as enjoyable as I would have liked.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Me and my kids love this game wish I didn't have to wait to get more time<br />To continue the game but it is still a great game
0803730470|5.0|This is one of my 2 year old son's favorite books! Mom & Dad enjoy the story as well :) Pictures are great as well!
1451624468|4.0|\\"A Universe From Nothing\\" by Lawrence M. Krauss.  This is a good, honest book by a physicist (cosmologist) who tries very hard to explain the staggering impact of discoveries in physics over the past century--inflation, the Big Bang, the microwave background and quantum fluctuations, a flat universe, dark matter/energy making up 99% of the universe and providing a negative gravitational pressure/energy that provides for continuing expansion of the universe, a calculation of the age of the universe at 13.72 billion years, etc.-- totally changing our perception of reality. He argues that space and time not only can, but must, come from  nothing (no mass, no energy, no space) via quantum fluctuations and inflation.  He includes a good jibe against theologians and string theorists alike--\\"physicists don't invent things they can't observe to explain things they can\\", but incongruously seems to like multiverses.  The book requires study, not just reading, but it is the best book of which I am aware for explaining what science has to say on cosmology to the educated but diligent layman.
0525953728|5.0|excellent book, break neck speed, the photos were a plus<br />if you wanna the truth, just buy yourself a copy
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|If I am forced to a specific number of words in rating songs, I will no longer leave a rating or a response. If I paid money for the song that should suffice that I wanted the song anything beyond that is not for my benefit. After payment that should be the end of my obligation. The rating system should be the stars only without having to leave comments.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; order<br /># 106-2884279-8334629, we received<br />did not include a transformer or means to<br />quick charge the item only the wire and USB connector.<br />We need the wall receptical/USB,4.9V-.85A<br />transformer.
0061714402|5.0|I completely wrote Dave Mustaine off years ago. As far as I was concerned, he was just the bitter ex-Metallica guiatarist with a massive ego that spouted off retarded s*** at his shows and in the media. I read metal biographies and memoirs voraciously and I can never seem to get enough of them. I had been purposely ignoring Dave's book because in my mind he had become pretty lame, with his Iraq war support and Christian beliefs, there was not much his book could offer. I was so wrong, this book is great. He's very funny, articulate and completely honest. He doesn't dodge any of the aspects of his careeer that would cast him in a negative light and is accountable to the extreme for his actions. Which is a lot more than can be said for that troll Lars. Even the chapters dealing with his rediscovery of his faith was written tremendously well. It all painted a painful picture of a decent man at the core without the necessary tools to anchor his life to something positive and overcoming that. I'm going to go back and rediscover Megadeth's catalog, I don't think I've listened to anything past Symphony of Destruction, and maybe learn a song or two.  Once again, sorry Dave, I'm glad you got to say your piece.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be a little hokey at first. But, i really liked the Ironman movies.  I was not disappointed at all.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Looks great on a Kindle Fire. I read it for aggregating technical journals, and it does a really good job.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|A miss from start to finish. We kept waiting for something to happen, but it played out with a boreing predictability.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can't wait for the next chapter to be available. I couldn't put the game down. Really made me use my mind. Very challenging.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I use this on my Apple Cinema Display because the display is made for the old charger, and this stays on that old charger and is still simple to connect my new Macbook Retina. I wish it was half the size just because I'll never remove it from my Cinema Display and it'd be nice to be more profiled, but I understand that it would be really hard to pull apart the piece since it is magnetized and it would be really easy to lose if it was smaller; it's already super small and easy to use.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like the game but my game wont update. But beside the update stuff it is one of the best games ive ever played on a tablet
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Reading Malcolm Gladwell is like watching the PBS series &#34;Connections&#34;. In both cases, the author (and the narrator) brings up several interesting but initially unconnected historical stories, and then ties them altogether at the end to show the advancement of a science or an ideology.  Very interesting.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Other than losing a major character in the first 20 minutes of the film, it's about as much action - predictable as it is - as you'd expect from a GI Joe film and you can see the writing of the sequel on the wall...<br /><br />Still, it's fun! Everybody just on the edge of playing over the top, comic-book style, with the occasional actual subtle acting moment thrown in. Enjoy it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging but fun.  I hate to cheat on 2 levels but passed level 10 and am waiting for more.
B007OLYPW2|5.0|I have started this book and put it aside , each time reading a couple of pages until I became totally engrossed.<br />However, wverytime I made a pause in the reading I knew I will come back to it.  So as many here have written it is a slow start but it is a rich read.  Now that I finished It will take me a while to move on to another book.<br />Thank you Ms Byatt
B002KCNV70|5.0|My son is 8 and wanted this for his birthday. Product came promptly. Everything intact, nothing missing. HOWEVER, You can find this cheaper other places like W-mart, which we found out when my mother purchased the same gift for my son and we returned it (we had the receipt) - oh and it was only $1 shipping for her through them.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it! It was amazing! I was blown away by the humor and meaning within this book. A must read if there ever was one.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|This book has you guessing the whole time.  With so many character changes and events leading to the end, it kept my interest<br />for the whole book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This thriller kept you guessing to the very end! Lots of challenging puzzles. This game leaves you wanting more and more!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|We were so blown away by this DVD!!  It is truly a treasure to those of us who love this play!!  I could watch over and over, despite the emotional exhaustion that occurs.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I truly believe this book should be a requirment in high schools every where. I believe it could be used in grade schools to help children prepare for a full course in learning honest communication in highschool.<br /><br />I give this book a full five star recommendation.
B003ELY7PG|4.0|good for small businesses. The book was written from computer software development standpoint. I recommend it for small businesses. Good job.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Being a fifth grade teacher, I thought this book would be great to preview over the summer for my students. Absolutely wonderful story and I hope my students enjoy it as much as I did. A great lesson in kindness.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|This movie may end sad, but it always makes me soul search! I can watch it over and over! So glad I purchased it for my collection.
0425266060|4.0|I liked this trilogy.  I was looking for something similar to the 50 Shades trilogy and found it in this set.  These books were well written and the story was steamy.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love the new app.  Makes buying and selling super simple, fast and easy.  Love the picture taking abilities with the Iphone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It really needs to be updated. And it also should let you play on realms other than that it's still awesome
B000002KHH|5.0|Awesome, I'm glad I found this copy it's such a classic album.I would recommend this seller just for that. I'm a happy customer.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This movie had me in tears from beginning to end. The music was captivating and moving. I proceeded to buy the complete sound track after watching. Very highly recommended.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|It has been years since a story captured me so completely. If you are looking for a modern formula action romance this is not the book. This is a story of struggle,hurt,and laughter... and wonderfully imperfect love.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I love this book and have recommended to friends. Got the Kindle version, sort of wish I had a hard copy to loan.
1848507836|3.0|I understand its a heavy topic...but this book wasnt for me. i just lost my hubby 8 months ago to pancreatic cancer... Perhaps the timing just wasnt right. Didnt care for it at all.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|No swears, no sex, repetitive character quirks so you don't miss how cute and quirky the characters are. Given the lack of swears and sex, I was surprised by the graphic deaths and assorted violence. Yet I read it to the end, and by the time I was halfway through, I wanted to just sit and read to the end. I'm curious enough that I would like to read the second one, to see where the politics and rebellion go....
0345803485|5.0|Great book. My lady loves it. She would recommend to any lady out there. It just like captivates. Just read it.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|Fantastic vocabulary, character development, historical detail, convoluted sentences, dialogue, and paragraphs that are challenging and delightful. A slow read, that sometimes requires you skip back a page or two to untangle. Worth every minute if you love sailing, the days of sail, and watching two men try to be friends!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Like Baldacci as an author and have read his books.  Will continue to read them as they are released.  Very good writer
0525478817|5.0|Perhaps it's just me, though the main focus being a teenaged cancer patient leads me to think otherwise, but I did a lot of crying toward the end of this book.  That is not, in any way, a shortfall - I think that when words on a page can move a person to tears, it's a pretty resounding endorsement of said words on said pages.  I'd be remiss if I forgot to mention that I did a lot of laughing as well.<br /><br />After a long reading dry spell I thought this book would be a good way to ease back into literature.  It sure was - a moving story, real characters, plot twists, hope, honesty, young love, sarcasm, and a whole lot of end-of-life coping, it really had it all.  I breezed through the story in two days and spent another day or so recuperating.<br /><br />The story focuses on two teenagers, Hazel who has cancer, and Augustus who is in remission.  They meet in a support group and spark a friendship immediately.  The plot follows the two in their changing relationship with one another, the progression of their diseases, and a bit of an offshoot about Hazel's favorite book and its writer.  The characters aren't completely believable at first, but I had to remind myself that we find them in extreme circumstances.  Immediately upon reading the book I found myself thinking, \\"I sure wasn't like this when I was 16.\\"  To which I immediately retorted, \\"obviously.\\"  They are living a reality that very few do and are therefore extraordinary people.  Wise beyond their years.<br /><br />I read this book when I was 23 years-old but can see it being enjoyed by anyone from (a mature) 13 to 102 years of age.  I urge you to laugh and cry as, certainly, every other reader has.
193700788X|3.0|It seems Ms. Harris is really done with Sookie Stackhouse. It is a decent book but it seems like way too much content and new storylines forced into a book. I would have considered getting another writer if she really was no longer invested in the series.
B00CDCLL1A|3.0|The movie is great but Amazon digital format needs some attention.  I don't like the idea that I have no place to store the digital format on my HD.  I have to keep it on my device or it stays in the cloud.  I learned after purchase that at some point, if Amazon removes it from the cloud, I won't have any choice but to permanently occupy space on my iPad.<br /><br />C'mon Amazon, fix that.
B00D6OV57O|4.0|for me its easy you like Hans Zimmer work you would like this not his best work but still great
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Very well done book and in some ways better than the show, you get more detail obviously but there are some things that can only be truly enjoyed by actually seeing it.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Loving my Pulse!  Really like the combination of the Body Analyzer Scale along with the Pulse to do a little self quantifying.  The feedback loop is motivating and enjoy all the benefits of the Health Mate app both on iphone and the desktop.<br /><br />Keep delivering great products Withings!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|If I had a better grasp of how to play the game I might like or love it but the instructions are not clear and that makes playing it too frustrating to be enjoyable. Angry Birds, the core game, is very intuitive and does not need extensive instructions and because this game is more complicated the same style of directions just does not work.  It is a well designed game as all the ones from Rovio are - looks good, has good interaction etc. - but in its present state it is just not fun to play.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|always accurate never fail live it!!!! I'm very please  it great alarm for my teen girl and also has me on track with all my duties here at home and also at work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Cool game takes away boredom lots of fun boards and obstacle great for kids adults.I recommend it to a lot of people
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|First, I had no problems whatsoever with the operation of this game (Kindle HD 8.9). I played several games with no bugs or any other issues. I'm not sure what issue the reviewer who reported not being able to play this game offline had, but it was not true in my experience. After reading that I turned off wifi, and the game played just as it had with wifi on. I think one explanation may be that this app has been around for quite some time, and over that period the developers have made fixes and implemented improvements. For example, one review stated that it had no two-player mode, but the current version of the game does indeed have a two-player mode.<br /><br />The graphics are attractive, and the game plays smoothly and quickly. When you select a piece for your move the game shows you all possible moves including jumps. The game is not \\"touch move\\", so if you select one piece and change your mind, you can move another. One of the game options is whether or not captures are forced.<br /><br />The game has ten different difficulty levels, and they do play very differently. On difficulty three I had no problem defeating the game every time. I am not a seasoned checkers player, and this game took me to the cleaners on both difficulty 8 and 10. However, on the higher difficulty levels, the game did not pursue the quickest win, preferring to instead create more kings before applying the coup de grace.<br /><br />I found the game to be pleasant, varied, and challenging. I would have to study more checkers strategy and conventional opening moves in order to challenge the highest difficulty levels. I'd be interested to see how expert checkers players evaluate the higher difficulty levels.<br /><br />If you enjoy checkers, I recommend this game.
B00EKITOXC|5.0|It is developing into an EXCELLENT series! Mystery abounds...I do not like spoilers, so that is all I am typing.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This version of Uno is great plus its free! The only downside so far is it takes a while to build up tokens if you don't wanna pay for more. But other than that it's great fun.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I really liked the concept of the film.  How there was a war and Tom Cruise &#34;Jack&#34; is part of the mop of crew.  Film takes some interesting twists and turns.  I especially liked the ending.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|I just finished watching this movie on Prime membership. This movie did decently entertain me, which is why I gave it a good 4-star rating. I laughed a handful of times, nothing too hilarious to the point where it hurt and I've laughed at non-movies that have done this without even trying. Midway through the movie, I caught myself, thinking, \\"this isn't as good as I expected it to be.\\" But overall, it did entertain me. There are a lot of stereotypes in this film that were funny but it just illustrates how Hollywood keeps holding onto these stereotypes and gross depictions because they can't come up with any contemporary funny material. If you took out the stereotypes that Hollyood's been playing up for many years, people would be rioting at how bad this film was because essentially nothing would be in it. But it did entertain me.<br /><br />I did like the humorous irony pointed out by General Aladeen where he discusses America and its ways/similar characteristics to dictatorships and tyrannical forms of government from concentrating the nations wealth to 1% of its population to bailing out the wealthy when they gamble and lose to ignoring and disregarding the poor's health and education to creating the appearance of a free media controlled by a few individuals to wiretapping phones and torturing prisoners to having rigged elections to lying about waging (immoral and evil) wars to overwhelmingly filling prisons with a people of a certain racial background and no one would object or complain to this to using the media to intimidate and scare people into supporting government policies that are inimical and adverse to their interests. That part of the film came unexpectedly and I enjoyed it.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I read the book many years ago....easy reading.  I watched the movie and it runs pretty close to the book<br />I doubt if I will watch the movie again, but it was good.

B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Very addictive and relaxing especially when you are having a rough day. I am hooked on this game. Even downloaded it on my phone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Just like the pc version. I play it every day for a year. It is in version 0.7.3 now and it is beast!

B008AK8FHM|4.0|I read this book because so many friends and fellow church members were reading and recommending it. Eben Alexander struggles to put his near death experience into words but the tone is so sincere that he comes across as believable. The book gave me hope and a good feeling that my recently deceased husband is finding out more about reality in the realm of consciousness.

1416955070|4.0|I'm actually extremely surprised that this is only my second time reading City of Bones. When I first started reading (post high school), I re-read almost everything I could get my hands on, and that was mostly because I didn't have the circulation of books surrounding me that I do now. City of Bones, and The Mortal Instruments in general, is definitely one that fits into the category of needing to be re-read multiple times. Since I've started blogging though, I feel very pressured to read \\"new\\" (to me) stuff so that I can review them on the blog. I don't have unlimited time available to me to read, so I do the best that I can. However, with the recent development of my \\"From the Ashes\\" feature reviews and with the upcoming movie release of City of Bones, I felt that it was past time that I take a second look at City of Bones.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, I didn't have the details of City of Bones down as much as say Twilight or Vampire Academy--series that I've read upwards of 5 times or so. I had forgotten that Clary was fifteen at the beginning of City of Bones; however, she does turn sixteen during the book. And considering the book only spans about a week or so of time, that's not so bad. The beginning of the book was more confusing to me ironically enough because I remembered thinking that the \\"blue-haired-boy\\" wasn't really important from my first time reading it, being only a catalyst, but when Cassandra Clare switches to write from his POV, I was thrown off and thought for a second that maybe Jace had glamoured his hair blue or something. But obviously quickly figured things out. I felt a bit daft for a minute or two though.<br /><br />Clary is a fairly strong leading lady. She doesn't have the fighting skills of Isabelle or Rose from Vampire Academy, but she has a quick mind and she stands her ground when it becomes necessary. Though reading through the book for a second time, I picked up on her jealousy of Simon's interaction with Isabelle and things like that more than I picked up on her developing attraction to Jace. I did notice more of Jace letting down his guard around her. He might be in the middle of being a jerk, but would stop to ask her if she were okay or place his hand on the small of her back--something to indicate that she was bringing him out more than you would expect.<br /><br />Speaking of Jace, he's still one of my favorite characters. Between Jace and Will of The Infernal Devices, I tended to lean toward Will. Because truth be told, I like strong and dark a bit better than strong and blond (or golden as Jace is often described). But this time through, I found myself marking many passages where I just couldn't get over his sarcastic humor. I remember not understanding the Jace toward the end of the book. And can't say much about that without spoilers, but I was perhaps even more frustrated with it this time around while at the same time understanding it more. Does that make any sense?<br /><br />I loved re-experiencing the other characters as well. Simon's quirky-nerdy self. Isabelle, who I originally read much meaner than I read her this past time, was awfully friendly to Clary all around, even when dealing with a bit of the female jealousy that's known to exist among our sex. I can't say I liked Alec any more this time around than I did the first time. And after having read about the close relationship that Will and Jem have from The Infernal Devices, it was hard for me to actually see or feel the parabatai bond/relationship between Jace and Alec in City of Bones. Maybe that will shine through more in the remaining books, but I can't really remember. And then there's Magnus Bane.<br /><br />Oh Magnus, even when you frustrate the crap out of me, I still find myself cracking up at your jokes, your hilarious outfits, and your centuries-worth-of-being-alive wisdom. (Yes, I talk to these characters as if they're real people. So what?) I feel like I understand Magnus so much more from having readboth The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices. He's seen and experienced so much. (Kind of off the subject, but one of my neighbors has a Great Dane named Magnus. I call him \\"Magnus Bane, the Great Dane.\\" Totally cheesy.)<br /><br />Obviously, the ending to City of Bones completely blew me away my first time reading it. And truth be told, I wasn't sure I wanted to keep reading the series after that. While I won't include any spoilers, I will just say to anyone who might not have read The Mortal Instruments yet, keep reading. Just trust me. But since this wasn't my first time through, I must say that I was still left with a despair that these characters must be feeling. Yet, I felt like Clary handled the situation much better than I remembered, and much better than I think anyone could have expected.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I concluded a review of this book without discussing the wonderful world that Cassandra Clare has created. Demons, vampires, werewolves, half-angel/half-human demon fighters, mundane humans...they all fit together into this world that is beautiful and intriguing. And I for one am thrilled to have not only The Infernal Devices as a spin-off series so that I can remain in this world a little longer, but I'm also thrilled about the upcoming The Dark Artifices spin-off series so that I don't have to worry about leaving this fantasy world any time soon.<br /><br />Because I can't really talk about The Mortal Instruments without discussing The Infernal Devices to some extent, I can see so clearly how Cassandra Clare had not only the entire series planned out in her head from the beginning, but also at least a good portion of The Infernal Devices planned out as well. If that's not the case, then she's just brilliant about going back to the beginning of her story and tying in pieces that I would have never put together. She uses some of the smallest foreshadowing details that make the story that much better. ****Minor spoiler alert for Clockwork Princess (book 3 of The Infernal Devices): I was even wondering this time through why Alec has the dark hair and blue eyes that we find in the characteristics of Will when Will wasn't related even distantly to Alec. Will's sister, who just so happens to look just like him, is. Brilliant, I tell you. **End spoiler.<br /><br />I gave City of Bones 4 stars on Goodreads when I first added it to my read-shelf, and upon my second reading, I find that this rating stands for me. Any reader who enjoys a well built world and a story that is worked and weaved like a tapestry from beginning to end will appreciate City of Bones and The Mortal Instruments.

B00AZM7IQC|5.0|This movie is very entertaining to watch and can be described as a Cirque Infomercial as they touch on several of the shows in Las Vegas.  The 3d Effects were good.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and parents and is not preachy on values.  It is fast paced and has well disguised humor for adults.  The movie held our attention from start to finish and the 3d effects are very good.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This movie was not what I expected and probably has some of the best 3d effects out.  The storyline kept me interested from start to finish.<br /><br />Great movie for adults and kids that are not easily scared (some scenes are a bit scary for kids)<br /><br />The beginning 5 minutes of the movie has amazing 3d effects and the scene shot from the pool looking up is incredible.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Movie was entertaining and the 3d depth effects were great!  Good movie for adults and kids above 8 who like action and can take some mild violence.

B004HWYTP4|5.0|It was funny and full of suspense. The acting was excellent and I recommend it, if you don't mind a little violence.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Excellent horror movie with strong acting by Ethan Hawke.  Unsettling from the standpoint of the overall theme of evil in the picture, but that's what makes a horror flick, right?
B00DU74U74|1.0|I couldn't get past the 2nd chapter of the  book. Watched with a friend it was absolutely terrible. A fun movie to mock with friends, Science theater 300 style.

B00AEFYNTU|4.0|Great script well acted.  Big names in characters you may not expect to find them playing.  Fun to the end.  Very clean - for the most part.  Without the one scene of the main character walking around in her panties I'd give it a 5 star rating...but overall it is smart, funny, crisp, light an sassy!!<br />A+<br />Have already watched it 2-3 times.

0763644765|5.0|We're not specifically potty training yet, but I thought I'd get a potty book to keep in the bathroom and read to my 15-month old when she sits on the potty whenever I (Mommy) go potty.  She loved it from the first reading, and actually spontaneously clapped to celebrate the baby's success.  The basic story is that the baby wants to go potty, and doesn't want to go in its diaper, so it checks how the kitty and doggy go potty (in a box and outside, respectively) and says 'oh' and then decides to try its own potty, and after a little waiting, is successful (tinkle-tinkle-toot!) and celebrates with mom & dad & kitty & doggy, and then celebrates undies.  The book is very cleverly written and illustrated, with few words that tell the story well, but would also fit with whatever patterns, reward systems, or such you plan to use.  Also, the way, the baby is cleverly illustrated to be either a boy or girl, so anything goes!  I wasn't sure what to expect since the 'look inside' images are limited, but this book is well worth every penny, and I'm so glad we have it!  My daughter is eager to sit and listen to it, and generally wants to hear it twice.
0439023513|5.0|Suzanne Collins wrote a terrific trilogy!  I really enjoyed the story and found it both exciting and disturbing.  I didn't think I'd like the story, beginning with Hunger Games, but could not wait to finish the series!

B00005NRN9|5.0|5 stars because I wasn't offered 6 stars. To say this production was spectacular is an understatement. The French took the concept of a circus and knocked it out of the park. This is a collectors DVD....no matter how many times you watch it you will want to watch it again....always asking the same question, HOW DID THEY DO THAT ?  If you ever see it in on a 90 inch HDTV in 3D you will have experienced nirvana. Adjectives really can't do this production justice. It's mind numbing, jaw dropping entertainment perfection.
B00C0UHGLO|2.0|I found this App difficult to use and deleted it fairly quickly. But if you are familiar with the game already and not playing to learn the game, it may be a different experience.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|5 stars because I wasn't offered 6 stars. Artist carnies on steroids. Adjectives somehow fail at describing the level of artistic production in Worlds Away. A masterpiece and collectors item. As usual, you will never grow weary of watching this production...asking HOW DID THEY DO THAT ? If you see only one Cirque du Soleil show, see Worlds Away. And if you see it on a 90 inch HDTV in 3D you will have experienced nirvana...it's mind numbing, jaw dropping spectacular entertainment. The French have, as usual, mastered the impossible. Time magazine called it a gorgeous production....that's like calling the Mona Lisa a portrait. Worlds Away is artistic perfection in all respects.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|These movies never get old.  Over and over this series is great.<br />Eight more words for this review. Two more now done.
1416511946|5.0|Love this book! I borrowed it from a friend and read it. loved it so much that I had to buy it and read it again.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|Lovely writing, compelling sad story. I have been a PETA supporter before, but now will send them even more money to protect animals from terrible research.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that I can read my books anywhere and not have to carry around my tablet. It's very convenient.
B00C28J2VQ|1.0|WHERRE IS THE EXTENDED VERSION OF THE MOVIE LIKE AMAZON.FR SELL IN FRANCE AND ALL OVER EUROPE WITH 13 MINUTES OF FOOTAGES OF ACTION SCENES NOT SEE IN THEATRES ??????????????????????????????
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Not what I expected when I started it. I had a few questionable choices in my \\"to read\\" list in the last few weeks and this book was absolut jackpot!!!!!!!!!!<br />Witty, smart, devastating, and so well written.<br />It is a journey, a  very moving one.<br />Impossible to put down.<br />I am now and officially an absolut fan of this guy.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|While I agree that this series is brilliant, it is also not a story fit for children. Knowing that those who are very young often push the limit of the YA genre, it is possible that at least this installment should come with a parental warning. I am also bothered by the sloppy writing. Almost every page contains a &#34;sentence&#34; that is not an actual sentence. Perhaps that will be the ultimate use of this book--as an exercise in 10th grade English class where students identify all of the errors.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Since it updated a few months back it freezes constantly. I have deleted the app and downloaded again and it still doesn't work right. Switching to accuweather.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|This is one of my new favorite shows, the acting is excellent and the story is very well done. It starts by introducing you quickly to the main characters which is followed swiftly by the discovery of a death of an 11 year old boy, one of the Investigators ends up Knowing the child's Family and the rest is a roller coaster of emotion and suspense as the suspects start being rounded up.<br /><br />David Tennant plays a very cut and dry detective for the British Police in a high up position within the detectives of that branch. All this and this was only the first Episode! I am excited to learn what happens in the next few episodes and would strongly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Murder mysteries.
B0036UMM84|5.0|Daughter lost her copy and need a new ne for family gathering. Pronto.  Amazon ad always comes thru...  All the ladies love this movie while the men whine and look for sporting events.
0920668372|4.0|I love this story and can't wait to read it to my granddaughter. It makes me cry.I hope she will think of me when she reads it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Thanks Amazon for this free download! What a great deal, plus now I can pull up songs and videos in a flash! Speaking of flash,  had to be one of the quickest downloads I've ever had! Highly recommend this app for every Kindle owner!
B003JHKORK|5.0|no doubt that i am a total demi-geek. read and reread every book 2! if you are looking for an awesome series read them!!!!
B003QCCS36|5.0|Probably his best album so far.  Controlled and hushed with many good songs very suitable for his unique voice. Interestingly, the opening song is probably the weakest.
0345803493|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It was easy to read.  It's good reading for women of all ages and give it to your guys.
B0030BYWKU|5.0|Really well done, for younger audience, 'dancey', charming and effortless.  All the songs pass as singles.  Definitely deserves 5* but seems to be getting lukewarm reviews on amazon.  True, the lyrics is kind of ? occasionally and this review sort of ignores what he's saying there; do not expect any great thoughts for sure.
0545265355|5.0|Haven't open this package yet; saving it until I've seen all the movies and then I'll read through it; but if these books are as good as the movie; I know I'll love them.
B0055EDBIE|5.0|Another strong outing for Lenny.  Couple of excellent and couple of skippable songs but overall very good and recommended.  He's been making solid and sound music for the last 25 years, no small feat.  One can definitely count on him every couple of years making albums that mostly stand for high standards of rock.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|No one can top her voice and the songs are terrific.  Unfortunately, we lost a great singer.  Wish she could sing that way again.  Worth getting this Greatest Hits.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Need I say more?  Well, I do actually because there is a minimum word count.  Seger is one of my favorites in the genre and Old Time Rock and Roll is, IMHO, the BEST rock and roll song EVER.  Quality is decent...well worth the money.  Just glad I have cruise control or would be getting speeding tickets every day.
0345803485|5.0|Love this trilogy; had already knew a lot about keeping the romance in your relationship.  I wouldn't go as far as some; but definitely keeps your sexual relationship exciting.
B005DOJ68K|4.0|Big, big fan and this collection has all of my favorites and even a couple I did not know.  Quality isn't the best, but worth the price just to have this in MP3.
B0025YKDJC|5.0|I never thought I would love this movie, but after renting it on Netflix I turned around and bought it on Amazon.  That's how important I feel this movie is - I want to own it and show it to my friends and family in the months to come.<br /><br />To be honest, Jim Carey's usual movie formula is too manic for my tastes.  For every sensible Bruce Almighty or Truman Show there is an over-the-top Ace Ventura, and I'm one of those who don't go in for crude humor and middle-school plotting.  But in an outing more aligned to Carey's &#34;Liar Liar,&#34; we find &#34;Yes Man&#34; follows the life an ordinary, reasonable man thrown into an extraordinary situation.  And as he learns and grows, so we in the audience learn and grow with him.  I found the experience both exciting and thought-provoking.<br /><br />Without giving too much of a spoiler: imagine being challenged to just say YES to any opportunity that comes your way?  Now imagine being so lost and desperate, that you have nothing to lose by saying Yes to what presents before you?  Now what if - against all reason and common sense - the path you followed - the dominos you set in motion by going down the path - lead to bigger and better life experiences and rewards than you would ever have been able to accomplish by 'playing it safe'?<br /><br />This movie takes us on that kind of trip.  Assisted by the ever-charming pixie-ish Zooey Deschanel and an equally charming cast, Jim learns that the most unlikely choices can lead to incredible outcomes.  There IS place for the path less taken and the beat of the different drummer.<br /><br />If you need a little more poetry and derring-do in your life, add this movie to your collection.  It was a sleeper at the box-office, but big screenings is not where a film like this belongs.  It earns a solid place in my collection because it delivers on the small scale, up close and personal, and I am the better for having seen this film.  Give it a try - see how it effects you too.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Great characters. Great acting. I started with a couple episodes and quickly got sucked in. Binge watched all the way through season 2 in about 10 days. :)
