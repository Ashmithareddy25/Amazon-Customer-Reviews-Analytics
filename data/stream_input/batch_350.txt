0790731479|3.0|*** 1/2 stars rating for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. This movie was one of the biggest surprises in 1988, it revolutionized the visual effects field, established Tim Burton as a director with a huge imagination, put Winona Ryder on the map, and helped Burton & Michael Keaton to be signed by Warner Bros. to film their strongest 1989 project: &quot;Batman&quot;.      &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a very funny ghosts tale with a lot of creativity and imagination, the characters are easy to love, the situations are funny and bizarre at the same time, all this translates into a very entertaining movie.       There are several memorable scenes in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, among them a possession scene at the tune of Harry Belafonte's &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, another is the one on which Adam & Barbara (Alec Baldwin & Geena Davis respectively) are taken to the underworld offices.      &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a good option to see the gorgeous Winona Ryder in one of her key roles, to see the creativity of Tim Burton at his best, and to see a very funny supernatural comedy.
0345451325|5.0|As a HUGE fan of the game Halo, I could not put this book down until I had read it cover to cover...twice! It answered almost every question I had about Master Chief, the war, the covenent, etc. It is a well written and interesting book in it's own right but if you are even remotely a fan of the game then this book is a must have!!!
B000089RVR|2.0|I'm reading the good reviews but I don't get it...this is sleepy, dull and no &quot;hook&quot; to it. One or two good songs and thats it. Definitly not as good as the last. Her brother (Faithless), is a genius - where is his influence on this? If you are expecting the same &quot;catchiness&quot; and full of &quot;content&quot; as the last, you may have to really dig deep, I can't find it. And, I really dig her too. (Plus, this cd? It's everywhere in the used bins already-dirt cheap. That says something.)
0385504209|5.0|Although it may not have been the author's intention, this book will probably make you question everything you think you know about the Bible and Christianity.<br />Factually accurate or not, Brown raises issues about the Catholic Church, Holy Grail, and Jesus Christ. Are the things we learned from the Bible fact or just interpretations from a select few? What was Jesus' real relationship with Mary Magdalene? I'm not particularly interested in theology but I have considered these questions since reading this work. Any book that makes me continue to think even after I've finished it is worth recommending.<br />Although the characters are not fully fleshed out, I can overlook this since the story only seems to span two days. The book sometimes becomes bogged down in too many details but the reader's patience will be rewarded. Brown cleverly lets his audience think they have figured out a key element of the plot only to veer in an unexpected direction.<br />If you want an intelligent read, I recommend The Davinci Code.
0446310786|4.0|The plot of TO Kill a Mockingbird get's two thumbs up as they say in the movies. I felt that the author did a good job by making us see it from an eight year olds perpective.Well it took place in old town during the time racism occured. I felt that alone had me intrigued to read the book . It was intersting to<BR>me because the book had two different stories going on at one time. <BR>    I felt that the author showed me as a reader that a kid growing up with a single parent was hard and that it's even harder when your parent is a hard worker and he doesn't have time to see you so you go and start own adventures like Scout and Jem do by trying to find things about there scary  and mysterious neighbor Bo Radley.<BR>     In my opinion I would say that the author portrayed Atticus as a man who does what he thinks is right by defending a African American man who he thinks is innocent eventhough knowing the whole town will look at him and his kids differently.That made me think about all my past situations where I had to the do the right thing. I thought the book had key elements but the part I liked the most was when Scout met Bo and found out that he was a good  man. That tells the reader to don't judge a book by it's cover.<BR>    I recommend for everyone to read this book because this book has a lot of meaning to it. It shows the way a kid grows up in rough times and the racial issues in that period of time. I gave the book four stars because after every chapter I wanted to read it not knowing what to expect.
B000089CPF|5.0|There is nothing like seeing Calexico live.  Period.<BR>BUT, I must say that 'Feast of Wire' captured these talented musicians and their many instruments and voices like none of their previous albums.  This album is prolific, sultry and just plain cool.  We all know that Joey has a voice that could melt the coldest heart, but the real unsung heroes of this album are Jacob Valenzuela and Martin Fink.  They're on trumpet and a number of other instruments.  Joey and John could have a great duet going, but Martin and Jacob are really the glue that makes a simple band into, what I feel, is the greatest and most talented band alive today.
0425188809|5.0|To say I enjoyed this book would be a gross understatement. It is still - after all this time - the best book Dean Koontz ever wrote. It has everything - the evil, mad scientist, the nice guy, the woman who comes out of her shell and the greatest dog in the Universe.<br />The pages where he first meets Einstein and both he and the reader were given clues as to his uniqueness were awesome. I finally stayed up all one Friday night to finish the thing. Nora underwent a tremendous transformation and her love with Travis was a thing of beauty. <br />For once, Dean does not star the bad guy but relegates him to second page. It is Travis, Nora and Einstein who take center stage. Two movies were made from this - the first, one of the most abhorant piece of film ever presented, the other a poor representation of the book. It's like presenting War &amp; Peace in three 20 minute installments. This is perfection
B000009HF2|5.0|Saw this talented artist at the Fillmore last night (26oct03). Maybe Frampton isn't Eric Clapton but there is no denying his appeal. Comes Alive is merely a showcase for Peter and his band to demonstrate their considerable talent. Buy this CD, buy all his earlier works too. All his albums are solid but not spectacular. Listenable, catchy, completely absorbing and entertaining and the lyrics endearing.<br />Watching him last night live furthur solidified my genuine love of this once and still great rock performer.<br />He is not packn'em into 70,000 seat stadiums anymore but when you consider the heights he has risen he somehow still maintains love for his &quot;family&quot; which he demonstrates with heartfelt chats with the audience and searing musicianship. Frampton and his band have an intangible appeal, they are very watchable.<br /><br />Frampton is welcome in SF anytime.<br />Bill Hilow
B00008977N|5.0|I've read the reviews and can understand the frustrations expressed.  I've heard complaints about video quality.  While the quality could have been better, it could have been much worse.  There may be other issues with video but I didn't have them.  I suspect those with large screen TVs will notice a bit of graininess as I did detect some when examining the picture closely.<br />I wanted to discuss the audio.  It should be noted that this DVD has three different audio tracks.  Dolby 2.0, Dolby 5.1 and DTS.  When I originally popped in the DVD I paid no attention to selecting what audio track I wanted.  I figured my DVD player would select the appropriate track.  During the playback I was extremely disappointed at the lack of 'depth' and bass in the recording.  <br />When reading reviews of a couple people saying the bass was great, I went into 'audio setup' to see what it was set at.  Lo and behold the default was set to **DTS** when I just have a basic 2 speaker setup.  Switching the audio to Dolby 2.0 made a significant difference in the audio quality and brought back bass quality to the recording.  It's not quite as strong as it was on VHS, but it's still quite decent.<br />So if you do get (or have) this DVD, use the audio setup from the main menu if you're not using a DTS receiver.  If you have two speakers, choose Dolby 2.0 - only use Dolby 5.1 mode if you have that setup (6 speakers) and only use DTS if you have a DTS receiver.  Make sure your audio is set BEFORE you play this disc!<br />I won't dwell too much on the issue of overdubs.   I would have wished that Peter didn't overlay new audio over old.  It's not so much that destroys the audio (it doesn't) but moreso that this was a show in it's own time.  Like a glimpse into the past, it's meant to be seen and heard as it occurred.  <br />Nevertheless, it's an outstanding show.  I agree with others in that it plays more like a performance and not a simple concert.  I consider this a must buy for any Peter Gabriel fan, as well as anyone who appreciates music of this genre.
B00005JL96|3.0|Sure, this Disney flick comes bundled with a message about family (O-Hana) the importance of sticking together and not leaving any of its members behind, but the story... it sometimes strikes me as a bit of a departure from Monsters, Inc. (the &quot;Evil Genius&quot; who created him and one-eyed Pleakley being two characters that strike me as almost having been directly extracted from the Pixar movie hit). As for animation, I was particularly impressed with the underwater &quot;shots&quot; when the characters are surfing: beautiful scenes!<br />The source of inspiration and the quality of animation aside, I can't still put my finger on the movie as a whole. It's not just weird or odd, granted that Stitch is perhaps one of the most disfunctional Disney characters in a long time... an extended version of the Beast, but created in an extraterrestrial lab, instead of being the victim of a spell. If you add to that the fact that his earthly family is rather disfunctional too, you have a recipe for a very different movie. It's not bad at all, it's just SO different, that I don't see a whole lot of people loving it so easily like some other Disney classics (nor do I honestly see it becoming another such classic).
B0000AXE8I|1.0|If you thought that the Star Wars sequels (or &quot;prequils&quot;) were bad, you ain't seen nothin' yet. Matrix Reloaded is a very stupid and utterly pretentious waste of time. Hokey love stories, interminable kissing scenes, ridiculous plot changes, pointless effects. Pass it by. If the Trinity character was cool in Matrix I, she is tiresome and laughable in Reloaded. Morpheus is a blowhard. And Neo -- well, what a waste!

1565123875|2.0|I had every intention of wanting to love this book but will alone wouldn't suffice.  It is dreary, seemingly long for it's relative size.  Until the very end Kambali and her mother come across as weak and needy women enduring endless beatings while continuing to have a twisted reverence for their husband/father.  The story has a depressing flatline rhythm. One that would be better to get from the library or wait for paperback.
B0000AMRJC|3.0|I saw this movie for the very first time tonight and I have to say it is not that great at all. I'll admit Al Pacino is an amazing actor and he does give a really good performance, but the story is really lacking. I mean, how can we find these people interesting in the first place, he never really showed remorse for becoming what he was towards the end, and as far as violence goes this movie isnt THAT violent. Most of it is the usual lame &quot;drug talk.&quot; michelle pheifer is good in this movie, but even that cant save it. I give it three stars for the music and the incredible shoot out at the end, but other than that it is not something I would call a &quot;classic&quot; however that is an opinion and many others may disagree with me. If you want a good gangster flick with Pacino, check out Carlito's way which was also directed by Brian De palma that is a movie where you can actually notice character build up and you sympathize with what is going on.
0060537639|5.0|Impressive body of research and exciting visit to the world of the 15th Century.<br />I have read one other book on this topic, namely about pre-European global discovery, and that was Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings by Professor Hapgood.  Since I was rather disappointed by that author's conclusions, I almost anticipated an equally disappointing experience with Mr. Menzies' book.  Hapgood discussed the Piri Reis map, a portalan map of the known world rediscovered in a collection in Turkey.  He and his students subjected the work to a thorough study by applying modern mapping techniques and non-Euclidean geometry.  While I had no complaints about their scientific research on the map-I'd taken some cartography in conjunction with my degree in geology-I was somewhat taken aback by their conclusion that the map proved the existence of the \\"lost continent of Atlantis!\\"  It is a fair jump from deciding that a pre-Columbian map portrays an accurate visual image of the coasts of the world to proving the existence of a fabled civilization.  There should be other more reasonable explanations of the phenomenon tested before we resort to the Sherlock Holmes theorem (when all probable explanations are disproved, then the only remaining explanation is the improbable.)<br />Menzies' work, 1421: The Year China Discovered America, while it also challenges accepted doctrine regarding the European initiation of world discovery, is a far more satisfying work.  Like Hapgood and his students, Gavin Menzies subjects old maps to a thorough examination by modern techniques and approaches the project with a better personal vita.  While not himself a professor of history, he is a well read and well traveled individual.  Furthermore his life experiences qualify him far better to undertake this project than Dr. Hapgood's did.  He served in the Royal Navy from 1953 to 1970, commanding a submarine, the HMS Ronqual, from 1968 to 1970.  During this time he experienced the same natural phenomenon of the world's oceans and became familiar with the idiosyncracies of maps and cartography in practice.  He also lived in China for two years before WWII and has returned many times since then.  He displays an obvious bias in favor of Chinese culture and its potental, but not unjustly if his data are to be trusted.<br />Probably the most impressive thing about the book is the author's very methodical approach to his subject.  He begins by giving a history of the Chinese state at the time he proposes produced the maps, discussing the social background that provided the impetus to world discovery and the reason the great voyages were not followed by extensive colonization as they were later by similar European ventures.  He also notes why the documentation of these voyages is so scant in China and uses what information there is as a starting point for his own pursuit of external evidence.  Describing the careers of commanders like Zheng He, Yang Qing, Zhou Man, Hong Bao and Zhou Wen, he sets the stage for his own research into their adventures.  Following each of the ancient commanders in their proposed missions and capitalizing on his own experience as a captain of an ocean going vessel, he charts the nature-driven course these ancient pilots would have been encouraged or forced to take.  At each probable landing point, he searched for and occasionally found indications of ancient contact: in material remains like porcelains, votives, and inscriptions, in the mythology of aboriginals, in wreck sites of non-European vessels, and so on.<br />The most impressive piece of this type of assessment is that of the Bimini \\"road.\\"  This underwater formation has had many attempted explanations, most of them total fantasy.  They have been described as \\"temples\\" of a lost civilization, as \\"roads\\" from the lost continent of Atlantis, as odd geological formations, as concretions remaining from some former sea life, etc.  That they might have been laid down by sailors for the very practical purpose of beaching their ships for repair is the most logical explanation I've heard yet!  Menzies is even able to describe how the beaching procedure would have been done and why that dictated that the \\"road\\" be designed just as it is.<br />Unlike Hapgood and his students, this author examines not just the Piri Reis of 1513 but several of the other anomalous early maps in pursuing the voyages of these amazing captains: the Kangnido world map of 1402, the Pizzigano chart of 1424,  Fra Mauro's planisphere of 1459, the Cantino world chart of 1502,  the Waldseemuller map of 1507, and the Jean Rotz world map of 1542.  While many of these date to after the European voyages of discovery, this author-and others as well-believe that they are copies of originals that are older.  It is believed that the European understanding of map making and of assessing position, particularly longitude, was not adequate enough to have produced such precise descriptions of foreign coasts.  The author's explanation of why this is true and why and how the Chinese were so far ahead of their European counterparts is detailed and interesting.<br />Menzies' style is colorful and descriptive, reading almost like a novel.  At times one is as lost in the narrative of the voyages as one is in the history of the events and the logic of the author's arguments.  I found it difficult to put down and read it in about two days.  The bibliography is quite extensive and includes mostly books in English or in English translation.  Some are a little old-Aldridge's \\"Cairo\\" for one (1970) though it's a fascinating discussion of the city-but even some of these are germane to the subject.  The technical discussions might be beyond the junior high level reader, but the story certainly is not.  I think that some of this should be taught in high school world history classes, since it shows that the age of discovery was a global phenomenon, that the world may have been \\"ready\\" for discovery, that it was \\"in the air\\" so to speak and inevitable.  That the Chinese could explore the world without antagonizing the foreign people they met along the way makes one wonder if the violence of the European ventures abroad were truly \\"inevitable\\" outcomes of a highly technological society confronting a less advanced culture as sometimes said.  An interesting book and worth a space on your shelf.y practical purpose of beaching their ships for repair is the most logical explanation I've heard yet!

0156027321|5.0|To be honest, I began reading this book out of sheer boredom and didn't expect to get much out of it.  I was delightfully surprised!  Not only is the book smart and humorous, the characters are utterly real and likeable.  I couldn't put the book down.  I don't know if it will make you a believer in God, as the book cover claims, but it will certainly make you question the \\"dry yeastless factuality\\" inherent in our \\"reality.\\"  This book is full of imagination and heart, a great read.
0201633612|4.0|Great book if you are a software architect with experience in designing quality software. In fact, I'd say this is the best book in the \\"pattern\\" section of the bookstore. The problem with this book (or should I say \\"around\\" this book) is that most inexperienced programmers tend to over-use patterns, specially after reading a book such as this. Patterns are a way to add clarity, reusability and simplicity to code, but when beginners use them to write down simple \\"hello world\\" programs instead of going through simpler approaches, we have a problem. Fortunately for us the \\"patternization\\" of the early 90's is gone; now patterns are used in a more rational way, and this book can be read as it was meant to be. So, you can live without this book, but it doesn't hurt to have it in your bookshelf.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|I was absolutely hooked from begining to end. Carlito's Way has always been one of the most under rated Mob flicks ever released. I actually thought this movie was far more engrossing that Scar Face.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Folks<br />This is a good album--definitely not their best album--but a good one nonetheless. I would definitely rate it as a must-have for all Maiden fans.<br />I grew up with Maiden. The first album I heard was Number of the beast and that hooked me completely. Then I heard the other masterpieces -- Iron Maiden, Killers etc. etc.<br />After Dickinson left, I kinda stopped listening to Maiden. Don't mistake me--I really appreciate Harris and Nicko and the others, but the Maiden albums were no longer the same with Dickinson gone. Then he came back and I heard Brave New World and now this `Dance with Death'.<br />What I miss is that raw sound of erstwhile Maiden--songs like Children of the Grave, 22 Accacia Avenue, Flight of Icarus etc. etc. The last 2 albums sound polished--too polished and that is probably the problem.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Quite simply the greatest album ever made.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|Well I have to say that this isn't a very orginal plot. The stroy is bland, vapid, and cliche. The acting is good, but we've seen this story before. I really just didn't enjoy this as many people have. The direction is great, and the shooting locations are perfect. Believe me the stunts in this movie is cool, and the ending is rather entertaining, but overall there's a better movie out there waiting for you to watch it.
B00000373U|5.0|what can i say the best there was<BR>R.I.P elliot smith 1969-2003 you'll be missed<BR>&quot;everybody cares&quot;
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Excellent movie. Hillariouse from begining to end. BUT save your money and buy the original DVD release. The extra features on the &quot;Double Secret Probation Edition&quot; are completely worthless and boring.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I will never understand why there can't be room for new rock and roll &quot;gods&quot; without offending people who loved the people they are influenced by.  When the Stones burst onto the scene did everyone say, &quot;oh, they suck 'cuz Otis Redding was doing it first and better&quot;?  I am old enough to have enjoyed Zeppelin the Stones, and even Cream in their prime.  This is in that league.  <BR>     While &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; is my favorite (and also the most predictable cut), &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, &quot;Black Math&quot;, and &quot;There's No Home For You Here&quot;, are just as good.  &quot;Hardest Button to Button&quot; rocks like there is no tomorrow.  <BR>     Even if you don't buy the disc, you owe it to yourself to see this band live.  It was arguably the best show I have ever seen, and I have seen a bunch.  Chemistry and soul are something a band either has or doesn't, and for me, those two elements are far more important than great musicianship.  The Stripes have it all.  Jack White would be on my list of the twenty five greatest rock and roll guitarists right now.  Look, you can spend a hundred bucks watching some dinosaur whose last relevant album was in 1975 or you can spend less than half that to see a great band at the top of their game.  The choice is yours.
B0000C1HLF|3.0|MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) If you could enjoy the first movie you should be able to enjoy this one. It was the same comedy/action found in the first but with a bit more sensuality.<br /><br />2) Speaking about sensuality, it did get tiring after a while seeing all the butt and cleavage shots. It is like McG had to add a little something more than the first movie and he opted for more sex instead of better story. Too bad, which is why I knocked this rating down.<br /><br />3) He did try to get a bit more characterization going by introducing a past to Barrymore's character and Lui's character. Cameron's character doesn't have so much as a past as an attempt to develop her continuing relationship with Wilson. Overall, I like the attempt made at deepening the characters. Whether the attempt was successful or not is a matter of opinion.<br /><br />4) Demi Moore, was great! Her raspy voice and great 40+yr old chisled body didn't seem at all out of place in a movie dominated by 20 year old women. Hats off to Demi.<br /><br />OVERALL: I'm glad I rented it and didn't see it at the going movie theater rate. Will I own it? Probably not because my wife didn't like it at all and I thought it was only a tad better than GOOD, but far from GREAT. If they come out a with a third installment to the series I will definitely watch, but I won't be holding my breath for it. This is a take it or leave it flick.
B00005JLZN|5.0|This movie kept us on the edge of the couch. Excellent suspense movie. The way the story was told kept you guessing what really happened, who did what and why. Forget about death penalty or not, it's just a movie, just enjoy a good story. They don't come easy these days.
B00005JKZV|2.0|The good points? Gollum is fantastic, probably the best-realized character in this movie version of the Trilogy(so far). The scenery and settings, both digital and real, are incredible; you DO feel like you're in Middle Earth.<br />The bad points? Everything else! Why, why, WHY did Peter Jackson and his co-writers feel a need to &quot;improve&quot; upon the original material with new plot devices that manage to spoil the suspense and dialogue that makes George Lucas' STAR WARS scripts read like, well, J.R.R. Tolkien by comparison? The only thing I was left with at the end of THE TWO TOWERS was a sense of dread, scared stiff by the thought of how Jackson's going to mangle THE RETURN OF THE KING! <br />I don't care a bit if my opinion is in the minority: based upon what's been released so far, the only thing that could have been worse than this version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS is if Walt Disney Studios had tried doing it instead.
B00000J7JO|4.0|I liked every song on this disc except for...<br />Around the World (somewhat)<br />Get On Top<br />Emit Remmus<br />I Like Dirt<br />Purple Stain (somewhat)<br />Right On Time<br />Do you see why I don't like these tracks? There's little or no melody to the singing, and the lyrics are really secondary to me. I'm all for better sounding music than shocking lyrics.<br />It's still worth buying though for the songs that are good. I love Savior, Otherside, and Road Trippin' particularly.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Yes. This album is amazing. The best part is the crowd! They are awesome, what a live crowd should be. They (40,000 of them) cheer as loud as they can, they sing all the lyrics, and YYZ!!! Just listen and you can hear them singing the guitar parts. That's an audience every band wishes they could have! Now the songs. Great set list with a solid mix of their more keyboard driven songs, their 70s classics, and their newer stuff including 4 songs off Vapor Trails (that album is awesome). Songs like Distant Early Warning, Roll the Bones, The Big Money, and Natural Science, which were never some of my absolute favorite Rush songs are played very well and sound great. I think I'll listen to them more often now. There are only very few weak points on this album, like the fact that the sound isn't as all together as most would like it. I know that a lot of people will complain about this, but it doesn't bother me at all. The concert, the band still sounds great. Neil explains in the book that the night before this concert, all the equipment was hammered with rain, and that they just didn't have the best recording equipment there. But the recording and mixing crew did a great job with what they had. Also a BIG disappointment is the fact that 2112 isn't all of 2112 as it eludes to. It's just the overture and Temples of Syrinx. But that's ok. I understand why they didn't play the whole thing by looking at how many songs they play at this concert (29!!).  I also hoped they'd play Peaceable Kingdom from Vapor Trails. That's nothing though compared to all the strong points. The music is solid, intense and passionate. Rush performs a solid concert, and should be heard by all. Now for the rundown of songs:<br />Tom Sawyer - Great way to start off the show. Right off the crowd starts singing the lyrics and they cheer so loud after those first few chords and come the keyboard section.<br />Distant Early Warning - Great song. Vocals and guitar sound excellent.<br />New World Man - Not one of my favorites personally, but sounds great here.<br />Roll the Bones - Awesome guitar parts. And the chorus sounds good.<br />Earthshine - One of my favorites from the new album. Alex hits that riff right off and the rest of the song is really powerful. The guitar solo part soars.<br />YYZ - Wow. This crowd knows the band. Just listen to them sing this song. Oh yeah, Rush plays it perfectly, too.<br />The Pass - A smooth uplifting song played with lots of emotion.<br />Bravado - Beautiful song. This one always sounds very good live.<br />The Big Money - Played very well, and for those who enjoy The Simpsons... just wait.<br />The Trees - I love this song especially live. And this version is no exception. Beautiful classical guitar part at the beginning, and then ... BOOM! The electric guitar comes in the rest of the song is great.<br />Free Will - Great song played with lots of power and emotion.<br />Closer to the Heart - If you can't hear the crowd's excitement, you should see it on the DVD. Rush performs this as perfectly as always. A great song to play live.<br />Natural Science - Another great song, played better here than the studio. Sounds really good.<br />One Little Victory - Neil lays down that furious drum part and from then on it's awesome.<br />Driven - Excellent version of the song with a very cool bass solo midway through the song.<br />Ghost Rider - A good choice to play live from Vapor Trails. Geddy plays that smooth bass part to start it off, and the rest of the song rocks.<br />Secret Touch - Powerful and intense version of another one from Vapor Trails. This version really kicks!<br />Dreamline - Again, another song that always sounds really good live.<br />Red Sector A - Weird song but played very well.<br />Leave That Thing Alone - Sweet instrumental with a great groove and an intense heavier section.<br />O Baterista - Amazing, really long drum solo with a cool jazzy way to end it. Neil is king.<br />Resist - Alex and Geddy play this acoustic. No bass guitar. Sounds different but good.<br />2112 - Not the whole thing, but the best version of the overture I've ever heard. Awesome! And Temples of Syrinx really rocks hard.<br />Limelight - Played with lots of emotion and really good musicianship.<br />La Villa Strangiato - Great instrumental with a really good beat and then later on it gets pretty strange. It sounds funny and weird in the middle. Then it picks back up into a fierce song. Cool bass parts.<br />The Spirit of Radio - Starts off with Alex just flying through that beautiful guitar part with Geddy and Neil playing those off-beats and then it flows right into that cool part and then... Just take my word it's awesome!<br />By-Tor and the Snow Dog - Played quick and upbeat just like on the album. Sounds great!<br />Cygnus X-1 - Very groovy intro and solid the rest of the way through. Again not the whole thing.<br />Working Man - Alex soars on this song (just like the rest of them). This song is awesome.<br />Between Sun & Moon - Sounds good and smooth. Good version of the song.<br />Vital Signs - Heavier guitar part than on Moving Pictures. Sounds really good. I like this version better than on the original. A better feel to it.<br />And that's it. The band sounds really good on every song and ... what more can I say. I'm gonna go watch the DVD (even better than the CD). I highly recommend this concert to every Rush fan and anyone who enjoys a band who knows how to write and play good music. Everyone must buy both the CD and DVD. So go on... Get to it. And hey, if you don't like Rush, just buy it for the cover. It don't get better than that.coustic. No bass guitar.

B000088E6D|5.0|One morning on the way to work, I was tuned in to a radio Jazz station and \\"Moondance\\" was playing. I said to myself: Oh my what a voice! It couldn't be Harry Connick Jr, couldn't be Michael Feinstein, couldn't be Bobby Caldwell, definitely not Frank Sinatra or Mel Torme! Who is this singer?  After the song the DJ said: \\"You just heard \\"Moondance\\" by  Michael Bubl&eacute;, pronounced as (Boo-blay) from his self-titled CD.\\" I've never heard of him so I checked him out at Amazon and ordered the CD. And to my surprise, I found myself not only listening to it but singing along as well. Simply put, I enjoyed and loved it.<br /><br />It has great selection of songs from the initial track \\"Fever,\\" followed by one of my favorites, \\"Moondance\\" (makes you sing along & snap your fingers).  Listening to the slower ones such as \\"Kissing A Fool,\\" \\"The Way You Look Tonight,\\" \\"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\\" and \\"Put Your Head On My Shoulder\\" makes you want to fall in love again!  His remarkable renditions of \\"Come Fly With Me\\" and \\"Summer Wind\\" are almost like the legendary Francis Albert Sinatra's style.  \\"For Once In My Life\\" and one of the Bee Gees hit songs, \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart?\\" are equally delightful.<br /><br />\\"I can still feel the breeze<br />That rustles through the trees<br />And misty memories of days gone by<br />We could never see tomorrow<br />No one said a word about the sorrow\\"<br /><br />If you're in the mood for dancing and swinging and want to be cool and hip, then dance to the tune of \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" where he sings the refrain with so much flair and style. Likewise, the danceable beat of \\"Sway\\" will make you get up and dance to the rhythm.<br /><br />The last track, \\"That's All,\\" is one of my all-time favorites that he interprets with heartfelt emotion. Hopefully, it's not \\"that's all\\" for this young and promising new singer with a fabulous voice and a great sense of style. He deserves a pat on the back. Congratulations Michael Bubl&eacute; for a wonderful debut album! I look forward to your follow-up album.<br /><br />This recording is simply superb and it will be a welcome addition to your collection. Wholeheartedly recommended!Michael Bubl&eacute; for a wonderful debut album!

B00006CXXU|5.0|I have always laughed, upon hearing it mentioned that there is any similarity between Christina and Brittany.  Finally, this album should put that issue to rest for everyone.  Christina is the one who is and always has been truly vocally gifted.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|The main problem with Dance of Death is that it gets off to a not so good start with Wildest Dreams.  But once the next track &quot;Rain Maker&quot; comes on the below average Wildest Dreams is forgotten about.  No More Lies is good, but sounds a little unoriginal, and tends to seem drawn out towards the end.  Montsegur is an awesome song, probably my favorite on the album.  The opening to the next song Dance of Death is way too long, but the main riff that is played along with a symphony sound is really good.  The vocals on that track I thought fit the song really well, but other than that none of the riffs seem to stick out in that song.  Track 6 and 7 are a little too close to fillers for me.  I usually skip right through those.  Paschendale starts out really good, the only problem with that song is it gets way too drawn out.  Face in the Sand and Age of Innocence are both well rounded songs.  The last track doesn't really seem to fit on the album, and it gets repetitious.  Overall the album isn't too bad, but nothing spectacular.
B000002UB3|4.0|Wow,what can i say except, AMAZING!! &quot;Something&quot; is the greatest love song ever, and &quot;come together&quot; is a great blues-mellow rock song, four stars for the four most talented artists even. I would have given five but giving two to Lennon and 1 each for Harrison, McCartney and Starr is not very  fair. It could be the best cd by the Beatles.
B00000DHRZ|2.0|this group used to one of the all time greatest punk bands around with, NOFX, RANCID, PENNYWISE and such... as a huge die-hard offspring fan, it is hard to give my favorite band sucha review. The songs are not as punk-driven as the original offspring...the lyrics have matured, yet are a little worst. The drums/bass are the same...yet not as noticeable as in &quot;Ignition&quot; &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot; &quot;Offspring (self titled) and such. Everyone who wrote a good review about this was either because of the song &quot;pretty fly (for a white guy)&quot; or because they do not know the offspring well. lets see what offspring can do with their new cd coming out in december 2003..
B00006BTCA|5.0|Forget about the reviews, the constant comparisons to Joy Division (yes, they do sound alike) and just listen to the music. I'm not one who tries to disect every chord, every note; I can only tell you that the songs sound amazing. They lend a very mellow, atmospheric mood that is perfect for any time (or emotion.) And, anyways, even if you don't care much for the smart, insightful lyrics... get it for Carlos' great bass riffs.
0385504209|5.0|Brilliant! A Priceless piece of art.<br />Restoring the much needed feminine balance in our world today would heal this planet. This book will creates waves of changing people's outlook and thought patterns...it will touch many.
0385504209|2.0|I read this book, believe it or not, for a history class at the University of California, Berkeley.  The plot was fairly entertaining, and it was readable to a degree that I was able to finish most of it at the last minute (ahhh the college years).  This is why it gets two stars.<br />The problem is that it furthers an unfounded, oversimplistic, and extremely dangerous view of history.  I've read that reviewers go on to brag that they have checked the information in the book via the internet.  Well that's great, but SCHOLARS DON'T PUBLISH ON THE INTERNET.  Half-baked conspiracy theorists do.  Chances are you would find pages and pages filled with \\"evidence\\" supporting the goddess theory and the rest of Brown's claims, when the truth is that source material, combined with a little bit of common sense, propose a far more complex and realistic picture.  Could a logical thinker truly assume that, before Christianity, everybody was enlightened and happy in a society in which there was equality between the sexes?  Medieval Christianity had many abuses, but the truth is that the spread of Christianity through the Roman empire was actually associated with many advances in the condition of women.<br />Bottom line:  If you want an enteraining read, feel free to indulge (although I can think of a few books i'd rather read).  But don't take any of Brown's claims seriously.
1891252089|5.0|The great thing about David Swenson's book is that it is true to the pure form of Astanga Vinyasa Yoga, allowing for certain points of style. Most books go for the &quot;power yoga&quot; option, which is really more of a spin-off from Astanga Vinyasa, and this can lead to discrepancies and omissions in the form and series of postures. David is also very tolerant in his approach which I think works well for beginners (up to a point) since this is a very demanding practice and it would be easy to be put off. As long as it is understood that the book is not a substitute for a teacher, this shouldn't be a problem. Alternatives are provided in all situations where a practitioner might have difficulty. As well as the physical practice there is a lot of very informative background information which helps to put the whole practice of Astanga Vinyasa Yoga into context. And of course the spiral binding means the book can lie open which makes it easy to use during practice. An excellent book which I would recommend very highly.
B00008J4P5|3.0|Can't say much about this album, it's definitely good. I can't say it's great, but it is far from being mediocre or bad. Sounds are addictive and wonderfully raw. Worth getting, for sure.
B00004R99K|4.0|Disney's version, although not as true to the original atmosphere and storyline of the books, is a delightful family feature. Kathryn Beaumont's voice performance is very sweet and sympathetic. The animation in this film is spectacular, bringing<BR>the colour of the characters to life. The music score and songs<BR>will get the kiddies going, and has a sensible charm that will also entertain the adults too. Overall, a nice movie.
B00009TB5G|4.0|The extended version of The TT is going to be a lot better then the theatrical version (as was The FOTR). The Two Towers is a big book, and to put it into a 3 hour timeframe is hard to do. The extended version will hopefully make up for some of the scenes left out (the disgruntled forest for example). If you have the non-extended version DvD, make sure to check out the preview for the extended version, it will show you some nice scenes. On the other hand though, there is little excuse for the stuff which was added to the film (Arwen Saga, wargs, Helms deep accounting for a third of the movie). But then again, you want to keep the movie somewhat exciting, and Tolkein can lecture on in some parts. If you have not read any LOTR books you will like the movie a lot more then if you haven't, but if given the choice read the books first.
B00005OMTT|5.0|This CD of 18 Enigma singles is a truly great and haunting album. <br />My favorite album of theirs is arguably their first album with it's dark and haunting Gothic sound to it. &quot;Sadeness&quot; finds it's way on this haunting collection and merges so well into the intense &quot;Silence Must Be Heard&quot;. <br />The new songs on this album while not bad by any means, are relatively forgettable and among ENigma's least interesting songs. <br />Some of the songs on here are altered from their original sounds. &quot;TNT for the Brain&quot; on here is much darker and far superior to the original. <br />This album is a must-have, even if you already have their original albums.
B00007LTIA|5.0|The music of Tales From Topographical Oceans requires one to have open ears and an open mind. This isn't a &quot;rock album&quot; by any means - It's a musical journey, a LONG musical journey. <BR>Yes created these 4 compositions to tell a story, but it is my opinion that they also meant for them to be heard, felt and experienced for what they are, even if they're not easily understood. I truly enjoy this music. I can sit back and absorb it and let it take me somewhere else. Some may love it, some may hate it, but then Progressive music has always been an acquired taste. But if you're somewhat compelled, Buy this, open your ears, open your mind and enjoy the music.
B000088E6P|5.0|I just love this CD, it has great beats and sound. I just wanted the CD so bad and now I finally have it. This is what I think about the songs:<br />1. Intro (skit): Where is the gunshot?<br />2. What Up Gangsta? (5/5): I always start off with this one<br />3. Patiently Waiting (5/5): One of my favorites because Em has a great verse.<br />4. Many Men (4/5): Good song, but you can barely hear it becuz of editing<br />5. In Da Club (5/5): The album's first single. Great beats<br />6. High All The Time (5/5): I love this song, has very nice beats<br />7. If I Can't (5/5): Great beats<br />8. Blood Hound (2/5): I don't listen to this one that much<br />9. Back Down (5/5): Awesome song.<br />10. P.I.M.P. (5/5): The album's third single. Great song.<br />11. Like My Style (5/5): Good song.<br />12. Poor Lil Rich (4/5): Good song.<br />13. 21 Questions (5/5): The album's second single. Great song<br />14. Don't Push Me (5/5): Another good song with Eminem<br />15. Gotta Make It To Heaven (5/5): I like the beats<br />16. Wanksta (5/5): 50's long time hit single since 2001. Good song<br />17. U Not Like Me (4/5): Good song.<br />18. Life's On The Line (4/5): Pretty good song. He sounds a little weird in it like it isn't 50 cent singing this song.<br /> If you don't like rap music, don't write such upsetting reviews! It bothers me alot.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Its really not a bad flick at all... the unfortunate thing is that it doesn't end. I've talked with alot of people who rip the movie to shreds and then go on to admit that they didn't even understand it. Very few people have put in the time to really think about what the Architect is even saying at the end of the movie. I think that the Worchowsky bros. wanted this movie to be something of a mystery with all the hints but none of the answers... I think they were hoping that people would think about it. I enjoyed it. I want to see the next one before I make any final conclusions about the movie though, since I feel like I've only seen half of it. But giving it one star is just ridiculous.... Even if you didn't like it as much as the first movie, you have to admit that its not THAT bad.  It seems that these online opinions just invite people to charge in with superlatives though... Don't jump on the bandwagon.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|There's little sense in over-intellectualizing the work that is Enigma.  This album presented a scaled down front as opposed to &quot;Screen Behind the Mirror&quot;, which was, to say the least, uber-orchestrated.  You'll find the occasional beat heavy pieces on &quot;Voyageur&quot;-- but nothing so ostentacious as to turn down your speakers for fear of blowing them out.  In fact, there's a lighter, crisper feel to the music.  Indeed, it's much like being on the outside, looking in on a voyage into places beyond.<br />The theme here resides in a sense of vocals and beats as opposed to central samplings from whichever source is the flavor of the year.  Note, in MCMXC A.D. the Gregorian chant was much the focal point; in Cross of Changes we heard something to the effect of aboriginal beats and intonations; Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi! put forth a wildly alluring focus on Southeastern Asian rhythms and chants-- and for some reason Screen Behind the Mirror delved into the realm of Opera, more specifically Orff's &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;.  The latter, of which, didn't seem to appeal, despite the addition of explosive percussion tracks to an already celebrated classic.  Voyageur, while lacking in central theme, hardly lacks.  The choices made in the album were quite so in accordance with the group's overall style, capturing an ambience lost in &quot;Screen&quot;, more reminiscent of the voluptuous sound of &quot;Le Roi...&quot;
B000002J1F|5.0|Like most Yes Fans, Fragile is what made a believer out of me! The first time I heard &quot;Roundabout&quot; was at a 70's party about 2 years ago.I was instantly hooked on that song and thus began my quest to collect this disc and other Yes recordings. Fragile rocks like no other album! &quot;South Side Of The Sky&quot; is prime prog-rock, &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot; is both catchy &amp; clever, but the album closes with one of the many Yes long-form classics, &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise&quot;! That track alone is worth the purchase of this disc! They Just Don't Make Music Like This Anymore!
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold does a wonderful job using her life experience to write The Lovely Bones, following her memoir Lucky.  The Lovely Bones is a sad story, yet uplifting.  The main character Susie Salmon tells the story of her brutal rape and murder, and the after affects on her friends and family as she watches from heaven.  On a snowy day in December 1973, she was tricked by her neighbor Mr. Harvey to follow him into  a underground hideaway. He claimed he built it for the children to play in but it was just an excuse to satisfy his illness.  Susie was only 14 years old when she suffered this tragedy.  Sebold claims, that everyone has their own version of heaven.  Susie's heaven is in the place she never got to visit while on earth, high school.  A heaven of her \\" simplest dreams,\\" where \\"there were no teachers, we never had to go inside except for art class, the boys didn't pinch our backsides or tell us we smelled, and our textbooks were Seventeen, Glamour and Vogue.\\"  <BR> While Susie struggles to except her death, she watches the slow destruction of her family and friends.  Her fathers obsession to find her killer which almost gets him killed.  Her mothers starts to disappear from the family and after committing adultery she leaves her loved ones behind.  Her younger sister Lindsay faces her sisters death throughout her teens with Susie's spirit by her side.  Her little brother Buckley tries to understand the death of his biggest sister and the affect it has taken of his family.  Also having to grow up without a mother.  <BR> Susie also watches down on school mate Ruth, who feels her spirit all the time, and a boy Ray who she once shared a kiss with.  She describes the kiss as \\"like an accident a beautiful gasoline rainbow.\\"  While Susie is in heaven, she comes to find out that she wasn't Mr. Harvey's only victim.  Although Susie and her family live many rough years there's a happy ending.  I have to admit that I was a little disappointed with the ending, but my lovefor the book was much greater.
B00008IAMD|5.0|WOW, Is the first expletive that comes to my mind. This album moved me more than I can remember any moving me before. I have listened to it 5 times through now and I still get tears in my eyes from the emotion pouring out of Johnny in this album. I don't know if a non fan of Johnny would get the same thing if they didn't know about the highs and lows in his life. The sweet and the outlaw, but I for one love it. I recommend this album to any one that loves good music with a tale.
B000062X9B|5.0|The most mind-blowing aspect I found about this album was the way he took songs that I didn't even necessarily like, and made them his own. (As opposed to the standard cover formula of today: play it faster with distortion...I'm looking in your direction, Ataris...) He brings an amazing sadness to the music, and makes you listen to the emotion he brings. On U2's &quot;One,&quot; he demonstrates the frustration in losing his love, while on Neil Diamond's, &quot;Solitary Man,&quot; he holds almost a pride in his affirmation of his lonliness. It's difficult to hear Nick Cave's &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; and NOT believe it is Johnny's own words. Cash is amazing, and proves once again that he is the true American icon.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This film is the greatest film of all time, and the DVD is by no means average. Packed full of extras and fantastic documentaries this is a must for all Lord of The Rings fanatics. Jackson is a genius and the acting, plot and action sequences are breathtaking. I recommend you definately BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!
0385505833|4.0|I enjoyed this book, and it would be a great movie.  I think that it had many halirous antics that just added to the story.  It was a very enjoyable book with a great plot.  I think that grisham was smart to move away from his thrilling lawyer books and move to a more light topic.  As luther and Nora krank have numerous differnt thing happen to them that makes it harder and harder to skip christmas the movie just gets funnier and funnier.  If any one makes this a movie i will go see it
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I think that A Perfect Cirlce is one of the best bands nowadays.  Their music has so much talent and it just grabs me.  I rate this CD 5 stars.
B000000HZT|4.0|You can really hear Tony's contributions to Genesis on this album.  Those gorgeous chord progressions, even in their simplist forms, are so reminiscent of his work with Genesis.  The instrumental songs are lush; the vocal songs are very good.  &quot;Lucky Me&quot; is such a beautifully composed song, and &quot;For A While&quot; sounds instantly familiar even if you've never heard it before - it's just one of those naturally appealing songs.  My only gripe is with the horribly dissonant fourth verse of the chorus in &quot;Somebody Else's Dream&quot;: for me, that just ruined an otherwise powerful song with magnificient chords.  The CD sound is a bit veiled and soft, but a great album anyway.
0061092037|1.0|This book is an incredible waste of time.  Two amoral main characters do not make for an interesting read.  Archer goes on at imponderable length to describe the lives of these two slugs passing as kings of the publishing industry.  Do not waste your time or money reading this pile of crap.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Warner Brothers (WB) Studios has begun meticulously digitally restoring its action classics of the 1930's &amp; 40's under the &quot;Two Disc Special Edition&quot; Series.  This 1938 TECHNICOLOR (awesome) film &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; starring Errol Flynn, Olivia deHavilland, Basil Rathbone &amp; Claude Rains is still the best rendition of this fictionalized English tale.<br />Warner Brothers has given us with this 2 Disc set the complete movie theatre experience circa 1938.  DISC 1 - First we get a complete &quot;Night at the Movies&quot; program.  Introduction by film critic Leonard Maltin explaining for your 10 cent investment what you got in a 1938 movie house.  Next the entire continous show with; coming attraction, news reel, Bugs Bunny Cartoon, short subject feature and then the main feature, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;.  This is a totally ingenius idea!!!  Also on Disc 1 - you have 12 Errol Flynn movie trailers and finally an indepth feature commentary by film historian Rudy Belhmer.<br />Disc 2 - Includes 3 hours of everything about Robin Hood, the movie, the stars, documentaries, cartoons, and a most informative documentary about TECHNICOLOR and why even today it still was the best color process ever.<br />I love this fun filled DVD set.  My hat is off to Warner Brothers for their dedication to the golden age of Hollywood and bring back the grandest of movies for us to see again &amp; again better than their original release.  Enjoy.
0385504209|3.0|Well, two of my friends insisted I read this book, so I did. I've read better books, although I did finish it. I guess the 'rapid fire' and 'action-packed' etc, etc, nature of the book got to me, it all seems a bit pat, i.e. the right things just keep happening to these two rather flat characters. It would be a good airplane book, the kind you could read and follow with a huge jet engine roaring outside your window.<br />I haven't reviewed a book that had 1200 other Amazon reviews, and I see huge piles of this book in the brick-and-mortar stores, so I am probably in the minority on this one.
0800179501|5.0|This is my idea of a martial arts movie. This not only looks at the combative side of martial arts, but the mental aspect as well. Ralph Maccio does a good job of portraying a boy who goes through the hardships of both school and learning martial arts. Being a martial artist for 10 years is hard training, and similar methods were used in this movie that I had to go through. Plus, the music fits well with the theme of the movie, so it keeps you interested.
B00000612P|5.0|If you only have money enough for one Rod Stewart album - this is the one. This is the best that Rod Stewart ever did. I can't listen to his new stuff - I can't listen to much of any of his work after this album - it's just not that good. But this album shines. Every Picture Tells a Story is my most favorite song that he ever did. This whole album is so very good.
0679600019|5.0|I picked up this book on a whim at a local bookstore knowing little to nothing about Oscar Wilde.  This story kept me entranced the entire time.  I, like Basil, was completely infautated with Dorian Gray from the moment his name was annouced.  A beautiful boy completely unspoiled by the darkness in the world.  A boy immeressed in the decendance of his times. When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him.  This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes. Dorian uses this completely to his advantage and commits selfish and horrible acts all the while hidden under a charming smile and innocent face.  A Picture of Dorian Gray is now one of my most favorite books of all time.  If only Wilde had written more than one novel!
0375759174|4.0|This is a very amusing novel, and Cathereine Morland's adventures in Bath are very entertaining.  But after she gets to Northanger Abbey it is a bit of a letdown. When she starts to suspect that General Tilney has done away with his wife, how much better it would have been if that had, in fact, been the case.  naturally Catherine would find the proof to convict the General.  It could have been the start of a gret mystery series, under the general title of the Morland Mysteries, or Miss Morland Investigates.  Hnery Tilney could have been her amiable but obtuse sidekick, poor old henry, he never gets the murderer's identity right.  Miss Austen missed a golden opportunity here.  It's not that I don't like her novels, I do very much, it's just that I think they'd be better if there were more murders in them.
B000065BPB|5.0|For the (...) or so I paid on amazon for these headphones, I am well impressed.  I consider myself an mild audiophile.<P>When purchasing headphones, I was looking primarily at these and the Bose Triport and Quiet Comfort headphones.  The sound quality of the Bose headphones was on par with these.  I personally have never listened to headphones that have impressed me with regard to bass, but these do as well as any others.  The mids and highs, however, are great.  Therefore, these were a steal for half the price of the Triport.  I was drawn toward the Quiet Comfort because of the noise-cancelling; however, if you have ever listened to the Quiet Comfort, they don't sound great unless you have the sound-cancelling on.  All of the air chambers sound like you have a shell up to your ear when the noise-cancelling is off: awful!  So if you're fine with chewing through batteries even when you have no ambient noise to drown out, then they are a great headphone set.<P>I decided to write an amazon.com review of these headphones--I've never written one before--only after taking them with me on an airplane for the first time.  I was disappointed the last time I brought my earbuds with me: I couldn't hear the movie on my laptop even though it was turned all the way up.  These headphones don't disappoint.  The primary thing to know about them before you buy them is that they grip you head quite well.  Positive consequence: the screaming baby who was sitting one row behind me (literally) was virtually drowned out, not to mention the drone of the jet engines.  Because they grip your head so strongly, they block out the ambient noise and let you listen to what you want to listen to.  Negative consequence: they're somewhat uncomfortable for longer periods.  The fatigue is due to the physical structure, though, not because of harshness of the speakers.<P>The upshot: if you're willing to sacrifice a little comfort for a great sounding alternative to noise-cancelling, these are your headphones.  I paid less than eighty bucks and I'd take these over competitors that cost twice that price.
B00000JPHD|2.0|Lon Chaney was booked to star in the title role of this film, but unfortunately died just prior to shooting. Bela Lugosi, who had starred in the stage production of Dracula was brought in right before shooting started. The movie suffers for this. Lugosi does not have time to learn how to act for the camera. I don't know what kind of plans director Todd Browning had for the Chaney version, but the final Lugosi version looks like a mere filming of the stage play. Set up the camera in front of the proscenium, and flip it on, and then leave it on autopilot. There is no innovation, and no significant script changes made to take advantage of the film medium.<br />This film is still worth seeing, just don't go in with the high expectations this film's reputation may lead you to have. If you are expecting to be overwhelmed by the drama, you will be disappointed. If you are expecting to be scared out of your skin, you will be disappointed. If you want a good, scary vampire film, try either version of Nosferatu, or the Frank Langella version of Dracula.
B0000DC13U|3.0|A rarely screened late 60's curio, &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot; looms larger as a legend in the minds of those who have namechecked it over the years than as a bonifide &quot;classic&quot;. While it's great to have it available on DVD, 35 years passing have not been kind to the film's scattershot approach. Director Jean-Luc Goddard is not exactly famous for linear narrative, so it's not like I was expecting &quot;ABBA: The Movie&quot;, but I found this film rough going all the same. The premise: Goddard was given permission to film the Stones working in the studio on thier classic &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot;. He took this footage and intercut it with Black Panthers spouting political rhetoric and conducting &quot;guerilla theater&quot; vignettes about the &quot;Revolution&quot;.  While I think we &quot;get&quot; the analogy between the seeds of creativity (the Stones methodically building the song in the studio) and the seeds of Revolution  (being sown in the streets), the repetitive nature of the dated rhetoric wears out its welcome quickly. This does leave one pondering as to whom, exactly, the film is for. Music fans will probably find the interruptions annoying; history buffs studying 60's politics will likely find the Stones superfluous. Personally, I found the beautifully shot Stones footage enough to warrant hanging on to my copy. If you're looking for a classic 60's MUSIC film with the Stones, check out &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; instead. If you're looking for a time capsule of 60's POLITICS, try &quot;Medium Cool&quot; or &quot;Putney Swope&quot;. Unfortunately, while &quot;Sympathy&quot; contains a good amount of both,it never successfully connects with either music OR politics.
B00006ZCFH|1.0|I love Badu first of all, but this album is good if you are under as much influence as erikah was. Issac Hayes and the jammers back then had long songs but it wasn't just an idea. It was fleshed out. This is underground? No Nina Cherry is underground, black rock and roll is underground. This album is garbage. I wished she pushed herself out of this neo soul idea and created a sound. When she did the rock thing at the end of I Want You, I got excited. But it faded. What she was about to do but cut off was underground. SHe was about to bring Hendrix, Grace Jones, Mayfield, Miles, Mingus and Bad Brains back, but she punked out. Oh well, I'll wait til someone is brave enough to be different.
B000002JS6|5.0|That pretty much sums it up. Most people know the story behind this album, but here's a short version if you don't: AC/DC had just had their big U.S. breakthrough with Highway to Hell, behind the guitars and songwriting of the Young brothers and the powerhouse voice and charisma of Bon Scott. Bon got drunk one night and passed out in a friend's car and was left there for the night. He vomited in his sleep, choked and died. Everyone assumed AC/DC was dead, but the band knew Bon's passion for rock n roll would want them to continue. They auditioned singers and found a diamond in the rough in Brian Johnson, then went into the studio focused on giving Bon the perfect musical farewell.<br />Now, the album. The tolling of the bell for Bon opens it ominously but perfectly, leading into Hell's Bells. Right away I was blown away by the pure range and power Brian delivers. You know this is something special. Don't think they're playing mournfully either, this is still down n dirty AC/DC rock, just more intense. They get back to more typical subject matter with the fun Shoot to Thrill, and by the time you get to What You Do For Money Honey the middle of the album just grooves along like no collection of songs you've ever heard. The title track is an all-time great (just like everything here) metal march that is the most personally linked to Bon. Everyone knows You Shook Me All Night Long, and it still holds up. The album rolls along to the song that gives a great middle finger to the people that would come to call AC/DC too vulgar or juvenile: Rock N Roll Aint Noise Pollution. The perfect anthem for rock fans to pump their fists too, it closes the album with a thunderous bang. So enough of me talking, go get this album and see the greatness you're missing. Like the last song says it just \\"makes good, good sense.\\"
B0000028M7|5.0|Every song on this album is a masterpiece.  If I were to be stranded on an island and i could only take one album with me, this would be it.  Every song on this CD is perfect.  I especially love their harmonization, amazing solos, and unusual time signatures.  Kurt Cobain was a great singer, but not even he came close to being the grunge god that was Layne Staley.  Have you noticed how everyone seems to have a different set of favorite songs from this CD?  That's because every song is perfect.  I'll actually think one of the songs is my favorite then listen to the album again a month later and change my mind and think another song is my favorite because each song is so unique and good.
B000083E79|4.0|I must say that I remember first hearing cher was her (turn back time)plus her cool video to it. Then later was (I got you babe) with Bevis and Buthead in 1993, also the movie mask.. cool. I became a Cher listener in 1998. with Believe and on. Cher does rock, BUT DOES NOT RULE. This goes to MR. LOEZA in mexico. SORRY but MADONNA needs no lessons from anyone, Especially Cher, Madonnas face of transformation (NOT PLASTIC SURGERY),music/hits and FAME is much larger than cher, even Cher herself knows it and said it ( I think madonna does it better than anybody else) So bite your tongue KID. Anyway I like this collection alot.. thanks
B000068PNQ|2.0|OK, let me start off by saying that I am indeed a VU fan and do not write this to bash the band, I just want to warn those who are unsuspecting and think that this package is actually &quot;deluxe&quot;, because it's not.  This album is essentially the original release, some Nico songs thrown in and the un-edited version of the album.  This may sound like a lot of great stuff, but pay attention.  The Nico songs can be bought seperately, they are not exclusive to this release.  But the real problem is that the second disc sounds so identically similar to the original that it defeats its own purpose.  I've listened to the discs with headphones on and there are differences, but they are so small and slight that even the most devoted fan probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference in a blind taste test.  If you are trully a completionist and want every VU release, by all means knock yourself out, but if you already own the original don't waste your money.  Finally, if you don't own the original or the deluxe, definitely by the original, it is one of the most under-rated and under-appreciated rock n roll albums of all time.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Simple rock, end of story. The album's filled with catchy riffs and simple beats. However, somewhat repeatitive in many ways. The 1st album for any band needs these &quot;pop&quot; tones to it to build a name for themselves. It is a great 1st album, but not a great album. The strokes is a very progressive band and for that reason i'm very excited to see their next few albums then to judge. The song &quot;someday&quot; and &quot;is this it&quot; raised many questions about ourselves, through those songs you can tell that their lyrics actully aimed towards our life style and question it... is this it? after school, after college, after getting a house in a middle-class town, after everything still not getting the satifaction, is this it? The band promise very intellectual and artistic abilities, their next few albums should be very cool.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This review is not for Stones fans, Stones fans already have this album.  This is for the new-comer.  There is no reason to not own this album.  If you don't have a cd player buy the tape.  Don't have a tape player, but the LP, just as long as you own the album in some form.  But, if you do own a cd player, and especially a SACD (super audio cd) player, then absolutely buy this album.  This might be the best album they ever released, and seeing how the Stones are one of the greatest bands of all time, well you do the math.  Basically the album sounds great, the music is great...I realize this isn't very descriptive, but I don't think I have the words to encapsulate this album.  Just buy it, you'll like it.
B000066NW0|1.0|GOODNESS ME!!!!!!!! This is one of the worst / most annoying albums that has dared gone on the shelves since Cliff Richard was first introduced to the music industry. <br />She calls herself 'Punk', but this album is as much punk as Slipknot is classical music. As for the song 'Sk8er Boi', apart from the poor grammar in the song title, Avril Lavigne most likely knows as much about skating as a toilet brush, and probably thinks that a skateboard is a flat wooden cooking implement for carrying fish. <br />What makes me cringe most, is the fact that this trash is referred to by small children and pre-adolescent girls and 'punk' or 'hardcore grunge' or 'death metal' when it is obviously nothing more than some crappy pop music that a chimpanzee could perform by pushing a button. It is very lucky for Avril that this has happened to her, for if it hadn't she would probably have gone into some illegal shenanigans such as drug dealing or prostitution. On the whole, a very bad album. Please, Avril, do give up the day job, and never darken our CD players or radio waves again.
B0000AFX64|2.0|As stated in a review for the BSG series, I have some grave doubts and misgivings as I watch this film. It does look beautful--Universal did not flinch from producing a great looking craft with the Galactica, the costumes look fine, and everything else shows that some cash was spent on the look of the show. The cast looked great and the music was pretty decent. However, the story is the problem--and it is a big one.<BR> For one thing, the story starts out with a strong hour--the destruction of the colonial fleet and the homeworlds. Then the feeling that there is something wrong with certain survivors and how they are getting all the food and all their needs met while everyone else is starving--no problem. However, and it is a big however, the story makes a sharp turn downward with the use of the casino and especially the three vocalists--with the three faces.  These take the story into realms that it did not need to go. <BR> The casino looks fake, the costumes seem a part of the 1970s and not a future place and time--or whenever you wish to place the tale.  The actions of Starbuck doesn't ring true. A seasoned warrior would not just place himself into this casino and try to win the services of the three (nine?) vocalists. It seemed fake when it was first shown and it stills feels faked. The show was at it's best on the bridge of the Galactica and this bit of silliness wrecks a promising beginning. Also, the idea of a few blasts from the warrior's firearms causing enough blazes to set the whole planet to blow up is just a bit too much.  Even with the basestar nearby, the viewer has not seen enough explosions to cause the temperature of the whole planet to rise to a high enough degree to blow up.<BR> So, a promising beginning is destroyed.  The problem of BSG, both film and series, is the same which caused the ruin of the other big space epic of the 1970s, \\"Space: 1999\\", the writers--especially Larson & Bellarsario, were only loosely aware of what makes good SF stories on the small screen.  These producers would take promising plots from films (think of DB's \\"Jag\\" which came out after the film \\"A Few Good Men\\" or his \\"Airwolf\\" which came out after \\"Blue Thunder\\".)  They could copy plots, but they were and are not the best at writing TV SF--a trick learned by J.M.S. of \\"Babylon Five.\\"
B000002AZ8|5.0|This was the first PJ album that I had ever purchased, way back in 1995. At the time I'd heard alot of the songs from TEN &amp; VS played alot on the radio but I didn't really feel compelled to go out and buy a PJ CD until I heard &quot;Not For You&quot; &amp; &quot;Betterman&quot; and thought I'd better finally check these guys out. Well the rest is history as they have gone on to become my favourite band of all time.<br />This album really surprised me at first listen as I was expecing to hear something similar to the singles released off TEN &amp; Vs, but this album has a very, very different sound and feel about it than it's 2 predecessors. Took a few listens before I was really hooked and now listening to it today is nothing short of aural ecstasy. It's an album that has aged well unlike it's predecessors which sound a little too 'polished' today. This album marked the beginning of a more mature and raw sound that PJ have carried through to today. The 'real' (10) tracks are all outstanding. Ofcourse there are the short filler tracks (4) also but oddly enough they all work well within the album IMHO, even the last track which is quite weird especially if listening with headphones on. 'Last Exit' is arguably one of the best album openers on any PJ album (right up there with 'Go' from Vs) and 'Corduroy', 'STBC', 'Not For You', 'Betterman' &amp; 'Immortality' are nothing short of all-time PJ classic material. Simply a great rock album and one of my all-time favourites. Give it a spin....5 stars.
B0000399WI|5.0|From start to finish, you can't go wrong with The Shawshank Redemption. This movie is gonna break your heart, and then mend it ever so gently as the movie progresses.  By the end, you'll have the biggest smile on your face, and want to hug the person next to you.  People who have seen it knows exactly what i'm talking about.  What an amazing movie!<br />I was so impressed with this movie i went to buy the DVD, and it was well worth my money.  I watched it over and over again with my girlfriend, and we never get bored with it.  This movie is a classic and it's one of the staples in my DVD collection.  I strongly recommend it to everyone.  If you haven't seen it already, what are you waiting for?
B000092ZYX|3.0|When I bought \\"Hail To The Thief\\",  I expected the songs from the group to be like its hit song 'There, There': light, mellow, but enthralling.  After listening to the whole album, I realized that the emphasis of this album is on light and mellow, and I also realized that I've fallen asleep halfway through the album.<br />I wouldn't say this is a bad thing, it's good to hear an album that doesn't deal with any head-banging moments that I've grew to love in music.  However, the album is very heavy on its light-hearted content.  Never have I heard an album as mellow as this, and it becomes a tiresome experience;  I actually believe I found the perfect cure for insomnia.<br />From the songs I didn't sleep through, I find them to be very good.  '2+2=5', while an incomprehensible song title, starts off slow, but it becomes pulsating and catchy later on.  'When I End and You Begin' is eerie, but it moves me by its atmospheric-related music background.  'Go To Sleep'...strange, all the other songs put me to sleep except this one, which is good, because I find it to be more energetic and upbringing; the same goes for 'A Punchup in a Wedding'.  Finally, 'A Wolf at the Door'.  It's always good to end a album with a bang, and that's what this song has done.  My least favorite song in this album has got to be 'Sit Down. Stand Up'.  Not only is it boring to listen to, but also just as silly.  After hearing \\"The Raindrops\\" from the song constantly for over a minute, it eventually becomes farfetched and laughable.  I can understand there has to be something subliminal about it, but come on!<br />Some people recall to the idea that the vocalist was a whiner, but to be honest, I don't see that in his character. He is a talented, thoughtful vocalist and so were the band.  I understood that they put a lot of effort into making this contemporary industrial album, but effort is not going to be enough if they want to be at the top of the league.<br />Radiohead's \\"Hail To The Thief\\" is a endearing, creative, but not an amazing album.  Radiohead fans are gonna get this, and it's good for them to have this, but for everyone else:  buy this album with caution...and plenty of caffeine.a endearing, creative, but not an amazing album.

B00007BHOE|5.0|What else can you say about Slipknot.  They've done it all.  From CD's to DVD's and even to plastic figures and lets not forget the clothing.  Their DVD &quot;Disasterpieces&quot; marks a rebound from the first dvd &quot;Welcome To Our Neighborhood&quot; which didn't fair too good.  In &quot;Disasterpieces&quot; it has it all from fan involvement to behind-the-scences.  The dvd contains a rarity in &quot;Purity&quot; which was cut from their original pressing of their S/T album in June of '99.  They hit their very first album (Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.) in a song called &quot;Gently&quot;, to their number one song from their 2nd S/T album &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot; then off their most recent album &quot;Iowa&quot; in a song called &quot;Heretic Anthem&quot;.  Awesome dvd for any die hard Slipknot fan.
B000001FS3|5.0|All the brilliance of a colorful exterior that shells a more spectacular interior filled with pleasures on top of pleasures. U2's brilliant The Joshua Tree, is one of the best albums of the 80's and for good reason. It is a stand out that covers ground of all types of music and stears clear of it's decades distinctive sound. Of course the first three songs (the singles back to back) are great it's the rest of the album that is stunning. The rebelous 'Bullet the Blue Sky', beautiful 'Running To Stand Still', and grand 'Red Hill Mining Town' are highlights. If you want the band at it's best and a showcase of good layered music this one's for you. Whether you see it from the distance or go to it and climb on, this tree stands tall and bold.
B00000BKDW|4.0|For Iron Maiden, following up the metal classic \\"Piece of Mind\\" would be no easy task, but the band proved themselves up to the challenge.  With the release of Powerslave, and the subsequent World Slavery tour, the group arguably climbed to the top of the heavy metal heap, emerging as the most popular metal band of the mid 80's.<br />At or near their creative peak, the band delivers powerful, energetic metal, dominated by the guitar work of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith.  The music shows growth and maturity, while still featuring driving riffs, blistering solos, harmony lines, and signature time changes.  As always, Maiden's sound is propelled by the aggressive bass of Steve Harris.  Nico McBrain is a solid, and often flashy drummer.  And Bruce Dickinson continues to carve out a special place as one of metal's finest vocalists.<br />Steve Harris often draws on novels or historical events as source material for his songs.  \\"Aces High\\", his song about the Battle of Britain, is an extremely tight number that is one of Maiden's finest compositions ever.  It features the customary alternating solo break, with Murray going first, followed by Smith, showing again their contrasting styles.<br />\\"The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner\\", is Harris's 13 minute epic based on the famous poem.  It starts energetically, drags a bit in the slow middle section, but then finishes strong.<br />Powerslave, drawing inspiration from ancient Egypt, is another tight, and powerful musical journey.  Creating a rich atmosphere, it transports you there to feel the pain and despair of that time period.  The Egyptian motif was both the album's theme, and that of the World Slavery tour.<br />Blazing out of the gate, and humming like a motor, the guitars on \\"Back in the Village\\", never slow down.  Murray and Smith continue to take their guitar playing in new directions, with their individual sounds meshing almost perfectly on this powerful number.<br />Swordplay is the theme of two songs.  Penned by Dickinson, \\"Flash of the Blade\\" is a dark tune with some interesting lyrics.  Not particularly \\"heavy\\", it features some tasteful guitar work, and an unusual opening riff.  \\"The Duelists\\", written by Harris, is a heavier, more traditional Maiden tune, with classic elements like time changes, arpeggios, duel solos, and harmony guitar.  This under appreciated musical gem, finds Murray and Smith at their complementary best.<br />The electrically charged \\"Two Minutes to Midnight\\", is Maiden's commentary on the politics of war in the Reagan era, and has gone on to become a concert favorite.  Rounding out the album is the instrumental \\"Losfer Words\\", which is more upbeat and light, than previous instrumentals like, \\"Genghis Khan\\".<br />Produced my metal specialist Martin Birch, the music is very tight, and precise.  The guitar work is magnificent.  The band continues to refine what it does best, and explore new musical realms as well.  The writing credits reflect more balance.  Bruce Dickinson's vocals are right on the mark, and never seem excessive.

0156027321|4.0|Pi Patel is a teenager when, on June 21, 1977, he and his family set sail from India bound for Canada with a boatload of animals.  Pi's father sold the zoo that he owned in India, and he is bringing quite a few animals with him to Canada by cargo ship.  When the ship suddenly sinks, Pi finds himself adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  &quot;Life of Pi&quot; is the story of how Pi and Richard survive for 227 days under unspeakable conditions of cold, heat, thirst, and starvation.<br />Martel's prose is lyrical and vivid as he brings to life the feeling of being lost at sea with little hope of rescue.  The descriptive passages are outstanding.  The reader can feel the searing sun burning Pi's body and the maniacal rocking of the life raft during a sudden squall.  Some of the passages are brutal and gory, as Martel depicts the depths to which a living being will sink in order to survive.<br />&quot;Life of Pi&quot; can be understood and enjoyed on several levels. As a story of survival against overwhelming odds, it is a thrilling and suspenseful tale.  Pi shows great resourcefulness and courage when he tames the tiger, obtains food and water for both himself and Richard, protects his body from freezing cold and searing heat, and somehow retains his sanity throughout his terrible ordeal.  There are many humorous passages that make this otherwise grim tale a little easier to take, and Martel also sprinkles the book with some fascinating animal lore for the zoologically minded.<br />The book can also be interpreted as an allegory about how human beings approach the inevitable challenges that we all must face sooner or later. When we confront tragic losses and failures, do we wallow in self-pity and curse our bad luck?  Or do we make use of whatever resources we have to rebuild our lives anew?  Although Pi is very young, he is deeply religious and wise beyond his years.  He understands that &quot;you must take life the way it comes at you and make the best of it.&quot;  These are words that we would all do well to heed as we make our uncertain way through the obstacle course of life.t comes at you and make the best of it.&quot;  These are words that we would all do well to heed as we make our uncertain way through the obstacle course of life.
B000002UWW|5.0|This cd is great, really upbeat tunes to get you going.
0156027321|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful and moving books I've ever read.  It didn't make me believe in God, but then nothing can!  It did make me believe in the power of the human spirit and the joy that can be found within ourselves.  Even againest a background of truly terrifying and horrific events, Pi continues to want to live.  The constant thread of humour is used to great effect, stopping the reader from being overcome by the horror of the situation.  And the ending?  I won't ruin it, but to my mind it was perfect!!
B00000J7JO|5.0|Californication is by far one of my all time favorite cd's. This band just keeps getting better with age and their music is impossible to get sick of.This cd is a must for everyones music collection.
B000002OVJ|5.0|I am trying to find out who or what &quot;Happy Jack&quot; is in the song by that title by the gruop, The Who.  The words to the song do not make any sense as to what or who or what, maybe, it is symbolic of.  I thought at firsttrying for the words to make sense I thought &quot;Happy Jack&quot; was a hermit crab, but it says in the song he &quot;wasn't old, but he was a man.  Or can you help me to find out where or who I could contact to find this out.
B008GFI4V8|5.0|This is Blu-Ray mostly the same as the extended DVD, but with a few improvements and additions. First obviously is the picture and sound which are noticeably better than the DVDs. The menus have been tweaked a little, they are faster and easier to navigate. The film is on TWO Blu-Rays. Special features are on DVD unfortunately. Disc 3 and 4 are identical to the 4 disc extended DVD edition.  The new disc is not very interesting and mostly seems to just be unused documentary footage from the original documentaries, which are excellent. There is also an ultraviolet digital copy.
B000059MEK|4.0|It is a crazy mix no doubt, starting off with \\"One More Time\\", the best dance track since \\"Around The World\\". Then the next track I can't even discribe, except that it manages to have a guitar solo. \\"Digital Love\\" is a catchy and dreamy favorite. \\"Superheroes\\" and \\"High Life\\" are extremely repetitive, but good. \\"Veridis Quo\\" is a pleasant instrumental break, in a beat heavy album. The beginning of \\"Short Circuit\\" always reminds me of a porno. Overall, it's a unique and amazing record, and will go great with your \\"Junior Senior\\" and \\"Air\\" cd's.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I think I can say this is just about the best DVD I have ever bought. Everyone should own it, because no one will be disappointed. This has all the classic songs, guitar smashing, and Moon you could want.
B0000A36J5|5.0|If you don't like this movie, it is because you are a bitter critic who wishes you had thought of it first. The first and the second movie are masterpieces that will never be equaled.  All hail Peter Jackson and crew for going beyond the limits of human reality and potential.  I have never met a happy, adjusted person who did not love this movie as if it were her own.  We all yearn to be a part of the magic, and this movie transports us there a bliss-filled few hours.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem has lots of talent and an interesting life.  Both elements are essential to this personal and ambitious CD and bonus disc.  The beats are hot, the lyrics are cool and the production is terrific.  I'm not the biggest rap fan in the world, but there is no denying that Em and Dre are an incredible team, and that Mathers tells compelling tales to a great beat.  Short skits are scattered between songs, making this a true concept album.<br />My favorite cuts are: White America, Without Me, Hailies Song, Business, Till I Collapse and Cleaning Out My Closet.  This material is not appropriate for kids.  This is mature content and the wording is sometimes profane.  But for adults the stories are worth hearing, the music is catchy and the voice is eminently worthwhile.<br />A nice booklet has lyrics and photos.  The bonus dvd contains almost an hour of concert performances, a music video, the 8 Mile trailer, a 12-minute animated sketch from The Slim Shady Show and a trailer for an upcoming dvd.<br />If you love rap, this is a no-brainer -- the latest, most mature entry from a very talented performer.  If you are curious about the genre or the artist, you may very well find your new favorite disc.  Finally, if you are one of many who criticize this artist on the grounds of sexism, racism or violence, you should listen to it yourself -- and perhaps let yourself be surprised by an articulate, intelligent young artist -- the Marilyn Manson of hip-hop.

B00005OM4N|4.0|I think this is a good album. Catchy songs, and a lot of the songs are about things that any teenage girl can relate to. Liking boys, feeling confused, etc... No, it's nothing completely original and her voice isn't the greatest. But I still like it. So she's not always making music that is groundbreaking or raw... so???? You don't like her, don't listen to her. To me, she just sounds like a girl trying to come into her own and experimenting with different things. She's allowed to do that. Maybe it seems like she's using her looks to sell music.. well, maybe she is. But she doesn't know any better. Leave her alone. If you don't like her, fine. But do you need to spend every waking minute saying bad things about her? Don't you have anything better to do? Obviously not, or I wouldn't be writing this.<br />But anyway, her songs put me in a good mood and make me relate to things that I've gone through or am going through. And this is written by someone who normally listens to the Beatles and Led Zepplin!
B00006CXXU|2.0|XXXtina has a nice voice, though it's a bit boring and she often oversings. Ah, well. Better than Britney. No one takes her seriously because of the way she dresses, and it's probably hurting her career. I know a lot of people who would probably like this but are put off by her image. Anyway, I'll review this track by track.<br />Stripped Pt. 1 - What's the point? <br />Can't Hold Us Down - Talks about sexual double standards. Good subject, poor execution, cute at first, annoying after repeated listens.<br />Walk Away - Pretty good, shows her voice well. Bad bridge.<br />Fighter - Sounds like it was written to be a rock song by someone who's never heard a rock song before.<br />Infatuation (Interlude) - One of two interludes. It's great you can speak Spanish, Christina, but you realize no one knows what you're saying, right?<br />Infatuation - Latin-ish. Actually quite good. Lyrics, vocals, melody, all up to par.<br />Loving Me For Me (Interlude) - Filler, like the intro and Infatuation interlude. Point? To make it look like there's more songs on the back of the CD case, which is strange, because 16 songs is plenty by any standards.<br />Loving Me For Me - One of the better songs. Corny lyrics. Another love song, which frankly I'm sick of.<br />Impossible - Annoying segment with someone talking at the beginning. That's the most interesting thing that happens on this track.<br />Underappreciated - Reminded me of something that would be sung in a movie by a choir of black women swaying back and forth and clapping their hands.<br />Beautiful - Pretty good. Her voice is nice, and as a side note, I was releaved that we didn't have to look at her butt cheeks in the music video. Has a nice message, a good chorus, good verse, good bridge. Just a nice, positive, uplifting song. <br />Make Over - She doesn't have the voice to scream. Leave that to Courtney Love, who I hope will revert back to her old punk ways with her new album instead of more Celebrity Skin tosh.<br />Cruz- Bland, boring.<br />Soar - Uck. \\"Spread your wings and soar\\". I hate songs that delibately try to sound inspirational.<br />Get Mine, Get Yours - Ladies and gentlemen, women like sex just as much as men. Excuse me while I alert CNN and the New York Times.<br />Dirrty - Tuneless, annoying, screeching vocals, an endless segment about throwing elbows or some such nonsense. The music video is the only relatively amusing thing about it.<br />Stripped Pt. 2 - Why part 2? There's only three more songs. If you were going to put a part 2, it seems to me it should contain roughly the same amount of songs as part 1. It's basically Christina babbling about how she's neither a virgin nor a slut, that she's with all \\"her dreamers\\", blah blah blah. <br />A Voice Within - She's talking to some \\"young girl\\", and telling her not to cry, she'll be there by her side. Put me into a deep REM state (and I'm not talking about the band).<br />I'm OK - One thing that annoys me is when an artist explicetly states the source of their emotional pain in their lyrics. I don't mind if they hint at it, but just going and writing a song about it is exploitive to me, and the artist loses their mystique. It also comes off as gimmicky. You may feel differently about this, though.<br />Singing My Song - I recede back into a REM state.<br />So, not incredibly terrible, just a bit boring. Christina's voice sounds pretty much the same on all the tracks, which means she really doesn't feel any particular way about anything she's singing. She needs some passion; she can't just mildly belt out random words on key. Maybe as she gets older and becomes more focused on her music and less on her image, and goes through some pain, she'll be an artist that matters. Right now, she's just a cute girl that has a pretty voice. And makes sure that everyone knows she's the most talented vocal artist of all the musicians in her age group currently popular (Britney, Mandy, Jessica, you know the crowd). I think she has real potential to be something great; but potential only matters if its fulfilled. Hopefully that'll be something she'll focus more on in coming years.
B000068TPN|5.0|I thought this movie was absolutley amazing. And this is coming from someone that does not like war movies. And believe it or not, I come from a military family. I love my troops to death but I have trouble watching war movies because they all seem to show all the gore, but none of the emotional depth behind those deaths. My father fought in Vietnam and didn't like to talk about it. However, this film made him talk to me about it. He felt the emotional and physical pain of the soldiers when they felt completely hopeless. Going into battle knowing you were completely surrounded but still wanting to fght for your country... that's what my father felt and that's what I felt. People can complain and complain until the day that they die that this war was useless, but the young boys that went to war knew that they were fighting for their country... for their right to live. Regardless of what they felt at the time, living in the USA meant more to them. So they fought for their lives, even though their backs were against the wall. Maybe I liked this movie more, because my dad went through the same situation... but regardless...<br />I thought this movie showed the courage and bravery that our soldiers had. Mel Gibson was incredible, as always. Chris Klein was someone that I thought that I could never take serious, but this movie proved otherwise. He showed me human interest, which I honestly thought I couldn't feel with him in it. <br />If you want to see a movie with honesty and raw courage, I recommend &quot;We were Soldiers&quot;. And if you hate this movie simply because you hate the fact that the Vietnam War existed.... then you didn't really watch this movie. I do not think that war is always the answer, but... sometimes if you love the USA, then you've got to be willing to fight for it.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Hands down, This is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece.  A movie about violence and its repercussions, and the way it has an effect on those around it. This is a real thought provoking film and it really deserves the awards it won. Clint Eastwood is astounding, and Gene Hackman is nothing short of amazing. In their roles in this film noir western, and Morgan Freeman is great as well. <br />Not too many movies can call themselves true classics but this is one of them.
B00006L90T|5.0|CARNIVAL OF SOULS is certainly a movie that was WAY ahead of it's time. Released in 1962, it left audiences bewildered, blankly staring ahead. Today, it fits right in! A woman named Mary (the stunning Candace Hilligoss) and her friends decide to drag race with a carload of guys. The girls are forced over the side of a very narrow bridge, plunging into the lake below. Mary rises from the depths, covered in mud, the sole survivor. Or is she? She moves to Utah where she gets a job playing the pipe organ in a church. Slowly, bizarre things start happening. She keeps seeing a sinister looking man -known only as &#34;the man&#34; (played by director Herk Harvey)-, first in her car window. Then, all over the place! She also slips in and out of a sort of dream state, wherein no one notices or hears her talking to them. Mary is also obsessed with an abandoned carnival she drove past. The atmosphere grows creepier by the minute! Is she alive? Dead? Somewhere in between? Candace Hilligoss only did one other film in her career (CURSE OF THE LIVING CORPSE by Del Tenney). In my opinion, this is to Hollywood's shame! She is brilliant in SOULS! Buy this classic immediately... UPDATE (7-9-17)- Well, since amazon has, once again, lumped a bunch of movies together, they've put my old review for the original black and white version of CARNIVAL OF SOULS w/ the colorized version. So, I'll review that too! Obviously, it's the same classic film. Does the colorizing add to, or subtract anything from the experience? Firstly, the color looks pretty consistent, almost as if it had been originally released in color. Ms. Hilligoss looks great! Her flesh tones are smooth and her beautiful eyes are bright green. The organ pipes, and the stained glass in the church are perfect. To be honest, the scenes I was most concerned about, were Mary's initial sighting of the CARNIVAL, as well as her dark, creepy encounters w/ the various ghouls. I was afraid that color might take away from the overall atmosphere of dread / doom. I'm happy to report that these scenes retain their eerie, macabre nature, even in color! As for the ghastly denizens of the night, in particular &#34;the man&#34;, they are every bit as frightening. In fact, &#34;the man&#34; benefits from some greenish tint to his pasty face, adding a cadaverous hue. His &#34;under water&#34; sequence is actually better! He really looks dead! As for the &#34;dance hall&#34; segment, it's just as effective. Perhaps, even more so! In conclusion then, whether in color or good old black and white, CARNIVAL OF SOULS is bleak masterpiece...
B00005JKNC|4.0|Of all the slapstick comedies that Jim Carry has done, the best film he has done in my opinion is a drama about family, courage, and honor. The Majestic was over looked in the theater, and that is a real shame because not too many movies deal with the kind of courage that it deals with broadly in this film. Jim Carrey really Shows great dramatic chops, Martin Landau is great as always, and should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his role, and Laurie Holden gives a great performance and holds her own with the boys.<br />See it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|...pay him no mind, he is a simpleton who cannot comprehend the greatness of this theatrical translation of one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time, and make no mistake about it, Peter Jackson has made the legendary words of Tolkien into a legendary visual and virtually amazing trilogy that will live on in cinematic greatness for years to come....
B000002B7U|5.0|First off, as a Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Veteran, I must say that Jake E. Lee is definitely Ozzy's best guitarist. Don't get me wrong, Randy Rhoads and Zakk Wylde are two kick ass guitarists, but they are very overrated. Jake E. Lee was way more talented and musically diverse. It really is a shame that he never received the credit he deserved all these years. But, anonymous musicans are ALWAYS more successful and talented in the long run. As for &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot;, I personally can't understand everyone's problem with this album, being that is definitely Ozzy's best. I've been listening to Ozzy for many years now and he never topped The Ultimate Sin, even the stuff before with Randy. Believe me, every song on this album is heavy and true. On a lot of Ozzy's later albums without Jake, there are only about 3 or 4 good songs that you'll actually skip just to listen to. The Ultimate Sin is an album that you can play for hours and listen all the way through without skipping to the next track. You won't find one weak, soft, out-of-place, or a filler song located in this whole record. Once you get this album, you won't want to take it out of your cd player for weeks, it's that damn good and absolutely addicting. Hell, I'm listening to it right now as I'm typing all this, lol. I must compliment on the guitar work as being absolutely brilliant, flawless, and phenomenal. Just plain brutal and lots of energy! I must also compliment on the cover art too, definitely Ozzy's best cover. You will also find that the musicians on this album (Ozzy, Jake E. Lee, Phil Soussan, Randy Castillo) are without a doubt the strongest line up in Ozzy's history. I can't believe that one guy earlier posted that Ozzy sounds tired on this record, B.S.! If anything, Ozzy sounds the most energetic and down right pissed off than in anything else he has ever done, period. I didn't claim The Ultimate Sin as possessing the strongest line up for nothing, it does, believe me. I just don't get the people who bash The Ultimate Sin,...I guess not many people know what good Heavy Metal is anymore, or they never did in the first place, amateurs lol. The only downfall is that this album is out of print everywhere so definitely purchase it ASAP. I think it's a damn good thing that they didn't re-remaster The Ultimate Sin like the others that were recently...they left it alone in it's 1995 22 bit remastered true and pure form. But if they did re-remaster it, it would be crucified like the rest, with the new bass and drums recorded over the originals,(Argggg!)  In conclusion, make every effort you can to buy this album, it is hard to find and is only for the true and dedicated. No one will ever replace Jake E. Lee on guitars.
B000003C2S|5.0|Technically, Spiritual Healing cannot hold a candle to the amazing Death albums that would come after it, but I find it just as pleasent to listen to. For me, this album is just a classic. It defines what straight up Death metal should sound like. When the double bass kicks in on &quot;Defensive Personalities&quot; I just get goosebumps. Every riff on this album is just pure classic death metal. There are plenty of other bands recongnizable as death metal, but this is what I'd play if someone asked me what the sub genre sounds like. There are a lot of other things to like here too. There are Chucks vocals which are in top form. You won't find better death vox anywhere than the title track. Plus, as always, Chuck's classic vocals can actually be understood! Then there are the lyrics which show class and maturity. Especially &quot;Within The Mind&quot;, which is a great song to show the lyrics to without even playing. No one would ever dream those lyrics would be connected with the ultra creepy heavy music on that track. In short, album has a classic sound that defines death metal and yet it shatters the negative stereotypes people have about it. Best of all, when I listen to it, I know that Chuck hadn't even warmed up yet. There were still 5 more amazing albums to come that would make this effort look like it was done by a garage band. When brain cancer claimed Chuck, we may have lost the foremost musical geneous of the last 25 years. He's gone, but he left a truly awesome musical legacy behind. RIP Chuck.
B000002IOW|3.0|After spending much of the '80's exploring synthesizers as a main instrument, Rush took a brief hiatus after their 1987 album Hold Your Fire to reassess the direction the band was heading. Thankfully for fans, that new direction was away from the dominance of the synths. And that new direction starts with a unique album in the Rush catalog, Presto.<BR>As already mentioned, the relegation of the keyboards out of the spotlight and into the background is one noticeable feature of this album, but they aren't gone all together, and still figure quite prominently in a few selections (old habits die hard). <BR>This change allows Geddy Lee's bass playing to shine once again. With the drums and bass more integrated and freer, a certain feel and groove can be sensed in many songs, something for which Rush was not really known.<BR>However, guitarist Alex Lifeson's guitar work remains the same as on recent albums: thin, atmospheric and toned down. This, along with the slick, almost polite production of Rupert Hine (his first production work on a Rush disc), make Presto sound about as adult contemporary as ever and closer to a Steely Dan album sonically speaking than a Rush album.<BR>Another feature fans will notice is the prominence of backing vocals, which had begun cropping up sparingly on previous discs, but here they become a main part of the songs. It adds to the sound of the band, and songs such as Show, Don't Tell and Superconductor are the catchiest and arguably the most radio friendly tracks ever laid down by the band.<BR>Drummer Neil Peart had also created some of his best, most mature and accessible lyrics ever here as well.<BR>Most Rush fans overlook this album because of its soft edged, weak production and lack of meaty guitar work (and that is why I only give it 3 stars), but the melodicisms, arrangements (still quirky as ever) and overall feel make it a worthy listen for anyone. Don't overlook this disc - its very un-Rushness makes it a magical album in its own right.
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|This album is the reason downloading from sites like napster became so popular. For the money I paid, I expected there to be at least 1 or 2 tracks that I would find to be really cool but obviously these songs were written with the absolute purists in mind (those who think ANYTHING Maynard does is great). I'm not impressed by this latest offering and I have been a huge tool and perfect circle fan for a long time now. I guess I'll go back to &quot;stealing&quot; the music on the download sites first before wasting anymore of my money. This cd sucks.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|This is a bad ass soundtrack, its like the rest of the taratino movie soundtracks, badass. i like how it starts off with the opening song from the movie, &quot;Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot;. when i make movies i hope to have a badass soundtrack like this.
0380730367|5.0|I just finished the last of the Kenzie/Gennaro series and have to say it was the best of the bunch -- which, considering my high opinion of the preceding books, is saying something.  I'm not a big fan of violence, but it always seems counteracted by the scenes when Patrick, Ange and Bubba get together and start their &quot;three stooges&quot; routine.  Besides, once I start a Lehane book, the writing just sucks me in and I've gotta stick to the end.
0446310786|5.0|I have juss finish reading To Kill a Mockingbird and i liked it. The story starts off in a town called Maycomb. The characters are Jem and Scount Finch along with their father, Atticus Finich. Atticus is an attorney and he is defending an african-american man, Tom Robinson, because he is acused of raping a white girl, Mayella Ewell. Jem and Scout are the two kids that try to get Boo Radley out of his house. Boo is supposedly a big, tall monster-child. Jem and Scout meet a new kid from the block, Dil, who is visiting for the summer. He dared Jem to touch the side of the Radley house. Jem does it and they never messed with the Radleys til Dil came back next summer. When he comes back, they are wiser, so they decide to go to the Radley house at night. When they do Nathan Radley, Boo's brother, scares they off with a shot of his shotgun. When they run off over the wire fence, Jems pants got stuck on it. When he came back to get in the next night Jem went back and tried getting his pants back, and he found the rip stitched up and ready for him to get it. It was the work of Boo Radley. They find that Boo isnt a bad person, but they he is friendly. <BR>  I would really recommed this book if you like reading race-related books. This book also has mischif in it when Scout and Jem try to get Boo to come out. I thought this book was really good because I like the whole jist of the book. The whole getting Boo out of his house part was really good because of the sneaking around part and stuff. I really liked this book and recommend everyone to read it atleast once.
B000089RVR|4.0|Dido has done it again! She brings hope to the rest of the meaningless music out there today.
0790729725|5.0|If you like to watch mafia and gangster movies you have to watch<BR>this one. When I watched the first 15mins of the movie I started<BR>to really enjoy it. Its about this guy Peter(Ray Liotta) whos wanted to be in the mafia since he was a kid. He did errands for gangsters when he was about 14 years old and loved it. When he gets older he hangs out mostly with Jimmy(Robert Deniro) and Tommy(Joe Pesci)his closest friends. But when Peter goes to jail a couple a times, Jimmy and Tommy think that Peter is going to squeal on them. The only way Peter can get out of jail is to sell drugs. When he sells the drugs he takes the drugs also. He starts having trouble with his wife like beating her. But if the head of the Mafia Pauli, finds out that Peter is selling the drugs , Peter might get wacked(killed). What happens next I can't tell you so your going to have to see it to what happens. A very good movie. Two thumbs up.
B0000AM6LY|2.0|Can we say &quot;one hit wonder&quot;! What a random cd! One would think that the creator of such a unique and intriguing song, Sunrise, would have a better cd that captured the flow and feel of that in Sunrise however this is not the case. The song Sunrise is completely out of place in this cd. If one didn't know better they would assume that this cd was made in the 80's, and not in the Blondie/David Bowie/Oingo Boing 80's but the maudlin sounds of Michael Bolton 80's. I rate this cd a capitol P capitol U.
0671042858|4.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, is a great book.  I guess you would enjoy it more if you were familiar with baseball and understood the game and the players as I did, but I still think if you like enjoy reading and Stephen King, that this book will appeal to you.  I hate reading and I still enjoyed this book.  Stephen King is good writer and I enjoy most his novels.  I think that the plot and the creative way he incorporated the whole Tom Gordon theme into it was done real nicely.  This book kept my attention the whole time.  There were some scary parts and real descriptive parts where you get a real clear vision of what's going on.  Overall I liked this book and I think that most readers would enjoy it too.
B000002LGW|5.0|As seminal moments in one's adolescent life go, being in attendance at this concert (June 19, 1988) in the Rose Bowl ranks pretty high on my list. Having had my introduction to DM in 1984, my friends and I were in a pretty full lather by the time this concert arrived. It was, in a word, amazing. Southern California has always been a signifigant part of DM's fanbase and the feeling in the Rose Bowl that night proved it. I have attended college football games (and a couple of Rose Bowls) in the same venue and this was louder. A definitive classic in the annals of rock history (especially the last 20 years) and a must have, even for the casual DM fan. Even seeing Violator a couple of years later (at a slightly smaller venue, Dodger Stadium) was intense, but nothing like the night that Dave and Martin swept 90,000 people off their feet........
0060512806|3.0|The size of CRYPTONOMICON varies depending on which individual printing that you get ahold of (although, presumably, they all contain the same amount of text).  Depending on the size of the margins, the typeface and the paper, the page count of your copy of CRYPTONOMICON will range from nine hundred to eleven hundred.  My own copy weighs in at nine hundred, eighteen pages.  No matter how you look at it, that's a lot of words, and a lot of reading.  And I'll say this from the onset: in addition to everything else I will mention, Neal Stephenson's CRYPTONOMICON was engrossing and absorbing.  It rarely bored me, and kept me interested for its entirety.  No mean feat, considering the length, though I certainly felt as though I had completed a marathon by the time I finally turned over the final page.<br />To reduce the book to a summary is an extremely difficult task.  As a start, we can say that the story takes place in two different time-periods, although there are separate strands running in each setting.  The first part takes place during World War II; much of it concerns the exploits of the mathematicians who broke the German codes as well as the people who tried their hardest to make sure that the Germans themselves did not figure out that the Allies had broken the encryption techniques.  The WWII sections are the book's strongpoint, with the historical details and diversions providing an excellent background.  A lot of the humor in this section works well, although some of it reads like a watered down version of CATCH-22.<BR> <BR>The second portion of the book takes place in the modern day.  It vaguely feels like it's trying to be a sort of techno-thriller.  Of course, it's difficult to describe more precisely, because it seems like it's trying to do half a dozen things at once, and it isn't quite sure what it wants to be.  Some plot points begin, are expanded upon, and then promptly vanish.  There's a lot of geek humor on display, and some portions of the plot will require quite a bit of technical knowledge.  Stephenson explains much of what the audience needs to know, but I bet that a fairly significant portion of the book will fly over the head of many readers.<br />Could the story have been told in fewer than 900+ pages?  Absolutely, but the question rather misses the point.  The plot itself is relatively minimal.  What the book does is to allow itself to go off into tangents and branches nominally related to the main subject.  Characters (or even the narrative itself) will suddenly launch into long speeches about unrelated topics to varying degrees of success.  Some of the discussions are fascinating and thought provoking.  Others are utterly self-indulgent and should have been left on the proverbial cutting room floor.  One gets the impression that the editor (or editors) were afraid suggest cuts, leaving us with a flawed work.<br />I got the inkling that Stephenson had thought of about a dozen good ideas for a book, but instead of developing them individually, he decided to throw them all into a single volume.  This gives us a mixed result.  It's decidedly fresh, unpredictable and exciting, but I also felt that he wasn't doing justice to all of his ideas.  Some threads don't have time to flourish before they are cast off, and it's a shame to see their potential flushed away.<br />The ending feels a bit rushed, which I found to be surprising, given how much time is spent setting up all the plot threads and strands.  And looking back on what I've written, I notice that I've probably spent too much time going over the book's flaws, so I feel the need to point out that there is a lot of great stuff contained between these covers.  A lot of the little passages lead to fascinating discussions.  Had this been a more disciplined work, it would probably have been absolutely amazing.  As it currently stands, however, it is a flawed work, albeit an interesting one.
0385504209|2.0|OK.  Lots of people have appropriately eviscerated portions of this book for being (often eggregriously) inaccurate.  However, it's marked as fiction, and not non-fiction, so I don't see why that would prove surprising.  At it's best, in terms of analogies, I would think this is fictionally equivalent to the movie &quot;JFK&quot;.  In other words, potentially intriguing, mostly enjoyable, but horrifically flawed in terms of the interconnection of key 'facts.'<br />With that being said, the I actually found this book to be patently absurd for reasons specific to its fictional elements within the Thriller genre.<br />Essentially, the *entire* book comes down to this sequence (in broad generalizations so as not to spoil it anymore than other reviews have):<br />*  &lt;&lt;initial setup&gt;&gt;<br />*  Arrive at Location<br />*  Pontificate in a manner and breadth that no human ever would<br />*  &lt;&lt;repeat steps 2-3 incessantly&gt;&gt;<br />*  &lt;&lt;conclusion&gt;&gt;<br />Oh yes, and all of this is done in one day, with no appreciable, discernible, inferrential loss of stamina or lucidity among the primary protagonists.  It's stultifyingly amazing!<br />Perhaps instead of a 'thriller' for his next book, Dan Brown could write a fitness manual that prescribes the appropriate mix of exercise and gensing to achieve and maintain these levels.  NOW that would be a book worth reading.
0553277472|4.0|Whenever I look into a new book I always read the reviews.  But I don't read the reviews that give a book a good standing.  I like to read the ones of the people who just didn't like it for whatever reason.  I find if they can give me a difinitive argument on why the book isn't worth the paper it's printed on then they most likely have taken the time to think about it.  However, in this case I believe in my own mind that people miss the point of this book.  Most people read this book expecting to get some deep philosophical insight or just to impress their peers.  I did enjoy the fair amount of philosophical discussion that occured but the best thing that I found when I read this book was that it gave me emotional response.  Sometimes I would say, &quot;I can understand exactly where Pirsig is coming from.&quot;  but other times I would just totally disagree with Pirsig's approach to a situation.  So in the end this book did have an impact on the way I think and act.  It gave me insight into the mind of someone else.
0767830555|4.0|Robert Deniro and Jody Foster, two great actors of our time. How could you possibly go wrong with these two? The answer is, you can't. Deniro would have even been successful during the silent film era...His face says so much without making a sound. What a fantastic actor...Now, about this film; I had many preconceived ideas of what the movie was about and what was actually going to happen. I was constantly second guessing everything. Nothing happened as I thought it would which really disappointed me in the end. So my advice would be, just watch the movie and try not to figure out what's going to happen from one scene to the next. You will enjoy it much more, I think...with saying that, it was still good and I am glad that it is now a part of my DVD collection. Would I watch it a second time? I'm thinking no, unless I was with others who were seeing it for the first time.
B00005V0X5|4.0|This album sounds so much better than the original - it's unbelievable!. Gar Samuelson's drums are the main improvement, they sound f#ckin great! My favorite songs are KIMB (the title track, which Mustaine wrote about the punisher (comic book character), Looking down the cross, which has great lyrics and music. The Mechanix is the best song, Mustaine wrote this song before even joining Metallica, then Metallica jacked it from Mustaine along with several other great songs. Mustaine's version is much faster and I like it better. The situation with &quot;these boots&quot; just sucks. Lee Hazelwood, the author of the song threatened to take legal action against Mustaine if he didn't edit out everything that Hazelwood wanted him to (most of the bleeps aren't even bad words!). Fortunately I was able to find an old used copy of this album, which is the only version that has the song unedited, it's a great cover. That's the only problem with the album. I'm not going to write anymore cause I'm tired. If you want a smart detailed review of this cd read der kommissar's review, it's really accurate and honest.
B000002VC3|5.0|Parsons was already successful in his own right before Eye in the Sky.  But this album would be the climax to his mainstream career.  While he has released wonderful and excelling music since Eye in the Sky, nothing has compared to how well he charted with this album.<br />The album itself, is really good.  Its got a great sound and the first songs are tremendous from Sirus (a classic arena rocker) molding right into Eye in the Sky (a radio classic), followed by a trio of somber but at times upbeat songs: Children of the Moon, Gemini, and Silence and I (perhaps one of the best songs by Parsons).  These songs are the highlights and make the album worth buying outright. Sadly, I feel the album does go down hill with a couple mainstream songs: Step by Step and You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned.  However, Psychobabble and Mammagamma make up for them. The album finishes off with a reflectful Old and Wise. <br />If you're a Parsons' fan, then you already have this album.  However, if you are looking for a more mainstream progressive pop rock, then you might do yourself some good by trying out this album.
B000002UDD|4.0|Megadeth's third album features a new lead guitarist and a new drummer. After Gar Samuelson and Chris Poland were kicked out, they were replaced by Chuck Behler (drums) and Jeff Young (lead guitar). Although Jeff Young isn't as good as Chris Poland, he is still a great guitarist and delivers some really good solos on the record. However, Chuck Behler's drums suck. Maybe they just sound so bad because of the piss-poor production of this album, which features a boring cover of Anarchy in the U.K., most likely because there are no stylistic changes from the original. I never liked \\"Mary Jane\\" or \\"502\\" very much either, but The other tracks make up for those weak ones, which is why this album is still great. Despite the bad production and drum quality, this album contains three of my all time favorite Megadeth songs ever - \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" (Mustaine's metal tribute to Metallica bassist Cliff Burton) is such an incredible song both lyrically and musically along with \\"Hook in Mouth.\\" \\"Liar\\" is the other song that I love on this album - the guitar riff is sweet and the lyrics are deliciously rude, it's not epic like \\"In my darkest hour\\" or \\"Hook in mouth,\\" but it's fun. Other great songs are \\"into the lungs of hell\\" (a mustaine instrumental that rips) and \\"set the world afire.\\" Basically, if you're a Megadeth fan, you should get this album, but not before buying \\"Rust in Peace\\" and \\"Peace sells...but who's buying.\\"
B0000640VO|5.0|Excellent movie that will make you feel so good.  Audrey Tautou is absolutely adorable and pulls you into this movie by her excellent performance.
B00005ASOI|3.0|For months I had been hearing about how great Suspiria was on the Internet. When planning a horror movie fest this Halloween, I decided to pick it up and give it a watch with some friends. I had been hyping the movie, and they were believing it.<br />The movie does look and sound excellent, hats off to Anchor Bay for making another older movie look like it was released in theaters months ago.<br />The movie began with the effective and famous death scene, and from there it went downhill. Silly dialogue and scenes building towards suspense are cut, seemingly in the middle. People say Argento doesn't focus too much on plot, and here it shows. Had this movie been more streamlined, with the imagery and the camerawork, this could have been what people had been calling it - a true masterpiece. But until that happens, the original Halloween stands as my all time favorite horror movie.
B000001ESJ|3.0|Yes, I know it has Xanadu and Cygnus X-1 on it. But the sound of this disc is pure tin. I can't stand listening to it. Xanadu is better off being heard on Exit Stage Left about 4 yrs later during the Moving Pictures tour with The Trees right before it. Cygnus X-1 sounds great on the 3rd disc of Different Stages during the Kings tour. Cinderella Man rules...no problems there. Madrigal is easily the 2nd or 3rd worst Rush song ever recorded and written. Closer To  The Heart is on 25 other albums and there are better versions. Then there is the title track...which again..sounds better on the Hammersmith disc of Different Stages.<br />This disc had some great songs on it...but better versions are elsewhere.
B000021YQV|5.0|Though Systems message at times may seem a little overhwleming, the general statement they are trying to make is that of awareness and not just trashing. If any of the people who have reviewed this album actually read the lyrics and used their brains to review what System i sactually trying say you would see that their message is intense and supportive of educating America to things that occur everyday. In general American's are very ignorant to waht truly happens in our world, and quite frankly we have alot of room for improvement. Naturally this is an opinion and a feeling that isn't agreed upon by everyone.<BR> <BR>As for the drug comments, System of A Down puts down drug use constantly in their lyrics across all of their CD's. Their message is political, and is spurred from their desire for the acceptance of the Armenian Genocide. If you understood this you would see where their anger for government is spurred from. <br />But ignoring all that, System has some of the most heart pounding, intense driving riffs. Every song is a classic, and builds on the amazing foundation of their first album, and songs such as Johnny. System i sfresh trend setting and stands apart from the crowd. One listen and I was hooked. It doesn't get better than this boys and girls. If you want an amazing CD with some deep lyrics and some of the most intense playing seen today, this is your best bet. For the true fan, check out their first CD self titled and Steal This Album!. The Energy can be seen throughout all their music
B0000C0FJB|5.0|To not pick this live package on cd would be criminal. Rush In Rio the 3 cd package is literally the best bargain out there. You get what is on the dvd plus the never before on a live album Vital Signs and Between Sun and Moon both recorded during the Vapor Trail s tour on the Phoenix and Quebec stops on the tour.<br />This package certainly blows away the Different Stages 3 disc set that came out 5 yrs ago. Throw that crap in the cd rack. Also this eats A Show of Hands completely. Simply put...this is the best follow up to Exit Stage Left...that one could have asked for.<br />It is worth it folks for the money...look at the price! Usually you could only buy 1 cd for that kind of money. This is excellent work on Rush's part and to have the power of the people of Rio behind the music is the icing on the cake. I for one am tired of attending incredible rock shows only to have people go on beer runs, bathroom runs, and talk on cell phones.<br />Rio shows how it is done. Rush should punish North America and put us last for the rest of their tours. This way the rest of the world can go nuts and give them what they deserve. Then when they come to the U.S. they will not be rusty and will be polished. But we should be forced to wait for the lame crowds we give them.<br />Get this package on dvd and cd and you will see what I speak of. Also, head over to the new Rush website [...] and check that out.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg, perhaps the most well known battle of The American Civil War, is an amazing movie to every history buff.  The movie Gettysburg is created from the book The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara.  With a great cast and story it is not even a question why I gave Gettysburg five stars.  This movie shifts from Union to Confederate sides showing plans of attack and reason of fighting the war.  The battles are present through the entire length of this movie. As all three days of the battle are shown it is an incredible site to see especially the final day. Picketts' charge is the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  The speeches provide courage and bravery for the men as they walk into Union ground accross an open field.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Have no fear those who are skeptical of \\"Chicago\\", this film delivers! Great movie musicals have been, sadly, few and far between for the last 20 years or so. I walked into the theatre to view \\"Chicago\\" with a bit of hesitation, expecting another poorly organized and sketchy musical version of a Broadway hit. I was blown away, however, by the exciting and original way that director Rob Marshall integrated the engaging story line with the stunning musical numbers. He used a style that has never before been seen on a movie screen. The performances are not to be overlooked, either. Richard Gere is sensational as Billy Flynn. He departs from his usual style to deliver a brilliant performance and he manages to belt out two of the greatest songs in the film like no one else could. Catherine Zeta Jones is sexy and magnificent as Velma Kelly, and Renee Zellweger in stunning and seductive as the idealistic Roxie Hart. I recommend this film for anyone who is a fan of great musicals, great movies, great directing, and great acting. Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture, \\"Chicago\\" scores!
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Having watched the first Matrix three times with my daughter, I was strongly encouraged to see Matrix Reloaded with her. <br />Reviews were mixed, and MPAA also put an 'R' on this film, so we waited.  After seeing the terrible editing job done to the televised version of the Matrix, I knew I wouldn't wait until she was 18.  So I reviewed it myself, to see what the 'R' was about.  In case you don't know, there's a five+ minute section about 25 minutes into the film that really should have been mostly left on the editing floor.  Neo and Trinity having fully naked sex, and the Zion crowd, in parallel, wildly dancing themselves into a frenzy that, in some places, slips into an .... <br />Aside from the Neo's premonition at the end of the scene of Trinity in a future battle, which we've already seen once, this whole section adds nothing to the film, but make it an 'R' movie.  <br />What really did not work for me was the pacing of the action sequences.  Most reviews have already lamented this - it was way too much.  The Smith fighting scene was fascinating, but to a point, and the film-makers just didn't know what \\"way too much\\" was. (Personally, I really enjoy Higo Weaving's fleshing out of this character, and his dialog scenes are among the best in the movie.) <br />Consider the highway scene.  Morpheus and Trinity, the warriors, trying to get away with Keymaker, the wise and crucial sage (who does not fight). The foes intent on stopping them, are agents, the twins, and of course the police. But Neo's temporarily out of the picture.  Part of this is very intriguing, in that the agents and the twins have no dealings with each other.  But the scene goes on far too long, and begins to feel like tag-team wrestling.<br />However, like the first, there are intriguing insights into the nature of the Matrix and its inhabitants, and these insights make the adventure worthwhile...
B0000025D0|5.0|I am a huge Bruce Springsteen fan and if asked the question which Springsteen disc I liked best, I would probably say its a near toss-up between this disc and the classic Born to Run.  Why such lofty praise for this disc?  Because Darkness On the Edge of Town is an album that captures Bruce and the E Street Band at the top of their game.  Not quite 29 years old when this album was released in the summer of 1978, Springsteen sings with a youthful defiance, which exudes a great deal of energy and passion.  A number of Bruce's greatest songs are here:  Badlands, Candy's Room, Racing in the Street, The Promised Land, Prove it All Night and Darkness on the Edge of Town.  On this album, Bruce uses both upbeat rock songs and haunting slower songs to tell his characters' stories, and as any Springsteen fan already knows, he is an amazing storyteller.<BR>  <BR>The stories here are generally told from the perspective of proud, working-class people who are doing their best to stay optimistic, while struggling in their lives.  These are the types of people that Springsteen grew up around in his native New Jersey, so his portrayals of such people in these songs are rich with detail and dead-on accurate.  Some of my personal favorite moments on this album are as follows: 1.)Racing in the Streets-A beautiful song about a guy who refuses to grow up and become responsible and is slowly realizing that it is costing him his relationship with his neglected wife; 2.)Darkness on the Edge of Town-In this song, a guy's refusal to grow up and become responsible have already cost him his marriage.  Despite realizing this, he seems resigned to accept the fact that he is incapable of changing his ways, no matter what its cost him; 3.) Candy's Room-I may be wrong, but it always seemed to me that this upbeat rock song was a story about a guy who is in love with a prostitute and believes that his genuine love for her can make her truly happy and get her to give up her occupation-sort of like thestory line for the classic song by The Police titled Roxanne; and 4.)The Promised Land-A great song about someone who is struggling, but is able to maintain their faith in the midst of that struggle.<br />In conclusion, I am 29 and have found Bruce Springsteen's music to be richly rewarding over the 8 years I've been a fan.  The stories in his songs continue to touch my soul no matter how often I hear them.  He is, in my humble opinion, truly one of the all-time great musicians, singer-songwriters and live performers.  However, any Greatest Hits album doesn't really do him justice, you really are better off selecting individual albums from his body of work.  That being said, you cannot go wrong with Darkness on the Edge of Town, I highly recommend it!
B000005RYQ|4.0|This is a superb collection of Police singles, from the early days of Roxanne and Can't Stand Losing You - both of which were considered controversial songs because of their subject matter. The Police very successfully integrated reggae rhythms into their sound, as demonstrated by the aforementioned and by later smashes like Message In A Bottle and Don't Stand So Close To Me. My other favourites include Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, Spirits In The Material World and Every Breath You Take. Not everything here has stood the test of time well - De Do Do Do is one those irritating novelty numbers that I skip when listening to this album. These songs, although mostly simple and catchy, are a cut above simple pop because of their clever lyrics that often contain a twist or two, innovative rhythmic patterns and the band's professionalism. This greatest hits album is perfect for the casual listener although hardcore fans might want to get all the band's output on CD. There is also the 1997 collection The Best Of Sting And The Police with a slightly different track listing, containing more of Sting's ballads.
B00007E8V4|4.0|This CD mastered many qualities of that of a CD rating five stars, but some songs had lyrics that had no meaning and were merely using words for rhythmical value.  All song titles related well to the topics, but many songs lacked a good consistent beat, and had some incomprehensible and not thoughtful lyrics.  These faults contributed to the reason I rated it as a four star  instead of a five star album.  This CD overall had an excellent flowing beat and good related titles for each song.  The new album for the band System of a Down, \\"Steal this Album\\" is an upgrade from their last album, \\"Toxicity\\" because it had a more understandable tone, and clearer lyrics.  On a personal note, I really enjoyed this new release, and I think it is an above average CD.

B000089RVX|1.0|I am a student at University of California at San Digeo and I am really angry with Evanescence.  I have their CD and i kinda liked it, but Forensik was supposed to open for them at SOMA at San Diego, and Evanescence just denied the for no reason. This is not a good thing.  Forensik is a good band. I have heard their demo and they are going to go big once they get a record deal.  Evanescence has made a big mistake not letting them play.  I was supposed to be the penguin in the mosh pit and anyone that knows Forensik knows that they have awesome shows.  Evanescence's CD is not all that good.  They just got some good airplay on MTV which sucks because they are not that good of a band.  Forensik is a much better band; they have really good talent.  Contact me if you would like to know more about Forensik.  DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!<br />go to [...]  for some good music.  I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS CD, go to Forensik's website and listen to their music.

078062999X|2.0|This book wasnt good 200 years ago and it certainly isnt any good now.  We are confronted with a question here, that question being why would someone redo a movie over such a terrible book.  The answer is quite simple, they need money and these actors if you want to call them need us to watch them so they get money.  This simply cannot last and i emplore all of you ever humyn being to not see this movie or by it, please the fate of humynity rests on your shoulders.
014028009X|5.0|I am not a 30 something, but I loved this book.  I read it in two days, and it's one of those novels that leave a smile on your face, instead of keeping you up in a sleepless, \\"hmmmmm\\".  I would recommend this book to anyone who is tired of all the drama out there.  Escape for a couple of hours, it won't kill you! There is a Bridget within all of us.  It will wake you up to the fact that we are all too hard on ourselves.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Anyone remember those Magic Eye posters that were all the rage a few years ago?  On the surface, they were nothing more than a bunch of funny shapes on a piece of paper, but if you looked at the image in just the right way, a spectacular 3D image appeared.  Those who couldn't see the pictures often gave up in disgust, some even claiming there really was nothing there -- that it was a joke.  A relative few figured out how to see the images, either immediately or with practice.  Those people got to see really wonderful things, but unfortunately had no way to explain it to others.<br />THE MATRIX RELOADED is a lot like those 3D images, except, I believe, not quite so difficult to get!  The film is filled with revelations and subversive developments, many of which churn just below the surface. Unlike blockbuster crowd-pleasing sequels which sell out their story for bigger effects (see TERMINATOR 2), RELOADED dares to make the viewer have to work to get at its deeper meaning.  Dare I say it, but I believe RELOADED approaches 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY for sheer chutzpah in its method of storytelling. In RELOADED there are long, seemingly banal stretches of dialogue which try the viewers' patience at first, but which, on repeated viewings, reveal things essential to understanding the way the Matrix controls its inhabitants.<br />An interesting point which people seem to mention endlessly is that the film seems to have no plot.  What most of these critics fail to realize is that the movie acknowledges this!  In a key scene, the Merovingian explains that our heroes have come to him without any real reason.  They have been TOLD where to go.  It is at this point where it becomes apparent that there are other sinister forces at work here, moving the characters around like pieces on a chessboard.  It is quite possible that their fight is futile, and that fate has already predetermined the outcome of their struggle.  This idea, that one can only succeed so much when others are in control, is where the genius of RELOADED lies.<br />Cynics will be quick to scoff at this analysis of the film, noting that one will see beauty in anything if they stare at it too hard.  This may be true in many cases, but in the case of THE MATRIX RELOADED, there really *is* a hidden code, and those who crack it are better off for having done so.
0688010377|5.0|With a backdrop of a fairy-tale castle set in the Austrian alps and the music of Der Rosenkavalier playing below from a traveling circus, an old horse dances in a meadow, executing the precise dressage movements called the &quot;Airs Above the Ground&quot; of the famous Lippanzaners of the Spanish Riding School.  The only witnesses are Londoners, Vanessa March, and her companion teenaged Tim Lacy thrown together by chance as Tim pursues his dream of untying his mother's apron strings by applying for a job at the famous riding school and Vanessa searches for her errant husband, Lewis, supposedly away on business in Sweden, but documented on a UK newsreel with a beautiful blonde during an out of control circus fire near Graz.<br /><br />As usual, Mary Stewart creates a fine story where intrepid characters move along a lushly described exotic locale. The delineation between good and evil is clearly defined.  Like the other Stewart heroines, Charity Selbourne of 'Madame Will You Talk' comes quickly to mind, Vanessa unhesitatingly does the 'right thing.'  Although she has the stereotypical loveliness, intelligence, and quick wittedness with a bit of the acerbic tongue of a married woman that makes her narration marvelously fun, she is never obssessed with superficiality like so many more modern 'romance' heroines.  But, of course, a Stewart romance is a romance of the most highly literal type; the love scenes are suggested rather than depicted. The narration moves you along as if you were one and the same as the heroine; you breath her air, your heart clenches with terror when hers does, your skin prickles when in the presence of the ethereal and you quickly adopt and share her high value system.  Above all the atmosphere of magic liberally sprinkling the air is maintained throughout so that even the most coincidental and improbable happenings seem to gel and fit with a puzzler's adept precision. When the tale draws to an end, you sigh with disappointment at turning that last page and you wish that Stewart had written three times as many novels so you had more to rediscover.<br /><br />I listened to the audio presentation of this novel read by Jane Asher; it is very well-done, well worth the investment to listen to over and over again and see that poignant image of the horse dancing alone in the meadow just one more time in your mind's eye.  Fantastic!ast page and you wish that Stewart had written three times as many novels so you had more to rediscover. <BR><BR>I listened to the audio presentation of this novel read by Jane Asher; it is very well-done, well worth the investment to listen to over and over again and see that poignant image of the horse dancing alone in the meadow just one more time in your mind's eye.

B00005JLYW|1.0|I loved the first one so much that I coudn't wait to see this one. What a disappointment! Is this movie supposed to be an unfunny comedy? Everything that was great about the first movie, they overdid in this one. It was a very sad thing for me to see how they ruined a good franchise. What was with Creepy thin man having on those freaky white contacts? And who wrote those cheesy lines that they were saying? This is a true review from a Charlies Angels (first movie) true fan. I think the people who gave those great reviews work for Columbia Pictures!
014100018X|5.0|I saw the film before I read the book.  Ms. Harris is a wonderful storyteller.  She is descriptive to a fault.  Her prose is smooth as silk, and she is capable of pulling emotions from her readers.  Underneath the guise of bringing some joy into the dour lives of the villagers in this tale, I could not help but feel that Vianne took some satisfaction in destroying certain peoples' lives.  The town priest's, Reynaud, for example. Everyone has secrets in Lansquenet-sous-Tannes.  I suppose since I saw the film, and the intentions of Vianne in the film were harmless I thought the book was going to be the same.  It was not.  Vianne had a load of baggage.  Though her facade was lighthearted, inside she was battling many demons.  In one instance, the author alluded to the fact that Vianne might have been a kidnap victim and the woman she thought was her mother might not have been.  Yet, the topic wasn't explored any further.  Why bring it up?  And the character of Roux, the gypsy, had me totally confused.  Was he attracted to Josephine, Vianne's friend, or to Vianne?  Both, obviously.  At least the filmmakers made that point clearer.  After all this grousing you would think I didn't enjoy the book.  Not at all.  I thought it was beautifully written, and I would gladly read anything else by the author.  My point is, perhaps we should not make judgments about the course an author takes in the telling of the tale.  Perhaps we should simply read it, see how it unfolds and accept it as it was meant to be, one person's story.  However, being human, we bring our own preconceptions to the tale when we sit down to read it.  That's why those other reviewers were disappointed.  The story didn't go the way they wanted it to.  It didn't go the way I expected it to go either (after seeing the film first!)but it's still an excellent book.
B00003CX97|4.0|I was 12 when BOTRK owened and I've grown up with it.  While the DVD transfer is excellent (picture and sound), what I am always after is the BONUS material.  If you know the film as well as I do, seeing the BONUS disk first will add tremendously to your enjoyment of the feature.<BR>The longer documentary (about 40 minutes - much of it in widescreen and color) is enough in itself.  The other featurettes are mostly a b/w review of what you've already seen.  The tid-bits are fascinating: the SHEERS character (William Holden) is not in the novel and was added simply to get an American male star attached to the picture for box office appeal.  The same thing is true of the various women who appear, from SHEER's brief love interest in Ceylon to the women bearers who carry equipment through the jungle - all added to inhance international appeal.  Most interesting was the story of Lean's harassment of Japanese star Hayakawa (COL. SIATO).  He has to cry in one sequence and just couldn't get it.  Lean yelled at him constantly, saying he was a bad actor.  When Hayakawa did the scene again, he was actually crying!  Also, when Guiness is in the &quot;hot box&quot; or &quot;sweat box&quot;, he begged Lean for something cool to sit on; Lean refused and Guiness sweated real sweat!  The train wreck that actually wrecked the train BEFORE they blew up the bridge, etc.  I kind-of liked the Bonus Disk more than the feature.  But that is the true beauty of DVD.

After renting CA:FT, I am very glad I didn't buy it. <BR>I have read many negative reviews here about CA:FT, and I agree with them.  This is a very bad movie in virtually every catagory you can think of.  However, I am not someone who is so totally obsessed by movies that they take over my life: I do not cry because the movie is bad; I do not go into a rage because the movie is bad.  If it's bad, I turn it off and send the disk back.  After all, it's just a movie.

B00008EY9G|5.0|A spectacular whodunnit with brains and a twist. Beautifully executed, Identity brings together ten people connected by a single surreal link. Nothing is as it seems, and everyone has a hidden agenda. The performances are perfect and creepy, and the plot is engaging, so the 90 running minutes seem to fly by. Ending with a flourish reminiscent of The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, or Memento, Identity is a perfect ten. You will be telling your friends about it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Okay, if there's one thing I am sick of, it is die-hard Tolkien fanboys trashing this series of movies. Yes, the movies are not like the books-I will gladly concede this point although they only Tolkien book I have read is 'The Hobbit.' And, given what I read there, if you were to make a movie exactly like Tolkien's books, NO ONE BESIDES YOU WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO WATCH IT. Yes, he's clever, and erudite, and somehow manages to seamlessly blend both mythology and the picaresque tradition, but not every word on the printed page can, or should, be written and shot. And when you're dealing with a world of so many supporting characters, tangential characters, background, folklore, and history, something's got to give. <br />Adapting anything into a film is a very difficult business-much harder, I think, than starting with an original idea. Yes, there are lots of good things to take from the orignal work-and lots that should never see one frame of finished film. So, the filmmaker looks at where the story truly lies-what the drama is. Where the conflict as at its sharpest. In some cases, that's easy to find. In some cases, it's not there, and you have to invent it yourself. I'm continually astounded by the length of the Rings films-not only how big they are, but how much story is there, and that the majority of it is actually WORTH being there. For the non-purists, these films are a treat-all told, you're getting over six quality movies' worth from three films. For the purists, your answer is simple-go buy the rights to do your own remakes, write your own scripts (without deleting one scene or character, in fact, just copy the text from the books straight into the screenplay), get some studio to finance it all, and produce your own trilogy-otherwise, we don't care to hear it any more. Most of the rest of us are happy with the ones Peter Jackson is doing.
B0000BYM3K|1.0|Give me a break! I was in seventh grade when I road my bike to Buzzard's Nest Records in Columbus, Ohio to buy Piece of Mind. Iron Maiden was incredibly awesome in their day. However, that day has long since gone. This album is entirely stale. Even my hero Bruce Dickinson sounds tired, especially compared to his brilliant Chemical Wedding, which was only a couple of years ago. There's just something about heavy metal bands: when they get old, the magic goes and they get stale. They should have retired years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years ago!

Things to not like about Charlie's Angels II: Cameron Diaz doing the Calista Flockhart [Please return to Mask levels of weight and curves], Bernie Mac as Bosley [my god, what terrible casting, not worthy to carry Bill Murray's jock, maybe they can get Chris Rock to play Charlie in the next one], 40+ year old Demi w/out her implants.  Oh well, things blow up, numerous Matrix pioneered effects are utilised [poorly], Bond movies are ripped off, and forced happiness team spirit is everywhere.  Brain dead MTV video level escapism to be sure, under the guise of Girl Power! Yeah!  Demi is an-ex angel who strikes out on her own to get rich w/ the aid of protective custody files to be sold to the highest underworld bidder.  Robert Patrick shows up looking even older and more haggard than he did in X-Files, as a corrupt government agent in cahoots w/ Demi.  Terminator 2 seems so long ago Robert.  There are some laughs, and the pacing is frenetic enough that it will get you through the movie quickly, but at what lasting effect? At least it was better than Swimfan which I also saw recently, and the wife liked it.
B000002KHH|5.0|Great album by a great group, Black Sabbath with Ozzy really rules (except the last two albums Technical.. and Never say die). This along with the first album and Master of Reality is the best Sabbath has to offer... Buy it and feel the raw power of the old metal gods!
B00005JKG7|5.0|i am giving this movie 5 stars even though its not an awesome movie, i just find it to be everything a horror movie ought to be....<BR>suspensful, scary, mysterious, and keeps you watching instead of yawning...<BR>nothing stupid or retarded happens either
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I was a little nervous as I unwrapped the cd. Quivering as I slid the cd into the player... I held my breath...OH-MY-GOD! I was not dissapointed. Maynard's voice electrified me. He continues to be one of my favorite vocalists in rock music. He puts so much feeling and energy into what he sings, you can't help but to be mezmerized by his voice. I recommend this cd for a thrill-ride that you will want to take over and over again.
B000068IEU|3.0|i rented this movie for 2 reasons...i like the title, and wes craven directed....<BR>i found it to be a let down....it just was not that scary or suspenseful, although it does have parts that are quiet disturbing....<BR>overall, i dont recommend this movie to anyone, but i dont tell anyone NOT to rent it either....its just blah.....<BR>maybe i need to rent and watch it again???
B00006CXXU|4.0|I respect Christina Aguilera;she made a great album ;intense and honest songs in which she is completely true and sincere.I think it's very difficult for an artist to maintain integrity and spontainety in writing a song;Christina made it.Beautiful,Cruz,Soar,The voice within,Fighter and Walk away are simply stupendous and i think that all of us recognize ourselves in these songs.What can i say about I'm ok?I have goose-flesh everytime I listen to it.Congratulation Christina, you're now a woman, a free woman.
0060931671|5.0|There are many better reviews of this book than mine, so I will keep it short. I read a selection from this book out of my Postmodern Literature and Film class and decided to go out and buy the actual book. There is level upon level upon level in this story. You can read it ten times and still see new things and make new connections. Very confusing at first but very rewarding. And as a bonus, it is based on fact. Search the internet for Thurn and Taxis and you'll come across websites that detail in fact and pictures what this book talks about. Fantastic book. Very short. Good for a weekend.
B00005R62K|5.0|A legendary album, indeed. \\"Stained Class\\" stood out from positively ANYTHING else that was out at the time, with the complex song arrangements and actually very deep lyrics as far as Judas Priest goes. Judging by it's great follow-up \\"Hell Bent..\\", this album was really JP's last foray into really meaningful lyrics. It was all \\"metal and partying rules\\" anthems after this.<BR>\\"Exciter\\" sees the birth of speed metal and introduces us to another of their character stories. I've always felt that the lyrics come across as a metaphor for LSD--\\"You will taste the fire upon your tongue\\" being a sort of giveaway--but I could be reading too much into it. <BR>The title track and \\"Savage\\" are uncommonly socio-political in nature and practically go hand in hand. The former discusses the degradation of mankind's dignity/courtesy/civility and the latter is spoken from the point-of-view of a tribal leader whose long-hidden, peaceful culture is being eradicated by the relentless expansion of modern civilization into his land.  A lyric from the song says it all: \\"Of us both who's the primitive man?\\" In fact, all of the song's lyrics really damn the human race for what it has done to some cultures, and they present a very strong case.<BR>\\"Better By You...\\" is, as we all know by now, the song that supposedly will inspire you to kill yourself. Call me kooky, but when I hear someone say \\"Do it\\" I typically think of sex, since \\"do it\\" is nothing more than grade school vernacular for copulation and has never meant anything else. Of course, there are NO such subliminal commands in there anyway, but the premise is ludicrous:<br />Imaginary sexy nude model: \\"Hey, wanna do it?\\"<BR>My imaginary response: \\"What, kill myself?\\"<br />Yeah, that makes complete sense. NOT! <BR>The fact that I'm still alive after listening to this great song many, many times kinda throws that notion out the window. Also of note is the fact that this song is yet another great COVER song, the original written by Spooky Tooth (your guess is as good as mine). A bonus track is a live version of this song.<BR>What's really funny is that \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" truly IS about someone who kills himself, yet no one noticed that minor detail. But rather than being a pro-suicide song, it is instead a cautionary tale about how depression, gone unnoticed, can lead to tragic results. It also happens to feature Glenn's  most moving, inspired solo.<BR>Before I get lost in the moment and decide to go through just how awesome each individual song is, I'll cut it short by saying this is one of the band's best releases and my personal favorite. It is a wellspring of inspired and epic metal. \\"Saints In Hell\\", \\"Heroes End\\", and all the rest assure you of a flawless, dark and disturbing listening experience of the highest METAL caliber. Definitely the best PURE HEAVY METAL album released in the 70s.
B00005R62N|5.0|I have trouble really putting my finger on what makes this album so great. It seems, besides the superb performances and top notch production, that there is an aura in this recording that lends an almost supernatural feeling to it. <BR>Rob's vocals in particular are just staggering, and when he screams \\"VICTIM OF CHAAAANNNNGGGGEEESSSSSS!\\" right before Glenn's solo you know that this is no ordinary human being at the microphone. This is the METAL GOD, and this performance alone cemented his reputation for all time. It sends shivers up my spine every time.<BR>In addition to the superhuman vocals, it seems that there is something really different about the guitar tone here that adds an intensity to the proceedings. It is pure energy, like nothing we've heard from them before or since, and I think it is a major part of that mysterious quality which makes this recording as incredible as it is.<BR>I don't care if, in actuality, it is \\"Unleashed in the Studio\\". The final product here  is definitely a highlight in heavy metal history, because it takes you to a place filled with tumultuous, energized. unrelenting METAL the likes of which we probably won't hear again.
B000000WA4|5.0|28 songs, over two hours of music, a diverse collection of songs that, together, provide an album of incredible scope and edge, whilst flowing together perfectly. This is 'The Wall' for the disaffected Generation X.<br />This is one of those albums that will stay with you for life. I remember being overwhelmed by it upon first hearing. Up until that stage, I had listened mainly to standard 'grunge' and other rock, and then suddenly being knocked out by a double album containing blistering alt-rock anthems (Zero, Tales of a Scorched Earth), radio-friendly rock songs (1979, Tonight Tonight), beautiful keyboard-led singalongs (We Only Come Out At Night, Lily My One and Only), and those gorgeous acoustic songs (Take Me Down, Farewell and Goodnight). I couldn't categorise this group. Were they grunge? No- they had those 'soft', ballad-like songs. Were they pop? No- they had XYU and An Ode To No-one. Were they straight-out rock? No- are straight-out rock-songs flooded with orchestras and keyboards? Were they inspirational? Yes. Definitely.<br />The album fast became a soundtrack to my life. It had something for every mood I was in, something to serve every musical taste I had. But it didn't have anything I disliked. I found myself immersed in sounds I once wouldn't have cared for, and loving even more the songs that had first drawn me to the group. The band sounded so inspired, so full of ideas. The album flowed together perfectly. It almost had a 'flavour' about it.<br />To this very day, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness stands as one of my all-time favourite albums. No band since has been so daring and so diverse, and I don't know if another band ever will be. There are very few albums that can stand the test of time like this one does. Billy wanted to take things further than ever before, and this album shows exactly why labels such as 'grunge' and 'alt-rock' are too restrcitive when referring to his mastery as a songwriter and performer.<br />Favourite songs? Ilove it all equally. I cannot choose. Selecting one song would be unjust to another. You listen, you decide.<br />Seven stars.
B00005JLYW|4.0|It seems the latest trend of mega-blockbuster DVDs is to have not only the movie but as many special \\"extras\\" as can fit onto a DVD or two.  There were some special features, but none of them really interested me.  They could have done more... the feature on the XXX-Treme was the best one.  But I would have liked to see how they worked on some of the special effects or a \\"making-of\\" feature... Don't come to this movie expecting a huge plot because 1) it isn't there and 2) it shouldn't be there.<br />The special effects were fun, as was the costuming.  Seeing the three angels as Nuns was interesting and funny.  There are a lot of explosions and a lot of stunt-men (and stunt-women) must have been used.  The action scenes makes me NOT want to meet either of these girls in a dark alley.<br />For a night of light-brained, high-special-effects entertainment I would recommend this movie.  I wouldn't recommend it for the little ones...
B00005R5G9|3.0|Women may enjoy the romantic, hopeful elements of the story.  Check the reviews on this movie.  Everyone is correct.  Obvious, silly, with a screenplay that sounds like it's written by a high school male - performances are broad and cartoonish.  All participants are a stereotype.<br />However, on closer scrutiny, the real villains in this movie are not the conniving men, but the shallow, bitchy women.  One frustrated clown, articulates the theme - surrounded by beautiful women, he cries out that he wants a mannequin.  That is, a kind, woman who can nurture.  That's the irony and the romantic appeal of the movie.  A nerd lucks out by finding love with a beautiful phantom soul.<br />I should know better, but I like this movie.
0446677450|4.0|Through story form Robert explains his perspective on how to properly invest money into purchasing items (aka assets) that will turn around and make money for you.  He gives a wonderful story of how he made money opening up a comic book viewing \\"store\\" and he sites many examples of how he purchased assets and turned them into a great money making opportunity.<br />This book has done well on the best-seller lists and for good reason.  He advocates learning many financial skills but neglected to teach them himself.  But for those who are interested in getting out of the rat-race and becoming self reliant, this is a good book to start with.<br />My largest complaint:  he does take a while to get to the point.  A lot of this book is useless sluff.  But there is a lot of good financial advice to be found in the book.<br />Check out many other books written by the same author that will expand on the topics touched upon in this book.
B000002KOG|3.0|This album is good, but only if you have it on vinyl.  The song &quot;What did you do to my life&quot; is mixed very badly on the cd, with that sort of droning incredibly irritating organ sound.  This is only one instance of the poor transfer to digital that occured with this cd.  It is on one of the best songs on the album, but just sounds horrible on the cd.  I don't think they put this one out on vinyl since the early eighties, I was lucky to get it from an old neighbor.  On LP, &quot;what did you do to my life,&quot; without the bad electronic noises, gives the album a cohesion that it otherwise lacks.  Does anyone else out there know what I'm talking about?  The rest of the album lacks the rich production level of the LP.  It's almost like it's a completely different album. I know--this is Neil Young minutia, but I just can't get over how bad this album sounds on cd.
B00005JKC3|5.0|There are movies these days that have partially or entirely computer-generated characters, usually not human. In 1998, we got the (quite unjustly) underrated GODZILLA, as well as SMALL SOLDIERS. in 1999, we got the (quite unjustly) overrated STUART LITTLE, and the kick ass TOY STORY 2. And in 2002, there was SPIDER-MAN. <br />So now, after years of being stuck in the realm of comic books (and television; Lou Ferrigno is a worthy non-CG green gargantua), HULK gets a shot at silver screen prominence.<BR>And it get's a perfect bull's eye.<br />What are those people who didn't like HULK talking when they say it didn't have enough action? Are they $#!**ing me? Hello? The Hulk trashes a lab, goes at it with a pack of Hulk-dogs, throws couches, people, cars, tanks, and about everything else he can gets his hands on, gets a trip into the stratosphere on an F-15, etc., etc., etc. What more do you want? The Hulk to marry Betty Ross? Well, if you do, just wait until HULK 2, dammit!
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|Rolling Stone gushes praise and notes that The Strokes didn't change a thing -- except to add a song or two that is ``Radio Friendly''.  Nothing wrong with that: if one is going to form a popular music band, then having some music that is actually popular is a good idea.  But The Strokes might enjoy a very short-lived popularity.  At only 33 minutes long, this CD seems to be a bit of a ripoff.  Are they planning to re-release this next year in a \\"Special - Extended - Remastered - Extra-Tracks - Edition\\", and just making sure that they have plenty of space for the ''new'' material? Just in case, save your money and wait.<br />The Strokes are the Punk-Rock or New-Wave version of a Civil War re-enactment (at best). \\"Room on Fire\\" only confirms the doubts about ''The Strokes'' raised by \\"Is This It\\".  <br />For this 2nd CD, those excuses seem lame--and untrue.  Spiky haircuts and skinny ties cut and pasted The Cars, guitar riffs from \\"the C.B.G.B.'s punk scene,\\"  blah-blah-who-cares-[not us!]-deadpan vocals from Lou Reed.  \\"Room on Fire\\" is a re-enactment, not an original work.  They are this year's \\"Psychedelic Furs\\" (fawned on by critics, avoided by rock fans).<br />The Strokes sound like 'an act' -- they lack the intensity to sound like they can be taken seriously.  Their good press derives from location, location, and location (New York City, next to all of the media HQ's). The Strokes are image and surface, with almost no depth or substance. They craft their image with faux magazine paparazzi photos that depict them carousing with ladies in New York City nightclubs. It looks cool but it's just part of the act.  However, it accouts for at least half of their appeal.  Beyond the facade and image, The Strokes are like a movie scene (or perhaps, a music-video digital effect): a great, but ultimately false, front -- nothing more.<br />As a re-enactment or re-creation of something original, \\"Room on Fire\\" is accurate, and consistent, making a review really easy.  The songs hardly vary in melody lines and rhythmic pacing. They even seem to be in the same key (it's hard to tell, but probably doesn;'t matter much, since their genre-style choices are not concerned with the academic elements of music making). Each song is based on fast, downward guitar strums, snappy 4/4 drum beats with a loud up-front fuzz-guitar line (or an occasional keyboard substitute), and nearly indecipherable, heroin-chic vocals. The vocal style is a late-1990's New York Fashion theme that became all the rage with New York's high-society designer-drug-abuser crowd, but it bombed everywhere else.<br />While the elements are all here, overall the whole CD sounds like it's just a heap of Lower-East-Side attitude -- from Deperately Seeking Susan (bored suburban housewife looking for excitement), not the Velvet Underground or the punk scene.  I wonder if ''Blue Man Group'' had ''The Strokes'' in mind when they wrote their rock concert satire song.<br />The best song from \\"Room on Fire\\" is \\"12:51.\\" It's a hummable, head-bobbing, tasteful pop song -- a probably radio hit, but from 1980.  It has a fantastic keyboard hook; it sounds like a Blondie song -- with grunge band vocals.  But it feels fake: as if The Strokes have turned into a shadow (or at best, a distantly-reflected image) of rock and roll. While they may have the look and image of late-'70s New York rock, they sound like cyborgs.  They're a well-made copy, crafted to travel lightly in a data-clogged culture.  Parents take note: The Strokes' music can be downloaded safely without fear of the emotional impact, social subversion or, most importantly, the strangeness of the originals. It's as safe as milk for kids.<br />\\"Room on Fire\\" is not Rock and Roll: it's a Rock-hologram; an image illusion that only seems real until you try to touch it -- and realize that \\"Nothing\\" has deceived you.

B0000A0DRY|5.0|This is one of the albums that led to the famous Summer Of Love in 1967.  If you ask me, Jefferson Airplane and The Doors were the two greatest rock bands of the 60's, and probably of all time.  This was also the first album they made with Grace Slick, the greatest singer that ever lived, period.  The Goddess Of Rock.<BR>The moods on this album vary.  Some of it is cheery, happy and flower-powerish, and some of it is gloomy and dark.  All members of the band were great at what they did.  I seriously consider this to be in the top five greatest rock albums ever, maybe even #1.<br />\\"SHE HAS FUNNY CARS\\": Excellent, upbeat and reassuring (\\"Your mind's guaranteed, it's all you'll ever need\\").  Great psychedelic guitar outro from Jorma.  Killer vocal harmonies.<br />\\"SOMEBODY TO LOVE\\": Now what can I say about this masterpiece?  I can NEVER get tired of this one.  Grace sings with tremendous passion, enough proof that she was the greatest ever.  <br />\\"MY BEST FRIEND\\": One of my favorites on the album.  This tune is simply irresistable.  Wonderful, relaxed atmosphere.  I'm in paradise every time I hear it.<br />\\"TODAY\\": One of the loveliest ballads ever written.  The final verse, which is a duet between Grace and Marty, is priceless.<br />\\"COMIN' BACK TO ME\\": Another amazingly beautiful song.  The poetic lyrics are brilliant and very profound.<br />\\"3/5 OF A MILE IN 10 SECONDS\\": We're back to fast, grooving rock for this one!  It should be played very loud.<br />\\"D.C.B.A.-25\\": The only lead vocal by Kantner on the album, and it's a great song.  Very melodic, and it makes me feel so good every time I hear it.<br />\\"HOW DO YOU FEEL\\": The album's weakest track.  Not bad at all, but not nearly as good as the rest of the album.  The flute playing by Grace is fantastic, and the vocal harmonies are marvelous.<br />\\"EMBRYONIC JOURNEY\\": Some would call it 'filler', but not me.  It shows Jorma's stunning acoustic skills and his ability to go from gentle to rough in a split second.<br />\\"WHITE RABBIT\\": Timeless.  Spooky.  Haunting.  Euphoric.  Grace's vocals practically give chills to the listener.<br />\\"PLASTIC FANTASTIC LOVER\\": Great way to close the album, with a pounding, upbeat jam.  Marty said that this song is about television and how too many people are addicted to it.<br />\\"IN THE MORNING\\": Fabulous blues jam.  Jorma proves that the band is definitely not limited in style.  Features great harmonica and guitar.<br />\\"J.P.P. MCSTEP B. BLUES\\": I'm not really a big fan of this one, but it's an okay song.<br />\\"GO TO HER\\": This one is excellent.  It's far better than the version they recorded with their original singer, Signe Anderson.  Such a hypnotizing song.<br />\\"COME BACK BABY\\": Whoa!  Dig those crazy wah-wah licks, Jorma!<br />The mono versions of \\"Somebody To Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\" aren't anything to write home about, 'cause they sound practically the same as the originals.  But the other four bonus tracks are definitely worth having.<br />This might be the greatest rock album of all time.  Screw The Beatles.  Screw The Stones.  Hear the roar of the Jefferson Airplane!
B0000029DD|5.0|Of the 1000+ cds I own, Jeff Buckley is my favorite. I will always miss him. All fans must check out the album Distorted Lullabies by Ours to see how well the torch has been carried.
0671042858|5.0|As an avid hiker, I found this book terrifying!  King demonstrated how easily a person could become lost and disoriented on a simple family outing.  You think you're safe because there's a path, but what happens when you lose sight of that path in a massive forest?  King did an amazing job of portraying the fears and natural progression of exhaustion of his lead character.  This is King at his most subtle and most stunning!  I rate this up with his best work.  Highly recommended for a quick but satisfying read!  My only regret is that I didn't pick it up sooner.
B000099T2L|1.0|I only bought this because of &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and was really disappointed with the rest of the album. Even though &quot;baby boy&quot; gets a lot of air time, it's certainly not warranted.  Don't buy this album unless you've heard the entire thing.  In the first run, i couldn't stand to listen to this CD past track 3.  Then I let it play in the background one night, and was thankful when the noise was over.  Seriously sucks!  Which is really disappointing considering her talent. (the clothes in her CD jacket are cute though)
0060977264|5.0|I am not a writer myself, as my review will clearly show, but I must say this.  This was a truly excellent book, and I've already recommended it to 4 other people.  It is true that it does get very religious, and some people have docked it for that.  I must ask this though, why can't they step back and see it as general spirituality?  I for one don't believe in organized religion, but couldn't put this book down.  I feel that says something for the quality of the book, and for the meaning it gives.  I wish that everyone could read this book, and not get hung up on simple things.
B00003CX8U|1.0|I was very impressed with this when it came out. I was 18.<br />What's wrong? Let's see: the dancing, the music, the choreography, the sensibility, the dialogue, the sermonizing, the acting, the pseudo-sensitivity, the posing, the style-over-substance approach to presenting -- nothing at all.<br />Not the most-overrated film ever. But very close. Wake up people! It's all flash! In some rather minimal way, that was the point of the movie ... so, thank me. I saved you from a 2 hour-long 'revelation' ...
B00009RGB6|5.0|Fast, engrossing and suspenseful with a surprise ending. Watch this for the fun of seeing two very dangerous and skilled men hunt and try to kill each other. <br />The knife fights are memorable. No cute and coy Steven Seagal dancing here. These men push themselves in these scenes and make you believe it. It's true though, as other reviewers have said, that the story development was sometimes a little vague and unrealistic. For example, as another reviewer pointed out Jones plays a *top* trainer of elite killers who claims that he's never had to kill himself. Just from my own military experience that strikes me as pretty unlikely. Nevertheless, this movie grabbed me. It's a blast, just don't pick it to death (Sooo, if you're a guy and you need to have everything about the plot and character behavior spelled out for you so you can 'truly experience the film' then I think you'd be happier watching a Kevin Kostner flick with your boyfriend. Ahem ;)<br />Jones and Del Toro are excellent and do a credible job with their parts as much as the script allows. These two actors really get into it and make you cringe and smile at the same time. <br />Watch this movie just for the fun of it.
1400049628|5.0|This is a great book. Written in a straightforward, dry manner, it never breaks &quot;character&quot; and is all the better for it. Fans of the zombie genre(?) will certainly find vast amounts of pleasure within these pages but so will anyone with a skewed sense of humor. Heed its lessons well!
B00005JGAB|5.0|Its pointless to talk about how much this album signified a historic change to the music scene.  You can read any one of the hundreds of other reviews for that.<br />Every rock, punk, new wave, grunge, emo, and/or lo-fi mother-scratcher from Queens to San Diego owes it to themselves to pick up this record and listen to it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...
B000069HZP|4.0|Less than a full year before A PERFECT MURDER (1998) was released, Michael Douglas starred in THE GAME (1997), which is not simply a Michael Douglas movie, it's a David Fincher film-and you know what that means!  From a screenplay by John D. Brancato &amp; Michael Ferris, THE GAME is classic Fincher: dark, mysterious and with a constant sense of brooding danger in which lets you know that somehow, somewhere, something is not quite kosher.<br />In THE GAME, Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton; a man of great wealth and power and totally devoid of any human compassion (as evidenced by the cold and callous way in which he fires a longtime employee).  If this sounds like Gordon Gekko to you, it's because Michael Douglas, at this stage in his career, plays cold callousness like no one else.  Call it typecasting; I call it brilliant acting ability and being smart enough to stick with what works.  However, Gordon Gekko in the legendary Oliver Stone-directed WALL STREET (1987) didn't have a younger brother; Nicholas Van Orton does.  On Nick's 48th birthday (the same age at which his father died, hint hint), his black-sheep-of-the-family brother Conrad, as brilliantly played by Sean Penn, visits him in his sprawling, cherry-wood office and hands his older sibling his birthday present: a business card with the name Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) on it.  &quot;What is this,&quot; Nicholas cynically asks.  The sly answer given by Penn is one of my favorite lines in the film, and one that tells us that his elder bro's life will never be the same, once he begins to play THE GAME.<br />Along the way, Nicholas Van Orton encounters CRS and its primary spokesman (or so he thinks) Jim Feingold (played with disarming confidence by character actor James Rebhorn), a mouthy cocktail waitress (Deborah Kara Unger) who seems to hold the secret to THE GAME, and a spooky-looking full-size inanimate clown who appears to watch everything he does.  Also along the way are near-brushes with death that culminate with Conrad Van Orton's tearful admission that he &quot;didn't know what the $#@! he had gotten them into&quot; when he had signed his brother up for THE GAME. But that's still just the beginning...<br />Everyone is superbly cast in this film, including BABY DOLL (1956) herself, Carroll Baker, and the always-watchable Armin Mueller-Stahl.  But the real star here is David Fincher; he is so adept at guiding us down a labyrinthic path of which only he knows the end, that all we can do is hang on and enjoy the rollercoaster ride on which he breathlessly takes us.  He primarily relies on small, subtle signs of foreboding to generate suspense, as opposed to full-blown violence and gore.  Although this is one of those films that relies on first-time viewers' lack of knowledge of what to expect, and thusly loses something on repeated viewings, it is still a very good film to re-visit on occasion, if only to experience Fincher's unique style (this film and A PERFECT MURDER are miles apart in this respect, believe me), Douglas and Penn's acting and the production values, which are first-rate.  <br />See and experience THE GAME for yourself. <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000099T2L|3.0|I can't stand the way the music industry turns young innocent girls into these video bad girls.  There is no reason why Beyonce had to put out an album like this.  I bought it for my daughter because I am used to the innocent fun and empowering lyrics of Destiny's Child.  I guess \\"bootylicious\\" should have been a sign of what was to come from Beyonce. I don't understand why she has become this way. I wish I was able to hear extended samples of her songs before I bought this CD.<br />Crazy in Love - great dance song, good blend of the old and new music<br />Naughty Girl - my daughter was embarrassed to hear it; I was disgusted<br />Baby Boy - Good club song, love the international feel; hate the video<br />Hip Hop Star - can do without it<br />Be With You - no comment<br />Me, Myself and I - I like the message of this song; not a hit, but it is a good filler<br />Yes - too Isley brother-like; way too sexy for my young child's ears and I personally don't care to hear about Beyonce being touched and pleased and rubbing bodies with sweat between her and ?? (Jay-Z); yuck!  tacky<br />Signs - hate it<br />Speechless - too, too, slow - reminds me of R. Kelly - not impressed<br />That's how I Like it - I really hate this song with a passion.  It is so very annoying.  Way too much noise going on in this song. Awful!<br />Closer I get to you - I love Luther Vandross.  They sound good together, but this song is a classic and it was better left alone.  Can't nobody touch Donnie Hathaway...!<br />Dangerously In Love - okay<br />Gift from Virgo - different; creative; not a hit<br />Daddy - sweet; She needs to thank her daddy because he has been the driving force behind her success; nice tribute<br />\
B000089RW0|4.0|Even though this movie was not like the original Ghost Ship movie made in the late 60's-early 70's, it was an awesome movie. The actresses Margulies, and Francesca Rittondini were very beautiful. The movie had a great story line and the ending was excellent. Good special effects too. <br />Best part of the movie was when that little ghost-girl took the character back into time to tell how everyone died on that ship. Good club music at that particular scene and very macabre.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie was just plain sweet.  Everything was done in perfect detail.  The effects were awesome.  And the battle sequence was stunning.  A lot of [people complain that there is too much fighting in this movie.  But the war is the main focus on this part of the Lord of the Rings.  Plus some people complain that they left things out that were in the book.  Well, we should all know by now that movies are more often than not, different from the book.  The movie was already 3 and a half hours (minus the extra long version on DVD), they could probably have made each part 5 hours if they wanted to.  Plus i heard some of the stuff not in it would appear in Return of the King.  That's fine.  It's all about what is going on.  It makes more sense to me to do it that way.  Anyways...The Lord of the Rings was written as one book, not three.  And since this is just one movie serialized into three parts (cant have people in the theatre for 10 hours!) it doesn't matter.  <br />I am awaiting the Return of the King with much excitment.

B00005U1YO|5.0|This is one of my favorite electronic albums ever.  With songs like The Test, Gravity Bouce, Star Guitar, It Came From Afrika, etc...you do not need anything else.  If you want to dance the night away, or sway drunkingly with your best gal, do yourself a favour and bring this cd.
0393312836|5.0|Before reading this novel I saw the movie, and I do not reccondmend doing so. By watching the movie I was unable to capture the imagery in this wonderful, wonderful book. The nadast language that is used throughout the novel was easy to pick up on after about the second chapter. At first I thought the book was just all fun and games but after Alex got sent jail I started noticing deep insite. The book is talking about choice, and how if you cannot choose what you want, then you are nothing. Sure, Alex was &quot;cured alright&quot; but he was still as sick and demented as he was before getting treated. I'm sure you have all heard this before but why not say it again, eh?

B000067CPX|5.0|when I brought 'by the way' i did not think it could be as good as the previous release 'californication', but luckly i was wrong. This Cd was brillant in every musical sense. Funked up rock tunes such as 'Minor thing' and 'can't stop' mixed in with more soulful tunes such as 'dosed'and 'don't forget me'made this album the best release of 2002.
B00005JLKN|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this movie, for two main reasons. First and foremost is the fact that it provides such a stunning contrast to the superbly inferior Manhunter (which, in my opinion, was a waste of William Petersen's obvious talent). Furthermore, Manhunter didn't have the same kind of psychological suspense between the characters that was present in this particular film.<BR>The second reason is that this film so closely paralleled the movie. Of course, there was a little bit of &quot;liberal interpretation&quot; in the beginning on the part of Brett Ratner and the screenwriters, but it still adheres fairly close to the original storyline, and gives us some more insight into why Lecter and Graham hate each other so much.<BR>Edward Norton delivers a spectacular performance as the psychologically haunted Will Graham, and Anthony Hopkins performs just like he did in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; as the demonically grotesque Hannibal Lecter. Philip Seymour-Hoffman could have done better as Freddy Lounds, but I think Anthony Heald did one of the best jobs portraying the abrasive Frederick Chilton.<BR>Well, here's to Brett Ratner. Bon Appetit.
B00008973Q|3.0|&quot;Ran&quot; is one of my favorite films, and so eager was I to have it on disc that the predictably sub-par Fox Lorber edition was one of the first DVDs I acquired soon after we bought our first DVD player.  Fox Lorber did their usual quick-and-dirty (but first-to-market) job, basing their crude transfer on a copy of the film that was anything but pristine and was in no sense &quot;restored&quot;.  Unlike the present edition, however, the subtitles were error-free and faithful to the original theatrical release of the film.<br />Needless to say I eventually bought this version, too, and to say that the image and sound on this edition are an &quot;improvement&quot; over the Fox Lorber edition requires a great deal of qualification; it would be faster to say that they've been extensively processed but not necessarily improved in most respects, and I fully endorse Ben Rudiak-Gould's review of this DVD.  My own less technically knowlegeable assessment is based on what I see and hear on this disc and what I saw and heard in the theatre when this &quot;restoration&quot; was screened theatrically a couple of years ago, compared with a still absolutely clear and distinct memory of my first theatrical experience of &quot;Ran&quot; in 1985 -- an experience which astounded me and profoundly enlarged my understanding of the possibilities of cinema.<br />My hope is that some day Criterion will acquire the rights to produce their own version of &quot;Ran&quot;; one which, I'm confident, would finally do justice to this masterpiece in this medium.  The history of &quot;Ran&quot; on DVD has been a sorry one, with the profiteers triumphing over those who sincerely love movies, especially this movie, and a more capable and ambitious writer than myself could almost discern apt points of comparison with the story of the House of Ichimonji and Shakespeare's tragedy of King Lear, on which it was based.<br />In the meanwhile I have two editions of &quot;Ran&quot; sitting on my shelf,neither of which are are worthy of this immense work of art, for which they are but faded simulacra.
B000002UA0|5.0|There is no denying that this is the essential psychedelic album. Syd Barrett's career was short but so full of incredible songs and visionary style that it's hard to compare anything to him. Syd started with the usual blues rock basics (the pink floyd's first two demos- Lucy Leave and King Bee clearly show this.) At that time Syd was rhythm guitarist and singer. After Bob Close left the band, Syd took the band into new directions that no one ever could have imagined. Next came Arnold Layne and the See Emily play singles and then Piper at the Gates of Dawn. With this album it captures Syd's Pink Floyd at its best. Every song does indeed have a purpose but it's not very obvious unless you know a lot about Syd and his influences. Simply put it's the best pink floyd album in my opinion but I know I'm in a very small minority here. Also worth checking out is Syd's solo material (box set preferably) and the second Pink Floyd album. <br />Without Syd, there would be no Pink Floyd.
0060591706|5.0|I already finished City of the Beast and had to get this one!This book is awesome!! I love the adventures of Kate Cold, his grandson Alexander, the International Geography photographers and all the characters like; Nadia, Boroba (the monkey),  and in this particular story the people of the Himalayas; the budist monks, Pema, Judit Kinski, Tensing and the future king, Dil Bahadur. The author Isabel Allende writes this stories so that you can almost feel like you're part of it. In this one, she writes about a Sacred Dragon statue of gold with beautiful gems and magical powers, that is secretly protected in the Kingdom of Tunkhala on the Tibet. Only the King knows the code to use this magical powers  and of course the bad guys (the blue men from the scorpion sect) under the command of Tex Armadillo who wants to steal the Holy Gold Dragon. All that and more happen in the Gold Dragon Kingdom.<br />I can't wait for the next adventure of Kate Cold, Alexander Cold,  the International Geographic group and maybe Nadia Santos.
2707306959|5.0|This autobiographical novel is pure art. I read it in French first, but the translation loses nothing of the suspended breath of emotion so often found in French literature. There is nothing overwritten in the prose nor overstated in the story. The tale of a girl's forbidden passion is breathtaking in its simplicity and poignant in its retelling by a woman now grown old.
0316518565|2.0|Somehow Nick Leeson ended up with the reputation as some kind of whiz kid but reading this book you get a different sense. The derivatives Mr. Leeson was trading do not seem particularly sophisticated (don't compare this to LTCM). But you wouldn't learn much about them from this book. I got the sense that Mr. Leeson was grappling with very basic financial questions. As a consequence, the book tends to be repetitive in a description of losses getting out of control and the soap opera building around that. You also have a nagging feeling that you never get the full story. However, the book is interesting where it describes the complete breakdown of financial and management controls.
0316666343|3.0|I was quickly drawn into the story. It certainly has an unusual premise. The author probably purposefully selected the most ordinary setting she could think of for the tagedy to take place. As you would expect from such a milieu, the characters are ordinary and believable in their ordinariness. I experienced sympathy for the characters, especially the father and son, but I didn't get choked up over the story, which started out as a literary work and metamorphosed into popular fiction, running out of steam at the end.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|A bit of an offset from Is This It, with more complicated bass lines and extravagant riffs, Room on Fire has it down. This album is well done. Each track manages to meld with one another, that is until the wonderful surprise of &quot;Under Control&quot; where The Strokes go 50's. The rawness of it is amazing. From lead singer, Julian Casablancas, explicitive use of the phrase &quot;Say what?&quot;, to Nikolai Fraiture's  jumpy bass, this album is a must for 2003.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|If I was forced to give one word reviews of everything else I everything else I read, see, hear or play from here on in, that is the one word I would use for Clint Eastwood's incredibly compelling western &quot;Unforgiven.&quot;  To date, it is the most story driven, theme driven and character driven film I have ever seen, western or otherwise.  Beginning with an intense knife attack in a whorehouse and ending with a final, soul-wrenching showdown between Eastwood and Gene Hackman (who won an oscar for his trouble), the film never lets up on its sheer dramatic force or its provoking moral play on violence and its inevitable consequences.<br />Clint Eastwood plays a hog farmer named William Munny, now leading a relatively normal life after decades of being a feared and remorseless bounty hunter, with his loyal partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).  But Munny now is down on his luck, with the farm struggling.  When a chance comes about for a $1000 bounty put up by angry prostitutes from Big Whiskey, Wyoming, Munny and Logan take up the offer, along with a green but eager fellow hunter (Jaimz Woolvett).  Meanwhile, in Big Whiskey, the town sherriff, Little Bill Dagget (Hackman) has put a ruthless lid on the bounty, and beats up an old rival who comes looking for it, English Bob (Richard Harris) who by the way shoots chinese men working on the railroad for kicks and giggles.<br />When I first learned &quot;Unforgiven&quot; was garnered with best picture and best director oscars, I thought it had something to do with Eastwood being the old vanguard that he is and not so much talent oriented.  I could not have been more wrong.  Eastwoods' direction is outstanding, building scenes of dynamic character development with the hand of a skilled craftsman.  Every extra, every flat and otherwise unimportant chracter shows real, human emotion on their face, which is something I have never quite seen on screen before. Eastwoods' direction is aided by excellent, oscar-winning film editing.  &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is a prime example of direction and editing working off each to mold scenes of true power, and give the viewer a real sense and feel for the surroundings.  And the film is beautifully shot in the stunning scenery near Alberta, Canada.  Filmmaking doesn't get much better than &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; and Eastwood is far more than just Hollywoods' old vanguard.
B00006BS6T|3.0|The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the early movie flight sequences.  Usually whenever this movie is on HBO, I watch this part and then turn something else on.  The rest of the movie really sucks.  And I, personally, am getting tired of Gene Hackman playing the same roles over and over.<br />Basically, the flight sequence is probably the coolest air scene ever in a movie.  Top Gun can't even compete really.  The fireball is hokey, but overall the sequence is done pretty well.  The rest of the movie is boring.  Nothing to do with flying at all.  It's one man versus an entire army, and guess who wins?  It's a good old patriotism movie (This movie came out like a few months after 9/11, if I remember correctly).
0142004235|1.0|In spite of all the good reviews raving about this masterpiece, I don't like it and I'm not going to struggle with it anymore. If it does get interesting, I'll never know as I'm not going to continue.  It was painful reading.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This is pure, undiluted horror, with a superb musical score and fabulous scenes of terror and suspense. This movie is about a teenage babysitter, Laurie Strode (portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis, the daughter of Janet Leigh from Psycho) who is stalked by a maniacal killer, &quot;the boogeyman&quot;, on Halloween Night. Micheal Myers was a young boy when he killed his sister and was then sent to an asylum. One night, he escapes from the asylum, and relives the terror of Halloween night again ... and again ... and again. This wonderful movie uses suspense and a great musical score to replace the blood and gore every movie uses. And that is what sets it apart from the other horror movies.
B00005V9IL|3.0|I've always wondered what's &quot;really&quot; underneath all that ocean water that covers three-fourths of the earth's surface.  Could there be more than just the critters that adorn my plate when I visit Red Lobster?<br />Well, I must confess, I just lied:  I really don't think about things like that, but James Cameron's handsome film THE ABYSS certainly tweaks at my brain matter and introduces a most interesting story that we humans are not even alone on our own planet when it comes to intelligent life.<br />Yes, we have drama:  a downed nuclear sub deep in the ocean, an underwater oil exploration platform hijacked by the feds to go on a rescue mission, and a Navy SEAL commander just itching to go bonkers.  We also have a failed romance suddenly rekindled, even though it's beyond me why anyone would want to light a fire with grouchy engineer Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), but for whatever reason ex-husband Bud Brigman (Ed Harris) does.  And then we are treated to magnificent underwater camera shots, high-tech gadgets and machines, and special effects as only James Cameron can paint on celluloid.<br />As viewers, we are asked to jettison our common sense to the high seas as we watch people swim thousands of feet underwater without protective gear, but that's okay:  the assault on  disbelief is only beginning.  With escalating tensions between the U.S. and the old U.S.S.R. coming to a head, the pesky human race suddenly receives an eye-opening comeuppance by a superior form of intelligent life that comes up from the abyss to paternally warn us to knock it off.  Lesson learned, planet saved.  I'll have the shrimp scampi with extra sauce.<br />--D. Mikels
B000002KO1|5.0|This CD represents one of the best rock albums ever made, clearly the best music being made at the time of its release, and, as many have suggested, the best the Pretenders ever created. At a time when the airwaves were dominated by bad music, as punk and new wave were emerging as alternatives, this band stood out. Unlike many of those alternatives, this music still sounds fresh.<br />There may never have been a better rock song written than Precious, and when the song moves past the opening Ramones-like guitar strumming, we instantly travel far beyond punk to reveal a unique and wondrous voice and singing style, then a guitar sound never heard before. My jaw still drops as raw energy and musical flair combine to introduce what was then an entirely new sound. Whether it's the guitars, the way chords are combined, or Chrissie Hynde's voice, this is a band that is distinctive at its best, as here, or at its worst.<br />This album was made before CD's, and had two sides that were put to good use. Side one was absolutely blistering rock, from Precious to The Wait, and was all I listened to 20 years ago. Sophisticated, biting, shocking lyrics were spat out with energy that is preserved here. If Chrissie Hynde's voice has been an influence on many others, so was Patti Smith's, very audible in The Wait. Side two was the pop side. It doesn't have that same fierce rock sound, but beginning with the Kinks cover that was our first ballad from Chrissie Hynde, it stands out in its own way. Kid remains a good ballad, and Brass in Pocket a classic pop anthem. Private Life is vocally and lyrically sophisticated, and Mystery Achievement picks up the pace to close the album with a driving beat and changes that still sounds great.<br />There simply isn't a bad song here. This is a near-perfect album. Amazon is full of 5-star reviews for everything from the best to the worst, but this is the essential Pretenders album. It may be downhill from here, but that isn't unusual or bad. Many singers or bands spend years putting together their best material for a first album, then have less time to write songs for those that follow shortly thereafter. And then are simply not able to rise twice to the level at which one changes the course of popular music. Isn't once enough?

B00009V7P8|1.0|While I'm generally all for heart-on-the-sleeve balladry -  there's a distinct difference between emoting and mewling.

020530902X|5.0|This book hammers home the point that, to learn to write, one must focus on the clarity and simplicity of the words with which one writes.<br />Certainly there is a time and a place to write complexly; however, Strunk and White are interested in providing the framework of how to write well.  In order to use a framework, you need to start somewhere, and their focus on clarity and simplicity is a good one.  Why try to aspire to the obtuse and the impenetrable if you haven't the basics of cogent writing?  Interested in being a sedulous writer, and not an earnest one?  Well, in order to use such sophisticated words well, one could hardly do better than to suggest that you master the basic elements of effective writing first.  This is where Strunk and White excel.

This will definitely pick you up.
B00003CXB4|4.0|Summary:<BR>Simba (Matthew Broderick - voice; Joseph Williams singing voice), the son of Mufasa (James Earl Jones - voice), the current Lion King, begins the movie by losing his place as heir to the throne due to the manipulations of his evil uncle, <BR>Scar (Jeremy Irons - voice). The plot results in the death of Mufasa and Simba believes he caused the death, so he leaves The Pridelands as an exile.<BR><BR>While in the jungle in exile, Simba makes friends with Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella - voice) and Timon (Nathan Lane - voice), who help Simba get past his guilt by teaching him to live a care free live. This all changes when Simba's childhood friend, Nala (Moira Kelly - voice), now a lioness, enters Simba's new stomping ground and nearly eats his new friends. Simba saves them only to find that Nala is hunting here because Scar has ruined The Pridelands. <BR><BR>With the help of the Prideland's mystic, Rafiki (Robert Guillaume - voice), Nala convinces Simba to return to The Pridelands, defeat Scar, and return everything to how it once was. Simba, with his new friends, and the help of Rafiki (who also happens to be an expert martial artist) and the lionnesses, attacks Scar and his hyena minions and reclaims his throne.<BR><BR>My Comments:<BR>Though many will likely disagree, I think this Disney animated film is only the second best ever created, the best being `The Little Mermaid'. But I did greatly enjoy both films. <BR><BR>What makes The Lion King such an endearing story to me is that it deals with rather complex social issues and does so quite compellingly. The first one is the idea of shame and guilt. Though ultimately it takes Simba realizing that he didn't cause his father's death for him to get over the guilt and it is a bit unclear whether or not the movie is actually encouraging of the care free method for dealing with the guilt, I thought the movie's treatment of the issue was ambiguous enough to allow for numerous personal interpretations. <BR><BR>The idea of Hakunah Matata (spelling?) or `no worries' seems similar to the philosophies of Bertrand Russell, if I understand his perspective clearly. Essentially, Russell didn't think there were very many things that should warrant guilt. Now don't misconstrue what I am saying. Russell and Hakunah Matata don't advocate taking the idea of `no guilt' to its extreme (i.e., don't worry about anything, including providing for your own food), but it does represent a counter perspective to the guilt complex so commonly found in religion (Russell was an atheist). Thus, Simba's approach to dealing with the guilt is generally an approach I would advocate for dealing with guilt that is brought on through the more menial types of things in life (e.g., sin and the socially constructed `guilts' found in religion). I do believe there are times when guilt is psychologically healthy (e.g., when you have intentionally hurt a loved one emotionally or committed a serious crime), but with many of the lesser behaviors, thoughts, etc. that generally accompany guilt, I think the Hakunah Matata approach is a much better philosophy of life.<BR><BR>The second idea that this film addresses is death (another Disney film that deals with death is `Tuck Everlasting'). Though I would guess that the general understanding of the discussion of death in this film probably includes some ideas surrounding religion, I believe you can interpret the story without including religious beliefs, which is part of the reason that I like it. Essentially, the movie says that when people die they join their ancestors in the heavens (very `religiony'). But a looser interpretation could also be that when people die they join the legions of those that have passed on that have left some legacy on the future. The movie doesn't necessarily have to imply a notion of heaven; it could just as easily be interpreted as an idea of an accumulation of traditions, knowledge, and respect, which I would here combine intoone word - a legacy. Mufasa left Simba a legacy. Now, not all legacies are good ones, but all legacies can teach a lesson. I think The Lion King can be interpreted secularly to imply that the deceased should be appreciated (for either their good or bad contributions to society), and their lessons they have taught humanity should be cherished (be them good or bad).<BR><BR>Anyway, I've definitely spent far too much time reading into a film that is generally seen as a movie for kids. As far as the movie goes, I really don't have any criticisms. It's a good movie with a solid story. I can't think of problems with the film off-hand, which is probably why I chose to offer the insights above rather than attempt to critique the movie. As noted, I did like `The Little Mermaid' better, in part because I think the story (and issues, yes, I like to read into these films) was more poignant to me at that particular point in my life. I'm only giving this film 4 stars because it isn't as good as The Little Mermaid, but it is definitely a movie that people should see.
B00009UW0N|5.0|The original Halloween easily surpasses all of its sequels. Without resorting to gimmickry or trickery to startle a viewer into thinking he has been scared, and without resorting to blood splattering a scene with special effects to exhort a cheap scare, John Carpenter tweaks the primordial recesses the human brain where survival and fear instincts are stored. He induces apprehension and fear of the kind that are not mitigated by someone cracking a weak joke at an inopportune moment, hoping to disguise self fright.<br />Great acting by the two main characters goes a long way toward making Halloween a classic. Jamie Lee Curtis is the sympathetic high school girl whose mother stared in Psycho, one of the few predecessors of Halloween that achieved its fright level; and the late Donald Pleasence is the intense and determined doctor of Michael Myers, whose blood curdling assessment of his patient convinces the viewer of a great evil, beyond human. With a  chillingly scary story line, and the perfect setting on Halloween night, this film induces a primordial, subliminal, fear of the unseen but ever present evil that lurks in the soul of all humanity, wicked, supernatural and indestructible.<br />Halloween ranks as the best of the horror genre. It is the quintessential horror film by which others are measured. It set the standard for all horror films that followed.<br />Michael Myers is the inhuman, personification of pure evil: he lurks in the darkness; he does not speak; he moves slowly with a methodical, malevolent gate, fearless and indifferent to his surroundings; he takes time to observe and enjoy his masterpieces which are his dead victims, complete with props including a tombstone, presented as if for an admiring audience. But worst of all, Michael Myers represents an evil that cannot be killed. The evil is indestructible and will live on, to haunt the characters and the viewers forever in their dreams.<br />Toward the end the drama increases along with the blood pressure of the viewer to the last scary and eerie scene which is one of the most haunting and bone chilling in film history!d pressure of the viewer to the last scary and eerie scene which is one of the most haunting and bone chilling in film history!

B000002J1S|2.0|\\"Laughing stock\\"? Based on Chris's references, I would suggest that he's leagues ahead of most of the other reviewers here in both musical knowledge and adventurous tastes.<br />Lamb Lies Down is TOO accessible, and if those of us who've tried to give it a chance still don't get anything out of it, then someone with different tastes has no right to bring \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" into it. I myself tried listening to the album when it first came out, coming back to it years later; both times, I was profoundly disappointed at the fact that all of its songs sound the same, except for maybe three (title track included -- it all goes downhill from there). Peter Gabriel has this sort of tuneless voice that goes well with his ridiculous attempts at wordplay.<br />It is my opinion, as well, that this album does not belong in the pantheon of progressive rock masterpieces such as Close to the Edge and a Passion Play. This is completely different, so those of you who might be expecting something mind-blowing should beware: This is more like a collection of straight-ahead, 1974-tinted pop songs, mixed very dry (the producer could use a lesson in ambiance) and made into a so-called concept album by the fact that a large number of sound-alike piano ballads flesh out the latter half.<br />I recommend King Crimson's brilliant late '60s-early '70s material (up through Larks' Tongues in Aspic), or Emerson, Lake & Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery if you're looking for something worth your time that has been called progressive rock. This is an acquired taste, so at the very least, listen to a few clips before you spend money on the double-disc set and find yourself severely let down.<br />The only reason I can give this one two stars is that at least Genesis was TRYING for something different. It was a bold move in the first place. Perhaps if they'd waited until they got a bit better at composing songs, they could've truly made an album that stood up.<br />Joe
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|In 2001, they brought us a new sound of rock, a terrific album that was an instant classic. Can they do IT again? They did indeed. Room on Fire is no difference of Is This It. They don't disappoint like many do on their sophomore attempts. They delievered another instant classic that will be playing in my CD player and on my computer round the clock.
B0000C0FJB|2.0|I love Rush and expecially live Rush, but this is NOT a good live Rush album.  The mix is not very good, Geddys vocals are too far down and there is too much bass.  The audience is also way too loud in many places too.  Different Stages (from last tour) is MUCH better, and it has most of the same songs anyway.  (Please tell my why they did Natural Science again instead of Camera Eye like they were thinking of doing).  The only good part of this album is the 2 bonus tracks, Between Sun &amp; Moon and Vital Signs.  Both a far better quality then the Rio show, and are great versions.<br />So if you just want a good, recent Rush live album, get Different Stages.  If you really want a live concert from the Vapor Trails tour, get one of the many, live DAT recordings via trade.  Some have better sound quality then this concert recording!
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|When people say this album is a second-generation xerox rip-off of IS THIS IT, I honestly don't see where they're coming from.  Okay, so The Strokes more or less maintain The Strokes-style (which seems appropriate being as how they ARE The f*ckin' Strokes) which people praised the first time around -- suddenly, now they're repeating themselves?  That's a crock.  The new batch of songs is just as strong as the first -- and they do successfully branch out their style into things like soul, reggae, new wave...Bottom line is, I don't see how the White Stripes were acclaimed as having produced a classic album with ELEPHANT (*because it reached &quot;new levels of maturity and musical growth&quot;*...even Jack White didn't agree with these comments, citing he was doing what he always did) and yet the Strokes are facing a backlash.  It's dumb, ELEPHANT is no better than ROOM ON FIRE.  I like them both, but ROOM ON FIRE is simply the one I like better.

B00009V7RF|5.0|This CD is the sh**! If you want something to get your hips rollin and your booty shakin like a person possessed, buy it! Now! Quick, before all the overexposure ( commercials, mtv, etc.) makes you sick to death of it. Really, though, its quite excellent. Warning: Where is the Love is sort of a departure from the rest of the Cd, seems like just a hook to get people to pay attention (Justin Timberlake). After a few listens though, you probably won't even get to that song. Black Eyed Peas rule!
B00005JKZV|3.0|I am an avid fan of the Lord of The Rings trilogy, and have waited for years for someone to do it right.  I give Peter Jackson five stars for successfully capturing the look of Middle Earth.  The scenery, the epic battle scenes, the special effects are all first-rate.  For the most part, I like the cast also (I'm sorry, but Liv Tyler, although beautiful, simply hasn't the depth to play Arwen).  The reason I give the overall movie only three stars is because of the blatant disregard Jackson has for the character of Faramir, the brother of Boromir.  As anyone who has read the book knows, Faramir had wisdom and a sense of honor second only to Aragorn.  In the book, once Faramir became aware of Frodo's plight, he did everything he could to aid Frodo in his quest--he would never have forcibly taken Frodo and Sam to Gondor.  I have to agree with Sam Cable and some of the others who were disappointed in this movie:  There is no need to &quot;improve&quot; on Tolkien; and while I understand that some things have to be condensed or even cut to fit the story into three hours, I see little point in leaving out scenes that did occur in the book to make room for scenes that never happened in the book.  I almost wish I hadn't read the books before seeing the movies; I think I could enjoy the movies more then.  But this is still the best treatment of LOTR I've yet seen.

B00005JLYW|3.0|The first &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; movies was a lot of fun and rather endearing in a kitschy sort of way, which was rather surprising.  But you know the ways of Hollywood.  Instead of building on that strong beginning director and McG have opted for providing more of the same and end up serving up less than before.  If you saw the first film and enjoyed it, then it is hard not to be disappointed in this 2003 sequel.  You will probably want to go rewatch the original after seeing this one to remember why you liked the first one in the first place.<br />All three of the Angels are back for this go around, but the rest of the cast of characters is a curious hodgepodge.  &quot;Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle&quot; brings back Luke Wilson as Pete only so Drew Barrymore's Dylan Sanders can fret that Cameron Diaz's Natalie Cook is going to leave the group (which does provide the biggest laugh in the film when Dylan pictures herself as the last of the trio to remain).  I was surprised to see that Matt LeBlanc had returned as Jason since I thought Lucy Liu's Alex Munday had disposed of him, but he does have some fun scene with John Cleese, a welcome addition as Alex's father.  But Bernie Mac as the new Bosley is a complete waste of talent (you can just imagine a cutting room floor filled with stuff that was too raunchy for the finished film), and Crispin Glover's Thin Man, who was so memorable in the first film, is back for no other reason apparently than he was so memorable in the first film.  But his stylish sense of menace is now turned into a screeching joke.<br />Then there is Demi Moore as Madison Lee, former angel.  The idea of her being the villain is pretty good, although the betrayal element was part of the first film as well.  But besides proving she looks better in a bikini than the three stars of the film, Moore is just not given anything great to do in this film.  There is an overwhelming sense of &quot;waste&quot; that permeates &quot;Full Throttle.&quot;  The scene with the Angels dressed up as nuns to talk to Carrie Fischer is not only not as funny as the frauline scene in the first film, it is not as funny as the same scene in &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot;  I would think that this might kill the franchise, but Barrymore is one of the producers and Diaz and Liu are clearly all having fun doing this so it will probably endure for at least one more film.  But these films are heading downward, which is both the wrong direction for Angels and Hollywood franchises.ot;  The scene with the Angels dressed up as nuns to talk to Carrie Fischer is not only not as funny as the frauline scene in the first film, it is not as funny as the same scene in &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot;  I would think that this might kill the franchise, but Barrymore is one of the producers and Diaz and Liu are clearly all having fun doing this so it will probably endure for at least one more film.

B00006ZSA0|4.0|It is hard to really imagine it when it really comes to Greatest Hits records these past few years in the industry. Unfortunately, people always want more but never recieve it. From the music of Elton John however, it should be considered as a message from above. Still, many people don't seem to remember that out of Elton with poor Greatest Hits records, but with a definitive voice.<br />When Universal released the Elton John Greatest Hits 1970-2002, the U.S. version seemed as if it was a joke, largely because there were just too many good songs that were overlooked. Ironically, that went exactly the same for the import from Britain. The British version had a little difference in its lineup with songs like Kiss The Bride, Blue Eyes and Elton John's 1978 Insturmental Song For Guy. Still, the record doesn't have a few songs the U.S. version has like Blessed and Little Jeannie. Still, there are so many good songs on the take including Believe, Sad Songs (Say So Much), and Your Song. Speaking of the collection, it happens to be the Bonus CD that makes this collection a little bit better, with three of the songs that were on a special Bonus CD that was issued on the U.S. version. Sadly, that Bonus CD was pulled. This one does have a lot more to play around with with three of the songs from the U.S. bonus CD, Your Song, Live Like Horses, and Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me (with George Michael). The only song that wasn't included in this Bonus CD was Elton's live performance of Candle In The Wind in 1987.<br />However, there are 11 songs added to this mix including some that were really overlooked on the U.S. version including True Love, his duet with Kiki Dee from no longer issued Duets record, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, his cover of The Beatles hit, I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That, not released on the U.K. version of this collection, but as a bonus, as well as classics like Border Song, and his cover of The Who's Pinball Wizard, which he performed in the movie, Tommy. There are also a couple of new editions to this collection, including a remake of Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word (with Blue), and Are You Ready For Love, and unreleased song from 1979. The song recently took off here on the Billboard charts, but only as a single.<br />Although many songs are still missing from this collection from the 90's and above, with songs like The Last Song, Simple Life, and Empty Garden, the collection is a far improvement from the issusing of it last year, there is no doubt about Elton John. His music as his legacy will be Forever.e, Tommy.

B00005JLKB|5.0|Maybe it is that Superman is truly indestructible or that the Man of Steel, who was picked this year as one of the Top 10 American pop culture icons, is so respected that not even Hollywood would dare tug on his cape, because \\"Smallville\\" is another successful small screen version of the strange visitor from another planet.  Of course, the great irony is that this time around there is no cape to tug on because this television series is about Clark Kent, years before he put on the suit with the big red \\"S,\\" when he was still in high school, his powers were just starting to kick in, and the girl in his life with the double L name was Lana Lang.<br /><br />Keep in mind that when Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel created the Man of Steel in 1939 there was no Superboy until 1949, when he began part of the futuristic Legion of Super-Heroes.  All we knew about the early days is that just before the doomed planet Krypton exploded to fragments, a scientist placed his infant son within an experimental rocket ship, launching it toward earth.  When the vessel reached our planet, the child was found by an elderly couple, the Kents.  They adopted the super tyke and with love and guidance shaped the boy's future.  As he grew older Clark Kent learned to hurdle skyscrapers, leap an eighth of a mile, raise tremendous weights, run faster than a streamline train, and that nothing less than a bursting shell could penetrate his skin.  When his foster parents passed away, Clark decided he must turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind.<br /><br />The key part of \\"Smallville\\" is that creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar go back to the simple beginning, with young Clark (Tom Welling) growing up on the Kent farm with Martha (Annette O'Toole) and Jonathan (John Schneider).  From the \\"Superboy\\" comic books the series borrows the characters of girl next-door Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) and best buddy Pete Ross (Sam Jones III).  But in addition to covering the basics, Gough and Millar come up with a key triad of additions to the original Smallville mythos.<br /><br />First, they add young Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) to the mix, knowing that he and Superman are fated to be (im)mortal enemies, but that for the present he and Clark are friends (after Clark saves Lex's life in a car accident that should have killed them both).  The key thing is that they truly are friends and that \\"Smallville\\" is as much about how Lex would become a super villain as it is about how Clark would become a super hero.  Throw into the mix Daddy Dearest in the form of Lionel Luthor (John Glover), and Lex would have already pulled all of his hair out if it were not for what happened that fateful day in Smallville.<br /><br />Second, is the brilliant reconceptualization of Superman's arrival on earth where the small spacecraft shows up in the middle of a shower of glowing green meteors that are all that remains of the planet Krypton.  As much as the little boy in that spaceship, those meteors change Smallville forever, turning a little girl into an orphans and a young boy bald, and the small Kansas town into the self proclaimed meteor capital of the world.  More importantly, those little green rocks will have continue to have an impact as they cause a series of mutations with which young Clark will have to contend.  This also accounts for the great in-joke that Clark always becomes a bumbling idiot around Lana because she wears a locket made of kryptonite.<br /><br />Third, there is the multi-purpose character of Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack).  The driving force of the Smallville High School student newspaper her \\"Wall of the Weird\\" documents all the strange things that have happened around Smallville since the meteor shower, making her the show's resident mistress of exposition.  But she is also the tragic figure who longs for Clark the way he casts puppy dog glances at Lana, creating a nice example of teenage love triangle pathos.<br /><br />Overall, Miller and Gough had created an extremely solid premise for their series, which creates multi-dynamics for all of the plotlines.  The first season (2001) is book ended by some great special effects, with the devastating arrival of the meteors in the pilot and the three twisters becoming one in the thrilling cliffhanger finale.  My only serious complaint is that Schneider's Jonathan Kent has too much of an angry edge, which takes away from his font of parental wisdom.  Martha really needs to mellow him out so that he cuts Clark some slack.  I understand that Jonathan is motivated by fears and concerns about his son, but I always liked the gentle influence personified by Glenn Ford in the first Christopher Reeve \\"Superman\\" film.  Turning adolescent traumas into mutant monsters of the week is a hit and miss proposition, but that was true of the first season of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" as well, and look at how well that series turned out.<br /><br />Yes, we can also throw into the mix that Clark and Lana are played by a couple of cute young actors.  Welling is not too serious as the kid who is going to grow up to be the hero who stands for truth, justice, and the American way, and I was going to say Kruek was the WB's new Katie Holmes except after her soft-core Lana scene in the school swimming pool goes way beyond the world's biggest collection of midriff revealing tops.  But the bottom line here is that either the Clark-Lana or the Clark-Lex would be enough to make this a good show and \\"Smallville\\" has both of them and a lot more, including the brilliant metaphor of the scarecrow immortalized in the DVD collection's cover shot.for their series, which creates multi-dynamics for all of the plotlines.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I liked Is This It more, it was a perfect album from start to finish. But I still give this one 5 stars because it's excellent and suffers only if you compare it to the first one and expect that same perfect retro nostalgia for a hybrid band that never quite existed. Songs like Automatic Stop could be from the first album. Room On Fire is faster than Is This It, the tracks are shorter, and with the new elements they add to the mix it's more eclectic, the effect being busier, like you're channel surfing.<br />The End Has No End won me over, that irresistible chorus of &quot;oh no&quot;, pure pop perfection. And this album works very well on infinite repeat, 33 minutes in all. I think it's the speed that makes the album a success, it's like zooming by the countryside in a fast car, each time you pass through there's stuff to take in as you go.
B000089RVR|4.0|Life for rent, Dido's second album, sounded just OK when I bought it. But having it in my cd-player all the time for about a month, made me realise i can't get enough of it! It's just as beautiful as No Angel, but still different.<br />She got more comfortable with her voice this time, her voice stands out and she's not relying on instrumentation like she did before. The sound is more singer-songwriter-ish, the songs like Life For Rent, Mary's In India and This Land Is Mine are not overproduced, but simply show just Dido with her guitar.<BR>There's still that Rollo/Faithless influence, which i love so much, on songs like Stoned, See You When You're 40, Who Makes You Feel and Do You Have A Little Time (she performed this song on her previous tour, not everyone like the studio version because it's totally different, no piano, it doesnt sound so romantic anymore, it's more dark...still, wicked!).<br />Her music is a mix of music genres she's been influenced by: the hip-hop beats, trip-hop, pop, rock, folk, ... You'll find a nice mixture + THAT VOICE.<br />It's easily seen that Dido grew up as a lyricist too, with songs like Mary's In India (the famous twist at the end!), Life For Rent (my favorite right now) and See You When You're 40 (Dido is just mean in it!!! And I love that!).<br />My last thought: Life For Rent is definately worth buying (if you liked No Angel, you can't go wrong with this one) and I hope you'll like it as much as I do.<br />Enjoy! :o)
B00003CXXP|4.0|I really enjoyed the relationship that was created by the AI ( David) and the mother. It showed me how we as humans can become attached to non human things. It is really unnerving to think this could happen. It showed the extent that a machine will go to when programed to feel love. The Blue Fairy looked alot like Mom. It had a really neat ending. Love can last forever. And he can be a real boy

B0000C9ZLD|2.0|Influential, groundbreaking!???? Give me a break!  This sounds exactly like bands from the 70s.  There's nothing new here, just like their first album. Almost every song sounds the same and the singer's voice is almost the same monotone sound throughout, hiding behind a voice effect.  One of few &quot;rock&quot; records that put me to sleep, it's only 30 minutes long yet it feels twice that much.  I don't understand the critical praise showered on this group at all. I'll stick with Interpol anyday.  At least each one of their songs sound different!
B00005AQF7|5.0|A very very good cd. It's very old but it's the 1st Snoop Doggy Dogg album!

Go listen to 1) Trout Mask Replica by Captain Beefheart  2) Metal Machine Music by Lou Reed  3) the first Korn CD  4) THEN listen to this first Slipknot disc.  You'll know what I mean.

Some people may love this kind of novel, but I don't.<br />It's not what I expected, but as far as straight mystery goes, it works.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|When I first listened to this soundtrack I felt as if I was whisked away to another time and place. When I closed my eyes I felt as if I was sailing the ocean in a gigantic ship rather than riding in the backseat of a car.  I like how each song flows into the next and conveys such emotion. There is a deep rooted story within each track.  I can't help but think of my favorite scenes in the movie when I listen to it, and I highly recommend it!  : )

0060934913|5.0|For anyone who has ever dipped their finger in and tasted the spices of the more-often-than-not-not-pleasant restaurant industry will find this book supremely satisfying.<br />  Bourdain presents a story that is similar to the shock of that first cold beer down the throat after a long, hard week; once you start guzzling, you can't stop. It is so refreshing to hear the raw, clear-cut, honesty that jumps out from each page. Bourdain has a natural talent for brute tell-it-like-it-is storytelling. I especially enjoyed the little bits of French titles, Spanish slang, and culinary jargon that were dropped and placed around each story with as much care as an expediter would decorate each precious platter.<br />  Of course there's all this hoopla and controversy that Bourdain has violated the `secret codes' of cooks in telling his experiences. I say \\"shaaadddup\\"! If anyone hit the nail on the head, it's this guy! I am impressed that Bourdain had the gusto and the intellect to actually sit down and recall even half of his drug-filled past. Kudos!! I think this book is a fine accompishment, and is an homage to any hard-working, slave-laboring, raw skinned, food-slinging fool who even attempts to make it in this dog-eat-dog world of food, let alone succeed. Good Work, Man! A toast to the guy who did it right, drinks are on him!!
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|Many songs on \\"Room on Fire\\" could have easily fit on \\"Is This It\\".  As a matter of fact, \\"Meet Me in the Bathroom\\" just missed the cut back in 2001.  This is not a bad album, but it lacks the maturity and variety of a great album.<br /> This album does have its high points. Reptilia, 12:51, and The End Has No End are my favorites.  <br /> Maybe something no different from their last album was the aim of the Strokes and producer Gordon Raphael.  After all, the first words heard on \\"Room on Fire\\" are, \\"I want to be forgotten\\".  And if no change is seen soon, forgotten they just may be.

It has changed my views on many different things in this world, and i've started to see things a little bit more like charlie.  This book lets you under the world of a highschool student going through changes and everything which your average adolescent does, the author gives you enough imformation about charlie to love the book, but leaves some distance which leaves gap for questions and mysteriousness.  Overall this was a great book, i couldn't put it down.  So simply, yet beautifully written, all my praises to this book, it is one of my favorites, and has really changed the way i see things.

Buble's truly &quot;American Idol&quot; material even though he's Canadian. Buy this cd and you too will be hooked!!!!

The 200,000-300,000 numbers being floated around by you and your compatriots ostensibly as pre-occupation numbers is some of the most uproarious poppycock I've seen in a long, long time.

B00005KHJM|4.0|This is always described as a classic horror movie. But really that's a misclassification, albeit one made natural by the presence in  the cast of horror specialists Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt. In fact it's not really a horror movie at all, more like an erotic mystery thriller. The ending certainly is horrific but you won't spend any time hiding behind the sofa waiting for something horrible to jump out of the shadows and nothing horrible ever does. <br />Edward Woodward is Sergeant Howie, a policeman in the Scottish Highlands who is sent to investigate the reported disappearance of a child on the fictitious Summer Isle. (In a nice wind-up, the opening credits thank the locals.) This leads to some trouble as Woodward is a stern, conservative and virginal presbyterian while the island, it turns out is an enclave of a rather improbable form of oversexed paganism. And the trouble is not lessened by the almost complete lack of cooperation of the islanders in the in vestigation. At first they deny that the missing girl ever existed and when this is exposed as deception they continue to appear nonchalantly unconcerned. the most interesting thing about the film is perhaps the way our attitude to Sergeant Howie changes as the film proceeds. At the start the Summer Isle seems rather a fun place, all singing and shagging, while Howie is just a dreadful stuffed shirt. However as the film unfolds and the darker aspects of the local religion become apparent and the hunter becomes the hunted, we grow far more disposed to sympathize and identify with him.<br />It's possible to hear quite absurdly inflated claims made about how good this film is. It is hardly a great masterpiece. In fact at many levels it is a pretty silly piece of nonsense. But it's fun well-crafted nonsense, highly idiosyncratic and intriguing with a unique atmosphere much enhanced by the clever and effective use of bawdy folksongs like &quot;Gently Jonny&quot; in a number of the most memorable scenes. And the notorious final scenes are genuinely sinister and disturbing.
B000084T18|1.0|i'm a punk rock fan myself and i respect rap as music i guess but this is not even rap.  this my friends is trash.  this man is a drugged out loser who thinks he's the greatest.  what the heck is a &quot;birf day&quot; or a &quot;showtee.&quot;  this guy couldn't sing or dance so he decided he'd talk into the microphone.  i dont undrestand how this loser sold any records and i urge you not to by them.
B00008NRL8|5.0|The name says it all - \\"Gotan\\" is a twist on \\"tango\\", the dance that's famed as \\"the vertical expression of a horizontal desire.  Gotan takes the distinctive sound of the Buenos Aires squeezebox or bandoneon, plus violin plus the basic \\"slooow, sloooow, quick-quick sloooow\\" pulse and the sultry attitude of the tango, overlays loping bass'n'drums'n'dub and filters the whole mix through a witty Parisian post-modern sensibility.<br />It's slinky, seductive and very addictive.<br />And provocative.  The opening track \\"Queremos paz\\" (We want peace) samples Che Guevara's 1964 address to the UN General Assembly and \\"El Capitalismo Foraneo\\" (Foreign Capitalism) echoes with the ghostly presence of Evita Peron.  There are cool reworks of Zappa's piece \\"Chunga's Revenge\\" and Gato Barbieri's theme for the movie \\"Last Tango in Paris\\".  <br />It's lounge, it's mellow, it's sexy and it has just the right edge of sweet Argentinean sadness.
B00009P1O2|4.0|Queen is one of the greatest bands ever...that said, much can be expected of them from their live shows, and this concert is no exception. Fans of Queen from the first 'half' of their illustrious career may not jive well with the band on this performance. Don't get me wrong, this is an AMAZING show, in front of 65000 screaming fans. However, Queen got a little too showy and a bit less concerned with the music itself. In the old days, there were just four guys on stage, Freddie handling quite adeptly all the piano parts. They rocked like the great rock band they were, with no breaks for air. Now...Freddie hardly plays at all, with the addition of stage musician Spike Edney. He dances and sways and sings wonderfully, but its all show. Then, the song selection...it's comprised mostly of Queen's lighter tunes from their post-Jazz second half: One Vision, World We Created, I Want To Break Free, Bite The Dust, Kind Of Magic, Under Pressure, Radio Gaga. These are great songs, but to me, don't compare to Don't Stop Me now, Spread Your Wings, Death On Two Legs, Somebody To Love, Brighton Rock (why do the solo without the song? Why?), Liar, Keep Yourself Alive, Dead On Time, Sheer Heart Attack, the list goes on and on. THESE are the songs that made Queen the great rock act they are. NOT Who Wants To Live Forever. Then, I can never understand why bands elect to do Blues Medleys when there's such an amazing library of wealthy songs to choose from. Ask anyone in that stadium that night, I'm sure they'd agree that they'd rather hear a few more QUEEN songs than Tutti Frutti and Hello Mary Lou. Again, this is a great show from a great band, but I'd rather have LIVE KILLERS any day of the week.<br />I hear that there will be other classic concert releases from QUEEN, including the wonderful Rainbow '74 show. This I'll be looking forward to.
B00005JM02|5.0|While you were thinking what new ideas could Pixar come up with after Toy Story and Monster Inc.? They put the answer right at your face. This time Pixar brought us into the marine world at the Barrier Reef where fishes struggle to survive and...well...have fun. Finding Nemo provides one of the most interesting and entertaining underwater experience to the audience after the spectacular success of the Little Mermaid years back. Technology has changed a lot since the Little Mermaid and what we have now are computer generated sea creatures that swim and talk like humans. The most interesting part of Finding Nemo was it managed to weave both human and \\"marine life\\" jokes together. The crown fish should be able to tell jokes is one of the very good examples. Also the Whale language is witty and amazingly funny. It is amazing the Pixar could put in so much charcter into beings that we don't think about much in life. The forgetful Dory, the Shark that wants to live a life with fishes as friends not food, fishes that want to break away from the acquarium etc. there are so much thoughts in the character building that you just feel like \\"hey they are so real\\". Lastly, since the movie has so much Australian reference and gags on the Aussies, it is even more fun to watch it in Sydney than in other parts of the world.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Is This It? is one my favorite albums ever made. It was a breath of fresh air and, whether or not people want to admit it, changed modern rock as we know it.  In a post 9/11 world, the whining and constant complaining of Staind and Linkin Park were replaced with songs about what great rock used to be: sex, drugs, and good old fashioned rock and roll.<br />Nobody ever said that The Strokes were the most musically talented band in the world, or that they have a style that is completely their own.  The comparisons to Velvet Underground came up the day The Modern Age EP was released.  Room On Fire does a great job of showing musical growth and further establishing an identity for The Strokes.  \\"Reptilia\\" is more musically complex than anything on Is This It?, \\"Under Control\\" is The Strokes first ballad, \\"12:51\\" is pure 80's bliss that will stick in your head for days, and \\"Automatic Stop\\" has an extremely simple but catchy bass line that steals the show.  <br />Lyrically, you will find more of the same from Julian Casablancas on Room On Fire which is why some have considered this album so similar to Is This It?.  But this doesn't mean that Jules is a bad songwriter.  Quite the contrary actually.  He tells the listener just enough to put them onto his train of thought, and then it's up to the listener to decide what he's really talking about.  And yes, to all the Strokes haters, his vocals are still blurred out.<br />Room on Fire is another classic from The Strokes. This is a band that knows the formula for what their fans want, and they stuck with it.  On their third album, I'd like to see them venture out and possibly go back to Nigel for production and see what a little Radiohead influence could do for them.  However this is the perfect follow-up to Is This It?:  Fans will love it, Strokes haters will be in full swing, and the Kings of Modern Rock are still sitting atop their throne.
B000094A6B|4.0|And that is due to a gently funny script and perfect casting.  Will Ferrell is ALWAYS funny (and even more self-deprecatingly so in the &quot;Inside the Actors' Studio&quot; spoof in the bonus features section), Vince Vaughn is simultaneously smarmy and engaging, and Luke Wilson is solid in the comedic/dramatic central role.<br />This movie wasn't as childishly raunchy as I was led to believe it was.  Rather, it is sweet in the appropriate spots, a tad rude without being vulgar, and boisterously funny without ever being mean-spirited.<br />This is a fun, lightweight comedy and worth at least a rental.
B00000JCOV|1.0|It is amazing that such garbage like this can be so popular; even more amazing that it takes seven people to produce this sound, even though you can only hear the words.  Yes, I call them words because that is all they are.  Just profantic words shouted in no sort of rythm and with no sort of pitch.  My lawn mower makes more music than this trash.  The only good thing I can say about this band is that... um.. I can't remember.  It must not have been anyting important.  Anyway, this album blows.  If you're into this sort of stuff, you have better stuff to spend your money on; like a session with your therapist.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I grew up with the Stones, The Faces, The Kinks, etc. I am also a big fan of the current 'garage band' scene The Strokes, White Stripes, etc. Unlike the current trend, Jet is not LoFi and it's to their credit. There is not a single bad cut on this disc. A great band with great songwriting sensibilities. If you lament the death of rock and roll, Jet will restore your faith.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie makes you feel wonderful inside.  It is the best movie I have ever seen.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is a wonderful highlight on the beggining of the body building empire that we are blessed with today. The movie showed how competition is everything and it is mind over matter or should I say \\"mass\\". Great movie
B000002H70|5.0|It's hard to come up with anything to say about DISINTEGRATION that hasn't been said hundreds of times before.  On this album the Cure take the dark mood of their &quot;goth&quot; period to a new level by expressing it in the context of pop music, resulting in a lush, emotional album that is as amazing for its accessability as its quality.  <br />The Cure are able to keep the listener's interest through the soundscapes alone, never mind the irresistable melodies and the best lyrics of Robert Smith's career.  The individual songs are stunning in their emotional impact, particularly &quot;Fascination Street&quot; and the jittery &quot;Lullaby,&quot; but the whole of DISINTEGRATION is much, much greater than the sum of its parts.  Listening to the songs out of context doesn't do this album justice; it begs to be heard in one sitting, with the volume turned way up (just like the liner notes tell you to do) to let the gloom wash over you. This is the best rainy day album in history, and I doubt it will ever be challenged.  <br />Recommended for all fans of any kind of music.
B000002H33|5.0|To tell you the truth, I do not really like Metallica- it's just not really my type of music.  However, i love this album; now that's really saying something.  8 tracks ranging from 5 to 9 minutes long make up this album.  The guitar parts are furocious and the lyrics will give you the chills.  The album opens with the mellow acoustic riffs of &quot;Battery.&quot; It slowly gains momentum, until all hell breaks loose with heavy distorted guitar and galloping drum beats.  My favorite songs are &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Disposable Heroes.&quot;  &quot;Welcome Home&quot; and &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; are both also excellent songs with beastly guitar solos.  &quot;Orion&quot; is an excellent intstrumental with strong guitar parts and a unique sound while Damage Inc. makes a deadly closer to the album, leaving you with the warm fuzzy feeling of having just lived through something.  Every guitar player should own this album for Kirk Hammett's solos as well as hard rock fans, because this album is right up there with &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; and &quot;Nevermind.&quot;
1565123875|5.0|I read this book in two sittings.  It is a well-crafted, beautiful, and smooth. Even when dealing with the abuse and fear aimed at the protagonist and her family, &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; gave me a sense of hope - hope for Kambili and hope for more African voices to emerge with tales of the lives of everyday African people (as opposed to the war and starvation images popularized in mainstream media).  My only comment is that I wish the book were longer.  Kudos to Adichie for a job well done!
B000002VTE|5.0|Spiritualized's third album, finally found them a new audience that had so far eluded them...(admittedly I myself experienced them via this album), and its almost certainly their most complete work. From the opening chorus \\"All I want in life, is a little love to take the pain away\\", you know your not in convention territory, moving between Melancholic Ambient pop (\\"Ladies &amp; Gentlemen we are floating in space\\"), Downtempo glowing melodic pop (\\"I think I'm in Love\\"), and bruising Noise-Pop (\\"Electricity\\"), all handled with a humility rarely seen in Alternative rock, in fact there a chance that it'll be a difficult listen first time around, but each listen reveals the album (many) hidden depths, and it's place in the all time great albums will become apparent.
B00005JM02|5.0|the pixar studios are just awesome and they only get better and better.  finding nemo is no exception.  this is a movie that is meant to be seen by a whole family.  it is as entertaining for adults as it is fo rchildren.  it is a movie about the relationships between parents and their children.  however i really believe that it shows how important it is that people should care about each other.  it is important to have a family so you know that there will be someone there that will look out for you and go to the ends of the earth for you.  it is just as important to have friends and friendships.  the fish dory is the perfect example because a friend can help you out of a tough situation, and also lend a helping hand because things are easier to deal with when you have someone to go through it with you.  this whole movie is about relationships.  also it shows so much about family.  it shows how parents are very protective of their children, and with good reason, but it also shows that parents need to give their children a little room also.  parents have to let their kids grow up and find things out on their own.  then on the other hand it tries to show kids that sometimes parents do know what they are talking about and that we should listen to them every once in a while, or at least think about what they are telling us.  this movie is fun, touching, and educational.  it says so much about family and the importance of relationships and i think everyone can learn or take something away from this movie.  definitely on of the years best, i cant wait to buy it.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|One of the most critically hailed garage rock bands of our time have recently caught a bit of heat from the people that once praised them, calling their sophomore album Room on Fire a clone of their debut Is This It. But here is my question, why is that a bad thing? Their debut album was very influential &amp; ground breaking and their follow-up album follows the same formula, yet with a more mature lyrical approach.<br />The infectious lead single &quot;12:51&quot; is still one of my favorites on the album. The melodic pop-rock track was right what the doctor ordered, because this album couldn't have come soon enough. &quot;What Ever Happened&quot; opens up the album and sets the tone for the great songs that follow, such as &quot;Under Control&quot;, &quot;Automatic Stop&quot;, &quot;You Talk Way Too Much&quot; &amp; &quot;Between Love &amp; Hate&quot;.<br />The Strokes sound so different from everything else on the radio right now, that their music deserves spins for that alone. They stepped outside the box and went in the complete opposite direction of what was popular at the time. They are one of my favorite bands on the scene right now and I'm very satisfied with the release of this album and the material on it. Pick this one up.
B00005RIKI|5.0|A Southern Man needs this kind of music.  I heard it back when they played for free at Georgia Tech in '72.  I saw them back up the Who's Quadrophenia Tour at the Omni in Atlanta - Skynyrd was a worthy successor to a generation of great rockers even when they took the stage first.  Their music had soul, the kind that you just don't hear on the radio these days.  If you want a taste of something similar and maybe a little bit rawer but just as good, check out the Drive-By Trucker's Decoration Day.  And I don't get anything for that referral except the pleasure of the music being spread around.  Long Live Skynyrd, they surely did create music that I still love to play to this day (and please, don't scream FreeBird at some half-crap band that doesn't hold a candle to these guys...even in fun it's disrespectful to these guys).
B00005RHGK|5.0|Although Victor Silva's first DVD which I saw, &quot;Powder&quot; had lots of suspense this movie is definitely in the horror genre. It's great in the use of shadows, lighting and music to keep ones suspense without too much actually gore. Just like the early Universal monsters, i.e. Frankenstein, Dracula... the director recaptures a better ear of horror complete with color and scared teens. A great film for high schoolers. I really liked the monster's appearance and superhuman abilities, especially the wings. The monster certainly has good taste too!<BR>Enjoy this DVD for suspense and don't miss the DVD 'Powder' either.<br />Jeepers to all,<br />AJ
B000005J56|5.0|Lets not beat around the bush regarding giving this album superlatives...this is one of the finest albums ever made. Sure!!...such comments are subjective, but the influence &amp; creative power of this album virtually single-handedly put Cuban music back on the music map, as far as the rest of the world is concerned...unquestionably authentic, grippingly expressive, unbelievably passionate and sung by a group of individuals, who with their singing careers long since firmly behind them, undoubtedly had no idea how enthusiastically the rest of the world would embrace their music...so much so, that this album revived the careers of the participants involved (Some of whom, hadn't produced music for over 30 years)...and one listen to the first track \\"Chan Chan\\" will confirm their heavyweight status...and quite possibly the only thing that could possibly detract from the overall magnificence of this album is the recent death of singer/bandleader \\"Compay Segundo\\", for what is a truly remarkable album.
B00005B36H|5.0|Well, probably not. I'd like to offer some personal experience instead. If you went to high school in 2001 and liked rock, Lateralus wasn't an album, it was an era.  If you were worth your salt in faithful devotion to Maynard James Keenan, Daney Carey, Adam Jones and Justin Chancellor you either skipped school on the release date to wait in line at Sam Goody or you went as soon as class got out. Tool had a strange amount of popularity build up between the release of Aenima and Lateralus. When Aenima came out they were big, but not huge. Over the five year wait their fan base grew and grew until we were all frothing at the mouth for the new record. Salival was a nice snack, but we needed a new record, like now!  I can remember listening to Lateralus for the first time and just being blown away. A seventy minute record, with most tracks clocking in at 7 to 10 minutes. All of them, fully developed masterworks from a band that had suddenly clicked. I was lucky enough to score good seats for Tool's mini tour with King Crimson in the summer of 2001. It was my second concert ever and one of those evenings I will always remember. Tool came on with &quot;The Grudge.&quot;  Everyone roared with approval at anything Maynard said, even if it was an insult directed at them. The air, of course, was thick with a sweet smoke I wasn't yet familiar with. They played for a good hour and a half and at the conclusion of the show, gathered around Danny's drum kit and launched into the opening notes of &quot;Lateralus.&quot; My copy of this record is pretty much destroyed. Alex Grey's incredible booklet of artwork has long since been torn apart, and I've only had it for, what, over two years now! These days, I prefer Tool the raw rock n' roll band of Opiate and Undertow to Tool, the new Pink Floyd. I now wish I had been able to see them in the days of Maynard's mowhawk. Those were the days when they weren't afraid to be offensive and angry. But this album will always be a sacred one for me. It is Tool's most blatantly perfect album, the one people will single out to future generations of rock n' roll kids as THE record to get. Its also the most mature and developed, whatever that means. Enjoy it, but do be sure and check out the back catalogue as well.
B00008J4P5|3.0|I believe 'Elephant' is an appropriate title for the most recent release from this duo, as the album's namesake is often noted for visiting the graves of its ancestors. Jack and Meg have proved that yes, they can write commercially viable bluesy rock songs, and yes, they can put up a good rock hero front, but having evolved little since their debut, the old 'Rolling Stones meets Foghat in a punk dive' bit strikes me as redundant. I'll agree that 'Seven Nation Army' is immediately catchy and danceable, 'The Hardest Button to Button,' contains enough rock attitude satisfy the hardened indie critic's need for style, but ultimately these old school formulaic rock songs are starting to prove their insincerity. On a final note, I'd much rather have the most recent batch of young MTV viewers exposed the White Stripes than to any of the milquetoast diva/pop/rap/R&amp;B/shake-your-booty soul groove garbage currently in broadcast.
1565123875|5.0|I lived in Nigeria for 11 years and I think Chima has really captured life in that part of the world. I think this is a wonderful story. It's sad, funny and real all at the same time. Definitely an enjoyable read.
B00005R87K|1.0|Amazon is doing its customers a great disservice by mixing the reviews with this version of Nosferatu with those of the superior version.  DO NOT buy the one with the tinted green picture of Nosferatu coming out of a coffin with the bloody pink font.  This has horribly incorrect title cards, Count Orlock is referred to as Dracula and there appears to be missing scenes.  Just a big waste of money.  Don't get the cheapo version!
B000003S5H|5.0|Is there anyone left, that isn't familiar with the French duo's seminal album??....if you aren't, then there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't seek this out immediately!! (unless you dislike Electronica), because you'll be hard pressed to find a more moving and beautifully constructed electronic album. \\"All I need\\" &amp; \\"You make it Easy\\" inject real warmth into synthesized music, and are as emotional as any real instrumental track you care to mention....\\"La Femme D'Argent\\" is downtempo music the way `Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister' would tackle the project....and the \\"Ce matin La\\" is a glowing trumpet inspired track that predates `Zero 7's' work by 3 years....'Air' made this album (with the exception of 1999 \\"Premiers Symptomes\\") their definitive statement and every subsequent album would only serve to diluted the experience, but this still remains a truly lovely, lovely record, and essential for anyone that's a fan of ambient electronica.
B00005JKG7|3.0|this movie totally sucks.<br />i bought it , turned off the lights, pumped up the volume, and then I realized I just threw away 20+ dollars to buy this.<br />the only part worth watchin is when the old lady gets a pencil in the eye.<br />so other than that good laugh, it sucks.
0156027321|5.0|I found this book to be a very entertaining read. I did think it was odd that the boy's views on religion were more enlightened than many scholars. The story of his survival at sea was captivating. I particularly enjoyed the ending to the story which left the reader scratching his or her head and wondering what the real story was after all.
B000003S0D|1.0|Now I really love and respect King Crimson, and I consider them the best and purest progressive rock band of all time - ahead of my sentimental favorite, Yes, and Genesis, who might have been the greatest if they hadn't jumped the shark by becoming an extension of Phil Collins' solo career.  And despite the sonic excellence of Adrian Belew-era Crimson  (1981-present), I much prefer the various 1969-1974 incarnations.  During this era, Crimson basically invented progressive rock with their first album, re-invented it with \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic,\\" and perfected it with \\"Red.\\"<br />Against this stellar body of work, \\"Lizard\\" sticks out like a sore thumb.  Every year or so, I pull it out of my collection to give it another chance.  And for a brief moment, when the ominous Mellotron of \\"Cirkus\\" kicks in, I think I'm about to be proven wrong.  But the rest of \\"Lizard\\" is darn near unlistenable, hampered by subpar production values, Gordon Haskell's tentative and unfocused singing, and undisciplined, chaotic instrumentation. Haskell's ridiculous laugh at the end of \\"Indoor Games\\" must qualify as the most embarrassing moment in Crimson's history.  The instrumentals are meandering and often just plain noisy, with none of the improvisational prowess that marks the Bruford/Wetton era.  Even a guest vocal by Jon Anderson is wasted.  If Robert Fripp's intent was to produce music that sounds like it emanated from hell, he succeeded all too well.<br />Fripp himself dismisses \\"Lizard\\" in current interviews.  Take his word for it.  Unless you're a Crimson completist or a masochist, pass on this one.  Your ears will thank you!
B000002MG1|5.0|If \\"Out of Time\\" is considered R.E.M.'s `Light' album (a mostly Positive album, with a precious, cheerily &amp; decidedly upbeat song structure), then this surely must be considered their `Dark' album.....a intimate, gloomy, troubled masterpiece of an album. \\"Drive / Try Not To Breathe / The Sidewinder sleeps tonight\\" are 3 fantastic songs one after another, but it when singer/frontman \\"Michael Stipe\\" opens with \\"Everybody Hurts\\", that it's clear that R.E.M. influenced &amp; inspired a generation with a song of such introspective beauty, that for a song of anguish &amp; despair, manages to underneath &amp; throw up feelings of comfort &amp; salvation in its poignancy. But not every song here is a emotionally distraught record....\\"Man on the Moon\\" shows how upbeat songs on their albums still work remarkably well with the decidedly melancholic nature of this album. But its important for me to remind people of the shimmeringly beautiful \\"New Orleans Instrumental No. 1\\", that fleshes out an album (along with \\"Out of Time\\") as truly indispensable album marking a prolific career.
0375823360|5.0|I was given Northern Lights when I was eleven or so, during a half term, to keep me entertained. And I was instantly enchanted! The writing was of the highest quality, the plot was captivating and neatly done, and the characters were real, three-dimensional, and believable.<BR>  Five years later, having read all the books, all I can say is that the following two are equal to, if not surpassing, the first. The development of the plot is carefully done, elegant, compulsive, and a sheer good read. My mother preordered The Amber Spyglass for me (she adores the books as well) and I devoured it in a day or so. The ending was so sad, but so right! it couldn't have been been other way without losing some of the excellence of the trilogy. I actually cried - I'll admit it! <BR>  Philip Pullman is an astounding writer, and I make him my compliments. Every aspect of the book is perfect, fascinating, and all the way it is eminently readable and pleasing: so many good books lose themselves in detail, or plot twists. Philip Pullman does not: he does everything with clarity and emotion.<BR>  Curiously enough, I'm not particularly fond of his other books: for me, His Dark Materials stand out as a supreme masterpiece. I love them, I admire them, I learn from them, and they inspire me, quite frankly. I reread them often, and they never lose their charm, their wisdom, and their ability to delight. <BR>  If anyone is thinking about buying these books, my advice is quite simply: do so. You will not regret the purchase. His Dark Materials, while containing content a maturer mind will appreciate, is also a cracking good read for any age.<BR>  Bravo, Philip Pullman!
0316666343|4.0|The book was captivating and entertaining, even hard to put down. I enjoyed the bittersweet ending, although the final resolution of the plot line with the killer was a bit unfulfilling. Even that kept the realism of the story - everything in life does not wrap up with a neat little bow. My one issue lies in the fact that the story was more of a stream of consciousness rather than a story, and after thinking long and hard, I was left with a bit of a hollow feeling that there was not a lesson to be taken away. I still give high marks to the author for an incredibly well-written story.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|Animation done to music is nothing new, but \\"Interstella 5555\\" does a great job of breathing new life into this tradition.  Essentially an hour-long music video animated to Daft Punk's album \\"Discovery\\", it tells a good story about kidnapping, theft, rescue, love, and adventure across space. Music being the central theme, the highly stylized anime (brought to life by the legendary Leiji Matsumoto of \\"Harlock\\", \\"Space Cruiser Yamato\\", and \\"Queen Emeraldas\\" fame) and music mix makes this a fun way to spend an hour.  Epic almost on the scale of Chage and Aska's Studio Ghibli animated video \\"On Your Mark\\", \\"Interstella\\" is something relatively new, something fresh in both anime and music circles.  Hopefully the success of this DVD will inspire a new generation of stylish and fun music videos.  While the album itself has its high and low points, and the movie lacks any major dialogue, mixed together these minor flaws really don't matter.  I would recommend this video for any anime fan or music video enthusiast.  Enjoy!
B00004Z459|5.0|The Formula is simple....take surging rowdy bruising guitar arrangements, add a dash of energetic rapping (courtesy of rapper \\"Mike Shinoda\\"), and pen all of the lyrics and big choruses by lead singer \\"Chester Bennington\\", with a decidedly introspective / Alienated manifesto. Serve in 3 minute chunks, and you have the biggest selling (&amp; most widely recognised) Nu-Metal album ever created, Sure!!..everyone will mostly mention the incredibly powerful tracks such as \\"One Step Closer/ Crawling / By Myself, &amp; Points of Authority are the best tracks...(and they'd be right), but most forget to mention the utterly sublime metal /Industrial insturmental \\"Cure For the Itch\\" that is easily as noteworthy as any of the aforementioned tracks....Needless to say, this album made \\"Q magazine's\\" 100 greatest albums of all time.

B00004U8P9|5.0|Ah, yes! How can I possibly forget to provide a Halloween review for one of the greatest cult films of all time? What can I say about \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" that hasn't been said already? I can best describe this as a spooktacular musical extravanganza! A monstrous creation brought to life by genius Richard O'Brian, this movie is a decadent amalgamation of sex, science fiction, and horror. Don't worry about the R-rating, kiddies; \\"Rocky Horror\\" is one of the few provacative pictures that doesn't stretch across the borders of bad taste.  And of course, the film has become even more incredible thanks to its infamous audience participation. Despite having debuted in theaters way back in 1975, \\"Rocky Horror's\\" infectious songs and fashion trends never get old!<BR>Here's a brief synopsis for all you virgins: Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon play Brad and Janet, a pair of wholesome lovers who planned to announce their engagement to their former science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott (Johnathan Adams). But on a dark stormy night, after suffering a flat tire, Brad and Janet enter a castle owned by the film's star, Dr. Frankenfurter (Tim Curry), a delighfully evil scientist/ transvestite from the planet Transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania! Put on your makeup and fishnet stockings! Let's do the Time Warp (again) with creepy handyman Riff Raff (Richard O'Brian), sultry maid Magenta (Patricia Quinn), and rock & roll groupie Columbia (Nell Campbell). Even Meatloaf gets his own rock solo as the Doctor's motorcycling zombie Eddie (a rebel who ends up getting served for dinner!) Let's not forget also that \\"Rocky Horror's\\" unforgettable soundtrack and hilarious dialogue are all narrated by the dignified Criminologist (Charles Gray-RIP). This cult film is a must-have for all horror and musical lovers alike! Enter at your risk!
B000005RT8|4.0|After Wings great ending album &quot;back to the egg&quot; which featured most of 70-ties rock stars as guests (Bonham,Gilmour,Thowsend) Paul loced himself in Home-studio with some instruments and his wife linda and recorded &quot;McCartney II&quot; - a follow up to his homemade low-budget debut.While &quot;McCartney&quot; from 1970 was very spontanic and amateurish,this follow up is full-proffesional work.it raised top ten on Uk lists and some of songs from here became a real classics - althogh whole album is....strange!<br />1.COMING UP - very catchy disco-funk songs which became huge hit and still joines the tracklist on many of his live performances.Funky Guitar,nice synths and Linda on backing vocals.a bit wierd but really catchy and interesting 10/10<br />2.TEMPORARY SECRETARY - Wierd,Annoying,strange...whole song is based on Kraftwerk styled electronic instruments.it is a parody of New-wave bands and it works well along with funny lyrics and strange vocal line on chorus... 8/10<br />3.ON THE WAY - blues - Garry Moore styled song...only Paul's vocals bass and drums - some nice guitar are coming between verses and chorus.not awesome but nice 7/10<br />4. WATERFALLS - lovely and warm ballad - just Paul with piano and guitar.one of the most moving things i have ever heard...propably the best track 10/10<br />5.NOBODY KNOWS - Country rock? i do not know really what it is but it is a music joke...funny and catchy.not bad.7/10<br />6.FRONT PARLOUR - Another joke...Music like from very first computer games,funny samples in background.....could be much shorter because it is funy but later it gets boring while the easy melody gets played on and on 6/10<br />7.SUMMERS DAY SONG - Slow ballad with short vocal line...it is dark but has some christmas feeling and the keyboard sounds really massive.a good song 8/10<br />8.FROZEN JAP - Awesome Drumming - the melody is sweet but there is something more in it...propably a reminescence of Paul's visit in Jappaneese jail when hewas caught with Marihuana on airport.a very good instrumental track - one of my favourite from here. 10/10<br />9.BOGEY MUSIC - Elvis presley meets the Residents.Wierd Rock nd Roll song with creepy echoed vocals and awesome bass line...some horns are here too.another joke but works the best compared to other Joke songs.amusing 10/10<br />10.DARKROOM - dark hypnotic Drum and bass track with mantra-like vocal line.interesting experiment 9/10<br />11.ONE OF THESE DAYS - lovely ballad,just paul sitting along with his guitar.brilliant example that real power lies in simplicity.melodic but nostalgic - result is fantastic 10/10<br />12.CHECK MY MACHINE - a lots of samples and funky background.another experiment,not as good as others but nice too. 6/10<br />13. SECRET FRIEND - a 10 minutes long trance ambient track.now i know where Stereolab or Orbital got their ideas from. 8/10<br />14.GOODNIGHT TONIGHT - awesome disco track recorded shortly before The wings split up - hats off to Paul for his another marvelous bass line and a lot of nice acoustic guitar...<BR>catchy,very catchy.it was a huge hit. 10/10<br />In the end - the whole album is uneven but surely it is very interesting for all that know Paul only from Beatles or from his solo hits...very good job paul - and many songs sound fresh even now!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This is quickly becoming my favorite album. I bought it the day before he died, and it is so haunting everytime I listen. His love, his sadness, his lament, is all there and bruisingly honest. I could only hope that I will have something like this album, something so hypnotic and beautiful, to be remembered as my last words. Buy it. Listen to it loud and alone at least once. It's like Johnny is right next to you. You could hand him a tissue, offer him some coffee, or pass a bottle around. Every song is perfect. Rest in peace, John.

B00001U0DP|5.0|The unique nature of Holocaust has left our world out of balance! Thus, a film that attempts to bring it back may seem overly ambitious. &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; manages to maintain a balance throughout its duration--a balance between grief and joy, between the seriousness of pervasive death and the jocular island of innocence (where Guido's son lives), between desolation and hope... between so many other similarly contradictory juxtapositions. As for the balance this film brings in (your) life you be the judge!<br />Roberto Benigni, as Guido, is at the top of his form and, at times, one has the feeling that he becomes the movie itself. The supporting roles (Nicoletta Braschi and Giorgio Cantarini) are nothing less than great. A FIRST, and hopefully not singular, in what may well be a new genre.
B000089RVX|5.0|I think that Evanescence is the best new rock group out there on the market right now. Their music is what keeps me going all day. I live for their music. If I didn't listen to their CD at least once a day, I would be going crazy right now. I don't know how people can judge their music with just seeing their picture. I know that if I saw their CD last year, I wouldn't of bought it from the cover, but I bought it anyway and I listened to it and I couldn't stop listening to it. It is the best CD ever. You don't have to be &quot;gothic&quot; to listen to their music and understand it, you have to give it a chance and &quot;look between the lines&quot; or so you say. I love the Evanescence CD Fallen. Just give the CD a chance, and I can gurantee you will like it!
0553277472|2.0|Even though this book rambles at times and is often confusing and dull, it still brings up some intriguing points.  I found the discussion of Quality to be interesting at times, but it eventually got repetitive.  I also thought that Pirsig's discussion of so many different philosophies was insightful and thought provoking.  This book even made me analyze my own life at times.<br />Nevertheless, in terms of enjoyment, this book definitely falls short.  About half way through, Pirsig's thoughts get so in-depth and specific that they are almost impossible to follow.  This amount of detail almost forces the reader to lose interest very quickly.  In addition, practically the entire book is a discussion of Quality, theories, and philosophies.  This leads to almost no plot whatsoever.  The lack of physical events actually occurring in this book failed to grab my attention.<br />Overall, I thought this book had some good points and a good message, but these points were to few and to spread out to make up for the rest of the books flaws.
B0000C8AW5|4.0|Usually a label's remastering project is an attempt to get fans to shell out the bucks one more time, but Columbia's new Dylan cds are a different proposition. In particular, &quot;Planet Waves&quot; is like a whole new album. I never realized how warm and relaxed Dylan's vocals are, how tight The Band locks in behind him, how perfect Richard Manuel's and Garth Hudson's piano and organ accompaniment are. This remastered version is light years better than the original, and the songs aren't too shabby either. The whole gambit of moods is explored here, from the urgent rock of &quot;Tough Mama&quot; through the tender prayer of &quot;Forever Young&quot; to the aching confusion of &quot;Wedding Song&quot;. At the time he recorded this, Dylan was a man in conflict between his love of settled family life and his desire to hit the road again, and this album captures his dilemma perfectly. &quot;Planet Waves&quot; could be his most underrated album.
B000002UDD|2.0|So Far So Good So What is my least Favorite Megadeth Album.  My first problem I have with the album, is the poor mixing.  The guitars seem to have way too much reverb,  no matter what I do I can never listen to this album very loud because the sound seems to shred my eardrums to pieces.  The next problem is the lack of good songs.  The instrumental into the Lungs of Hell doesn't have anywhere near strong enough riffs to support it without vocals and lyrics.  This song gets repititious,  and borderlines on being bad music or just noise.  Set the World Afire doesn't get much better.  The structure of this song is horrible,  none of the riffs ever seem to catch my attention.  Anarchy in the U.K. is better than its original version, but that is not saying much.  I always consider this song a filler, and have only been able to listen to it about 2 times in my entire life.  The 4th Track, Mary Jane, finally starts to pick the album up a little bit with a good opening, but the songs main riffs seem to be just a bunch of old recycled material.  Mary Jane does do a good job of ending with some pretty decent riffs.  502 is about as bad as Into the Lungs of Hell and Set the World Afire.  My Darkest Hour is the only song that make this album worth buying, and is probably one of Megadeth's best songs.  Liar starts off annoying, but actually turns out to be one of the best songs on the album.  Hook in Mouth is nothing spectacular, but is a well rounded song, and finishes a bad album off nicely.  The lead work on this album is by far Megadeth's worst.  The best thing about the album is probably Dave's vocals.  Even though he does sound tired some of the time, his voice offers a lot of emotion and fits all the songs very well.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I only know about Sigur ros from other amazon reviewers going completely crazy about this band from iceland. i've seen this album in countless listmania lists and on its own page, there are more than 200 reviews! gee what have i been missing here??? plus one of the reviewers mentioned that the booklet had only blank pages with NOTHING printed on them! i'm a designer so this intrigued me even more and when i saw the album at a local music store i literally jumped at it. now i'm expecting a lot from this band because i rarely buy something without any previous knowledge or hearing.<br />after repeated listens (i listened to it for 5 times in one day and now it's been a week that i've been listening to it) i can say i'm so glad to have this album in my collection; right from the first track (all 8 cuts are untitled and have a total running time of 72 minutes), the sad and mellow tune freezes you to wherever you are. i personally closed my eyes  and didnt make a move, not wanting to spoil this moment, totally forgetting that this is a cd that i could replay for  as much as i wanted ! i'm glad noone witnessed my dumb trance when i listened to this. vocals are dreamy and blurry and i could hardly comprehend what the singer was saying; his voice seemed more like an instrument complementing the coherent whole of all other instruments. pianos produce simple minimalistic harmonies repeated and enhanced by keyboards that first are bearly heard but which gradually build up into walls of soaring majesty, magnificently blending with the pianos. the most amazing example of what i'm talking about is track 3 (my favorite); a recurring piano tune, so gripping that you never want to hear it end. i think these guys just showed us the meaning of the word &quot;cohesive&quot;. every remaining track goes on to unfurl into an 8-9 minute long mini-symphony that is simply delightful.<br />this is not a happy album; some reviewers spoke of 'hope' .<br />i could mostly sense the melancholy and sadness but only glimpses of hope, shimmering here and there, mostly through added background vocals.<br />the last 2 tracks show a more proggish approach than in the beginning of the album where minimalism is most stricking and guitars were far less present; these last tracks remind me briefly of old pink floyd epics like &quot;shine on you crazy diamond&quot; or early marillion; i still havent decided if there is a weak track on this album because frankly they all seem to range from 'good' to 'jaw dropping' and i'm going to look for 'agaethis byrjun' which also seems to be another gem by these very talented artists. you owe it to yourself to check out this album if you're into plain, meaningful music you can feel in your inmost depths.ess but only glimpses of hope, shimmering here and there, mostly through added background vocals.<BR>the last 2 tracks show a more proggish approach than in the beginning of the album where minimalism is most stricking and guitars were far less present; these last tracks remind me briefly of old pink floyd epics like &quot;shine on you crazy diamond&quot; or early marillion; i still havent decided if there is a weak track on this album because frankly they all seem to range from 'good' to 'jaw dropping' and i'm going to look for 'agaethis byrjun' which also seems to be another gem by these very talented artists. you owe it to yourself to check out this album if you're into plain, meaningful music you can feel in your inmost depths.
B00001QEE6|5.0|The definitive Disney classic, and the benchmark by which the success or failure of others should be measured.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Well, I have just viewed my STAR TREK V:  THE FINAL FRONTIER DVD, along with its special features!  The movie is still a rather poorly crafted entry in the popular series compared to the other entries, but I still enjoy certain parts of it.  Though mired by pitiful attempts at comedy, extremely bad special effects, and uneven story telling, the film still manages to succeed on other levels.  The performances here are very good, not only from the regular returning crewmates, but from supporting cast members as well.  Lawrence Luckinbill, who plays renegade Vulcan Sybok (a role originally offered to Sean Connery), gives a very inspired performance that carries the film quite well.  No film explores the inner circle friendship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy any better or any deeper than this one does.  The only time our beloved crew members seem to fall flat is when they are placed in uncomfortable comedic situations (sprinkled throughout the story) that should never have made their way into the film.  This installment is a truly a hit and miss affair to be sure!   <br />The best part of the film is the entire sequence set in the ships forward observation deck where Sybok reveals McCoy's and Spock's pain. DeForest Kelley gives such a fine performance here, as do the others. If only the rest of the film could have been on this level of maturity and quality! The sequence probably is more successful due to being carried by the experienced performers as opposed to any other element. That and its actual lack of any humorous elements what-so-ever! To me, this section of the film is better than anything STAR TREK:  INSURRECTION has to offer.  William Shatner elaborates himself in the commentary that he would have liked for the film to have maintained these types of themes throughout.  Interestingly enough, DeForest Kelley first objected to the scene due to a dispute over his character's motivations!<br />Speaking of the commentary, it was a good one overall with the slight exception of a few stretches of silence. I can honestly say that Bill Shatner was quite candid about his experience and what he wanted to make versus what he was allowed to make. The studio truly shares in the problems of this film. Their interference robbed Shatner of what could have been some pretty nice material. Their relentless schedule, lack of time for filming, and restricted budget also limited what was being done. This probably could have been waded through by an experienced director with better results, but if Paramount was not willing to trust Shatner, they shouldn't have given him the job from the get go. Overall, he did not come across as shifting blame in any way, but just simply telling stories of what the filming was like.  <br />The deleted scenes were interesting, but nothing to write home about. <br />&quot;MOUNT RUSHMORE&quot; simply shows Sulu and Chekov bantering about whether this was the right choice of vacation as the camera pans up to reveal an unfinished matte painting of the infamous mountain with an additional sculpture of an African-American woman added to George Washington's right. <BR>&quot;INSULTS&quot; was more entertaining than I thought it would be, detailing Romulan representative Caitlin Dar's enthusiasm over volunteering to work on Nimbus III, as Korrd insults her in Klingon. <BR>&quot;BEHOLD PARADISE&quot; simply shows Sybok and his horde of merry men approaching Paradise City on foot. Sybok simply states &quot;Behold...Paradise&quot; and the camera pans down to empty desert with a horse running around in it to show where the special effect of the city would later be added. <BR>&quot;SPOCK'S PAIN&quot; picks up at the end of his birth, where he tells Sybok that he failed because the issue has been resolved. Then you hear Sybok speaking to Spock in desperation from the past about his exile from Vulcan, and Spock expressing his desire to go with him. Spock asks where he will go and Sybok tells him that he will begin his search forSha Ka Ree. This sequence is done with Lawrence Luckinbill and Leonard Nimoy reliving the past as opposed to an actual flashback. <br />The ROCKMAN IN THE RAW footage was very interesting and worth the wait. Text explains that the budget would not allow for ten creatures, so the story was altered for just one creature. It shows the creation of the suit and some test footage on a red lit, rocky set. The suit is actually very neat looking, with glowing red eyes and an animatronic face. I think they did a wonderful job on it, you just can't get past the fact that it is slow and cumbersome, and would make an exceptional villain for Godzilla! It simply wasn't enough to present an adequate threat to Kirk and crew in the film. Still, I was much more impressed with the effort than I ever thought I would be! <br />I really love the menus on these DVDs!  Once again we are treated to nifty CGI recreations of key events from the film, which in this case looks better than anything the effects team of the actual film were able to muster!  There are storyboard sections that show the original ideas for the whole Sha Ka Ree sequence of the film, from leaving the Enterprise to Kirk's rescue by the Klingons. The film really could have benefited from having been redone like STAR TREK:  THE MOTION PICTURE was, with some new effects following these old storyboards.  Can you say \\"missed opportunity\\"?  Naturally, I will be skipping the waste-of-time documentaries altogether, such as &quot;Cosmic Thoughts&quot; and &quot;A Green Future&quot; (I never watch that garbage on these discs, leaving me to wonder why Paramount goes through the trouble of including them???).<br />Overall I rated this DVD set three stars.  That breaks down into two stars for the film itself and four stars for the Special Edition DVD that Paramount Home Video has been good enough to put together!
B000062YAZ|2.0|Over the years I have been able to listen to a good number of Slayer songs here and there.  A lot of songs from Show No Mercy and Seasons in the Abyss I thought were pretty good.  After reading on just about every heavy metal page that Reign in Blood was one of the best heavy metal albums ever, I thought that I would go ahead and try it out.  Let me start off by saying that Reign in Blood does contain some pretty good rythm riffs, but other than that I don't see what all the hype is about.  First off,  the vocals suck.  Never thought that the lead singer for Slayer was that great, but on this album he really sucks.  2nd, the Lead guitar work sucks, nothing but random spurts of noise.  Not one of the solos seemed to have any soul put into it at all.  3rd the lyrics are way too korny and childish.  I will admit that several of the main riffs caught my attention,  but after the last song was over I was glad the album was only about 30 minutes long.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|Frankly, I'm amazed that when this CD was released in 1999 that Jennifer Lopez escaped much of the ire bestowed on contemporaries Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.  Although all the songs released as singles on this CD are great, the rest are bland, watered-down love songs.  With lyrics like &quot;I saw you and fell in love/You saw me and fell in love too/You and me, we fell in love/With eachother last night&quot; on &quot;Talk About Us,&quot; this is as cheesy as anything any teen pop star has ever done.  Not to mention that Lopez is listed as one of the writing contributors on only four of the fourteen songs.  In 1999 it was interesting that boy bands and pop singers were heavily criticized for not writing their own songs or playing their own instruments, and of &quot;brainwashing&quot; their fans with their images, while Lopez escaped unscathed and was seen as a more &quot;legitimate&quot; artist, due more to her own adult, urban image than the talent she displays on this CD.<br />I think Lopez has a nice singing voice, but the songs the public is probably already familar with--&quot;If You Had My Love&quot;, &quot;Feelin' So Good&quot;, &quot;Let's Get Loud&quot;, &quot;No Me Ames&quot; and &quot;Waiting For Tonight&quot;--are the only reasons to listen to this CD.  The rest are unremarkable and could pass as elevator music.  A much better bet is her second CD, &quot;J.Lo&quot;, which has more flair and punch and is more fun to listen to, with consistently catchy songs between the singles rather than just filler.
B00006RU5B|4.0|It was a no-brainer to purchase this album before even hearing Cochise on the radio. Chris Cornell, one of the best vocalists to ever try their hand at music, teaming up with the bombastic rhythm section of Rage Against The Machine may have spelled disaster (ie; Chris Cornell rapping) but more than likely would become a monster that would be the new Goliath in rock music. Bombastic rock group, minus the rapping - check.<br />I must have heard Cochise on the radio about 100 times a day before the album's release last November and with good reason. The first single off of the would be self-titled debut of Audioslave was a Zeppelin-esque track that reeked of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; but in any era, no one could deny that it caught their attention immediately. &quot;Cochise&quot; locked into a groove assertively and let the whole world know what they were getting and the people responded in accord.<br />&quot;Cochise&quot; was a stellar lead-off single and introduced the world to their new favorite band. Continuing on with &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot;, Audioslave laid the foundation of their Rage Against The Zeppelin rhythm section while Chris Cornell reminded us of brighter days when Soundgarden was in full swing. The brightest moments on this album shine like the sun at high noon. &quot;Gasoline&quot;, &quot;I Am The Highway&quot;, &quot;Exploder&quot; and &quot;Light My Way&quot; mark the most memorable moments on this recording and; alone, make for a noteworthy listen.<br />The main problem with the remainder of the album is that the majority of it sounds too much like Rage. I could never help but be impressed by Rage's top-notch guitar and bass work but other than the volume, the drums lack any real punch or flair. There just isn't a whole lot going on behind the kit to keep you attentive, leaving the bass and guitar to carry the music more than it should have to. Granted, once you see Audioslave live, you give the entire album another chance and really try to like everything you were not-so-hot on before but even though you find more to like, it's not enough to make it a classic.<br />Don't get me wrong, I love Audioslave. The good news is that they have a got a LONG way to go yet and their best is way ahead of them. This debut was basically them feeling each other out without the contraints of a hip hop overtone and the as the comfort level sets in, Audioslave has more than a few surprises in store for their fans. One thing is for sure though - it takes most bands three or four albums to make one as good as this debut is and that says alot.y to like everything you were not-so-hot on before but even though you find more to like, it's not enough to make it a classic.<br />Don't get me wrong, I love Audioslave.

B00008DDXC|1.0|Harry Potter is basically just garbage.  Sure the fantastical plot and personable characters will help drag you helplessly into the movie, but it's all for naught.  The movie with it's witchcraft and sorcery only lures younger people into more dangerous supernatural things.  I only give fair warning to anyone that intends their kids to watch this.  I've seen kids where I live go from Harry Potter to trying to cast spells on people, and then some start learning about seances and try to connect with the dead, etc.  It's just a fork in the road.  &quot;At least my little Timmy/Sally is reading books now thanks to Harry Potter, and watching tasteful movies!&quot; you might say.  Well sure, but then see if you regret it when you have a supernatural conjuror trying to cast spells on family and holding seances with his/her friends.  If you're mad at me for pummelling Harry Potter in my review, sobeit, I just go by what I see and what I witness.  Just find something more educational for your children, not just choosing the only thing that that they'll watch willingly.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The release of The Two Towers followed the Fellowship in about a yeat later.  The cast for the most part is the same with Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and Liv Tyler as Arwen and etc.  In the first movie, Frodo Baggins a Hobbit is met by Gandalf who urges Frodo on the quest to destroy the one Ring that has fallen in his possesion.  His quest is aided by a Fellowship with his gardener Sam, other fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin, Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn, Legolas (played by Orlando Bloom who seems popular among the ladies), and Glimli the dwarf.  Towards the end of their quest Saruman's troops of Urak-Hai warriors kidnap Merry and Pippin.  The fellowship splits as Sam and Frodo continue the quest to Mount Doom as Aragorn, Legolas, and Glimli continue to rescue Merry and Pippin.<br />The movie is pretty much split in two parts: one on the quest of Frodo, and one about Glimli, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gandalf.  The second quest begins with Aragorn, Legolas, and Glimli following the Urak-Hai to rescue Merry and Pippin.  They find the Urak-Hai killed by humans and Merry and Pippin escape into forbidden woods.  The three follow inside, and the trees promise to take care of the two hobbits.  Meanwhile  Aragorn, Glimli, and Legolas find Gandalf alive and well (now called Gandalf the White) as he supposedly died in the first movie.  The four evacuate the town of Rohan and move to the refuge in Helm's Deep where they must defend from the huge army of 10,000 Urak Hai, Saruman's troops, which seem impossible.<br />Meanwhile Frodo's quest is going astray as they utilize the help of Gollumn, a strange being, who is very mysterious.  They are captured by an army of humans and only after Boromir's brother sees what a burden the ring is, does he release Frodo, Sam, and Gollumn.  The ring seems to be slowly controlling Frodo, and his will is slowly slipping away.  These troubles begin to mount as the fate of Middle Earth is truly shaky.<br />The movie is long, but has exciting action sequences especially the climax, the Battle Of Helm's Deep.  The acting is decent, though the battles take a long chunk of the movie.  Watching it is fun, as you get sucked into the world of Middle Earth and the quests of the heroes.  Peter Jackson is a supberb director and The Two Towers is an awesome movie.  The effects and sounds are amazing, and the detail is meticulous.  A great movie altogether and a fitting sequal.
0553573403|5.0|I've read and/or listened to this book no less than 1/2 a dozen times. The first time I read it, it took me a while to complete. Martin has a different \\"cadence\\" to his writing, and I seemed to read very slowly at first. Don't get me wrong, I liked it from the start, but it took me a while to fall in \\"love\\" with the story. This story is huge. Epic in every sense except the obvious for fantasy. No wizards and fireballs, crystal staffs and other-worldly races. Just humans. Flawed, beautiful, loving, putrid, spiteful, heroic...humans. Oh yeah...and the \\"others\\"...<br /><br />The plot begins as a simple thread...or so it seems. It changes and weaves into a thick cord rapidly. The end of this book is terrific, and had me on my way to the store to buy book 2 the first time I read it. It's very hard to explain how good this book is. It is so intricate and full of symbolism, foreshadowing. It really needs more than one read. Layer upon layer of overlapping storylines. One small detail, lie, or omission affects the entire world, and good intentions can lay waste to an entire kingdom.<br /><br />The second time through, the sheer weight and emotion of the story hits much harder. Scenes come alive in more subtle ways once you know more about the history, the culture, the details of the people. If you've finished the book, simply go back and read the prologue and first 2 chapters. There is so much more there than it appeared to me the first time through. Careful though, you won't want to stop reading after chapter 2.<br /><br />The HBO adaptation is great, and very faithful, but I would recommend reading this first. It's so good.<br /><br />One word of warning...if you are starting this series and plan to read all 5 currently available books in succession, it's a lot to take in. You may want to consider breaking it up with a lighter read between books 3 and 4, just to give yourself a break. You won't want to, but book 4 is a much slower pace, and coming directly from the fastest paced part of the series to date (last 1/2 of book 3) it can seem even slower. I have absolutely loved all 5 books. I read every page with great interest, and don't presume to know where the author is going with the plot. I'm just enjoying the ride.

Bravo, Mr. Martin.t paced part of the series to date (last 1/2 of book 3) it can seem even slower. I have absolutely loved all 5 books.

B00007E8V4|5.0|About 2 years ago, System Of A Down broke down the walls between nu-metal and heavy metal with the release of &quot;Toxicity&quot;. Prior to this album, they were viewed as another Korn-come-lately. &quot;Toxicity&quot; changed all of that for good by maintaining their dreadlocked &amp; &quot;disenfranchised&quot; fans or yore and adding on former metal non-believers. It seemed as if, for one moment in time, those of us who grew up on real metal like Iron Maiden and Slayer and the mallrats had found a band we could all agree on.<br />&quot;Steal This Album&quot; is a collection of tracks from the first 2 albums' sessions that &quot;couldn't make the cut&quot; that have been leaked onto the internet and the band decided to release the songs in an official manner for their fans. The result is a collection of 16 tracks that actually manage to best both of their studio albums combined, sounding like a brand new album altogether.<br />Each succesive release from SOAD has embellished on what the former recording attempted to convey and continued to add to the fray. &quot;Steal This Album&quot; continues that tradition, borrowing some elements from their contemporaries in The Dillinger Escape Plan and Clutch and successfully furthering themselves, musically speaking, from the goth rock nu-metal hordes that they have had the unfortunate displeasure of being lumped in with.<br />Each song on &quot;Steal This Album&quot; carves out its own spot on the disc very well. Songs vary from charging and aggressive (Chik N' Stu) to mid-tempo and rockin' (Inner Vision) to melodic and heartfelt (Roulette) while never failing to include their more technical musical ability and obvious Frank Zappa influence (I-E-A-I-A-I-O). The tracks are mixed in together so flawlessly and helps one build a relationship with each song individually and with the album as whole.<br />System Of A Down have been a roaring success based on their ability to sound like System Of A Down. They are unpredictable and their range of influence shows itself as increasingly vast with each new song. And while they are very popular now, I have a feeling that they will still enjoy a wealth of die-hard fans well into the future while the Disturbed's and Mudvayne's are having trouble packing in the sports bars.d their range of influence shows itself as increasingly vast with each new song.

0316666343|1.0|The first chapter of this book really was chilling and interesting. Still, I found some things about it that had me rolling my eyes. I guess I should have stopped reading it right there because I should have known it was only going to get worse............... Don't buy this book. It's utterly worthless.
B00004Z459|5.0|Congratulations to Linkin Park, the CD is a huge hit and is a big seller.  Not bad for a band that popped out of nowhere.  Hybrid Theroy is a favorite of mine.  Linkin Park provides hard driving rock, with awesome beats and not one single bad word.  This CD has many songs, each unique.  Linkin Park is innovative bringing and fusing the two sounds of Chester's loud, powerful rock voice and Mike's rap.  The songs have been hits and the CD is an awesome buy that has plenty of songs.  &quot;In The End&quot;, &quot;Crawling&quot;, &quot;Points Of Authority&quot;, and &quot;One Step Closer&quot; have all been made into singles and Linkin Park's sucess with Hybrid Theroy pushed into a remix album and now a new CD Meteora.  I certaintly reccomend Linkin Park to all rock or alternative fans. Excellent music.
B00005JMFR|5.0|i believe that causality is the underlying theme of these movies.  I believe that by killing neo he unlocked the powers of the one and by neo killing smith he unlocked smiths true powers.  The two become equal forces killing each other in an epic battle.  The two anamolies are killed and the next matrix can be created.
B000002WYT|4.0|This cd is a perfect buy for anyone interested in expanding their DMB collection. although not all of the songs are amazing hits like the first cd, its still a great cd. Here are a list of my favorite songs from this cd:<BR>2. Two Step- By far one of DMB's best songs ever. Its so powerful and melodic. The lyrics are amazing also and make the song twice as good.<BR>5. #41- My second personal favorite love song written by DMB. It needs no explanation of why it rules, just listen to it yourself.<BR>7. Drive in Drive Out- A really cool fast song on the cd. has lots of really cool sax. solos.<BR>Although fewer famous songs, this cd still delivers. another must for die hard DMB fans.
B000000H3Z|5.0|When I heard first time the Sepultura primitive metal style, I was thinking they'll hit the heavy rock stardom in the future. These brazilian guys at first time use to make some Slayer and Venom covers in live presentations, also they had a Metallica and Nuclear Assault influence. But their teenaged illusions were came true when they picked up for a brazilian metal label as called &quot;cogumelo recs.&quot;, so they tried a single album with two sides, one side was a &quot;Overdose&quot; recording (Overdose is another Brazilian metal band), and in the side two was the &quot;Bestial Devastation&quot; EP, now it can be heard in the &quot;Morbid Visions&quot; remixed album as a bonus EP.<br />But despite for the &quot;Morbid Visions&quot; and &quot;Schizophrenia&quot; previous albums, they got their popularity more higher when these Belo Horizonte natives traveled to Rio de Janeiro for the &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; recording. The end complete puts Max Cavalera (original lead vocal/rytmic guitar in the band)when he went to USA bringing with him some &quot;demo&quot; tapes and the &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; album. Roadrunner puts their faith in the brazilian monsters and all their albums was conveying in worldwide albums, Sepultura puts their signal and metalistic power music in all the world.<br />This album is the best of all Sepultura stuff, if really is &quot;Arise&quot; as like another kind of masterpiece, it never be compared with the technic, speed and intensity that &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; have for itself. Songs like &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot;, &quot;Inner Self&quot;, or &quot;Lobotomy&quot; puts the thrash metal in the air in a very &quot;Thrash Death&quot; style. Sepultura never decay in this album, they make a lot of combinations (speed, technic, melodic and progressive riffs all the time), so they deserve all the respect for this genre.<br />Sadly, since they've recorded &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;, their original style has dying few a few until now, their actual sound is diferent and that incredible band is another with another sound. Just let's concentrate in the Max Cavalera's voice and riffs, Andreas Kisser's faster and melodic guitars, Igor Cavalera's incredible beating drumming style and Paulo Jr. touching bass efforts and you'll have one of the best Thrash albums in the whole world. Enjoy it and scream it. SEPULTURA RULES ('TILL &quot;ARISE&quot; ALBUM)!!!until now, their actual sound is diferent and that incredible band is another with another sound.

B0000CABBW|5.0|Please let everyone in your family see this beautiful movie. The rating is mis-leading.  It should be rated &quot;G&quot; but for the use of one word.  I was so emotional at the scene where her grandfather was honored, I could barely breathe. Deserving of every honor that exists!
B000050GAW|5.0|This three-pack is a must have. It includes all the REAL &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies (the ones that tell the story of how Luke Skywalker gets to be a Jedi Knight, like his father), and by Episode VI all the loose ends are answered. Truly great cinema, with great special effects.<BR>This three classics must not be missed!
B00003CXB4|5.0|Hola Amigos;<br />Last week (October 2003) when I came in my local Blockbuster just to look around I was so happily surprised to find &quot;The Lion King&quot; Special Edition DVD in a full shelf specially crafted for this premiere.<br />I was waiting so long for this release on DVD. I actually thought that here in Peru it was going to be very difficult to find it since all the time I asked for this movie all only they got was the Lion King 2 for renting on DVD.<br />I finally got it! I must say I almost burst into tears when I started to watch it on my TV screen. I was long ago since I last enjoyed of this movie. It was as colorful and bright in both english and spanish versions as I recalled it.<br />I first watch it when I started the university back to 1994 and it really meant a lot for me by that time.<br />I actually still have a good time by listening to the different tracks on my PC (the soundtrack without any dialogue is fantastic!)<br />If you ever come to Peru let me know since I work for the Tourist Information here in Lima-Peru and I like to have friends from all over the world.<br />WELCOME TO PERU THE PROUD LAND OF THE INCAS!<br />Cesar Dominguez<br />A Peruvian Young Man of Honor<br />Lima-Peru<br />This is my homepage with some pictures of Machu Picchu: [...]<br />cesards@hotmail.com, cesards@yahoo.com
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Good: The songs that are here are great. That's to be expected from a Tarantino movie. Zamfir's song - he's the master of the pan flutes! - fits perfectly with the movie and it is great out of context as well. &quot;Battle Without Honor or Humanity&quot; is an essential action movie song. &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; is a fine and complicated song, though at first it may seem simple. <br />The first time you listen to this soundtrack, it makes you very impatient for the DVD release of the movie itself.<br />Bad: Of the 22 tracks, 9 are sound effects or dialog. For a movie with so much great music, I expected more of it. <br />And that one song where the RZA talks over the beautiful background just ruins the track. I'm a Wu-Tang and RZA fan from way back, but this track is just strange. He doesn't flow nor rhyme well. It's as if RZA let someone far less talented write it, and then the first take of the poor verse made it onto the CD.<br />Overall: I'm glad I got it, and I'm just as glad I got it at a good price.
B000050GAW|5.0|SPOILERS AHEAD<BR>This Episode ties all the loose ends left from &quot;A New Hope&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, with the best special effects of the Trilogy, and maybe of all Sci-Fi movies. Personally, I love the fact that Darth Vader, my favorite character in motion picture history, turns good, and that his spirit(as Anakin)can be seen at the victory celebration alonside the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda. The ending is just perfect.<BR>Also, the music is the best from the Trilogy, adding depth to the characters and underscoring their development. Arguably, John Williams did his best work here.<BR>Anyway, this should have been the last Star Wars movie, so that people could remember this series as the greatest achievement in cinema history, and the greatest story ever told.
B0000DG00B|5.0|I just flat out have to tell you that this is one of the best and any ABB fan must have this to experience the original sounds of this group.  The &quot;early sounds&quot; are so tight. Makes me remember being there in Byron.  The sound quality of the recording is quite good and brings back the jammin' sounds that made the Allman Brothers one of the ushers of Southern Rock.  I favor the first day recording over the second, but both are superb.  After some 33 years, the sounds are still classic and fresh.  How is that? Because the Allman Brothers will remain one of the benchmark bands of rock.  Favorite songs are Elizabeth Reed, Whipping Post, and Statesboro Blues. Whether the Brothers wrote it or re-arranged it, the sounds on the Festival album are on any real fan's &quot;must have&quot; list. Buy, I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Trust me!!
B00008D1NF|5.0|With over three million copies sold in Brazil alone, in addition to a Grammy, Tribalistas are now conquering Europe (namely Italy, Switzerland, France, and the Netherlands) with this essential album and its various singles storming up national charts in those countries making them the biggest selling Brazilian act in Europe for well over 10 years! This is Brazilian music of the highest quality with band members Marisa Monte and Carlinhos Brown on production duties. The album includes two Brazilian Number 1 hit singles, the massive \\"Ja Sei Namorar\\" and its follow-up \\"Velha Infancia\\". A third Brazilian Top 40 chart hit comes in the shape of the very brilliant \\"Passe em Casa\\", co-written and performed with Bahian superstar Margareth Menezes. Incredibly, a year on from the album release, \\"É Você\\" also found its way into the Top 10. For once an album that actually lives up to the hype and more than deserves the sales it's achieving. A classic that will be played for years to come.
B000050GAW|5.0|I would like to say that surprisingly, each of the three films of the Star Wars Trilogy has been my favorite at one point, which is proof of their quality. For me, each Episode provides new elements to the story, and helps the plot to progress, ultimately leading to the great finale. To this day, no other sci-fi film or franchise has reached the level of these awesome movies; not even the new Star Wars films. This Trilogy remains the best entertainment you can get. <BR>I have only one question: when are they going to be released on DVD?!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I have been waiting for this on DVD and what a treat it is to finally have it with a breathtaking picture and great vastly improved sound. The restoration of this film was done with much care and the end result is a very spell bounding and in my mind under appreciated visual document of Pink Floyd's history. This is Pink Floyd at its avant-garde best and unlike allot of reviews on here I think the director's cut is superior to the original. The renditions of Echoes, Saucerfull of Secrets, and Set The Controls for the Heart of the Sun are superior to the studio versions. Playing in an ancient part of Italy only adds to the visualization. If you enjoyed this concert on VHS get it on DVD.
B000006NPY|5.0|Ths was my first taste of the pumpkins and what i would concider a must have for any fan of theirs. But its more than that, this album is complete, moody and dark. The prefect follow up to MCIS. If your thinking about buying it... you should.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|i saw this video in 1985 or six for the first time and it was good. i saw it in 1987, compliments of purple capped mushrooms and i would give it 5 stars plus. i saw it again on a big screen in 1990 with white blotter and it freaked me out. now that i am older amd somewhat wiser i still give it a super thumbs up not just for the memories of old, but the the floyd of old is brilliant and mystical; quite frankly , intersteller.
B00005JL78|3.0|Nice visuals, but the biggest flaw was straying from the awesome story and twist of the original short by Phillip K. Dick. What made Minority Report great in the short was the ending. The fact that Anderson (Cruise in movie) had to kill the general at the end to prove Precrime's validity was a great twist. Instead, in the movie, it's your typical good guy, then suddenly revealed to be the culprit of the whole setup toward the end of the movie. Then his demeaner changes. Just too 'hollywood.' This would have been better if done indepedently.
0060557818|3.0|Gaiman has created a brilliant underground world using the names of London Underground stations to create settings and characters.  This is a dark, enchanting world that I loved to explore along with the characters, who are also varied and intriguing.  The problem with this book is that it is utterly lacking a story.  Characters chase each other through foetid tunnels, gloomy rooftops, and abandoned buildings, but Gaiman provides no compelling reason for any of it.  Very much like a comic book, the characters are great on the surface, but we never learn anything else about them.  I really tried to like this book because it is a beauty for anyone who loves London or its Underground system.  Unfortunately, the boring story left me at the station...
B0000B1OFL|5.0|GREAT film.  Tremendous Actors and a great flowing story.  Plenty of twists and action.  Even better than Ocean's Eleven.
0790737345|1.0|This is the americanized version of the lovely &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; shot in Germany in 1988 by Wim Wenders. You should see that film. It truly is a beauty. THIS one, however, is so sub-par in comparison it is laughable. And not in a good way. Why, oh why, do american moviemakers insist on remaking old classics and foreign films? No ideas of their own I suppose. Pathetic. A great film recast and redone with a silly, shallow, cloying Hollywood veneer. Totally pointless and completely missing the artistry of the original. If I knew how to give negative stars, this one would get 5 of them.
B000008ERZ|5.0|Sleeping my Day Away and No Fuel Left for the Pilgrim are just blowing you away!<br />Very catchy tunes, and powerful music. Highly recommended!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This film deserves all the accolades it has accumulated. I don't think I have ever given 5 stars to any movie...maybe to nothing I've reviewed on Amazon. But Donnie Darko is just stunning. It gives you so much. Few things approach perfection, especially in the world of hackneyed Hollywood crud, but this film makes it. Richard Kelly uncorked a masterpiece for the ages.
6305696071|3.0|I cannot understand the hype about Julia Roberts. May be it is beacuse I am not American.In this movie she plays a warm, honest, compassionate prostitute with good moral values. How this happens?Prostitution on the streets must be quite tough, dealing with dangerous men,etc and some girl cannot get away with it with innocent huge eyes and being sweet. A movie does not have to be realistic but it should not be nonsense either. Then the nice hooker helps a millionaire to find his way and ended up being employed by him for a week to be his girlfriend. The millionaire being Richard Gere is cold and distant, but very well mannered, kind, generous, intelligent and plain gorgeus.  I did not buy the \\"he was a ruthless business man before the sweet prostitute\\" theme, he was nice from the beginning- how many men can be so kind to a hooker?...I can understand the director's motives here-to create an opposite attracts, the poor nice girl warms the rich man's heart, anyone can live a fairy tale if intentions are good...<BR>Still, there are good sides of this movie-Richard Gere. With grey hair and great suits he is epitome of mature gorge. ...
B000060P79|5.0|Well this CD is very good, I think that the people who post the bad reviews are talking just to talk. They need to listen to the Cd and understand the lyrics. Pierre has an amazing voice. It is his voice that one this 19-year-old fan.
0792165020|4.0|The movie is  about the talented, wicked, dishonest and many many other (mostly bad)qualities loaded Mr Ripley who tries to climb the social ladder through telling lies, pretending, murder and well, talent. Tom Ripley is a poor guy and one day meets wealthy Mr Greenleaf who thinks he is a classmate of his son (due to his borrowed jacked). Greenleaf puts money in Tom's pocket and sends him to Italy to fetch his carefree son. Tom befriended with Dickie (Jude Law)and his girlfriend Marge (Paltrow) and starts to have the time of his life. However, no lie lasts forever, and besides Dickie gets bored of people easily, so after a rough discussion and kind of love declaration Ripley murders the having-it -all Dickie. Was it jealousy, anger of unreturned feelings (yes Ripley is a homesexual, and he hints it from the start, he is so passionate about every beautiful thing but women) or the fear of returning back to his ordinary life? Then he takes Dickie's identity, and continues his enchanted life with some more crimes. He is really clever and calculating, he takes every little detail into account. So, he gets away with all murders and lies-well almost all since the end leaves a question<BR>The plot and directing is very good, as well as the atmosphere. The small Italian village, the costumes and the gorgeus Jude Law alone can save any movie. It was the first time I saw him on screen and became a fan immediately-handsome with talent. I think he could be Ripley as well, he could be better one as he has more charm.Paltrow is lovely, so is Cate Blanchett but very underused-she was the starring in Elizabeth and had an oscar nomination, why she admitted such a small part is a mystery to me.Hoffman as Dickie's arrogant friend Freddie displays a super performance, as well. For me the only problem was Damon. He is a fine actor and playing well, but I dont think he has the charisma and energy  Ripley should display. He looks like more of a good student trying to cheat in exam rather than a jealous and wicked personna. But he was good in the murdering scene-his expression while hitting Dickie with the stone was marvellous. He could do better in earlier Tom Cruise type movies-a la The Firm. I dont buy him as the smooth criminal.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I finally saw SPIRITED AWAY.  What a fantastic and marvelous film it is.  The story is about Chihiro, a young girl who becomes lost in a surreal wonderland.  She must find inner and physical strength in order to save her parents and return to the natural world.  <br />Hiyao Miyazaki's film resembles Alice in Wonderland, as well as Terry Gilliam's film Brazil.  Of course it reminds a viewer of his earlier movies, like Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro.  Amazing creatures appear and surprising scenarios arise throughout the movie, as we watch Chihiro evolve from a weak, spoiled brat into a strong, determined young girl, intent on saving herself and her family.  <br />The movie simply looks beautiful.  No Disney movie has ever looked this good.  I planned on watching it in two sittings, and found myself unable to tear myself away.  I think it suitable to all but the youngest viewers-- some of the magical creatures are gruesome and disgusting monsters-- perhaps too scary for the very young!  <br />I highly recommend SPIRITED AWAY.<br />Ken32
B00000F566|4.0|I remember watching this movie when I was in highschool, and being amazed by the striking characters, dancing scenes and great music. ...It may sound like a boring melodrama with rich girl poor boy from wrong side plot, but pas du tout. Patrick Swayze is sexier than he has ever been and will be, Jennifer Grey is wonderfully casted for the warm, strong willed, charming but not a classical beauty Baby. The leading woman character Baby (real name Frances) is so admirable-she is optimistic, confident, helpful, intellectuel and is not afraid to go for what she wants without being egoistic. I have to admit that I took her as a role model at that time. Today watching it again when I am 30, I still think that I can adopt some characteristics of her-at least believe that I can change stgs if not the whole world
B0000C9V3T|5.0|The person that wrote the review above was incorrect. The song that plays when Uma picks the sword IS on the cd, and it's &quot;The lonely shephard&quot; by Gheorghe Zamfir - Romanian folk music (Zamfir is very famous for playing the panflute). Some of the other songs are very energetic. Very good ensemble.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Like millions, I was blown away by The Matrix in 1998, and when I heard they were making the sequels, I was dizzy with anticipation. When I saw Reloaded I thought, well, not exactly The Phantom Menace but it's no Two Towers. It's not exactly garbage, but it certainly did not live up to its predecessor. It took me a while to figure out why I was so disappointed. As many pointed out, the Zion orgy thing was unnecessary, and the fights, which looked nice, didn't get the story going. I totally agreed with Trinity when she said \\"Come on, get OUT of there!!\\" <br />But I realized that what bothered me most was that Reloaded had no subtlety. The actors were drowned in a sea of digital what-nots, and the main themes were a bit too \\"Hey!! Look at me! I'm the main theme! I'm the most important word in this movie!!\\" Love, choice, and purpose, purpose, purpose. Did Smith have to say it over and over again? And the France-bashing was just plain annoying. I don't expect a thing from movies like Maid in Manhattan and Johnny English, but I thought the Wachowskis were SMART people. They made the Good Guys From The Bronx vs. The Bad Guys From Paris And Other Parts Of Europe thing a bit too obvious. <br />But in the end, I bought the DVD and saw Reloaded several times. especially the good scenes that were more subtle. Anytime the Oracle is on screen, it's great. Gloria What's-her-name is fabulous. Too bad she's passed away. Monica Bellucci is too hot for words, even to a 100% heterosexual woman like me. The little seduction in the men's bathroom was great too. Keanu's curt 'alright's really made me a fan. And the Architect's monologue was shocking, convincing me that the Wachowskis are pretty original people after all. The Twins weren't bad either; actually they were really cool. I miss them already. <br />While the abrupt ending made me feel like somebody pulled the carpet away under my feet, I've decided to let go of the disappointment and wait for what the boys have to offer in Revolutions. I really hope that George Lucas will be the only filmmaker who made fans rile and foam and tear their hair out.

B00005YW4H|5.0|This album is sublime, and although admitingly a summer album, is perfect to curl up to on a cold day.<BR>I can understand that some people may find this album boring, if they're not into this sort of thing, but I do not understand how anyone can find her voice irritating.<BR>Truly wonderful.
6305364648|1.0|Finally, I find someone who sees the abusiveness in the relationship between Arnie and his wife.  I find it really disturbing that this is supposed to be funny.  And that scene where he interrogates her is absolutely frightful.
B000089RV6|5.0|That pretty much sums it up. Most people know the story behind this album, but here's a short version if you don't: AC/DC had just had their big U.S. breakthrough with Highway to Hell, behind the guitars and songwriting of the Young brothers and the powerhouse voice and charisma of Bon Scott. Bon got drunk one night and passed out in a friend's car and was left there for the night. He vomited in his sleep, choked and died. Everyone assumed AC/DC was dead, but the band knew Bon's passion for rock n roll would want them to continue. They auditioned singers and found a diamond in the rough in Brian Johnson, then went into the studio focused on giving Bon the perfect musical farewell.<br />Now, the album. The tolling of the bell for Bon ends it ominously but perfectly, leading into Hell's Bells. Right away I was blown away by the pure range and power Brian delivers. You know this is something special. Don't think they're playing mournfully either, this is still down n dirty AC/DC rock, just more intense. They get back to more typical subject matter with the fun Shoot to Thrill, and by the time you get to What You Do For Money Honey the middle of the album just grooves along like no collection of songs you've ever heard. The title track is an all-time great (just like everything here) metal march that is the most personally linked to Bon.Everyone knows You Shook Me All Night Long, and it still holds up. The album rolls along to the song that gives a great middle finger to the people that would come to call AC/DC too vulgar or juvenile: Rock N Roll Aint Noise Pollution. The perfect anthem for rock fans to pump their fists too, it closes the album with a thunderous bang. So enough of me talking, go get this album and see the greatness you're missing. Like the last song says it just &quot;makes good, good sense.&quot;

I do recall cyndi lauper (girls just wanna fun), I thought! they were same poeple, some said that madonna was coping her, I must say Madonna kicked her ... with this album, cyn was though. I due like cyn, But you just cannot compare her to madonna.. anyway Like a virgin takes me back to 2nd grade when all the girl dress like her, that was so cool. I did once hee hee, Well as we all know its hit # 1 for 3 weeks on album charts title track rose fast to # 1 for 6 weeks. The song has over 1 million copies, but do to chart rules at the time they have it cert- as gold. They need to update that. with (crazy for you) is also over 1 million copies and under certified. So madonna has 6 platinum singles. Just to inform those who dint know. But like a virgin has it all. POP>DANCE>RnBsound> good flavor those who do not agree I think is sick in the head!!!!!!!!! LIKE A VIRGIN ALL THE WAY>>>
B00008GKEG|5.0|I think the DVD is actually cheaper than the VHS set when it came out, and that didn't even have the extras!!    This is the authorized video bio of The Beatles, the band that turned the world on its ear in the early 60s until 1970 when they broke up.    A lot is covered in the 4 discs, where they grew up, how they got together, the (mis)adventures they went on, the bonding and humor that got them threw the storm known as Beatlemania, the drug use, the women, and the eventual breakup.     You can tell the interviews were done over a number of years, and  because Lennon had done a number of lengthy interviews, we are lucky to be able to hear his voice throughout the film. We see George in various states of facial hair and hair length, Paul getting ready for a show and driving a boat, Ringo kicking it on the west coast as well as the \\"Threetles\\" hanging in George's backyard and in a kitchen, talking like old war buddies. Yoko is interviewed here and there, as is producer George Martin. In a way, you kind of wish the other Beatle girlfriends/wives were involved because they were there when it was going on, and would have been able to give a different take on it.     John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" has been recently released on DVD and is worth watching after this, even if just for the Beatles era. \\"Wingspan\\" goes into Paul's solo career, and \\"Concert For Bangladesh\\" might not be a documentary but it is a great concert that was just released.    The heart of this collection, in between the stories, is the music itself as well as the promotional films (Before they called them music videos). The Ed Sullivan footage is readily available on its own, but the Shea Stadium footage calls for a full-length release, it looks amazing, and the \\"Strawberry Fields\\" footage also looks great when having seen grainy bootleg versions.     The down side is that the songs are not easily accessible (on purpose?) and at times there is narration over them, or they're not shown completely. Something like \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" was considered groundbreaking, why not show it from beginning to end? The \\"Let It Be\\" footage also looked fantastic, far better than what they had released on video years ago.      Because it's the \\"authorized\\" story, you're not going to get the gossipy salacious stuff that has been brought up over the years, but at times the language from time to time is not for young children.     The documentary is a lot to digest in one sitting, but here and there it's a great story. The extras are great but one wishes there was more of it. It would have been nice had they put just concert and promo footage just the same.     Between this, the book, \\"The First US Visit\\", the movies,the Anthology 1-3 CDs as well as the CDs of their catalog, you get to see and hear the story the way they intended it to be told.
B0000028VT|5.0|Im not big on mariah, as a mega fan but I must say she has done a good job here. My favorite is (anytime you need friend), all the tracks are good.  Yes this was her album that really made mariah huge internationally, Yes # 1 selling over 20 million copies world wide. yeah yeah.They say she is the most sucessful female artist of all time, just because she has 15#1'hits( not all solo efferts) sold more albums in the 90's Mariah did kick butt!! But her peak was in 1995/96 with her Daydream cd. Everything after Daydream's peak! Mariah's sound went down hill to many duets nothing on her own was being created, for example using other people beats all the time it got old. She got to ghetto(late bloomer)tried to show more skin look good! but its has been done already!!!! This is not putting mariah down in any way. her early music still is good, thats what she needs to bring back, all this crap even off her latest cd is horrible. However Through the rain is beautiful I really like that song.  But Music Box with Daydream are both dam good album I have to admit that.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is an amazing DVD. The first disc captures them when they had a lot to prove, were lean and hungry, and it shows. This was around the time they did their first American tours, and anyone who saw them around that time said that &quot;Song Remains the Same&quot; did not do them justice as a band. This proves their case. More so the 4 song, 20 minute set they did for TV. <br />The Earls Court footage is also quite a find. Hopefully Page can put a complete show just of this concert alone. It sounds great, as well as some great closeups of the band members. <br />The MSG footage should have been saved for a &quot;Song Remains the Same&quot; Special Edition DVD. That DVD needs a proper makeover. Maybe in 3 years when the film was released in 76 they'll do it. <br />The Knebworth footage was decent enough, but it's not one of their better performances. But considering Plant lost his son in a tragedy, it's a miracle that he evewanted to do music again. <br />Overall, it's a DVD which is just a great band in its element without the mythic BS. The one you could show future generations who this band truly was. It's also one that gives you a reason to listen to their music again, even after it's been overplayed on the radio.
B000002C4J|5.0|Nothing else can be said, I love this whole album. Celine  gives her best here..  Get it along with Falling into to you. But her two recent efforts just dint get me like I thought. Go Celine, enough said!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000524CY|5.0|WHEW, THE MOVIE IS SCARY! THE ORIGINAL WAS GOOD, I PERSONALLY LIKED THE THE UNCUT VERSION, BECAUSE IT SCARED ME EVEN MORE! PERFECT FOR HALLOWEEN, JUST DONT LET THE CHILDREN SEE THIS ONE..I CANT THINK OF ONE PART OF THIS MOVIE THAT ISNT GOOD..IN THE BEGINNING THE MOVIE DRAGS A LITTLE, BUT IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THIS MOVIE YET, BY ALL MEANS, STICK WITH IT!! YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID...
B000002AVF|5.0|Along with her Music Box set kick butt!.. Yeah 10 million in the us sold, cool its well worth it. Like mr.Guatemale guy said I only got this cd for Fanstasy. I couldnt enough of it. Other tracks like- melt away,underneath the stars, oh god they had me crazy. This is one to own.. go mariah  But is she really the most sucessful female act of all time ?
6301955595|4.0|Haunting and powerful are jus two words to describe this movie although no words can describe it. Basically, it is about a young boy growing up in the circus with an odd set of parents. When tragedy strikes he is put in a mental asylum, and years later breaks out to join his crazy mother. that is all i am going to describe without giving anymore away. I thought this film was excellant but it is not for evryone. The acting was excellant especially the actress who played the deaf girl. the soundtrack is beautiful too. recommended but like i said not for everyone.
076790592X|5.0|I read this book and was touched by what Morrie had to say. Life is full of different obstacles. Each one will change our life in a different direction. Forgiveness, Love, Family, Joy and Emotions are what we want to not regret. Life is short and what kind of life we live is what kind of person we will become. Thank You Morrie. I am a better person today because of you!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|i'm not a rabid maynard fan, but i will give credit where credit is due.  i disagree with a previous reviewer who said that 'nothing stands out on the cd in my opinion'.  the songs &quot;weak and powerless,&quot; and &quot;the noose&quot; are wonderful songs that rival anything else out there this year.  what else do we have to choose from?  most &quot;rock&quot; or - and i hesitate to even use this term - &quot;metal&quot; bands these days cannot marry the two concepts of musical talent and meaningful lyrics to save their lives!  be honest with yourself and you will find you agree with me.  this album rocks.  buy it with confidence.  probably the most original stuff this year, albeit a little darker than britney.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Elliott's beautiful melodies and lyrics all intertwine here, and become some of the most haunting and memorable of his work.<BR>As of late I've been awakening to 'Happiness' playing in my head, still unable to understand why he chose to leave so soon.<br />Please check out his self-titled album, as well as either/or and xo. They are all amazing, and deserve to be heard.<br />He had such an amazing ability to communicate to so many the emotions and sweetness which too often go alone in our hearts; I hope that he found a comfort in knowing the pleasure he gave us in hearing his gorgeous songs.<br />Elliott, thank you.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|From the pure energy rockin' of &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; to the melodic &quot;Come Around Again&quot; and everywhere in between, these guys know how to write good rock songs.  Jet's influences ring loud and true on this album, and they have the right ones:  Rolling Stones, the Who, AC/DC, the Beatles, and more.  The result?  A rollicking, tuneful and harmonious guitar-driven masterpiece.  This sums it all up: They wear their influences on their sleeves, yet maintain their originality.  A note to the young crowd:  This is good new rock; you'll appreciate this album, even if you consider the Rolling Stones, Who, etc &quot;dinosaur bands.&quot;  (By the way, I'm 24, and regret the days I dismissed the &quot;dinosaur bands&quot; as such)  Jet allows you to enjoy good rock without having the mental picture of a bunch of middle aged men playing rock songs (see Rolling Stones last tour)
B00005JKZV|5.0|The Lord of the RIngs are probably the best movies ever made. I am a real fan of the books and the movies are just as awesome. Whatever Peter Jackson changes in the story does not take away from the plot but cleverly alters it slightly to fit the movie and keeps the same idea told in the book. Most movies made on books I`ve liked have usualy dissapointed me but not this one. It took two geniuses to create this film and it is truly a bigger hit than even starwars. I love the story the music the visual effects and the awesome battles in Two Towers. When a film trilogy is made the middle film is usualy not as exciting as the first or the last. The first film begins the story the last one ends it and the middle one sort of just hangs in there to make it longer. But the Two Towers is deffinately an exception to the rule: middle movie is not as thrilling. Be sure to see the ultimate in filmaking!!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|'Let Go' is probably one of the best pop/rock albums ur gonna get! it's been out for about 1 1/2 years and im still listening to it.  Sure Avril was overkilled on the radio stations and MTV and Muchmusic. but face it: she's got talent! AND SHE ADMITS SHE'S NOT PUNK! SO ALL U WHINING LITTLE PUNKS OUT THERE SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And she does co-write her own music, and play the guitar. (go to a concert and you'll see) also, sure her voice is a little raspy sometimes live, but dont you think you wouldn't sound top-knotch when ur singing every night, overworked, overtired, and are in front of over 1000 people?? i've heard avril sing live at times where she sounded almost exactly like she does on her CD.  And whoever says this music isn't original and wasnt made with every ounce of talent from avril's heart is WRONG.  you are probably the people who don't have much to live for, have the high lives, and don't actually face Teen problems.  I think i can relate to every song on here at least once!!! and to all u stupid little girls who think &quot;i listen to avril lavigne im punk&quot; UR NOT. SKATER BOI IS NOT A PUNK SONG!!  i think this CD would've gone better if skater boi wasnt released on it.  but all in all. this was a very promising cd.  nice and refreshing compared to all the pre-fab bubblegum pop we see these days.  With singers like Avril lavigne and Michelle Branch, hopefully pop will have a turn around...so give this cd a chance!! if it wasn't good, how could it have went platinum in canada??
B00005JKC3|2.0|When I decided to see watch The Hulk at the theaters, it was because I had nothing else do to.  I realized I could have spent two hours and fifteen minutes doing something else.  The movie was unneccsary too long and everytime you thing you are ready for some great action the movie slows down again.  It took a full hour to finally see the big green guy as well.  The acting of this movie will not exite anybody either.  It is fair to say that Nick Nolte does a respectable job as Bruce Banner's father. To my suprise Jennifer Connolly did not have it in this movie.  Also, Eric Bana is far from special. The ladies also get see him naked, not completly though.  At the end of the film, when we see the hulk walking around the dessert smashing things having some fun, the viewer would want to know what took so long see some action.  Thses movie did not have much, it clearly lacked action.  The bottom line is that it could hav been terrible but is far from good.

0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is the best book I have read in recent memory. From the first page Brown enthralls you in a mystery involving an ancient religious order, the Vatican, and a secret society which has been headed by famed people such as Da Vinci, Boticelli, and others. The book is, without giving too much away, about a quest for the Holy Grail and the age-old conflict between science and religion. As our heroes, a Harvard professor and a French cryptographer, search for the answers to a murder and the clues left behind, an extremist sect of the church seeks to destroy all evidence of that which our heroes seek, and the heroes themselves. The best part about the book is that Brown thoroughly researches every aspect of this story. All references and premises are based in fact!

A local safari guide had been stupidly keeping penned zombies. Some of his zombies escaped, and consumed/killed my livestock!

055357342X|5.0|Who's good, who's not? This serie is unbelievable, prepare to be heartbroken a few times. Loaded with twist and turns. Unlike most of the fantasy books out there, you feel the mortality of every character. When they enter battlem you never know if he'll survive or not. This keeps us on the edge at all time. In the end good always prevail, but the well being of one is not necessarily the same for all. I think this serie exposes this perfectly.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Concert films are, inevitably, pretty unrewarding spectacles. Iffy sound, endless crowd shots, migraine-inducing overuse of the zoom lens, and a sense of &quot;well, you had to be there, of course&quot; permeating every grainy long-shot of a &quot;legendary&quot; ten-minute Credence jam, all add up to an experience akin to someone telling you about a dream they had last night. That this Maysles brothers' Altamont doc was rescued from such Woodstock-the-Moviedom by the tragic events caught therein is certainly nothing to cheer about, but the results leave an indelible mark where your average festival film just washes over. Perhaps working with hindsight, but still believably, the atmosphere of impending disaster is magnificently built up over scenes of preparation for the speedway gig - from Andrew Loog Oldham's Partridgean attempts at crowd control (&quot;You're rendering that scaffolding unsafe!&quot;) to the massive communication gap between the Hell's Angels security detachment and the strung-out organisers. Meanwhile The Stones hang about in local civic offices as the finer points of car park regulation are ironed out. By the time the famous on-screen audience stabbing is being played repeatedly, in slow motion to the shell-shocked band by the directors in a squalid edit suite, you're as sucked into the nightmare as they are. Chilling, compelling stuff. Oh, and the music's pretty good, too.

6305922756|5.0|\\"The dial goes up to 11!\\" Marti Di Bergi's seminal spoof rockumentary has been seen so much and quoted so often its impact has been lessened more than a little. But it's worth remembering just how important, and more importantly how funny, it really was. The complaints about the comparative sizes of salami and bread, the dimensions of an on-stage Stonehenge and the involvement of Christopher Guest's girlfriend in the break up of the band are brilliant moments in the progress of the band and its promotional tour of their new album, Smell the Glove under the eye of their record company boss, Sir Denis Eton-Hogg, played by Patrick Macnee. Music stars are still just as flamboyantly idiotic these days and Spinal Tap remains just as relevant as it was in 1984 when it was released and the film remains the model for every spoof reality project since.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|&quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is neither as bad as many fans on the site would lead you to believe nor as good as the $200,000,000 spent to produce and market it.  It is a very entertaining and thought-provoking film, while it also has some deep flaws that take away from the overall viewing experience.<br />The greatest flaw of all is the refusal of the directors to cut ANYTHING.  Many scenes in this film could have and should have been cut.  &quot;Reloaded&quot; would have been a lot better if it was a leaner and meaner 110 minutes instead of 138.  First and foremost, the whole Zion part of the film should have been shorter.  The orgy/dance scene should have been cut in half.  And the scene where Neo talks with the counsellor probably could have been cut completely.  And the Agent Smith fight scenes???  Though they were quite thrilling, they didn't advance the plot whatsoever.  I realize that it was important do introduce Smith in this film because it looks like he'll be important in the next one, but still, these fight scenes should have been cut down a little!<br />Likewise, other characters (like the Merovingian) are introduced and then forgotten about.  What was the nature of the conflict between the Merovingian and the Oracle?  I guess we're supposed to find out in the third one, which brings me to the film's final flaw- the ending is in a very bad spot.  I realize that it was supposed to be a &quot;cliffhanger&quot;, but this film ends so abruptly that it just makes the rest of it seem that much more incomplete.  I guess I can't completely judge &quot;Reloaded&quot; until &quot;Revolutions&quot; comes out.  That's the problem- no one can.<br />What makes this movie so frustrating is that when it's good, it's REALLY good.  Some of the fight scenes are terrific, and the story is both convoluted and thrilling.  &quot;Reloaded&quot; is a film that's both entertaining and fun to talk about (hence the 1000-plus reviews).  It's just not as good as the first one, no matter how hard it tries to be.  One can't help but feel when watching this movie that the filmakers are trying too hard to replicate the originality of the first one- they end up with a film that is terrific eye candy and mind-boggling, but overlong and pretentious.  Sometimes, bigger is not better.  Here's hoping that &quot;Revolutions&quot; answers some of this film's problems.

B00003CXCK|4.0|This movie shows us that even in such an insane rule, such as was Hitler's, that there were men of concience.  Liam Neeson's portral of such a man was wonderful.  Anyone who views this film and does not atleast feel their anguish, and his is to be pittied.  I feel that even though the film showed the harshness of the treatment of people of the Jewish faith, that it was still showing it to us \\"kindly\\". I hope we never forget and are reminded like this film has so very well.
B0000A36J5|5.0|J.R.R. Tolkein wrote one of the masterpieces of human civilization when he crafted the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Peter Jackson's three films have taken that masterwork and translated it to a medium. The critics who scoff at the changes made to the books simply do not understand the nature of modern film. I'm just going to touch on 2 examples:<BR>1. Arwen. The Arwen/Aragorn love story is completely Tolkein. In fact, much of the dialogue for the scenes in the Two Towers was taken WORD FOR WORD from the appendix of the trilogy. Why did Tolkein not include these elements in the main novel? Some would say that they would have interrupted the flow of the novel, others claim that Tolkein didn't feel confident about writing love scenes. Whichever it was, this tale was clearly part of the story Tolkein wanted to tell. By including it, Jackson has enriched the story, unified elements from Tolkein's writings, and made the film more accesible to younger female audiences. Why does everyone think that this is such a bad thing???<br />2. Faramir. Yes, I agree that it would have been nice to see Faramir play his role exactly as written in the books. However, had he done so, the sequence would have contained absolutely no dramatic tension and brought the plot to a complete standstill. You can do that in a novel, but it is one of the golden rules of film to avoid doing so. You can pause for 50 pages to develop a character in an interesting way in a book. In film, the tension has to increase exponentially all the way to the climax. Brief respites are ok, but those respites should primarily serve as contrasts to the tension, not breaks in it.<br />Anyway, Peter Jackson has crafted an amazing piece of work. Very few films in history could claim to rival it.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin I was a tough album to follow up, but the band managed to do it and, arguably, outshine its predecessor. From the blazing guitar solo in Heartbreaker, to the thundering bass leads of the Lemon Song, to the almost melodic drumming of Moby Dick, the members all show their stuff here. <BR>But still, you can't say that Led Zeppelin favored self-indulgence over good songwriting...there's plenty of that! Most notably, the wicked electric blues riff in Bring It On Home and the bass driven hard rock of Whole Lotta Love. So, Led Zeppelin II will get your rocks off and your jaw dropping
B00005QGAV|5.0|This album has some of Michael's best work on it, and is a must have for fans. Here's a track by track review.<BR>1. Jam: Great start to the album, catchy song, with a great rap toward the middle of the song.<BR>2. Why You Wanna Trp On Me: Good song, it may take a little while to get into it, but when the chorus comes, it becomes much more catchy.<BR>3. In The Closet: I love this song, though it created a lot of controversy. A new kind of song for Michael. Very good music and writing, though there are some dirty phrases in it, that's what makes it an attention grabber.<BR>4. She Drives Me Wild: I love this song, it's got a really good beat to it, and comparing a girl to a car is very original, and he manages to do it without being corny. One of the highlights of this album.<BR>5. Remember The Time: Awesome! The video is great too. Great lyrics about love, without getting sappy, and keeps an upbeat energetic feel.<BR>6. Can't Let Her Get Away: I haven't really listened closely to this song. It takes too long for me to get interested, but the music is good, so the whole song probably is,<BR>7. Heal The World: Beautiful song about the world.<BR>8. Black Or White: One of my favorites off the album, and I am definately not alone, one of Michael's biggest hits. Awesome message and beat about races of the world coming together.<BR>9. Who Is It: Michael is awesome in this song. I love the sound of the song. Mysterious feel to this one.<BR>10. Give In To Me: Another Favorite. A rock song by Michael. For me, Michael seems so alone in this song, and that makes it a really great feel. Just the listener and Michael. You will get caught in this song. I sure do.<BR>11. Will You Be There: This song was put on the Free Willy Soundtrack. I think Michael is the only artist, aside from Whitney Houston, where I can listen to a song on his album, that has been put on a soundtrack, and I can listen to the song without thinking of the movie, meaning that his music can make you forget abouteverything, also if I hear a song on a soundtrack, and then hear it on someone's album, I think of it as a little generic.<BR>12. Keep The Faith: One of the best songs. It didn't get enough appreciation. Michael really sounds great on this track.<BR>13. Gone Too Soon: Haven't listened to this song a lot, but from what I've heard it's a very good song.<BR>14. Dangerous: Love this song as well. The lyrics are beat are very impressive, great end to an amazing album.<BR>I recommend this to anyone who appreciates great lyrics/music.
B0000C0FJB|3.0|For starters, let me say that this album is a true and excellent document of the triumphant 2002 tour. It was a fabulous show, and this CD brings it all back. However, I cannot listen to this CD. The audience is the 4th musician, and they &quot;play&quot; louder than the band. And it's not just the noise level. The noise they make is freaky. It's more like a political rally or a World Cup soccer match. I'm not sure why this distracting racket was not edited out (or at least down) in the final mix. <br />If you are able to concentrate thru the distraction of the crowd, you will be very pleased with what you hear. The classics &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, &quot;Natural Science&quot;, &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot;, &quot;2112 - Overture &amp; Temples&quot;, &quot;Freewill&quot; and &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot; are played with energy and passion. The new songs &quot;Earthshine&quot; and &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; are better than the versions on &quot;Vapor Trails&quot;. But the real treat is the encore: &quot;By-Tor &amp; the Snow Dog&quot;, &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; and &quot;Working Man&quot;. The band is clearly happy to be playing these songs again. <br />I personally think &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; was Rush's best record since &quot;Moving Picture&quot;, and I'm hoping they keep moving in this direction (assuming, of course, that they even MAKE another record). <br />Final note: The DVD of &quot;Rush in Rio&quot; is less annoying. I'm not sure if the crowd is actually lower in the mix, or if I'm distracted by the visuals, but I would recommend skipping the CD and sticking with the DVD.
B0000DD79B|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I am a big Simon and Garfunkel fan.<BR>I give it a 3 stars not because it is bad or anything like that. It's just that we have been given the same old songs again, re-re-remastered and re-re-re-released for the nth time.<BR>Tell me, honestly, don't you have all these songs?<BR>Just release a NEW album and get it over with... But no, they want more money from us again... gullible fans. They just know we'll buy anything with Simon and Garfunkel on the cover. Then just wait a year, they'll announce that they'll release it on DVD-audio and will buy it again. They've got it going as far as how to make money, not music.<BR>Man, if you want to succeed in life, just buy some shares or stocks of our dear friends at Sony or whoever is manipulating the public. It's a show biz scheme, and they know it.<br />Instead buying these same songs over again I went ahead and bought some NEW music buy another veteran outfit...DEEP PURPLE. Their new album -Bananas- is the best thing I have heard this year, along with -Say You Will- by Fleetwood Mac. Thank God some artists are willing to give their fans something new and wonderful.<br />The Essential Simon and Garfunkel: 3 Stars<BR>Bananas: 5 stars (check out all the great reviews on Amazon)

B000065V9Y|4.0|As much as I like &quot;So&quot;, sometimes it's a bit too commercial for me, and as good as &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; is, I don't want to hear it a 500th time. I think &quot;Us&quot; may be my favorite of his. Front to back it's just really pleasing. The first 3 tracks are beautiful slower ones, with &quot;Sinead O'connor&quot; singing backup on 2 of them. &quot;Steam&quot; was a hit, and is probably the &quot;Big Time&quot; of this record. There is a subtle world music vibe on many songs, but it doesn't dominate the album, like on Paul Simons &quot;Graceland&quot;. My favorite song here is &quot;Digging In The Dirt&quot;. It just seems to have everything good in it. Many of these songs are on his 2-disc &quot;Hit&quot; collection, but I could never get rid of this. It just seems made for people like &quot;Us&quot;.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Wow!  That's all I can say.  This CD set so wonderful because it is sequenced, for once, as the songs appeared live.  For instance the first disc contains the ENTIRE first half of the show.  Amazing!  Tell me that does not bring back memories. I saw the tour four times and let me state this clearly; this CD captures the pacing, the feel, and the sound of those shows.<br />I love all of the previous live Rush CDs, but SoH and ESL sound too produced.  Rio, on the other hand, sounds raw, relentless and energetic.  Is that not what Rush is all about?<br />There have been some negative reviews of these CDs, but the good outweighs the bad.  Believe me, you will be smiling from ear to ear when you listen and don't be surprised by an occasional goosebump or two.<br />The mix sounds like old, hungry Rush and it is clear that they are having a good time and playing their hearts out.  So go ahead and buy this CD, play it really loud, and remember what a great LIVE band Rush is.
B00000099Y|4.0|I'm no teenage fanatic that preaches &quot;Tool's&quot; greatness to everyone I meet, but these guys have got to be the envy of every other band in the genre. All of their albums are near perfect, and is simply some of the most powerful, smart, emotional, deep, and flawless music ever laid down. Only a few bands have amazed me as much: &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;, and &quot;Soundgarden&quot;. I love each other album of theirs, but &quot;Aenima&quot; might be the best. My only complaint is that a third of the album are &quot;interludes&quot;, non-songs that break it up, and are best heard only a few times. But the songs themselves are 5 star moving metal masterpieces.

B000002UJQ|5.0|No matter how many times I listen to OK Computer, I just cannot get over how incredible it really is. Way ahead of its time, the mixture of heavy guitars, light electronica and mellow vocals is a real delight to the senses. &quot;No Surprises&quot; ranks as my favorite track along with &quot;Paranoid Android.&quot; Might I also recommend the companion DVD, &quot;7 Television Commercials,&quot; which is pretty much a collection of all the videos.
020161622X|5.0|I've just finished the book. I love it very much!<BR>The book is full of golden sayings from the beginning to the end. Some of the principles are just in my mind, but I've never summarized them, when I found them in the book, I was very excited. Most of the tips are very short, it is impossible for the writers give more information about the tip, perhaps we can't get much &quot;knowledge&quot; itself from the book, but we can learn the way to get &quot;knowledge&quot; from the book. We Chinese have a proverb: It is better to teach a person fishing than give him (her) fish. Well, this books writers teach us how to &quot;fish&quot;!
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido's &quot;No Angel&quot; combines pop, alternative, and Celtic to creative this amazing unique sound.  Her voice is mindblowing.  She allows the audience to feel her emotions through her instrument, whether it's heartbreak, love, loneliness, or longing.  Her lyrics are written very close to her heart.  No drop of emotion is ever held back.  Her stand-out tracks are &quot;Here With Me&quot;(from the former TV show &quot;Roswell&quot;) and the smash hit &quot;Thank You&quot;(first heard on Eminem's &quot;Stan&quot;).  The album listened in whole give the audience an unforgettable heartfelt journey.  Such talents prove that she is one of the best artists of today, and that she'll continue to entertain the world for many more years.
B000092ZYX|4.0|I don't know why people around, don't understand what Radiohead is all about and write all the stupid stuff.  Hail to the thief is definately a good blend of different sounds, mixed with some very sharp and criticising words, in a sense of a metaphor.  Mixing of voices in the first two tracks is just fantastic.  Especially the high pick up of percussions at the end of track 2, stand up sit down, just blows one's mind.  I regularly hear Go to sleep, Gloaming (superb electronic loops and trashing and a sleepy psychedellic voice), There There (i believe they could have used better beats, but the song rocks), and a real surprise melody in A punch up in the wedding.<BR>Overall a must buy for a Radiohead fan.  Unlike Kid A, Electronic loops are used less here, but still the sound and melody of york and boys rocks.<BR>A true psychedellic band after Floyd.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I cant belive that anyone can talk bad about a band that doesnt care about what you think about them, and the strokes are just that with their new Album &quot;ROOM ON FIRE&quot;. It didn't dissapoint at all, and lived up to the hype of being the most anticipated albums of a rock group that can do no wrong. Sure all the songs sound like the strokes, but thats their style, and thats why we love them. Talk all the trash you want about them, because they dont care if they are the cream of the crop, and yet they still are.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Although enya only features on two of the songs on this CD, the counsul of elrond and the last track, may it be, it's still absolutely magnificent.  the whole score is beautiful and, in my opinion, the music is the highlight of the movie.  Enya was nominated for an oscar for her work on the LOTR soundtrack  and you can see why.  go out and buy this!  what are you still sitting there for? GO!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away has some of the most beautiful and colorful background, imaginative creatures and attention to fine detail I have ever seen in an anime.  In every sceen you can lose yourself in the world they portray.  Even the background characters are doing something fun or cute!  The movie is heavily based on Japaneese myth, so if you don't 'get it' -- well, oh well.  For those of us that do - it's an amazing tale brought to life!  The english voices are even bareable!!!  Well done!

B000089RVR|5.0|I am not too sure about you but Dido's latest CD definately has  much to offer. <br />Her own evocative style of singing still gives me the feel in her songs. As usual, White Flag is my favourite song in the CD. <br />Each songs has different energies to it, be it happy or sad. <BR>I particularly like Mary's in India and Stoned as well. Her voice is still as strong as ever.<br />If you ever like her previous hits like Thank you, Hunter, then Life for Rent another added album you should have. No surprises but both album are equally good!
B00000373U|5.0|Okay, Elliott Smith just died. Stuck the knife in. Well, here's his best album. Just know it blew a hole into everything else I was listening to in the late 90's. Either/Or still stands as the perfect anchor between the whispered confessionals of his 1st two albums & the big Brian Wilson productions of his last couple efforts.<br /><br />Melancholic but never depressing, Either/Or is chock full of the same kind of bittersweet hooks that keep people coming back to the likes of the Beatles, Big Star, Nick Drake & the Kinks. With an after hours mood straight out of The Velvet Underground's 3rd album.<br /><br />In terms of lyrics, Smith seemed to have that uncanny knack to accidentally stumble unto the kind of truths we're all searching for but are too self-involved to notice. \\"Between The Bars\\" might just be the epitome of all I'm talking about. Featuring a double entendre worthy of Cole Porter.<br /><br />Amnong my personal favorites are, \\"Say Yes\\" & \\"no name no.5 \\" Love that line, \\"got a broken heart & your name on my cast\\". It's the kind of thing that just hits the emotional funnybone. A sentiment that pretty much sums this guy up. So, leave all the eulogizing & rubbernecking to the popular press, this guy was no sad sack. And for my money this album is a classic.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol, Interpol, Interpol. I'm not going to drench you in comparisons of this band to other bands, but I will say that their sound is very unique. Forget who they were influenced by, it's all about who they sound like: and the answer is NOBODY. No other group today compares to the high quality of Interpol. When I listen to their album, I definately feel like I'm back in the dancing in the 80's. There are 5 songs on this album that I could listen to over and over and not get bored. They are:<br />Untitled - the opening track is well to do. A great instrumental song to start things off.<br />Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 - both songs are very good and very exciting. They go together like Adam and Eve or maybe like a Dog and Cat...<br />Leif Erikson - by far the most interesting song on the album in my opinion. I have listened to this song for an hour straight over and over, simply because it is a masterpiece. I cannot stress the fact that this song is the work of a genius. It's one of those songs where the lyrics are so perfect, all the while, the song itself is very enjoyable without becoming boring, tiring, or annoying. &quot;She doesn't know that I left my urge in the icebox&quot; for example presents some very slick words in this song.<br />Say Hello To The Angels - one of the best songs in recent years, without a doubt.<br />So if you really want to compare this band:<br />I hear The Strokes. I hear At The Drive In. I hear a bit of Billy Idol. I hear The Smiths, Morrissey and U2. I hear so much in Interpol. But to compare them to other bands is not fair, because they truly are an amazing band that deserves success forever because of this one album.
B000065VA1|5.0|This record carried me through my teenage years of frustration and isolation. Bare in mind I'm 19 so it's no distant memory. Anyway, I had been weaned on easy, lite music such as Air Supply, the Carpenters....stuff my parents listened to. This record was a shock that took me a while to get used to but once I did I was in for a real treat. I bought it for Big Time, that song in itself opened up my ears, and Sledgehammer, which I heard on a &quot;classic hits&quot; station (the song seemed out of its format too). I was disappointed at first when the tracks were &quot;wierder&quot; than those two but it didn't take long for me to appreciate the musicianship of Peter Gabriel<br />1&gt; Red Rain- The perfect teenage agnst song &quot;Red rain is falling down all over me&quot; well boo-hoo have a bloody sook! The atmosphere really captures &quot;rain&quot; (I know coz I used to listen to it while trudging with my schoolbag in the rain) and where his voice sings &quot;I am standing up at the water's edge in my dreams&quot; Abstract and magic 5/5<br />2&gt; Sledgehammer- Mad 80's pop tune. The bit where he goes falsetto &quot;heeey, I wanna be....&quot; shows he puts his all into it. The eccentric falsetto also reflects his eccentric personality- something I found reassuring being a bit of an outcast. 5/5<br />3&gt; Don't Give Up- I remember now I had heard this song on my parents easy music station. I never really listened to the lyrics, which, although about unemployment; I made my own for any problem I had with relating to my classmates. 4/5<br />4&gt; That Voice Again- Easily the most depressing song on the album, especially when he changes key &quot;oooh, I'm listening to the conversation&quot;. I was way too self conscious in those days and my mates would tease me about my voice. Hence the lyrics of &quot;judge and jury in my head&quot; and &quot;hear that voice again&quot; where affirmations of my self doubt. Good moping material 5/5<br />5&gt; In Your Eyes- &quot;inyour eyes the light, the heat. In your eyes I feel complete&quot;. Lyrics I couln't relate to. I still can't understand to this day why people talk of this being amongst Gabriel's Best from the album. I disagree- the weakest track for me 2.5/5<br />6&gt; Mercy Street- Took time to get it but when I did I loved the tune, the lyrics about &quot;the priest he can handle the shocks&quot; which affirmed my Catholic faith. The atmosphere also provided mopability, my folks jokingly passed razor blades through the door of my bedroom as I had this blaring full throttle 4/5<br />7&gt; Big Time- The best. The bass bit after big time as well as the wierd-soudning bit about &quot;a snow-white pillow for my big fat head&quot; was my idea of good pop. This was my favourite song for over a year. I would play it incessantly and &quot;bop&quot; along to it 5/5<br />8&gt; We Do What We're Told- my protest about the conformity of my classmates. Great stuff 5/5<br />9&gt; This is the picture- again the percussion and the wierd lyrics about falling snow (there's no snow in Victoria) takes me to a far-away world. Pure poetic fantasy 5/5<br />Music is art and art should do something to you. Stimulate ur mind with its beauty. That's what &quot;So&quot; does. Thankyou Peter Gabriel!
0064409422|5.0|I remember my 4th grade teacher reading this book to the class, as a treat, if we were good. I remember how much I loved it. I am buying it for my 10 yr old since I loved it so much, even now. I admit, I don't remember much except the sheer fantasy of it & how much it sparked my imagination as a child. It is a definite must for young dreamers.
B000065V41|4.0|I remember seeing this movie in the theaters and I loved it!<br />What a terrific Muppet adaption Of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. The casting was subperb and the DVD extra's a real treat too! The interview with Gonzo,Rizzo and Brian Henson was a very nice added touch that includes some behind the scenes info that we would never have known! I have to applaud the commentary track also as it includes alot of the secrets that whent into the making of this wonderful Holiday film!Four stars only due to the fact this was not presented in widescreen, but I enjoy this DVD all the same! If your a big Christmas movie fan and a Muppet fan, you will not go wrong with this DVD. The magic of the Holidays AND the Muppets live in this great holiday film!!
B00009ATKS|4.0|Scottish experimental rock band, Mogwai, have been releasing albums in 1997, all to acclaim in indie rock, but their latest release, the sarcastically titled Happy Songs for Happy People, is getting the band attention from the mainstream press. The music on this album is brooding and striking, and the band is often associated with the Icelandic quarter, Sigur Ros. Yet, Mogwai's use of more conventional guitar playing, even including distortion in some of their songs, separates the two bands from imitating each other. Mogwai's guitar riffs are beautiful arpeggios, with almost unintelligible, garbled vocals in the background. Unlike Sigur Ros, Mogwai's albums are not layered in mystique. The titles are in English, yet their songs have bizarre and somewhat silly titles like \\"Killing All the Flies,\\" \\"Kids Will Be Skeletons,\\" and \\"I Know You Are But What Am I?\\" The music itself contradicts the titles themselves, since the guitars sound bittersweet and restrained, especially when accompanied by a synthesizer or a piano. Its intensity is visible on the first listen, except it is more subtle and beautiful than it is flagrant or aggressive. Some of the songs even border on unsettling, such as \\"Moses? I Amn't.\\" It contains a droning synth bass that is haunting beyond belief, and the eeriness of the song intensifies tenfold when the string section (mostly consisting of a lone cello) enters. Happy Songs For Happy People is a fully consistent album, which defies the limited boundaries of rock music, and even \\"experimental\\" rock. Its magnificence is not compromised for inaccessible dissonance or for mainstream exploitation. Even at its heaviest, which is the final track \\"Stop Coming to my House,\\" Happy Songs For Happy People remains sincere but arcane, relaxing yet overly stimulating, brief but lasting. Listening to this album is a \\"happy\\" experience, even at its most emotional.
B000002IWQ|4.0|After roughly ten years of crafting slick synth/pop records of varying quality, Rush started moving towards a more organic approach with 1989's Presto and 1991's Roll the Bones. Those albums were still too polished and the vibe too neutered to pass for real rocking albums (blame it on producer Rupert Hine), and the band wisely passed over Hine in favor of the return of producer Peter Collins, who helped the band produce two of their previous discs. The result would be this album, Counterparts, arguably the best Rush album since Signals in 1982.<BR>Sonically, Collins does a fine job of capturing a much more exciting sound from the trio, breathing new life into a band that was treading dangerously close on becoming stale. The balance between all the instruments is great, especially with Alex Lifeson's guitars roaring back to life again after lying somewhat dormant for years. Listen to tracks like Stick It Out, Cut To the Chase, Between Sun and Moon, and the jazz/rock stylings of the instrumental Leave That Thing Alone, and you can hear a guy falling in love with playing all over again. Indeed, the whole band sound alive again. Even the sparse synthesizers are where they ought to be: far enough in the background not to tread on the three main players, but noticeable enough to add color and depth.<BR>Other strong tracks are the linear, bass grooves of Animate, the pensive 'love song' (!) Cold Fire, and the slightly schitzo number Double Agent.<BR>There are weak points though: the band had been falling into the 'power ballad' trap over their previous few discs, something Rush is not known. Here, they offer us two, Nobody's Hero, which is somewhat cheesy and contains rather forced-sounding lyrics from the usually adept drummer Neil Peart; and The Speed Of Love, which never really hits on all cylinders, sounding more like filler than anything else.<BR>Also, some fans detest the move into the use of backing vocals. I don't mind so much -- it adds a new dimension to the songs. (I just don't like the band using pre-recorded backing vocals in concert, which they do often). However, the pros outweigh the cons. This is a good album.<BR>So if you want a great example of latter day Rush, pick up this disc. You will not be disappointed. It ain't 2112 or Moving Pictures, but it's still a solid album that, on repeated listens, will have you hooked for good.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|After three years of no new material, and after some speculation that they may never make another record together, A Perfect Circle has released a new album, entitled Thirteenth Step. Essential, A Perfect Circle is the brainchild of Tool vocalist, Maynard James Keenan, and former Tool/Smashing Pumpkins guitar technician Billy Howerdel, except A Perfect Circle focuses more on atmospheric music than on heaviness and complexity. The band debuted in 2000 with Mer De Noms, which spawned the hit singles \\"Judith\\" and \\"Three Libras,\\" and sold over one million copies in the United States. <br />However, since their last album, the band has experienced some lineup changes. With the departure of bassist Paz Lenchantin (who went on to join former Smashing Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan in the short lived project Zwan), and guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen (who joined Queens of the Stone Age, but appeared on most of this album), the lineup of their debut was significantly altered. Replacing Lenchantin and Van Leeuwen, is former Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White (aka Twiggy Ramirez), and former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha. White played on most of the tracks on Thirteenth Step, yet Iha joined after its completion just in time for an American tour.<br />The band's sound has not changed drastically, relying on the detuned guitars, melodic vocals and ambience of their first album, but they also have expanded their sound as well. Songs like the 7-minute opener \\"The Package,\\" \\"Blue,\\" and \\"The Noose\\" still contain Keenan's distinctive vocals, textured guitars, and heavy drumming provided by Josh Freese, but it reflects more on bands like The Cure circa Disintegration, than early Black Sabbath or Jane's Addiction. Even songs like the first single \\"Weak and Powerless,\\" which strikingly resembles \\"Judith\\" off their debut, and the acoustic \\"The Stranger,\\" show a new side of A Perfect Circle, a sound they only hinted at on Mer De Noms. The band also covers \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me,\\" by the alternative band Failure. <br />A Perfect Circle are one of the few \\"metal\\" bands out there that keep the otherwise prosaic genre interesting and relentlessly innovative. It's another remarkable addendum to Maynard James Keenan's musical endeavors, and makes Billy Howerdel a prolific composer and a vital guitarist in the music scene. It even benefits James Iha and Jeordie White, who have kept a low profile since their respective bands severed ties with them; it gives the two underrated musicians a new breath of life in the music industry. Thirteenth Step is a massive leap for the band in terms of musical growth, and for the listener it gives them a worthwhile venture through its atmosphere.
0679735259|5.0|Over the past 15 years I have read more books on the Vietnam war than I care to remember... but this one is in a class of its own and I come back to it time after time. If you are new to books on this war then this is perhaps not the place to start as some knowledge and terminology is assumed. If you are looking for a historical account, this isnt for you either because its not a history lesson as such. If you are looking for a 'quintessential story' with a definite start and finish linked by a series of interconnected scenes, this isnt for you either because this book is so much more than that.<br />What Michael Herr does is beyond my powers of description... but he takes a pile of chaos and puts it on the page and somehow makes it work. This isnt about waving patriotic flags and beating chests and getting medals for being the only one to survive a suicidal rush at a machine gun. This is about the people involved, the mayhem they faced, the confusion of the whole deal and ultimately the great sadness and loss of war. Its raw and beautiful and easy to read. If you want to learn about the realities of the Vietnam war and are prepared to step outside to box, buy this and dont look back.
B000001EHS|5.0|This has almost all of Def Leppard's best songs. It is one of those albums that you can listen to again and again. Some highlights include &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me,&quot; &quot;Photograph,&quot; &quot;Love Bites,&quot; &quot;Foolin'&quot; (Best), and &quot;Armageddon It.&quot; (Second Best) Some other pretty good songs are &quot;Animal&quot; and &quot;Rocket&quot; although it doesn't have the longer version of &quot;Rocket&quot; which is seven minutes long, but much better. You must get this album, it is worth every penny.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is one of only three American bands that I can listen to and enjoy.  Evanescence's music is inspiring and well-done, and above all, the band has TALENT.  I highly recommend this.  Don't let stupid stereotypes keep you from at least giving this CD a try.
0385504209|5.0|I was recommended &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; by a friend of mine who said that in spite of its religious subject, it was a great read and a great thriller/mystery. She was absolutely right.<br />If you like thrillers but aren't into alternative religious studies, you will still like this book. &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; is so strong as an adventure story, you don't have to be into any of the main characters' favorite subjects to enjoy it.<br />It does help, however, to be interested by the mental twists and turns of the conspiracy theories, obscure history and anti-establishment viewpoints expressed here. It also helps to have a good vocabulary or a good dictionary -- the main characters are all academics, and they speak and think as such.<br />In a nutshell, this book is a great ride for the nerdier crowd, but still plenty adventurous enough for the regular thriller reader to stay tuned in.
B0000524CY|3.0|A lot of talent went into this trashy film.  Long flights of stairs, darkness, dogs, and psychiatrists are scary but there is also much unintended comedy - a priest who boxes and jogs and lights a cigarette just after his morning run deserves what he gets in this film; Mr Von Sydow's exorcism ritual must have had the cast rolling around clutching themselves in painful laughter;  and Ms Blair wetting herself in company goes down a treat.  Entertaining, but........
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I saw this film during a recent trip to New York and found it so totally uninteresting that I walked out.  Yes, it has plenty of impressive special effects, but there's no sustantive story to speak of.  This is a classic Hollywood example of FX and very loud sound superceding plot.  I found it a shallow waste of time.
B0000DJZAH|4.0|Hey, I'm as big a Who fan as they come, and I was certainly VERY excited when their entire catalog was remastered in the mid-90s.  I thought the reissue series was exemplary.  The sound was very good, and the bonus tracks were truly that...a bonus.  But now we've got the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" series, and I, for one, wonder where and when this will ever end.  Granted, the My Generation deluxe edition was a good idea, though poorly executed.  At least it was the first sonic upgrade that My Generation had received.  The Live At Leeds deluxe edition at least gave us the rest of the show, sporting the Tommy segment, warts and all (except a few noticable overdubs) for the first time ever.  Things started to go awry with the Who's Next deluxe edition, offering absolutely no sonic upgrade and very little new of worth over the excellent remaster of 1996.  In fact, the previous remaster actually sounds better.      So now, we get the Tommy Deluxe Edition, again with a second disc.  Supposedly this second disc offers some outtakes and Pete Townshend Tommy demos.  The real kicker - this is being released in SACD hybird, just like the Stones remasters of last year and the recent Dylan remasters.  SACD players are still relatively hard to find, and the actual sonic difference has yet to be proven to me.  The previous Tommy remaster sounds pretty good to my ears, and after the disappointment of Who's Next, I'll be surprised if this release sounds noticably better in the regular (not SACD) format.      We'll see.  Die-hard Who fans will will be forced to (and will) shell out the price of a double-disc to have the latest and (supposedly) greatest.  But where will it end?  Will they go back and remaster the entire catalog in SACD hybird?  Call me crazy, but I just think it's all getting a bit absurd.    I've tried to review the original 1996 remaster, but it won't let me, as it's combined the reviews together (bad idea), so I'm adding a postscript this this review.  The original 1996 remaster is actually a remix from the multitracks, and sounds EONS better than the stereo version here.  I can't comment on the 5.1 mix, because I don't have a receiver that can accommodate, but the stereo remaster, while true to the original mix, is not really much of an upgrade in sound to the original LP, and that's a fact.    And expensive.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Though millions of screaming fans may have played it while flipping through their latest delia's catalog, \\"Britney\\" showcased increasing irrelevance for America's fading pop heroine.  Relegated to the filler back-burner, Max Martin and Rami turned in middling, forgettable tunes for this third Spears compilation.  You might find yourself humming \\"Overprotected\\" if it stays under the thumb of the repeat button long enough, but it has none of the bombastic thrill of \\"Crazy\\" or \\"Stronger\\".  And speaking of bombast, \\"Bombastic Love\\" and \\"Cinderella\\" are downright tepid.  Rising hot young things the Neptunes turned in the staples here:  \\"Boys\\" has (in its album incarnation) a mildly sexy kind of arrogance courtesy of its house-ish beats and cocky lyrics-- though \\"control\\" is something Britney fails to project, now more than ever, unlike her always-commanding would-be role-model Madonna.  Of course, \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" is truer to the Britney persona, but the song's allure has faded over time, and frankly it never ignited as forcefully as her early singles to begin with.  \\"Anticipating\\", one of the less forced tracks, has some neo-disco appeal and prettiness, but Britney's whispery vocals and an underdeveloped mix hamper it from becoming truly memorable.  But predictably, the very worst tracks come from that maestro of music-murdering, Rodney Jerkins.  Yes, \\"I Love Rock'n'Roll\\" is even more heartily butchered than \\"Satisfaction\\" was on the preceding record.  Why Jerkins's services are still sought after is anyone's guess.  But as Britney abuses opportunity after opportunity to mature as a musical presence, instead of merely selling her stage image while disingenuously feigning ignorance of her pin-up status, we must ask why she should earn any further favors from her audience.  Plenty of song-sirens, from Shakira to Amber, offer more forceful, appealing, and in truth, booty-shaking music than our overpampered Pop Queen.  Like Marie Antoinette, she abuses the public trust while inspiring no confidence in her direction.  Let's move on to the next regime.

B0000C9V3T|5.0|I have yet to purchase this soundtrack, but upon reading reviews, I thought something needed clarification.  One reviewer remarked that &quot;The Lonely Shepherd,&quot; included on the soundtrack, is the song behind Uma picking the sword.  I listened to the track and guarantee this person is mistaken.  The song as Uma picks the sword is soft hammond organ with a beautiful soprano over the top, and it has been haunting me since I saw the film (three times).  I want to know what this song is and if it is on the soundtrack before I purchase it, so if anyone can answer, please post a review.  It is certainly not &quot;The Lonely Shepherd&quot; but I need to know what it IS and whether or not it's on the CD.

The Toltecs were an ancient group of scientists and artists that was formed to explore and preserve the practices and spiritual knowledge of the ancient ones.

To embrace and live each of the Four Agreements is to find yourself experiencing personal freedom--possibly as never before. The Four Agreements are:<br />Be Impeccable With Your Words<br />Don't Take Anything Personally<br />Don't Make Assumptions<br />Always Do Your Best<br />From the cover of the book:<br />Be Impeccable With Your Word: Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.<br />Don't Take Anything Personally: Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.<br />Don't Make Assumptions: Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.<br />Always Do Your Best: Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.<br />This book may be small in size, but it packs a hefty punch in terms of shattering personal illusions and opening up a path to personal freedom. I consider this book a must-have for anyone wanting to become more conscious and wanting freedom from personal stories and agreements that cause suffering.is book a must-have for anyone wanting to become more conscious and wanting freedom from personal stories and agreements that cause suffering.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Okay, y'all are soo worried about &quot;Lets Get Retarded&quot; and the disrespect its bringing. Okay  my point is ...<br />1. They did not make fun of retarded people in anyway, the used the meaning of &quot;retarded&quot; as dancing crazy.<br />2. At the beginning of the song they said &quot;In this context, there's no disrespect&quot; NO DISRESPECT y'all!!!! They didn't mean it like that.<br />3. Yeah, they shouldn't of used the words &quot;retarded&quot; maybe using &quot;lets get stupid&quot; would've been a better choice.<br />4. Still this album has great beats.
B000066F6H|4.0|Is it just me or is the music scene undergoing a Ed Keupper revisionist phase in 2000? The Dandy Warhols sound like the Laughing Clowns or EK & the Yard goes on forever. <BR>And now the Hives. They must've been to every gig The Saints threw in the Scandinavian reaches. <br />Ahhhhhh. The Saints at their peak were electric and the Hives capture that. It's Punk at the DIY and do it loud end of the spectrum. It's the same energy and youthful \\"work\\" ethic that '50's rock and roll was all about. It all takes me back to 77 when I heard (I'm)Stranded for the first time. CMON! AWLRIGHT! Or spotted The Stooges \\"Raw Power\\" album cover in my mates older brothers record collection. If it can take a sad old man like me back to his youth imagine ehat it could do for you!<br />The albums short and so it should be. So are all the Ramones songs. You should only travel at 10 tenths for small bursts. This really is a spot the infulence CD. You can hear and see The Damned in the film clips, see new wave in the dress sensibilities. Bits of the MC-5's, the Stones, the Buzzcocks etc etc in the sound (Can't hear the Beatles though as claimed by other reviewers). <br />There is only so many chords, so many killer riffs and things people want to sing about. <br />It's only rock and roll but I like it.
0783225857|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird was released in 1962 by Universal Studios. It is a drama in black and white with a running time of 2hrs./10mins. Directed by Robert Mulligan.  This movie also won an Academy Award.<BR>   To Kill A Mockingbird takes place in an old southern town during the depression.  Atticus, portrayed by Gregory Peck, is a lawyer. Atticus is a widower raising a son, Jem, portrayed by Phillip Alford and a daughter, Scout, portrayed by Mary Bedham. Atticus takes on the case of a black man accused of assaulting and raping a white woman. <BR>   The remarkableness of this film is how the children are exposed to prejudice, but keep their innocence and never become judgemental. The children's impression and admiration for their father grows throughtout the movie.  Atticus shares insightful things with them such as, &quot;you never really understand a man until you put yourself in his shoes and walk around in them,  also, &quot;it is a sin to kill a mockingbird for they only mean to please.&quot;  &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is enjoyable and educational and it explores stereotypical prejudices of the deep south with many emotional experiences. <BR>   I highly recommend this movie for everyone. <BR>   A bit of trivia--This is Robert Duvalls first movie. He has no lines in it, but has a high impact of emotions.
B00005JM1Y|5.0|This is probaby one of the funniest spy spoofs ever. Without question. I know many people argue Austin Powers was funny, but lets be honest here: Austin Powers went off on its own little tangent after the first one. Frankly I see very little correlation between Austin Powers and any James Bond film. Johnny English however, mocks Bond at every turn, making it all that much funnier. Atkinson, better known as Mr. Bean, actually speaks, and does so quite well. He is a master of physical comedy, and really just by facial expressions and actions just made me crack up. Its really something different in a good way.
B00000F169|1.0|Much has been written about this movie, so I will spare you any repetitions. Anyway, chances are you will be interested in Dark Star&quot; only if you already know it...<br />What I must mention is the DVD quality: On a scale from zero to ten it would rank minus 25! It is letterbox format and so poor that no amount of fiddling with my projector settings could make a difference. Grainy picture, lots of artifacts, washed out colours.. you name it, this edition has it. What a pitty.
B00000JPH6|4.0|I've always been a Jim Henson fan and I picked up this movie for that reason and for the nostalgia associated with it. <br />This movie is a story told entirely by puppets, though they are lightyears beyond the Muppets. The detail on the characters and in the world itself [all created by Jim Henson] is fantastic. The sets are all alive and vital with just enough movement to capture your eye and draw you into the world without taking away from the story.<br />The plot is driven by simple directives like Good VS Evil on the surface but there is more to the story than that. There are characters in this story that fall somewhere in between in the grey area where good and evil meet. That is the crux of the story. Good and Evil coming together to form one whole being capable of both.<br />It seems very deep, but don't be afraid.  This story is packed with action and adventure, mystery and love. Buy it. Watch it...over and over....<br />It's all in all quite wonderful to behold.

The more &quot;mainstream&quot; people will find interesting: &quot;Turn the page&quot;, &quot;Whiskey in the jar&quot;, and &quot;Tuesday's gone&quot;. <br />CD2 includes the &quot;classic&quot; Garage Days... and some live Motorhead covers. Good enough for me.
0060537639|1.0|This book appears to be lectures the author has given slapped together to make a book. so many of his points are repeated over and over that it became so annoying I couldn't even finish it. The author jumps to bizarre conclusions, gives incorrect information and even though he stresses his research over the years a lot of information is easily found on the internet. His attempts at humor are not funny, they are just strange. I also kept thinking after reading so many times that more information will be posted on his internet site, what was the big hurry to get this book out?  Also, why didn't he contact all these experts on the Chinese ship captain he researched until after his book was written? This book is just silly.
B000002HRE|2.0|hahahaha...<br />Well, if i had to choose between Load and Re-load, i'll probably go with Load. Re-load has a great start with &quot;Fuel&quot;, and Devil's Dance is also very good. But Re-load is a strange album, even more strange than Load, which i think was close enough to the metal genre anyway.
0399226907|5.0|This delightful book about a caterpillar's metamorphosis to a butterfly never fails to enchant and amuse children. The tiny, ravenous caterpillar eats everything in its path from apples to cherry pie to prepare itself for the chrysalis stage, and afterward emerges as a beautiful butterfly. While kids are fascinated by the story and magical process of metamorphosis, from egg to butterfly, he/she also learns about numbers, counting, colors and the days of the week. The illustrations are bright and cheerful, the writing is full of fun.<br />I bought this book as a gift for a friend's two year-old, and it has become one of her favorites. The size is right also. It fits perfectly into her small hands. And Mom is thrilled with the book's educational value, as well as her daughter's giggle's as she rereads this wonderful tale.<br />JANA
B00005JLYW|2.0|First off, I'll start by saying that I hated the first CHARLIES ANGELS movie. I thought it had absolutely no story and, aside from starring Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu, offered nothing noteworthy at all other than how bad I thought it was. So, of course I was hesitant to say the least to see the sequel, although I thought the trailers made the film look \\"fun\\".  That \\"fun\\" vibe (and Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz) is what made me eventually give the film a look see.  What did I think? <br />Packed with jump cuts, slow motion sequences, freeze frames, celebrity cameos (Bruce Willis, Robert Forster, The Olsen Twins, Eve, and more), song after song after song, and scantly clad women, the first thirty minutes of CHARLIES ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE are fun, exciting, and at times, even intentionally funny (something the first film never accomplished in my opinion). However, after the first thirty or so minutes the film begins to run out of steam. While the visuals are nice for a while, the film has no identifiable plot and the action and the visuals eventually become tiresome and repetitive. I like the style of the film and I thoroughly enjoyed the motorbike chase scene. One day I'm almost sure that director McG is going to make something that will blow me and everyone else away but this just isn't it. If the film had a thirty-minute running time I would have thought it was excellent but as a movie pushing two hours it had me constantly checking my watch for the time. While it would have made a great, kick a-- episode of the CHARLIES ANGELS television show it ends up falling flat as a film.<br />D+

B00008RV1L|5.0|Wow, that Patrick Bateman was sure a ladies man!  He just knew the right words to say to women.  You have to give a guy props for having a fiancee while calling up hookers for threesomes.  Too bad he was a bit on the loopy side.  Plus, for an allegedly straight man, he spends a bit too much money on all those skin care products.  Christian Bale just did wonders with his role.  The rest of the cast is pretty cool, including that chick from the movie &quot;Legally Bland.&quot;  &quot;American Psycho&quot; is a movie I'd totally recommend for that first date.  You'll be talking about it for hours after you finish watching it.  And you'll never listen to Huey Lewis and the News the same way again.

0385504209|1.0|For all of Dan Brown's &quot;remarkable research and detail&quot; I was lost at Chapter 3 when he &quot;skimmed south past the Opera House and entered the Place Vendome&quot; on his way to the Louvre.  The last time I looked, the Hotel Ritz was in the Place Vendome and the Opera House was several blocks north in the wrong direction from the Louvre.  So, why did the gendarmerie drive Mr. Langdon north from the Ritz around the Opera House, then  south  through the Place Vendome past the Ritz to reach the Louvre?  Applying the Magellanic Code of Circumnavigation, I have come up with three possibilities:  a) Langdon was really staying at the Ritz Best Western which is located north of the Opera House near the airport; b)2+2 really does equal 5; or c) someone didn't consult a map of Paris as part of the research for this book.  It sort of spoiled the rest of the story for me.
B000001C6M|5.0|This is a great first album by one of the most influential thrash bands in all of music history.There is some heavy guitar work here with lightning speed which we all love.The vocals are decent but definetly progress on later albums.Show no mercy is a great introduction to a great band.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
0385504209|5.0|Having never read any of Dan Brown's work, I found this one a page-turner.  Filled with historical, artistic, and mathematical allusions, especially to the expansive genius of Leonardo Da Vinci, it is also somewhat educational.<br />When I say the book raises great questions, this is not to say I have checked out every &quot;fact&quot; purported in the novel.  I haven't, because I'm not looking to this as a primary historical text!  Also, as an amateur student of history, I know it takes a while (sometimes forever) for even historians to agree about what is an &quot;undisputed&quot; fact in recent history, much less in early centuries A.D.!<br />After reading this, if you conclude that a egalitarian utopia perhaps existed before the Catholic Church, I think (as a self-described pro-equality Catholic woman) you would be mistaken.  That would seem unlikely.  However, on the other hand, it is ALSO highly unlikely that biblical editors in the early centuries somehow shed their political biases even when God appeared before them.  It makes sense that oft-male biblical editors(imperfectly) processed the divine message through a human mind born of that particular time and place.  So in a wonderful and unique sense, Brown is on point!  And this is a very RELEVANT insight( and one I rarely expected from a fun novel!):<br />Societies are never perfect.  Religions, however, OFFER images of perfection to which whole societies sometimes aspire.  Whoever controls these images (whoever edited the official Bible, for ex.), therefore, has more power than you might first think, because they assist us in forming ideals and imagining the possibilities of the way we could/should live.<br />So, if religion is symbolically that powerful -- could it be that, perhaps, just PERHAPS, a religion that lacks a symbolically equal, powerful woman will make certain things -- such as a female priesthood -- difficult to attain?<br />Also makes sense that something is missing from Christian symbolism.  After all, do you really think a religion that is borne of the Divine being (or at least mystic being) of Jesus Christ could be really so impoverished of any talk of basic male-female egalitarianism, justice?  Unlikely, so could it be that part of the message was just corrupted over centuries in the telling and re-telling of the message by the human, sometimes not-so-holy ones?<br />Thank you Dan Brown for raising questions like these (not providing hard and fact answers) in an accessible format.m.

B000001C6M|4.0|First off let me say that I am not a huge Slayer fan.  My first album of Slayer I listened to was Reign in Blood and I was very dissapointed.  After listening to a few songs of Show No Mercy I thought that I would give their Debut album a chance.  After listening to the first song I thought that I was once again going to be dissapointed, but I was proven terribly wrong by the 9 following songs.  The rythm work on this album is extremely powerful, close to being the best rythm work done on a debut heavy metal album.  The vocals and melody are nothing to brag about, but they far surpass those on Reign in Blood.  The lead work is also impressive,  normally I involuntarily plug my ears to any Slayer solo, but with Show No Mercy I could do nothing but bang my head.  I would definately recommend this album to anybody wanting to give Slayer a try, or to any thrash metal fan.  Show No Mercy definately showed the world the great potential that Slayer has.

B000006JPJ|5.0|I first became an Iron maiden fan after listening to the not so fan appreciated album &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;.  After hearing that album I wanted to quickly by as many of their other albums as I could.  After researching I decided that I wanted to make my first 2 album purchases be Number of the Beast and then Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  Well,  because of certain circumstances I was able to obtain mainy other albums, but never Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  After years of listening to the albums I owned I came to the decision that Iron maiden was one of the best heavy metal bands in the world, and that not very many albums could touch the greatness of work like Number of the Beast and Piece of Mind.  Then finally came the chance to purchase Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  Let me just start off by saying that this album is way underrated.  No words could really prepare for how great this album was gonna be.  For the first time I was able to listen to an entire Maiden album and like every single minute of every single song.  You don't only listen to SSOASS, you experience it.   Bruce Dickensons vocals are not only amazing, but flawless.  On this album he continues to prove that he has the most unique voice in heavy metal and that a voice can be just as powerful as any other musical instrument.  Steve Harris, like before, lets his instrument be heard unlike many other hardrock and heavy metal bands.  The Title track of this album is one of the best, and even though it stretches over 9 minutes, it never seems drawn out.  I'm not gonna get into any more of the songs because I would be talking on it all day long.  I'll just finish by saying that SSOASS is Maidens best work, and probably in the top 5 of greatest albums of all time.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|What upsets me the most about this cd, is not the music, and the artist itself, but the critics whose lack of what &quot;Real music&quot; was, is, and what it shall be. They should be glad to get the good music and talent that we got on this EP for the reasonable price, where as most artist definition of an EP is 25 minutes of jibber-jabber, unecessary filler, and god knows whatever else. Ok it isn't &quot;Mamas gun&quot;, or &quot;Baduizm&quot; it is another step of her creativity, and a different shade of what is repeatedly played on the radio. Half of these folks dont know about Donald Byrd, or The Sequence from back in the day, so therefore they cannot appreciate that Erykah Badu is paying homage to these great artist by either remake or sample of the old-school music. So before the criticsm and blasting of a truly great artist, do your homework, and open your mind a little more to what she is exposing our young brothers and sisters to. I'd rather hear this than thoing-thoing or get low 'til the sweat drop off my balls, which are both pointless and annoying anyday. So please, go support &quot;Real music&quot;.

B000063JZQ|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />William Shakespeare's (1564 to 1616) tragic play of \\"Macbeth\\" (written circa 1606) is set in an atmosphere that's visually dark.  There is only one brief moment of sunlight, just after King Duncan's murder by Macbeth.  The rest of the play takes place in shadows, in rain, in storms, or in the middle of the night.  Because the play is so short (it is, in fact, Shakespeare's shortest tragic play), it resembles a nightmare that's filled with witches, prophesies, ghosts, the fantastical, bloody murder, suicide, paranoia, and dread.<br /><br />Director Roman Polanski's \\"Macbeth\\" captures all this on film, especially the bleak atmosphere.  But there is even more since Polanski makes shrewd decisions when rearranging, eliminating, and embellishing scenes from the original play but he retains Shakespeare's beautiful language as originally written.<br /><br />We are shown Duncan's (Nicolas Selby) bloody murder by Macbeth (Jon Finch) and how he tries to cover up his crime by hacking up Duncan's guards.  His ordered killing of Banquo (Martin Shaw) is also shown.  Thus we absolutely believe Macbeth when he utters, \\"I am in blood / Stepped in so far, that, should I wade no more, / Returning were as tedious as go o'er.\\"<br /><br />Finch and Francesca Annis (who plays Lady Macbeth) make an attractive couple who are not too old to be ambitious.  Lady Macbeth's beauty convinces us that she could seduce a man to kill a king, and from one scene to the next, Finch's face hardens, tracing his transformation from hero to hell-hound whereas Annis' face softens from shrewd schemer to suicidal sleepwalker.<br /><br />The short Porter Scene just after Duncan's murder is fun to watch.  It effectively provides some comic relief.  And the final sword scene between Macbeth and Macduff (Terence Bayler) is thrilling and exciting.  You can see Macbeth's determination to win this duel (even though he has lost everything else) when he shouts, \\"Lay on Macduff / And damn'd be him that cries 'Hold, enough!'\\"<br /><br />Even though this is a dark play, the scenery and sets are visually stunning.

B000002JOH|5.0|This album is probably their best in my opinion.It is fast,heavy and brutal.All the songs are great with my favorite being mouth for war.If you liked cowboys from hell then you will love this one.When I hear this album I feel like getting in the mosh pit or benching sick weight.If you are feeling agressive then this is the perfect album to quench your thirst for agression.Pick this bad boy up today metalheads.
B00005JKC3|5.0|this movie certainly wasnt a bad movie it was a &quot;Hulk&quot; movie that alone is something that will never shake my attitude seeing the Hulk fighting tanks jumping canyons etc.. is something for everyone to see....the story on the other hand was actually pretty good yes it was long and boring when i first saw it but when u see it again you realize what you have missed the story was brilliant slow paced to build up the action for the appeareance of the Hulk this is a must buy on DVD Two Thumbs Up
B00006RINF|5.0|I listen to all types of music from 80s metal to underground rap and I must say Lacuna Coil is utterly amazing. If you like Evanescence, you'll soil your pants when you hear Comalies.<BR>This band deserves to be much more famous.
6305291446|4.0|The Halloween series, about the deranged psycho killer Michael Myers . It is an absolute favorite among modern day horror flicks. When the film Halloween H2O(Twenty Years Later) first came out it got some bad vibes of reviews but I thought it was great. I liked seeing what happened to Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis).
B000003S0I|5.0|Okay, first things first. This is probably the best Crimson album period. The amazing dynamics exhibited here by Fripp et al. is simply amazing.<br />The first track and its subseqent opening show signs of the influences of early minimalism. 1973 is really important in the development of minimalism, with Philip Glass, Brian Eno and Steve Reich and a couple of others at their apexes. Fripp's open-mindedness into new stages of harmony is seen from the get go in \\"Larks' Tongues Pt. I\\" and in the last track as well. <br />David Cross' immense neoclassical overhaul of harmony through strings is something really remarkable here. By far this is the most pastoral of 70s Crimson, simply because the \\"Cross sound\\" is so peaceful and seems to me a throwback to the folksy sounds that defined Crimson and a lot of other indie bands in the late 60s, when they were just beginning to find their musical language.<br />I must say that although the prevalence of minimalism is not as defined as, say, the \\"colors\\" albums of 80s Crimson, nevertheless the vision is there. It's kind of like looking through a crystal ball in the future of Crimson when one listens to this album; you can hear the band progressing into the bright new world of minimalism without necessarily forgetting the neoclassical and serialistic roots that brought them there in the first place. I can hear a little bit of every great modern composer here; first I hear Stravinsky, then Messiaen, and then finally Pendereki. So all in all this is one of the most intriguing albums I've ever listened to.
B000002H97|5.0|One word to describe this album? How about &quot;brilliant&quot;? while there are many other words that can summarize this cd, you really cant think of just one.  I was pumped about getting this cd from one of my friends, and i felt even better after i heard it.  Theres nothing better then a faster and harder song arrangment like &quot;enter sandman&quot;, &quot;sad but true&quot; and &quot;wherever i may roam&quot; while mixed with slower (but still powerful) songs like &quot;unforgiven&quot; and &quot;nothing else matters&quot;.  this album doesnt stop there though.  The Black Album doesnt sink at any point and i was glad that there were no instrumentals because those can get pretty boring.  this cd is worth the money and 5 stars.  even people who dont necessarily like metallica can easily find things in this piece of work that they will like.  i look forward to hearing the rest of what metallica has written and u should too.  ( i also recommend &quot;master of puppets&quot; and &quot;ride the lightning&quot;)
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I have read and enjoyed the reviews on this site many times but this is the first time I have felt moved to add my three cents in response to such gross misunderstanding of a great work. First of all, I am not one of those all-Neil-does-is-great sycophants. I thought Are You Passionate? was the most disappointing record of last year. I also have low regard for Silver And Gold,Harvest Moon,Landing On Water,This Note's For You and Old Ways.But let's call a spade a spade.Greendale is the best record of the year,probably the last few years and a solid addition to the top 5 or so by one of the most acclaimed and beloved artists in rock history.<BR>The point is reflection.Neil has always been known for the self-reflective statement.To a fault,if to judge by the legion of lame,self-pitying,whiny legions of imitators he has inspired in his wake.On this record,he has chosen to reflect himself through the stories of others.<BR>1st Criticism of this record by \\"reviewers\\": songs are boring,meander too long,all sound the same etc. Well,the point to this work is that everyone's life is a song. Everyone,not just flashy self-possessed rock stars of which Neil is very self-admittedly one of himself. And if the life is a song,should not the song reflect the form and feeling of the life itself?? The people whose stories are here told lead the slow,meandering, repetitive lives that we who live in big cities wish to stay as far away from as possible.Those who are bored by the songs may not wish to be reminded of the slowness and seeming meaninglessness of life itself.Can't really blame them,but every life dosen't have a chorus,dosen't resolve into the formulaic,dosen't burn out and not fade away in the accepted fashion. Because make no mistake,the \\"Granpa\\" who other \\"reviewers\\" have so ridiculed is just as \\"punk-rock\\" as Young's fabled song-heroes Johnny Rotten,Powderfinger and Bruce Berry.The fact that he happpens to be an 80 year old on a farm in the middle of a typical small town shouldn't cloud the issue.The surface of the record does seem boring and monotonous. But once you look past the surface INTO the characters, all the drama rises to the surface.The battles these people wage on a daily basis are just as dramatic, tragic and heroic in their \\"small\\" way as any household name you might care to mention.The songs reflect the time and place and the lives lived.The music is perfectly appropriate to that purpose.<BR>2nd Criticism: The music dosen't \\"rock\\" like the other Crazy Horse records e.g.\\"it's no Rust or Ragged Glory or Tonight's The Night\\". Duhhhh. Those albums were reflective of the time and place they were created in.For Neil to even try to replicate those brilliant works would be to tarnish them. It would be a facetious and wholly dishonest lie.Now I don't know about you but that don't sound like Neil to me. Even people who don't care for his work give him the respect he deserves for being the most uncompromised non-underground artist of his (or,for that matter,any)generation,commercially speaking.So what's the surprise?? In the 70's,when The Beach Boys and Joni Mitchell among others were liltingly lamenting the loss of ecosystems aplenty,Neil was unrelentingly inside his own head,offering debauched and decadent meisterwerks such as \\"On The Beach\\" and \\"Tonight's The Night\\".When everyone was throwing out concept LP's like confetti,Neil's were dangerously fragmented,mixing styles and viewpoints,sewing recording sessions staged years apart together into rough patchworks of ragged,groovy glory.So it's 2003,everyone's tired of Bono-Sting state-of-the-world mothers-of-the-brazilian-diappeared let's all weep and send in our five bucks to Amnesty International sob-moan.Concept albums are so far out of favor that many reading this might not know what the hell the concept means. So Neil in 2003 makes an ecologically-concerned concept album about people living in a boring little town on the edge of nowhere.Not only that,but it's an unrelentinglyunpolished slab of folk-blues sludge that sounds like nothing more than a rehearsal tape of Neil and Crazy Horse with a couple mikes aimed in the general vicinity.Again,what's the problem with that? Are the self-proclaimed Neil-freaks who have panned the album so out of touch with the aims of this artist who has moved them so much in the past by sticking to his goals and visions so fiercely? And do the people who hear the album as simply unfinished and boring really wish to listen instead to the peers of Neil, who endlessly flog their 30-year-old albums and endlessly preen and prance on HBO specials in a vain attempt to approximate their long-gone crdibility and talent? Or how about the artists who valiantly attempt to copy old styles and directions left by others long ago,principally trailblazers like Neil from the distant past? Do people wish to endlessly stroked,never confronted by their heroes?? Would they really shell out their $80 for the 30-year anniversary Neil-plays-\\"Harvest\\"-in-it's-entirety tour rather than hear him play new inspiring unfamiliar material??? I fear so.But then again,that's why Neil means so much to us.He don't do the things THEY do.So let's at least value it while he's here. He's trying to tell us something about us and them and himself.Is there any more telling or moving moment in Neil's work as when Gran'pa at the moment of his expiration cries out that a voice is filling his head,\\"Telll that guy to shut up! I don't know where the hell he comes up with this stuff!\\". This moment expresses the pain of the creation at the realisation that his fate is sealed,and the pain of the creator himself at having to fulfill his own mysterious plan.On and on,level upon level.There are many such moments sprinkled throughout the monolithic,daunting whole of \\"Greendale\\".But they are sprinkled,not shoved in your face.They must be looked for,searched out.They drift through your head,leaving a hazy residue not unlike the \\"Devil Dust\\" Satan himself drops intothe drink of one of the characters in the story. I think it's worth it,if one has the time,to seek these mysteries out,not to solve them,not to find the perfect answers,but the perfect question.I, for one,wish to be confronted and challenged by those I admire and I thank God for the dust sprinkled in my soul by the \\"Disappointed Angel\\" himself,Neil Young.
0446677450|5.0|This book is, as the title says, truely a must read. If you have any intrest on being financially wealthly after school, then this is the book for you. It gives you some common sense views that aren't so common and shows you how to make money work for you, not have you work for money. One more reason I love this book is because the writer himself was, at one time, broke. He had no money but still held to the ideals taught to him by his &quot;Rich Dad&quot; and he was able to pull out and create a multi-million dollar business.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers is absolutely hilarious. You can select any episode at random and you are guaranteed to laugh until it hurts. John Cleese is priceless as the henpecked , social climbing hotel owner and the rest of the cast all have their moments. The dialogue is witty , intelligent and quick. Cleese combines physical comedy with an amazing abilty to deliver barbed commentary and mutter insults under his breath.<br />This is really funny stuff that holds up well after repeated viewings.
0060930187|5.0|I've been trying to broaden my reading range by throwing in a few classics here and there.  One I had been interested in for quite some time is The Bell Jar.  And with the Sylvia Plath movie coming out soon, I thought reading this book might be a nice complement to that.  And what a real pleasure it turned out to be!<br />The Bell Jar does not read like a classic - \\"classic\\" being the term of very old books with very old language - the description I've always had for the classic genre.  This book has a very contemporary writing style, and despite it being written in the 1960s, The Bell Jar's topic of mental illness certainly transcends the generations and can be related by many people no matter when they read the book.  I absolutely loved it!<br />The Bell Jar tells the story of a young Esther Greenwood at the beginning of her mental decline.  She first recognizes its oncoming during a summer of interning at a magazine company in New York City.  Trying to fit in with the other interns, as well as dealing with boys and co-workers prove to be a struggle at times for Esther.  And later, when the real depression and suicidal thoughts set in, readers are invited into a dark and scary world, one created realistically and with honesty by Ms. Plath.<br />This book ranks high on my list of all-time favorites.  I'm so glad I read it.  From now on, if people want to read a classic (or a darn good book for that matter), I won't hesitate to suggest The Bell Jar.  It's fantastic!
B00009V7OL|2.0|It has been an increasing obsession in Hollywood that visual effects are the most important part of a movie and that to draw customers, all you need is a colorful dog-and-pony show.  The fact that so many of these efforts bomb - think of such recent duds as The Core or The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - is an indication that you can't have a good movie unless you have decent writing.  It's not necessary that it be GREAT writing (no one will confuse the Matrix with Shakespeare), but it needs to be at least decent.  Otherwise, you have a movie that, despite all its flash and fury, will be little more than another forgettable effort in a ocean of such works.  Which leads to The Abyss, a movie that looks good but is offset by poor writing.  Only because it is directed by James Cameron - of Terminator and Titanic fame - makes this movie at all noteworthy.  But if you disregard its well-known director, you find that this is little better than Wild Wild West or the Avengers (the movies, not the TV shows) were in their times.  <br />The story involves a submarine that is involved in a fatal accident after an encounter with a mysterious object.  A rescue crew is sent to retrieve any possible survivors and inspect the damage.  The crew is beset with problems, most significantly getting marooned two thousand feet below the ocean surface.  While Cold War tensions build above - along with a hurricane - the characters deal with their own problems as well as an alien presence that seems benevolent but has mysterious motives.<br />The movie looks good, but is riddled with story problems.  Even dismissing the scientific inaccuracies (after all, we're not watching this to learn), there are still all sorts of flaws.  The first hour is slow and the final portion is corny and preachy.  There are implausibilities from the get-go:  for example, wouldn't the sub crew have a better knowledge of ocean topography to avoid crashing into an underwater mountain even with the minor distraction of a mystery object and a brief power outage?  When things are at the darkest for the characters, there is always a miraculous intervention to save them.<br />Somehow, despite the many problems, there is enough in this movie to make it exciting in places and if you're willing to not think at all and just go for the ride, you might be entertained.  The problem is that you most likely will not be able to turn off your brain; as a result, like a cheap roller coaster ride, you may have had some fun, but when you look back at it later, you will find the experience to have been emptier than it first seemed.
0060278250|5.0|I love this series, but most of all, I love this last book, the culmination of the entire series.  Lirael is a wonderful character, whom I like to identify with.  I shared it with a teacher of mine, who's also a friend, and she loved the series as well.  It's well written, involving, and thoroughly addictive.

B0000C0FJB|4.0|The 3 discs here offer about the same material as the last live album. A tour of South America was well over due and it shows. This was the final stop on the tour. Some prefer just studio albums, as I do. But I will listen to it occasionally.
B00006RINF|5.0|Very atmospheric, and at the same time, very heavy.  I wouldn't be surprised to see them break big after Evanesence, but in all honesty, this is way better than anything on fallen.  Christina manages to give a truly good female vocal performance all the way through this album, without ever getting annoying (cant say that for Amy Lee)and the rest of the band just sounds awesome.  IF you liked Fallen, You'll LOVE this

B00009UW0N|5.0|This is by far the greatest horror film of all time. Without a doubt. The way John Carpenter scares the bejesus out of you is uncanny. It hasn't been duplicated. The score is one of the most terrifying things I have ever heard. And Donald Pleasance, and Jamie Lee Curtis are brilliant. The other actors weren't that good, but that doesn't take my enjoyment of the movie away. It is certaintly a classic, and is great on this 25th anniversary edition dvd. Anybody complaining that they left the TV version scenes out of this dvd is weird. Who needs them any way. They were taped like 3 years later and are pointless. Anyway brilliant movie, and the best horror movie ever made.
0060012358|5.0|I don't agree with the Reading Level assigned to this book (ages 9-12). Sure, 9-12 year olds could read it without problem. But, it's not a really a kid's book. It's just a very, very good book that's fun and light to read. It's also almost entirely independent of any need for prior knowledge of the Discworld. At a guess, I'd assign it a place just after \\"Moving Pictures\\" (purely based on the \\"Gaspode-the-Wonder-Dog\\" affect plus the fact that Maurice is mentioned twice in \\"Reaper Man\\" (which comes just after \\"Moving Pictures\\")). It's definitely a book to read. Anyone CAN read it and everyone SHOULD read it.

B0000D96NW|5.0|This year now belongs to Machine Head. Or rather, the revival of the old machine head. The Burning Red was good, but not great. And even for the most biggest fans of machine head, it was hard to argue that Supercharger was a good album. It had its moments, Bulldozer is crushing, Trephination is killer. But for the most part, Supercharger was extremely weak. Machine Head fans were in a state of dismay. What direction were the band gonna take after this album? Lets just say, they went in EXACTLY the right direction - back to the past!!!<br />Right from the start of Imperium - the albums epic opener, you know the old Machine Head are back. The riffs are the heaviest since Burn My Eyes, and rap-metal vocals are nowhere to be seen, er...heard. The guitar solos are back and better than ever. It seems being reunited with his long time friend Phil Demmel from the days of Violence, is the best thing thats happened to Robb Flynn for a long time. It is clear that with this album he has regained his love for crushing metal. And replacing Arhue with Phil, is the best thing they could have done. And Dave Mclain shines once again on this album with a flawless performance with the sticks. Although, its hard to recall a song where he hasnt been perfect.<br />But what sets this album apart from every other MH album, is that it combines Robbs melodic voice (something somewhat missing from MHs fist two albums,)with his deafening screams perfectly. All while reviving the heaviness of Burn My Eyes. <br />If you're slightly interested in metal, there is no reason not to buy this album. If your saying \\"i liked machine heads first two cds but now they are crap, so i wont like this\\" i challenge you to listen to 'Imperium' and not absolutely fall in love. <br />From the opening 'HEAR ME NOW' scream at the start of 'Imperium', to the 'FREE ME' scream at the end of the 8 minute closer 'Decend The Shades Of Night', this album will revive your love for machine head, and good old bone crushing metal. <br />This is Machine Heads finest hour. (...).
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Director Darren Aronofsky (\\"PI\\") has brought together a story of four people full of hope and allows them to slowly disintegrate into helpless shells.  The director's trick is that you continue to care about these characters throughout the film - not an easy feat.  Leto and Wayans (a nice dramatic turn for the comedian) are best friends caught up in heroin addiction.  Connelly is Leto's girlfriend who has her own problem with cocaine.  Throw in Leto's Mom, Ellen Burstyn and you have an unlikely collection of likeable people on their way towards self destruction.  We already know that all the characters are going to end up in hell or worse, but it's the way that the Director shows the quick and varied descent of each one that makes watching a car wreck seem like kids stuff.<br />Leto and Wayans end results are just as horrific as Connelly's final wasteland.  In fact, in this unedited version, Connelly has some nasty final punishment come her way.  Burstyn is the stand out performer here; with speed (diet pills) induced hallucinations and gritty realistic acting.  What starts out as a simple wish to fit into her favorite old dress turns into insane sequences of distorted reality and terrifying delusions (imagine a killer refrigerator threatening her - it's so real, it's uncanny).<br />Aronofsky's techniques are amazing, with fast cut editing and speed filled action sequences that instill the mood of a nightmare sequence.  There is simply too much symbolism, imagery and artistic endeavor to list here other than to say the scenes are breathtaking.  The dialogue and interaction between characters is genuine and each scene is carefully orchestrated to balance reality from fiction.  It's a hell of a story and a nasty ride, but worth every cinematic moment.<br />There are plenty of extras like Director's commentary (really nice feature), a making of featurette and deleted scenes.
0060537639|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst book ever written.  A five year old could have written something that would have had more historical merit.  Does he have to use the first person all the time?  It really does get old after all it is his book with his own material, so he shouldn't always have to say I this or I that.  We could logically assume that is how you feel Menzies without you saying I feel this way.  Then there is the fact that Menzies gives us NO solid evidence that the Chinese have been to America.  Where is the pottery like that found off the coasts of Africa and Australia?  Where is any evidence whatsoever?

0517123207|5.0|It is a crying shame that many reviewers have used this forum to try and critique evolutionary theory, making no references to the text at all and drawing on erroneous conclusions about Darwin in general.  The Origin of Species is most definitely the most important work in the field of biology, as it is the most succinct and well developed explanations of the unifying principle of the field, evolution via descent with modification.  I don't want to spend a lot of time explaining the theory or why a person should study it.  I want to explain who should read this book and why.  If you are looking for an introductory text on the theory of evolution you need to stay well away.  There are other better books.  In many cases Darwin's examples and arguments are outmoded or have been changed.  The book overlooks many aspects that are included in modern evolutionary theory, such as genetics, simply because Darwin did not know about them.  Natural selection as Darwin wrote it is one of the most effective explanatory theories in all of science but by reading this book you miss almost 150 years of the things it has explained.  It is also a flat out PAIN to read, they where much \\"wordier\\" in the 1800's and Darwin's English is rather stilted and formal, even compared to modern scientific writing.  So, who should read this book?  Any person who is an advanced student in biology (I read it the summer before my senior year) should be aware of how the modern theory of evolution was born.  You can't really achieve this without reading Origins.  I am aware of no better way of understanding evolution that to follow its development through time, beginning with Darwin.  And, if you don't understand evolution, you don't understand biology.  As something to read it is a classic, arguably the most influential work of all time.<br />A note on edition: this copy is the one I have.  I would suggest the facsimile of the First Edition found elsewhere on Amazon.  I don't know why the publishers felt the need to put the caricatured  human evolution (addressed nowhere in the book) on the cover.t the need to put the caricatured  human evolution (addressed nowhere in the book) on the cover.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|&quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot; is one of my favorite Xmas albums (I have a lot by the way).  The new tunes are fun annd catchy- some have lyrics that you wouldn't normally expect to hear on an Xmas song though (see &quot;This Year&quot;).  The classics are beautifully done.  &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; is my favorite.  I must agree that Christina does tend to oversing sometimes, but that's the only weak point.  I admit that I am a fan of Xtina, but that is not the reason I liked this album. Get a life people- holiday CDs are supposed to be fun tunes to get you excited for the Holidays.  If you want serious stuff from Miss. Aguilera, buy &quot;Stripped&quot; instead.
B000002LIX|5.0|If you listen to bands like Nickelback, Puddle Of Mudd, and Staind, chances are two things are the case: a), you're a complete lame-o and you need to stop letting mainstream radio tell you what to think, and b), you've never heard &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual.&quot;  This is yet another of those albums that I regret not having gotten a lot sooner.  Long before the bands mentioned above were making the genre look bad with their manufactured angst and laughably tedious songs, Jane's addiction were playing music that made the term &quot;alternative rock&quot; mean something.  If you've just heard the uber-catchy hit &quot;Been Caught Stealing,&quot; you've only heard the beginning of what the guys achieved here, as this album displays virtually limitless amounts of talent and creativity.  In the singular vocalist Perry Farrell and staggeringly underrated guitarist Dave Navarro, Jane's addiction were led by doubtless one of the great one-two punches of our time.  Dave's searing riffs and blazing solos are the kind that get stuck in your head for days after you hear them, and Perry's demented wail remains distinctive and instantly recognizable to this day.<br />What's most impressive about &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual&quot; is that its nine tracks are basically split into two different, if equally great, albums.  The album starts out with five hard-driving rock songs with a psychedelic feel, equal measures explosive, trippy, and funky.  &quot;No One's Leaving&quot; and &quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot; are the obvious standouts among this first batch of songs, but each one displays the band's own mix of manic, frenetic energy; intricate songwriting; and astounding technical skill.  These songs have the sound of a group of guys who truly enjoy what they're doing, a commodity that's becoming increasingly rare in today's mainstream climate.<br />It's after &quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot; that the band throws a series of changeups, showing a commitment to diversity and experimentation that truly separates the artists from the hacks.  The last four songs on this album are typically slower and quieter than their predecessors, but by no means lacking in power or craftsmanship.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|But it only offers a limited number of listens at one sitting because the style of all the songs are the same. i guess thats how all albums are. but other than that, this is their best album. its reallygood, and neone who is looking for a good new source for oldern style of music from the late 70s and 80s, this is the one to get. really good music
B00003CXB4|4.0|I hadn't seen this film since it opened 10 (?) years ago, so I'd forgotten just how great it is.  Everything from the luscious animation to the witty script (performed to perfection by the all-star cast) to the catchy score (OK, Scar's song is not so great) works like vintage Disney animation magic.  Hard to believe (according to one of the documentary extras) that this was the \\"B\\" film that the Disney animation department was working on at the time. (The politically correct, DOA \\"Pochohantas\\" being the \\"A\\" film!)  So why not five stars?  Personally, I find the DVD extras on this two-disc edition to be more pewter than platinum.  But the film is the thing, and it's absolutely wonderful.  Probably, in my opinion, the most all-around rewarding of ANY of Disney's late 20th century classics.

B000092ZYX|1.0|What do people find in this album? Mostly, I can't hear more than a musical void filled with the bleating of the synthesiser equivalent of robotic sheep. Is there really some higher truth between all those zaps and techno flashes? Or has Thom finally lost it? <BR>I'm told it takes a few listens to come to grips with this album. So, on the advice of an earnest work colleague, a devoted Radiohead fan, I spent several fruitless hours sifting this album for hidden musical sapphires. Did I like it? Well, I didn't really, and there were few sapphires, but I smiled and nodded blandly. But then I made the mistake of telling her I like their early stuff more. <BR>Immediately after I blurted out this badly thought out admission, I felt a curious icy chill creep into the air. The door of communication was now closed on me, and my musically insensitive brethren, except when she poked her head out several days later to let me know that Thom Yorke has really 'got it right', in the context of his profound understanding of, well, clearly pretty much everything. <BR>Obviously I had been lumped into the category of 'curious oddity - slight mental retardation'. Anything further I had to say was to be treated as if I was some odd lump of clay; not very intelligent and unlikely to absorb higher truth. <BR>So I thought, what is it in this album that delights the fans? If there really is so little goodness in this album, which is what my ears suggest, then why do people rave on about it? Is Radiohead the new cult of Osho? In the words of the Monty Python crew, perhaps Thom Yorke really isn't the Messiah.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is the new face of metal.  Perfect mix of singing and screaming, perfectly timed.  These guys are tight.<BR>Now a message to the Band: DON'T MESS UP YOUR NEXT ALBUM.  So many new bands change their successful sounds in subsequent albums and it almost never hits.  This album hits.  What you need to do is make a subsequent album that is more like an extension of this one than a new sound all together.  I downloaded this album but then went and bought the album to send the message to this band that this is where their sound should stay.
0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere is an outstanding book.  Neil Gaiman's detailed writing takes you into the book and makes it as if you're standing on the sidelines.  There is always something happening somewhere to keep you interested and the story takes unexpected turns.  It's exciting, scary, inventive, and full of imagination.  It's extremely hard to put down.  <BR> \\"Look, Gary,\\" Richard began. \\"Do you ever wonder if this is all there is? . . . Work. Home.  The pub.  Meeting girls.  Living in the city.  Life. Is that all there is?\\"  \\"I think that sums it up, yes,\\" said Gary.  Richard sighed.  \\"Well,\\" he said, \\"for a start, I didn't go to Majorca.  I mean, I really did not go to Majorca.\\"<BR> Everything in Richard's life is going well, until one night while walking to dinner with his fianc and her boss, he finds a girl bleeding on the streets.  He leaves his fianc and her boss, and takes the girl back to his apartment to get her cleaned up and let her rest.  Bad idea....or good?  From then on he is taken into a world of danger, betrayal, and strangeness, a world unknown to the everyday one he lives in. <BR> When I started to read Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere, I was expecting a story that would be drawn out, lengthy, but still have enough value to be interesting.  I love scary books, so by reading the jacket blurb, I decided I would try to read it.  I didn't expect to be able to feel what the character was feeling, whether it was frustration, happiness, or sadness, and that I could take myself into the character's mind.  I loved it, and I give it five stars.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Talk about coming out of left field.  Through the inpenetrable fog of Rolling Stone and NME articles concerned with either: 1) the 'new rock revolution' or 2) the fashion habits of Julian Casablancas, comes this towering, brooding messiah of a masterwork, aptly titled \\"Turn On The Bright Lights.\\"  It is indeed like lighting the brightest candle in thickest darkness--it illuminates and entices with every step and every song, and its insane hooks make the darkness at its heart unbelievably exciting.  It takes so many influences and turns them into an almost unrecognizable and unique whole.  The bubbling, aggressive bass playing is the most impressive attribute here, as it seems to spew thick black notes all over these melancholic tunes.  This is the album Radiohead should have made instead of \\"Kid A\\"--a post-modern, downtuned masterpiece floating upon icy sheets of guitar and chilled, tremorous vocals.  The track \\"PDA\\" is reason enough to buy \\"Turn On The Bright Lights\\"--a pounding rocker with bizarre lyrics (\\"we have 200 couches where you can sleep tight/grim rite\\") and entrancing chord progressions that give way to a soaring, atmospheric outro.  This is, hands down, the best album of 2002, and a masterful debut.

B0000E65V9|4.0|Good lord, people- not everyone approaches Springsteen's music with the level of obsession and sense of entitlement that his self-proclaimed &quot;diehard&quot; fans do.  This release is geared towards people interested in his music but who only want/need a sampling of his hits and a few essential album tracks.  I can't possibly own and listen to every album from every artist I've ever had an interest in, and for some of them, these Essential packages are very nice.  They're certainly better than a one disc greatest hits package, since they give a broader view of the artist's catalog beyond the obvious radio hits.  The third disc is clearly an enticement for those of us who own all of these tracks- taken for what it's worth, it's not a bad &quot;bonus disc&quot;.  Sure, I already have &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; and &quot;Missing&quot;.  Sure, there are tons of outtakes that I'd love to have.  But to believe that a release like this should be geared towards the fan who has every conceivable released track and is familiar with numerous outtakes through bootlegs is just unreasonable.  There aren't THAT many fans like that- I have to believe that most fans don't own bootlegs, and most don't have access to every rare track ever released on soundtracks, b-sides, comilations, etc.  The only legitimate complaint, I think, is that the 3rd disc likely has considerable unused space.  Who knows- it could always be tinkered with before the final release.  Or maybe this is a sign that another multi-disc &quot;Tracks&quot; set is on the way and that Bruce didn't want to use up all of his prime unreleased material on a bonus disc.  I don't REALLY believe that, but it's nice to dream...<br />The Essential set itself is interesting- I would have chosen different tracks, but it's impossible with an artist like Springsteen to pick a definitive list of songs that will please fans and newcomers alike.  I have no real complaints, and will look forward to hearing more remastered songs.Springsteen's CD catalog falls far behind that of other artists in terms of sonic quality, and hopefully this is a step towards remastering all of the albums.
B0000C9V3T|3.0|Ok, I know Tarrantino.  I saw Pulp Fiction, I loved the theme song...I bought the soundtrack....I HATED the soundtrack.  I only liked the movie....I saw From Dusk Til Dawn...it was oookay.  Other than that I haven't invested anything.  Until now. I saw Kill Bill.  I was rather blown away...not sure in a good way.  I realize it was a film much like old Black Belt Theater shows...but MAN I had to turn from some of the cheap gore.  As for the music in the film, I for once thought here was a line up that rocks.  I love the oriental flute work! I thought the fight music(that chaka-chaka-chak! stuff) was awesome.  The whistling was hauntingly annoying and addictive at the same time:P and that weird Incredible Hulk like music they would play when Uma get's that Killing Twitch...creepy cool:P  I just hope the CD is better than Pulp's was.  I am really tempted to get it, but you ppl here have mixed and what seem like differing reviews.  Thanks for the details; I'll have to make notes.  If you haven't seen the movie yet...don't write a review.  I feel kinda strange like Tarrantino must have used subliminal messages in that film...cuz as much as I was turned off...I am tempted to see it again:P  --OH and THANKFULLY Tarrantino didn't take his &quot;let's start at the end and finish at the beginning&quot; style to the extreme and end the movie's VOLUME ONE on a bad cliff hanger...I was seriously worried when the music got louder and the fight was just beginning.
B00008PW2E|5.0|SEASON TWO! SEASON TWO! SEASON TWO!<br />What am I to do with myself while I wait?!
B00005R1N3|5.0|There are a large number of horror films relying on graphic violence and cheap thrills in order to lure in viewers such as myself, and then there are films like Bob Clark's 1974 psychological tour de force &quot;Black Christmas.&quot; Foregoing hockey masked serial killers or shambling, meat eating zombies, Canadian director Clark rivets the viewer to the screen with this crackling tale about a college sorority house and a demented psychotic relentlessly hunting its denizens down. The director of this film has often moved freely amongst different film genres during his career, from bawdy comedy (Porky's) to Sherlock Holmes (Murder by Decree) to super intelligent infants (Baby Geniuses). We should all thank the horror gods that he made this film, however, because &quot;Black Christmas&quot; might just rank as one of the creepiest pictures ever made. After viewing this blockbuster, it quickly became apparent that many subsequent films cribbed shamelessly from Clark's objet d'art. If you haven't done so already, you need to hustle out and pick up a copy of this one soon.<br />&quot;Black Christmas&quot; takes place, predictably, around the Christmas season in a sorority house at a large university. The girls at the house all have their own nasty little secrets, little vices both major and minor that eventually emerge as the evening's madness progresses. The only hint of potential trouble at the start is a weird phone call the girls get from some guy screeching and squawking like a madman, which doesn't really concern them all that much because this guy has called before. The phone call did disturb me because it is as eerie as you could possibly imagine. Subsequent phone calls, where this guy screeches out a woman's name that the film never elaborates on adds additional chills. Who is this guy and what does he want from these young women? Sorority sister Claire is the first girl to go missing, causing her father to arrive on the scene and setting into motion a chain of events that rapidly claims the lives of several principal characters. The cops enter into the picture, and soon place a tap on that pesky phone in an effort to understand what's going on at the house. You can take it from here, but I will say the best thing about watching this movie on a DVD is that it lays to rest once and for all who it is making those crazy phone calls. If you have a pause or slow button on your remote, you can see the murderer's face. Moreover, the disc provides information about an alternate ending that leaves no doubt as to the killer's identity. The sound of a ringing phone over the closing credits was a nice touch.<br />&quot;Black Christmas&quot; does an excellent job establishing its characters. The primary sorority girl is Jessica Bradford, played by the delightfully beautiful Olivia Hussey, who soon reveals an unfortunate secret involving her temperamental yet musically gifted boyfriend Peter Smythe (Keir Dullea). Jessica's sorority sisters consist of Barb, a wonderfully foul-mouthed alcoholic played by Margot Kidder at the height of her beauty and SCTV member Andrea Martin as the homely looking Phyllis, a no nonsense young lady who can put even the obnoxious Barb in her place with a mere word. The sorority house also has a landlady of sorts, Mrs. MacHenry, a closet drinker with a flip attitude. John Saxon makes an eventual appearance as a cop, and Art Hindle appears as the boyfriend of quickly disappearing sorority sister Claire. There are quite a few recognizable faces in this film, which gives the movie a sort of instant familiarity. All of the actors do a great job here, with Kidder and the lady who plays MacHenry turning in the best performances. Clark works wonders with this stellar cast, often illuminating a specific character trait by relying upon a quick look or a single word. Watch the scene where a drunken Barb receives a brow beating from Phyllis as proof of the director's ability to sketch out his characters.<br />What I appreciated most about &quot;Black Christmas&quot; was the pervasive atmosphere of impending doom wending its way through the film. Six years before Stanley Kubrick used extended camera shots of the creepy interior of the Overlook Hotel in &quot;The Shining,&quot; Clark accomplished the same effect in &quot;Black Christmas.&quot; Those lingering shots of the empty hallways and staircases inside the sorority house instill a deeply disturbing sense that something ominous is just around the corner. Moreover, Clark made his film about as bloodless as possible, a rare occurrence in what is essentially a stalk and slash picture. Murders rarely appear in gory detail, but instead show up through quick editing cuts and by implication. Perhaps a rather tame film in terms of gore and an effort to slow down the pace in order to increase the suspense might not appeal to many modern horror fans, but I will take a film like &quot;Black Christmas&quot; over your typical slasher movie any day.<br />There are two DVD versions of this film floating around on the market right now, and unfortunately I watched the one with little in the way of extras. Make sure to look for the one with commentary tracks from Clark and Saxon on it. &quot;Black Christmas&quot; is a classic, although generally forgotten, horror film that belongs in the collection of every serious fan of the cinematic macabre. Besides, even if you don't appreciate the film, you can still learn the proper way to give a cop your new telephone area code!preciated most about &quot;Black Christmas&quot; was the pervasive atmosphere of impending doom wending its way through the film.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Boy, Fox sure has a bad history of cancelling good shows. First Dark Angel got the axe after a second successful season, and now Firefly, the heir apparent to Buffy, never got a chance to stretch its wings.<br />Oh well, at least Whedon's making a movie, and until then, the DVD will more than tide over rabid fans. This thing is packed, even going so far as to include the 3 episodes that never made it to the air. And this series just feels at home on DVD, as it was aired in widescreen format. It also features the best visual effects that have ever graced a television show, and an ensemble cast that, in a few episodes, accomplish what some casts never do in 100 (Friends anyone?).<br />The intriguing story of a ragtag group of outlaws in space makes for a compelling backdrop, and all the episodes play off of the characters, not just their struggles against the Space Mafia and the tyrannical Alliance, though these conflicts are certainly well done. Each character grows somehow over the course of the all-to-short series, and in addition to the story, there are some great action pieces as well.<br />The extras on the set are great. There are a number of episode commentaries, a behind-the-scenes look with interviews with the cast, as well as interviews with crreator Joss Whedon. Topping off the bonuses are original script drafts and some picture galleries. All solid stuff for collectors and casual fans alike.<br />All in all, if you missed the show, pick this up, as it's a fun ride and will introduce you to the characters before they fly to the big screen next year. If you've seen the show. . . well, I don't need to tell you that this set is well worth the money.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Based on the hit survival horror video game series from which it gets its name, Resident Evil does an adequate job of setting up a film franchise, but does practically nothing with the rich world available to it from its source material - it's all set-up and no follow through.  Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson does keep the pace brisk and the film uncluttered with too much detail, but a little more shading in the character department would have been nice, and having the two people who should know more about the facility than they actually do because of a nerve gas induced amnesia is just a dirty (and lazy) little cheat, narratively speaking.  Also the movie too often resembles other, better movies (i.e. Aliens, Dawn and Day of the Dead, etc.) instead of the games upon which the movie is supposed to be based.  Weak script aside though, the movie is visually exciting and fun to watch in its own way.  It just isn't the moody and scary experience the games are.  Hopefully the inevitable sequel will be an improvement and not another semi-successful missed opportunity.  For Resident Evil fans only.
0385504209|2.0|Flat, characterless, inaccurate and entirely guessable including the Isaac Newton clue, and the Da Vinci Code itself.  Jeez--I'm pretty dumb and I had it figured out.  Even as to the villain's true identity.  Who else could it be.  There was no one left!<br />Plus as one other reviewer noted, the whole novel somehow takes place in one action-packed 56 hour day!<br />In summary, the Church bites; Templars, Masons and Rosicrucians were weird and mysterious, everybody wants the Grail, no one expects the Spanish Inquisition, women are cool and even if you don't know how to have a relationship with one, it's nice to have a babe to go on an adventure with, even if you only get to kiss her on the last page.
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|I've only heard the single that they've put out.  It sounds EXACTLY THE SAME as the stuff that was on &quot;Is This It?&quot;.  I don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with these over-priviledged pretty boy Manhattanites.  If this is what's going resuscitate rock and roll, I think it's time to take out the feeding tube.  Stop trying to be cool by buying crap like this and listen to your gut feeling: that this is a horrible excuse for music.
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|Well, started out listening to their ultra-boring \\"12:51\\" track.  Ugggh, this is all they have to offer after 2 years of their overhyped debut album?  When I hear \\"12:51,\\" I ask \\"Is This It?\\" The song starts out with notes that sound like \\"Chopsticks\\" on the piano.  And the guitar is just plain repetitive and boring.  Saw these guys on the cover of Rolling Stone this month (10/03).  They have absolutely no presence of true musicians.  They appear to be a bunch of preppy college guys who have had fashion makeovers in attempt to make them look like music heads.  Well, this music fan is not fooled!  We have reached a very sad period in music history -- the Musical Ice Age.

In selecting books for my three-year-old twin granddaughters, I choose only the most frequently recommended.  The girls spend the night with me once a week and I always let them choose the books they want me to read at bedtime.  They choose different books each week but also ALWAYS want this one.  The story is very simple but there is something so appealing about it that it has remained their favorite for the past year.  They have begun reading it to me now.

I'm not sure many guys I know would care for it, but I can't imagine a female of any age not loving it.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|What was so funny to me about this film is that the creators proved that the first film was a fluke - as I always suspected. Their earlier ventures (script for Stallone's Assassins and the sluggishly paced, though stylized Bound) are more intune with what they're about.<br />I don't look for American movies from the fin du siecle to be enlightening or to shed any light on the human condition, and it was perposterous IMHO for people to find that kind of insight for the first film. Proving my point about lack of comparative religious studies in our schools.<br />This film lacks any kind of coherency, and stuffed several 10+ minutes (redundent) fight scenes to demonstrate how much money they can spend creating special effects that WILL be used better in other movies.<br />American movies took their cue on how to do second and third films from Lucas' original Star Wars trilogy, but the Wachowski Brothers (like Lucas himself and suprising Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill) don't have a clue on how to end a film that's designed to have a sequel. One doesn't just stop a story, bring some resolution to what you have already presented AND set-up the next film... which will be highly anticiapted. Anybody remember their feelings at the end of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK? What's going to happend to Han Solo? Good Christ! Is Vader reallly Luke's father? Will Luke finish his Jedi training with no hand? But in Matrix: Reloaded, does one even care about what's going to happen to any of the characters? ooohh, Zion is in trouble. so what? We never emotionally attached ourselves to them. And no one died, or even got close to dying. If this is about a war, then people who the audience cares about needs to die.<br />Personally, I would have killed Trinity. Permanantly, then Zeo can actually FEEL something when he takes revenge in the final film -- which I'm not going to see.<br />People expected some sort of continuation mystery for the first film, I hardly expected that and I was still disappointed. Completely.ted. Completely.
B0000D96NW|5.0|Burn My Eyes + The Burning Red = Through The Ashes Of Empires!  This could be the best Album in Machine Heads History.  Burn My Eyes was great, and this one is right up there with it.  The Cd starts out with one of the most explosive songs of there career, IMPERIUM.  Clean intro into increadibly heavy riffs, and then the song is finished off with some good old speed metal.  This Album is packed with awesome songs like Imperium, Bite the Bullet, Left Unfinished, In the Prescence of my Enemies, and Decend the shades of Night.  This album is a must have for any Machine Head fan.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This long-anticipated DVD release is based off the material from the Italian DVD release that has been circulating in Europe for at least a year.<br />The listed Aspect Ratio of 1.77 indicates that it's been enhanced for 16x9 screens, thus is presented in the original cinemascope.<br />As for the film itself, it's Leone working at the top of his powers. Everything he learned and turned inside out about the western during the Man With No Name trilogy, Leone exploits to great heights.<br />Performances and excellent - particularly Henry Fonda. How come mondern cinema icons won't play dastardly villians when they're career moves into that second stage. Claudia Cardinale holds this film together as the woman targeted by all sides.<br />A suprising turn is Jason Robards as Indio, he's youthful maniacal performance as the escaped bandit give the film the kind of flourish and panache you just don't see anymore - maybe because a seriously skilled actor of Robards caliber wouldn't play in the blood-fest like this; too bad though, would love to see someone like Anthony Hopkis a role like this.<br />If you've seen the movie before and want a DVD version, you'll definitely pick this up. If you haven't seen this before (wow), buy it sight unseen -- you'll enjoy it. The opening scene is worth purchase price!!!!
B00006879E|4.0|Maroon5, a band that started playing about 10 years ago, just made it big with their hit song:Harder to Breathe. But on their CD:Songs about Jane,I don't see any reason why they would not became famous with any of their other songs off their CD. I was skeptical at first, but when I heard them for the first time from my friend, I instantly fell in love with their music. Their drum beat (played by Ryan Dusick) is very simple however, James Valentine (guitar), Jesse Carmichael (keyboard), and Michael Madden (bass) come together to make the simple drom beat work. On their CD, there is mixture of up beat songs and slow songe like my favorite: Sweetest Goodbye. Some people would say that Maroon5 is rock while others say it is a little &quot;pop&quot; punk, but in my opinion I say it is a little rock. So in my opinion, Songs About Jane by Maroon5 deserves a 4 out of 5 stars.

He manages to stop the  bombing and save the girl.<br />It's an excellent book in the traditional Lee Child way. The tension is tight and the fast. Jack Reacher is a person who is realistic and so are the other characters in the book.<br />Enjoy.
B000002U82|4.0|When reading all the previous reviews I think one could be quite confused on whether or not this album really is worth buying.  Some reviewers glorified this album, while other deprecated it.  I stand more in the middle; I can understand why many people can't appreciate it and why some will become inthralled by it.  This is mainly because many people are only attracted to music that satisfies immediately, while the people who listen a little deeper and try to see where an artist is coming from will find so much in this album.<BR>    When I first listened to Pink Floyd I didn't really like it; I guess because it was a little to &quot;out there&quot; for me.  Then, because I listen to all types of rock music from classic to metal to progressive and instrumental, I saw how vital this album was in the evolution of rock music and music in general.  As my mind opened up to more types of music, the odd rhythms Pink Floyd used- 7/4, etc.- and the interesting sound effects only made the music richer and more interesting.  With this said, I think anyone who appreciates music that doesn't necessarily conform to mainstream standards and likes something a bit different, this album will satisfy greatly.  Also, I don't want to forget to mention that along with this uniqueness there are a bunch of songs on this album that are solid rock tunes that any rock enthusiast can appreciate.  Lastly, I agree with some of the other reviewers that this may not be Pink Floyd's best album ever, but it is vital in understanding them and their music, and how they influenced so many other people who came after.  It grows on me with each listening and every time I realize that without Pink Floyd many later great albums and bands would never have come about: Dream Theater, Fates Warning, Queensrych-the progressive rock genre.  In other words, buy this album.
B00009UW0N|5.0|It's easy to pick apart this DVD for what it DOESN'T have: the director's uncut version, the &quot;original&quot; shades of certain colors in the picture, etc.  But the truth remains that John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween&quot; is still the slasher film to beat.  Unlike the not-so-subtle &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; movies, &quot;Halloween&quot; relies less on gore and more on suspense to terrify an audience.  Jamie Lee Curtis, then barely out of her teens, rightfully earned her title as the &quot;scream queen&quot; as Laurie Strode, the babysitter who comes face-to-face with Mike Myers, a psychotic masked killer who just escaped a psychiatric ward.  The DVD has been re-released for its 25th anniversary, with a decent 5.1 soundtrack (Carpenter also composed the music).  Many pick apart the picture because the colors are &quot;off.&quot;  This didn't bother me, and it didn't lessen the viewing experience.  I was just happy that the picture is clear with hardly any print flaws.  The second disc includes a detailed documentary that runs for almost 90 minutes and has interviews with the filmmakers and the cast.  This documentary is almost worth the price of the DVD, in my opinion.  We also have the spooky original trailer as well as a few TV and radio shots.  It would have been nice if this disc also had the TV version of the movie so I could compare the two, but that's just a small gripe.  &quot;Halloween&quot; spawned several sequels (none were directed by Carpenter, thankfully), and none of them come even close to topping the original.  No questions asked, &quot;Halloween&quot; is a must-have for any movie buff.
B000092ZYX|4.0|First off this album is good, but not great like their past work. I think this is probably the worst album out of Thome and company. Saying that this album is still quite enjoyable. Radiohead made their name by creating great pop ballads and they  cemented their place in history through their ingenius  musical experimentation. Since this album features neither of these Hail To The Thief kind of comes off as &quot;the same old thing&quot; as strange as that sounds when talking about Radiohead. But when the band is Radiohead &quot;the same old thing&quot; is not exactly  bad. It means its good not great. If you're a Radiohead fan this album is a must own. If you aren't a fan you're better off buying some of their earlier work. I've heard these sounds and I've seen these tricks. Still though I love this band and support anything they do. There are of course some great tracks on this album, but don't expect to be blown away. Radiohead aren't learning anymore and Hail To the Thief is the proof. Good but not great. One last thing all of you who are jumping down this kids throat for not liking Radiohead need to grow up.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I really wanted to feel that Matrix Reloaded would be a great movie. The problem was that I felt that I had left the world of the original film and entered a video game. The characters are all there but somehow they became Superman clones overnight. <br />What little of the plot there is becomes increasingly confusing due in large part to the fact that what the audience gets is half a movie. Maybe things will be revealed when the final chapter of the trilogy comes out in early November. As the movie opens the machines are drilling towards Zion and Neo must find a way to prevent this attack. We go through the usual machinations of surface plot: Neo must find and rescue the Keymaker who will show him the way to the door to the core of the Matrix where he will be forced to make a choice to save the world or to act in his own self interest.<br />For the most part however the film presents fight scene after fight scene each more elaborate and CGI created. While the wire-fu is interesting I get the feeling that I've seen it all before and don't really need to see it again. The centerpiece of the film is a freeway chase scene that seems to go on forever. The movie is not bad but in the whole is not as great as the sum of its parts.<br />The DVD I viewed presented a crisp picture and soundtrack. Credit once again must be given to director of photography Bill Pope and composer Don Davis. While the set boasted of many special features they really did not amount to much more than extended promotional materials. Particularly bad in this respect were &quot;The Matrix Unfolds&quot; and &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; game promos. The usual making of feature &quot;Preload&quot; was worth a look and so was the detailed Freeway Chase Scene featurette if your interests are inclined that way. Perhaps the best part of the special features section was the spoof of the film for the MTV Movie Awards which is  presented in its entirety.<br />All in all woth a view but we're keeping our fingers crossed that the third chapter will be as great as the promise of the first film.
0393057658|4.0|After taking a statistical model development class in graduate school, I was intrigued by the thought of statistical analysis applied to baseball.  A classmate recommended this book to me.  Michael Lewis does a good job, if only by accident, of uncovering a story that's not just limited to baseball.  Here's what I got from the book:<br />* Changing the culture of an organization takes years to achieve and, for change in behavior to occur, constant enforcement and encouragement of the right behavior has to exist from top to bottom.  <br />* Not everyone is willing or able to adapt to radical change.<br />* Information is the key to market opportunities.  Just as important is the ability to analyze the information and make a decision based on the analysis -- even if the decision is later proven to be wrong.  Over the long term, inactivity and maintaining the status quo is much more damaging than making risky decisions.<br />* Doing something the way that everyone else does it will not necessary lead to success in a crowded marketplace.  Different paths from the norm must be taken.<br />* Make decisions based on data rather than &quot;gut instinct&quot;.<br />* Those that believe in the status quo and tradition are generally the most difficult to persuade even if definitive evidence supporting a different view exists.  Outsiders are effective at bringing about change because they value legacy the least.<br />I would have given this book 5 stars, but I was constantly annoyed by Michael Lewis' implication that only those toting bachelor degrees from Ivy League schools are intelligent enough to accept the use of statistical analysis or that only the smartest go to Ivy League schools.  I don't know whether Lewis attended an Ivy League school, but throughout the book he was always quick to point out whether a character went to an Ivy League school.
B000068FXR|5.0|This album is just as strong as the &quot;BIG 3&quot; (Crime of the century, Even the quietest moments &amp; Breakfast in America). In fact, It's my favourite! How can you not be hooked in by &quot;Easy does/Sister Moonshine?&quot; The rest of the album flows very well. There may be no big hits but that dosen't mean there isn't great tunes througout this cd. How &quot;Another man's woman&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; didn't become hits is beyond me! Just get it. You won't regret it.
B00009XITP|4.0|Amanda Bynes stars as a young American girl named Daphne whose mother fell in love with an artistocratic young Englishman in her youth but who was separated from him by family and social pressures.  Daphne has dreamed of being reunited with her father, and finally she takes things into her own hands and decides to run away to England to find him.  That's not difficult, as he is running for Parliament and he is campaigning everywhere.  Daphne discovers that he is soon to be married to a snobby young woman with an equally snobby daugher, but she doesn't let that deter her as she pursues a relationship with her father.  Predictably, this high-spirited young American is not well-suited to life among the aristocracy and lots of mini-disasters occur as her father tries to introduce her to English society.  The potential step-sister and step-mother do everything they can to undermine Daphne's efforts, but predictably this movie has a happy end.  This is not Academy Award stuff, but it does make for a pleasant evening's viewing.
B000002P2W|5.0|Coming after the synthesised glory of QUADROPHENIA, and the camp excesses of the TOMMY movie and soundtrack. Pete Townshend began to feel like the Who were just trading in on past glories. All the clichéd targets had been reached, so what was there left to prove? Not comfortable with the title of Rock Icon, Pete seemed to retreat into a period of self - scrutiny and damnation, bringing forth BY NUMBERS, as a result. Some say that this is not an rock opera like TOMMY, LIFEHOUSE, or QUADROPHENIA; it isn't, but the songs are linked by the underlying themes of treading water, feeling old and the whole fake ness of the rock industry. I love this album for it's beauty, anger, humour, and music. The bonus live tracks are just a cherry on top. Next to WHO'S NEXT and the deluxe edition of LIVE AT LEEDS, WHO BY NUMBERS takes up a treasured place in my CD collection. Have another listen to this underrated masterpiece; you might just like it as well. <br />SLIP KID - After some steady Keith Moon beats and a Pete Townshend count-in, this rocking track gets things underway in fine style. An old man finally comes to the realisation that he's been rebelling for far too long with no result. There is no easy way to be free and the younger generation will take up the struggle with the same futile result. Roger Daltrey sings the part of the old man with resignation and the young man with passion.<br />HOWEVER MUCH I BOOZE - The track Roger refused to sing lead on. Pete basically tells us that he is a miserable alcoholic, with the booze only being a temporary painkiller. Around this time, Townshend proclaimed himself and the Who to being in a creative rut and his fear of becoming an oldies act. Stardom did not fit well with Mr. Pete Townshend in 1976, and the lyrics proved it. Pete sings with a venomous edge in his voice.<br />SQUEEZE BOX - Single lifted from the album. A bouncy little number full of cheeky double entendres. The banjo playing adds a rural touch. Apparently it did not take Townshend much time to master the `squeeze box'. Great vocals from Roger. This track and  DREAMING FROM THE WAIST became concert staples.<br />DREAMING FROM THE WAIST - `A dirty story of a dirty old man' whose spirit is willing, but who can no longer muster enough energy to do anything about it; he dreams of the day these urges will vanish. The only track, besides SQUEEZE BOX, to make the regular concert set list. Townshend later disowned this track saying he `hated playing it live'. Keith Moon's drumming once again proves he is the consummate rock drummer, accenting the lyrics rather than just keeping the beat. John Entwistle's bass lumbers and pirouettes like an extremely agile rhino.<br />IMAGINE A MAN - A ballad, which tackles the themes of stagnation and repetitiveness, but also offers a chance at rebirth. Roger Daltrey at his most tender. Townshend offers up some spiritual lyrics to go with the self -pitying ones.<br />SUCCESS STORY - John Entwistle's satirical spin on the rock industry is an obvious lightener to the album's many `dark' tracks. The Ox even includes a little jab at Who mythology: \\"I will go far if I smash my guitar\\". The `fairy road manager' part is priceless; I still laugh every time I hear it. The world lost a underrated comic lyricist as well as a master bass player when Entwistle passed away. Not a filler track as some reviewers have classed it, but a song that fits easily into the concept.<br />THEY ARE ALL IN LOVE - Another song bemoaning the status of the Who as rock dinosaurs, unable to produce any revolutionary to the rock mix. Townshend portrays himself as a boozing jukebox, only in it for the money. Unlike SUCCESS STORY, the satirical knife cuts sharp and deep on this track. It is interesting to note that the rest of the Who were perfectly happy with who and what they were, particularly Roger; and this lead to conflict between himself and Townshend (but this was common anyway!). Beautiful piano work dulls the biting lyrics a little. Note: the `farting noise' Roger makes is to indicate a magazine whose name they couldn't use for fear of litigation.<br />BLUE, RED, AND GREY- Another pain killer with lovely banjo and brass mix with vocals from Townshend about how he loves every minute of the day, unlike some of his friends. This was a track that the producer included on the album against Pete's wishes (who probably wanted to hold it for a solo album). it may not fit with the album's concept, but it helps lightens the tone, and gives everyone a break from the sadness and cynicism.<br />HOW MANY FRIENDS - A common complaint among the superstars of today: who are my true friends and who are just the hangers on and backstabbers; and after years on top of the music heap Pete can't really tell the two classes apart. Another strongly sung, piano driven ballad with a supreme vocal by Daltrey.<br />IN A HAND OR A FACE - A rocker about running in the same place, getting nowhere and changing nothing. Some reviewer have likened this track to a suicide note, because of the lyrics: \\"Ain't it funny how they all fire the pistol at the wrong end of the race.\\"<br />SQUEEZE BOX (LIVE) - The first of three bonus live cuts from a Swansea gig starts with a typical faux aristocratic introduction by the always-genteel Keith Moon; leading into a supercharged rendition of the current hit. No banjo present, but Townshend's power chords do more than just compensate.<br />BEHIND BLUE EYES (LIVE) - After informing the crowd that Keith Moon will not be singing (and creating, hilariously, an audience chant for Keith's QUADROPHENIA solo piece, BELL BOY), the band launches into a spine tingling rendition of the WHO'S NEXT power ballad , BEHIND BLUE EYES. Limp Bizkit be damned, this is the only way to play this song.<br />DREAMING FROM THE WAIST (LIVE) - Even better than the studio version. The agile bass work by Entwistle is truly breathtaking, leading to Townsend's `rigor mortis' quip at song's end
0425129616|4.0|Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie's long-running character, is introduced to the world in this book.  He is a Belgian detective who is living near Styles, a large home owned by Mrs. Inglethorpe.  When Mrs. Inglethorpe is killed, Poirot is asked to help solve her murder.  The detective works with his friend Hastings, who is staying at Styles, and he methodically interviews each person in the house to ascertain the identity of the killer.  Poirot pays fastidious attention to every detail and painstakingly pieces together a solution, much to the consternation of Hastings, who is more impulsive and emotional when trying to solve a crime.  This book marks the beginning of a long-running series which has attracted fans for many decades and is a good example of Christie's wonderful &quot;whodunits&quot;.
B000001ELF|4.0|I recall the days back in '78 when I turned 9 years old and I got all four of the Kiss solo albums for my birthday ... lucky me eh?, looking back now I couldve saved the family the $$$ of the purchase of the other 3 albums if I had only known then what I found out soon after.<br />Anyhow back to the story/review .... back in those days I didn't have any particular liking or bias towards one Kiss \\"character\\" over another, I just loved their songs (okay I admit I always thought Ace's costumes were the coolest ... but thats besides the point) ... but after listening to all 4 solo efforts I found myself in an unusual position that I never had been in before ... I actually got that sick/embarrassed feeling when listening to Gene Simmons and Peter Criss' solo albums ... in particularly Genes rendition of \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\".<br />Well, when I finally put on Ace's album (2nd to last ... Paul Stanleys I listened to last) I found myself playing it over and over and OVER AND OVER AND ... well, you get the idea! :)  Especially the opening song \\"Rip It Out\\" ... which is by far my favorite! By the time I went to play Paul's album I just couldnt help but figit and basically say f&*k it and put Ace's album back on.<br />I have fond memories of air guitaring in front of my family's huge living room mirror to the likes of Rip It Out, Snow Blind, Ozone, I'm In Need Of Love, and Fractured Mirror. Funny that I no longer need to air guitar them but can actually play them :) But I digress.<br />Anyhow, there was no prejudice going into these solo albums ... its just that I happened to fall in love with Ace's solo album, which I CANNOT even come close to saying that about the others. In true metal-head mentality I can honestly say the other 3 \\"suck ass ... he he huh huh .. Beavis\\" .... okay, Paul's wasn't THAT bad ... but its was ruined after hearing Ace's.<br />Getting all that out of the way I have one thing to say ... and most of you wont like it ... BUT ... I always have and always will absolutely HATE the single \\"New York Groove\\" ... I'm sorry but its total cheese ... yes, I did get that embarrassed wrench in the gut feeling after hearing that song .... I dunno why ... but thats just the way it is. It has something to do with how the word \\"Groove\\" is sung in the chorus ... just bugs the hell outta me.<br />All in all though ... the BEST of the four ... by FAR!
B00005JKC3|3.0|Dr. David Banner was a scientist working for the military on a project to create a perfect soldier. But he aspired to improve his own biology and so tested his discoveries on himself. Inadvertently, the resulting cell mutations were passed on to his son, Bruce. 30 years later, Bruce (Eric Bana) is an accomplished biologist himself with no memory of the fate that befell his father when he was a boy. When a lab accident exposes him to heavy doses of gamma radiation, the effect on his already abnormal cells is unlike that of a normal human. When he becomes angry, Bruce is transformed into something possessed of rage  and great strength -a creature that intellect cannot control. When the military learns of Bruce's metamorphosis, it becomes obsessed with destroying this creature whose rage can unleash such terrific destructive forces.<br /><br />&#34;Hulk&#34; is based on the &#34;The Incredible Hulk &#34; Marvel comic books, which were also the basis for the 1970's television series of the same name. I haven't read the comic books, but I saw the television series, and &#34;Hulk&#34; doesn't remind me of it in the least. The comic book and the television series were both episodic, whereas the film has to confine itself to only one story. That, in itself, limits the character of Bruce Banner tremendously. There is some good stuff in this film. The relationship between the father's ambitions and his son's fate is interesting. Eric Bana is well suited to the role of Bruce Banner, but unfortunately he isn't given much to do. The first half of the film has a surprisingly slow pace for an action movie. It lingers on details that really aren't necessary to tell the story. This is not entirely bad, but it is bound to be off-putting to an audience that expects an adrenaline rush, as are the subdued personalities of Bruce Banner and his colleague and love interest Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />The appearance of the Hulk, itself, is problematic. The creature is an entirely digital creation. It doesn't look organic, except perhaps for its face, and it stands nearly three times as tall as an average human. In other words, Hulk's appearance is an obstacle to his credibility. Sometimes his expressive eyes succeed in reminding us that he is a man. At other times, his physique and antics are so spectacular that he loses all connection to humanity, and the audience loses all connection to him. At this point, the film is not succeeding; it looks a lot like one of those old alien invasion movies where the military gangs up on some giant monster from another planet. And &#34;Hulk&#34; falls into the &#34;computer game trap&#34; that so many modern action movies do: The digitally enhanced fight sequences look like a video game instead of like a movie. The present state of digital effects reminds me of the early generations of photographic special effects: hokey. &#34;Hulk&#34; is just a very uneven film.

B000002JSJ|4.0|considering that Robert Plant sang the whole album in a wheelchair and jimmy Page did all the guitar overdubs in one night and it doesnt contain any John paul jones keyboard its still a great album. It contains some of bonhams best drumming.  Achilles last stand is one of the best zeppelin songs ever. the weak songs are candy store rock and Tea for one [probably the worst song they ever did, its a poor mans &quot;since ive been lovin you&quot;]. Plants vocals arent his best and you cant really understand his lyrics at all on most songs. Overall though it is still Zeppelin and you cant beat Hots on for nowhere, royal orleans and Nobodys fault but mine. this is a straight ahead rock album.
0385504209|5.0|I just finished reading it. I give a lot of clout to books that simply compel me to keep reading. This book did that and so much more! It opened up another world of history to me that I had never been exposed to before. And it did it masterfully, in a mystery/suspense/thriller that is incredibly well written. It will leave you on the edge of your seat, and you won't be able to put it down until you're done. I've been very sleep deprived the last few days. I would recommend this book without hesitation!

B0000AXE8I|1.0|The original Matrix was a rip-off in terms of sci-fi originality, but the sequel is even worse.  In fact Reloaded has nothing original about it.

Funny how some people can become filthy rich by selling &quot;ideas&quot; they probably got while inhaling.
B00006RJHG|4.0|This is a fine little film, but hilariously overpriced. When they cut the cost in half (currently about $27), it will be worth everyone's while to check it out. Until then, forget it.
B0000047G6|5.0|I have 3 Lp copies of this CD. All in terrible state. I spinned these lp's hundred's times. Arrangements by Oliver Nelson are splendid. Numbers like step right up and walk on the wild side are worth 6 stars. Bravo Jimmy, this must be your best album ever.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|First I have to say I don't understand why so many reviewers were down on Mama's Gun.  So it didn't contain a lot of radio playable hits, but it had lyrics that made you listen and beats that let you groove when you wanted to.  I was hoping for more personalized lyrics on this album, and it just doesn't really deliver.  I don't understand what all the raving is about, because I have to agree with the previous reviewer who said this isn't underground.  Underground is Me'shell with her deep funky beats and thoughtful lyrics, who doesn't seem to be pandering to commercial radio.  Underground is Cody CHesnutt with his crazy lyrics, off-kilter delivery, and low-tech production.  Underground is conduction band Burnt Sugar playing a mix of rock, jazz, and funk --and sometimes in the same song.  Underground is Talib Kaweli, or her man Common rappers, who can be funky and political, but not jack-boot dogmatic.  Underground is music that falls outside of definitions and expecations to some degree.  This is a very commerical CD, and that's the disappointment in it for me; the material is way too familiar.  Basically it's a decent vibe album, the kind of stuff you listen to when you just want to chill.  I know that it wasn't put together to be a &quot;serious&quot; studio album, but the promise of something different doesn't really come through.<br />Erykah Badu has more talent than is displayed here.  Let's hope that with the EP out of the way, the really good stuff is on it's way.  Now, I'm not a hater.  Love &quot;Back in the Day,&quot; especially Lenny Kravitz's contribution of a funky guitar riff....wish he'd do more of that on his own stuff.  &quot;Bump It&quot; and &quot;Danger&quot; stand out as well.  Everything else just kind of blends together.  And I'm so tired of cameo songs, and studio tricks.  Can't we just get the primary performer to do their own thing and leave it at that?<br />Only a must have for die hard Badu fans.  Not sorry that I bought it, just wish there was more meat on the bones.re was more meat on the bones.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Behold, the greatest musical in film history ever made, with one of the best portrayals of envy within man, and the universal brooding music of Mozart, the man and his madness. Brilliant and delicate, with touches of dramatic human confabulation, along with a masterful dominion of the image and sound, convey is: truly, madly, humorous kinky, tenderly deeply. Released in 1984 and winner of 8 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Milos Forman), and Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Amadeus belongs to the other kind of musical that doesn't uses the music to tell a story, instead it tells a story about Music, this time it happens to be the story of one of the highest enlightened Geniuses of all human history, Salzburg's precocious composer: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791). <BR>The truth of authenticity, the music behind the man, and the man behind the music. Based on play by Peter Shaffer, the story uncovers the mean intentions of Antonio Salieri (brilliantly performed by F. Murray Abraham), who awfully discovers that his long wanted godlike talent has been bestowed upon a buffoon not worthy of such a gift, he encounters a childlike man that is both vulgar and ordinary, this is Mozart (performed by Tom Hulce with great talent and deep Insight of the character). Salieri's jealousy quickly turns into a vengeance against God for denying him the touch of grace, he will harm God's creature, commending The Requiem (Unfinished), at Mozart's funeral, tribute to himself and his now hatred monotheism, kill him and be purified, AAAAAHHHHHH Salieri has been finally touched by God.<BR>A perfect transcendent screenplay, Milos Forman uncannily composes all the necessary elements in their right space and tone, the cast (perfectly chosen) become the faces of the factual historic characters (you'll never take apart Tom Hulce's face from the real Mozart), the already legendary performance by F. Murray Abraham, compels the virginal side of the purest love for music, along with the filthy tremors of the envious ways, Salieri is shown at is fullest human emotions, a magnificent reference work. Filmed in Prague, utilizing real historic locations of the life of Mozart, the film creates an atmosphere of music frenzy and soft repression of artistic creation, along with the exquisite costume design, and of course, a magnificent conduction of Mozart's music by Sir Neville Marriner (dissection by musical exposure), Amadeus is far more than a complete canvas of the genius creation, is a whole experience of tenderness and myth, and that unique quality of the best story telling that embraces the viewer towards smooth and touching glimpses of the human comedy, is ever cinema has praised a historic figure and despised another one with a sympathetic opinion, Amadeus is king, with a valuable lesson in vengeance; Victory! <BR>Even though Amadeus is an unlikely film for a Director's Cut, the new 20 minutes additional footage enriches the movie without hurting its pace, adding more splendor to the viewers eye (2001 New digitally transferred). The Making of, on disc two (over an hour of material), shows every aspect of the creation of this Masterpiece (the whole cast and crew was gathered for this documentary DVD), the simultaneous audio track by Milos Forman and writer Peter Shaffer is good (but lacking of consistency), anyway the new version is at the level of its feature (Also, a Limited Edition Collector's set, comes with a beautiful presentation of the film and a third disc), a great opportunity to watch again this jewel of Cinema History with all the enhanced visuals and audio to please you in your comfort at home (The first DVD version did have a great transferring of the movie, 5.1. Dolby Digital, an alternated audio track with only Mozart's music and some production notes, offered a great choice).<BR>Mozart was among the most versatile of all composers and wrote masterpieces in all the musical forms of his time: symphonies, concertos, chambermusic, operas. All his music sings and conveys a felling of ease, grace, and spontaneity as well as balance, restraint, and proportion. Yet mysterious harmonies contrast with its lyricism, and it fuses elegance with power. Not only do his compositions sound effortless, they were created with miraculous ease and rapidity; for example, he completed his last three symphonies in only six weeks.<BR>Mozart died on December 5, 1791; five minutes before 1 am, After being blessed in front of the Crucifix Chapel of St. Stephen's, Mozart's body is buried in a common grave in the cemetery at St. Marx, leaving an immense legacy of inspiration and grandeur of the music composition, Amadeus is a consequence of that legacy, an extension into the visual / audio pattern of filmmaking, to inspire more with its beautiful romantic ideal of the life of the music genius, only the best, not meant for the uneducated ear.

B00003CXE7|4.0|Written in the classical fashion of the Hero's quest (the old way of Hero stories, for whom their fall from grace is the journey to revenge and redemption), Gladiator brings back the charm and violence of the so called Roman Empire, with its self indulgent blood thirst, and thankfully away from all the Christian topics (commonly surrounding the genre back in the old days), it is about the thrive for power and payback for the sins of thy beloved, even if it is your brother or sister, revenge conveys into the motif to kill for the masses, the most popular events in the Empire, played all over the realm, lasting for long centuries. The ones about to die salute, there for when applauding, you give then back their dignity and will to overcome the other Gladiator, the crowd decides their pardon or kill, and so the Arena is brought back to satisfied the need for such an entertainment, the mother of all blood sports, and the mob's red torn ideal of entertainment, Hail Caesar!<BR>Gladiator was intended to be only an appealing summer movie for audiences all around the world, but it ended being much more. Honored with 5 Academy Awards (Including Best Picture), the film revive a genre that had been forgotten for more than two decades, and almost 40 years after the last gladiator movie (Spartacus, 1960), intrigue political, and huge action spectacle are again the Odeum of Dark Blood and deceive, towards the Emperor's son, to overcome the uncanny mighty thirst of manipulative will over the people, to be their father, and consume the sister's love, twisted and rising over an splendorous dry atmosphere of dust and red water. <BR>Wisely choreographed, and visually breathtaking, Gladiator uses the camera and sound maximum to blend the action / adventure angle around factual characters (Marcus Arurelius and his son Commodus), but away from their factual life realities, Maximus is the favorite Son, and Commodus the unmoral blood, where the story is to much alike, or to much a coincidence with its predecessor, The Fall of the Roman Empire; Stolen or Homage?<BR>Ever since Blade Runner, Ridley Scott hasn't been able to rise the directorial quality that made him initially a young promise in the film industry, with Gladiator he came close (not matching the excellence level of his first 3 films, Gladiator is his best movie since Thelma and Louise), Scott's direction is elegant and visually rich, along with a pace that allows the story develops without any hesitation, the result values by own merits, from Germania to Rome it self, the landscapes are enhanced and enlightened by a magnificent photography that brings all the beauty of the surroundings, (Gladiator loss Best Photography against Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). The amazing visually effects made possible the breathtaking grandeur of Rome, specially in its beating hard, the Coliseum, shown as it had never been seen before, the 360 degrees shot of the Gladiators entering the Arena is the visual climax of the film. Massive fights against barbarians, or strategy to survive the recreation of the battle of Cartage, the choreography stands approaching with realism and sense. Russell Crowe brings freshness to the all to used classic Hero (who's unbreakable in his believes of moral and honor), wining the Academy Award for Best Actor (even though Crowe's performance is excellent, his character was the most simple of the nominees, there for, he didn't deserved the praise). The supporting cast shines also, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus, also brings something fresh to the also all to used pusillanimous villain. A short appearance by the late Richard Harris (one of his last films), in the indispensable Marcus Aurelius role, gives elegance to the cast, the also late Oliver Reed, brings sharpness to his last role: Proximo. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla does an O.K. job.<BR>Gladiator posses one of very best music scores made in the last 30 years, composed by the great Hans Zimmer and the legendary Lisa Gerrard, thescore is an absolute masterpiece, fresh, strong, solid, and complicated, (unfortunately, Gladiator's score loss the Academy Award against Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, an score that is nothing more than nice). <BR>The DVD edition comes in a great transferring, widescreen edition with DTS 5.1 surround sound, and the excellent DTS ES 6.1 surround sound. The extras are worthy of watching them several times (I love the Trailers), specially the great documentary made for this DVD, Gladiators; Roman Blood Sport, gives more data and insight about this fighting class. A whole combo is what this version is. <BR>Maybe not the best film of 2000, Gladiator is a great visual experience, certainly one of the best films of its year, and a great come back for the genre.
B000000JO3|5.0|Excerpts from my diaries: DAY 5 -- 23 OCTOBER 1981 8.53AM. `I've been listen to the Minor Threat ep for four days straight. The sun is shining through the shades of my window on what must be a glorious summer-like day. I've been self-incarcerated in my suburban prison cell room for what seems like forever, and will not be let myself out again until midday; four days of solitary confinement. How can a white suburban youth of seventeen resist this record? It is impossible. I will change my religion. I will have no religion. I will worship Minor Threat. I will not worship anyone. I will turn inward, and to my friends. This is the Western world in the twentieth century, not Turkey, not Nigeria, not Iran, but the USA. I will not be trapped by conformity'<br />TWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER -- OCTOBER 29 2003, after 22 years I am still listening to Minor Threat. Are they the best punk band in the world? Did they invent hardcore? They certainly perfected it, didn't they? Or was that the Bad Brains? Who cares? Life seems like a perjury trial lasting forever, and good music makes it tolerable. At least this music, which is so impassioned. Perhaps without it I might have turned into a violent criminal. If you don't get this record, you have no right to criticize me, or especially punk rock from Washington, DC, or the USA, circa 1981 through 1983.<br />Peace.
B00000J2PH|5.0|This album is the best, but Carole needs a pedicure badly.
B00000I8UK|5.0|I cannot for one minute believe that there haven't been more than a hundred master and doctoral dissertations on the subject of this record. How can I do it justice describing it in this short review? Impossible.  It influenced me musically, philosophically, and spiritually.<br />I first heard it at the tender age of 16. Other jazz I've heard or owned at that time was either of the straight-ahead variety, or fusion such as Miles Davis' \\"In a Silent Way\\". In no way was I prepared for this.<br />At first I couldn't make sense of it all. In my mind, it was too complex, too cerebral, and too noisy. And a bit scary. After a few listens (OK, quite a bit more than a few) I started to understand their vocabulary, and I was hooked. I searched out other \\"avant-garde\\" jazz albums. Many were very good (especially Eric D.'s other albums, and lots of J. Coltrane), but none came close to the musical epiphany I experienced with this album. None of them combined the bent lyricism with the musical genius encoded on to the disc of Eric Dolphy's \\"Out to Lunch\\". Actually, the vinyl grooves, it was quite a while ago.<br />What more can I say? Give it a chance. It is nearly impossible to judge it solely on the mp3 samples offered above. If you are already a convert to the free jazz of the 1960s, and you do not own this album you're going to lose your membership, no doubt about it.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|With their second release, The Strokes have once again managed to keep modern rock on life support with an uncompromising, full-tilt record complete with Julian's trademark distorted vocals and some confident takes on the classic rock vibe from the rest of the band. The songwriting is almost identical to Is This It?, and the overall sound creates much of the same result. It would be hard to differentiate both records if you just stumbled upon the band for the first time. On Room on Fire, standout tracks like Reptilia, Automatic Stop and Under Control prove the band is one of the most important groups out today. I am hooked, and this CD won't be leaving my stereo for a long, long time. If you loved their first record, don't hesitate to pick this one up ASAP. If you haven't heard Is This It?, then go buy both CDs and play them back to back. Rock is alive only because bands like The Strokes are making their brand of music.
B00005TPKD|5.0|You knew it was bound to happen. Any time an egomaniac writes a review; eventually self-absorbed ramblings and delusions of grandeur (complete with opinions) are bound to crop up. Despite the fact that I am, of course, a non-conformist and a tortured artist (of course), I will comply with this stereotype and throw out my scribblings for the entire world to see (or at least the three people who read this review -- you know who you are). Just nod and smile.<br />I've pretty much accepted that this is one of the greatest psychedelic records every recorded. And it's given me a sudden burst of energy in the last day or so. Hopefully things are going to be a bit more streamlined, easier to find and easier on the eyes once I come down (yeah, yeah, it took me quite a while to get over the mental images). I figure since the new mastering might or might not be better than the import LP I own; I should give it a chance. So I might as well just focus on that. Besides, I know you all are just dying to hear about my life, aren't you? Aren't you?<br />Fine, be that way. See if you're on my Christmas card list any more.<br />For the uninitiated, give this album more than a few listens before expressing your opinions in these (web) pages. And for goodness (or worse) sake, don't just judge it on the miniture audio chips, er, clips offered above. After completely absorbing this album, you might find yourself in a totally different frame of time and mind when you eventually find your way back. Or perhaps you will have turned into a substantial, sinuous, organic diffusion of matter. Multi-hued, of course, but no doubt influenced by the sonic intimidation that can be injected into one's being.
B000089RVX|2.0|The first 2 songs-the ones on the radio-are a fluke.  The rest of the CD is banal.  Their sound is cool, but contrived and not put together properly.  The lead singer's voice is strained sounding-which is straining to listen to.
B00003CXXM|5.0|I did NOT want to see this movie.  Quite frankly, up until two weeks ago, the last thing I wanted to see was another movie with Matt Damon in it.  However, after seeing this movie, I'm ready for some more!<br />This movie flat out rocks.  You've got spies and covert action going on.  You've got explosions.  You've got your guns, your shootouts, your car chases, and of course, the ladies.<br />Of course it's not the most original idea, but sometimes you just want to see people running around shooting at eachother.  At least I do.  Check it out.
B0000C8AVM|4.0|This is definitely essential music.  It's just blood...on the tracks.  There is something bloody beautiful about that.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|good solid effort by one of my favorite bands. i was however hoping for something alittle more distanced from thier first album. this and IS THIS IT could have been a double album.<BR>12:51,between love and hate,and i cant win are my faves,but as with the first album,that distorted vocal sound gets old after a while. i was hoping they would use a different vocal sound this time around but,they didnt. still a good disc and worth buying. i also understand you can get this on ultra cool vinyl !!!!!!!!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I saw the movie and fell in love with it! The movies music is just as good as the movie and is an intrical part of it. The soundtrack helps make the movie even better. If you loved the movie you'll love the music. All the music you hear in the movie is on the soundtrack and even includes some short sound effect clips. my favorite song is either #7,8,9,or 11. And #5 is hilarios to listen to. It's the part of the movie with lucy lu speacking to the councel of yakurza. Ha Ha hilarious!
B00006JKOL|5.0|For some odd reason, I never really got into Tull when I was growing up. I only recently have gone in and listened with a critical ear.<br />I have to say - WOW! What good stuff it is that I have been missing. This album was my first pick, and I hit a winner and a half.<br />All in all, just an excellent, excellent album. Lots to listen to, lots of talent, creativity and all in all just a delight to savor and enjoy!
0792151712|5.0|I bought this movie the year it was realeased and since then i've seen it 25 times (I'm not kidding.) It's the best movie in the history of the world, maybe it's because it has a bit of every thing, romance, tragedy, greed, a few laughs, ect. I'm really glad I bought it. I recommend it to every one who loves to see a great movie and Titanic freaks, like me.
0345347951|5.0|Somewhere in the mid 70s, I finally read Clarke's \\"Childhood's End\\", a book recommended to me by the clerk/manager of a local science fiction/fantasy book store. I was pretty much a lifelong fan of Clarke's due to \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" anyway, but this novel cemented that.<br /><br />This book's plot will remind an awful lot of people of \\"The Village/Children Of The Damned\\" movies, derived from the novel \\"The Midwich Cuckoos\\", another sci-fi classic published a bit later. The children here were also bred for excellence in everything, specifically mental acuity, by mysterious, supposedly benificent aliens, a major subplot shared by both books.<br /><br />This story follows the fortunes of mankind in general, and the hand-picked and germinated children specifically, as the entire world lives under the benign rule and nurture of the aliens. The world essentially turns into a Utopia that nonetheless has a few skeptics fomenting rebellion amongst normal humans.<br /><br />Clarke has given so many classic concepts to the world of sci-fi, he puts both Asimov and Roddenberry to shame. Science fiction just might still have been mired in Jules Verne and 50s monster flicks if it wasn't for him. This is probably his first major conceptual contribution to the field.<br /><br />As a Clarke fan, I highly recommend this book, a classic for all time, and I am patiently waiting for the day when this book is finally made into a faithful movie adaptation! (Something Columbia-Tristar promised a few years back, as a matter of fact, with nothing even being rumored to be in production so far!)<br /><br />My God, it's full of stars!!
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD, from a little unknown band from Little Rock, Arkansas, is phenomenal. I was anxiously awaiting the purchase of this CD because I myself come from Arkansas. Evanescence embodies the gothic mood with moody lyrics and anxiety-inspiring quitar riffs. Heavy, brooding songs make this CD into something like a boquet of black roses. This band is very much better then Forensik. BUY THIS CD...
076790592X|4.0|I thought this book was a very good way to look at death and how to live.  I loved how even though Morrie was dying, he still gave everything he could to people.  He would always give whoever he was talking to his full attention and not think about other things.  Once he started dying, he learned how to live.  He didn't wither away from society, but he taught life learning lessons.  He didn't care about the materialistic things because that's not what makes us happy in life.  He said it was the love and compassion we get and give from people.  <BR>I liked how it was Morrie's idea to have Mitch write this book.  He didn't just want people to remember him but more for his ideas and thoughts how to live each day to its fullest and not take anything for granted.  If our whole world was filled with people like Morrie, we would live in an almost perfect society.
B0000B1OE7|3.0|One of the coolest movies of all time has been remastered! An anime in DTS? Yea, there are few of them now-a-days. This anime has some of the best voices for Japanese AND English.<br />Basically we get to see Jubei fight the devils of Kimone. The movie has alot of gore, and alot of innovative monsters. Basically it isn't all hack and slash. The story is about a village wiped out by a plague. In order to investigate the plague, and wandering monk like dude hires Jubei to help him fight the devils. They run into a ninja girl who has a very special secret.<br />The movie's DTS is awesome! The picture looks more crisp, and the widescreen aspect only adds to it! I would reccomend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. If you have Ninja Scroll already but are not crazy about it, pass this one up.<br />Actually though, I have to correct my review. I have noticed slight differences. The full screen and widescreen version are on the same dvd, but the fullscreen gets pixely at times(very few). I would just buy the original movie unless you really like Ninja Scroll. The Widescreen isn't even real widescreen, it is 2 black bars.<br />Both versions have their flaws. I prefer the newer looking image of widescreen. Still, the fullscreen gives you more movie. Take my advice and only buy this if you are a true ninja scroll fan.<br />Still, the sound is awesome, and the special eddition of a movie has to mean something doesn't it? You never hear of them making the special eddition of crappy movies. Again, true ninja scroll fans are a plus for this, others should just check out the original dvd at the store, which is probably MUCH cheaper now.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I listened to some of the songs several months ago (PDA, Untitled and Stella...) but I was impressed by the last song Leif Eriksson. That's the greatest song of the album. isn't the solo at the end of that song a rip-off of The Cure's How beautiful you are?  Overall, it is a very good album, kinda gloomy but catchy at the same time (unlike Joy Division, which is much more difficult to &quot;digest&quot;. And the singer does sound like Ian curtis, especially in PDA).
1558908382|5.0|This is one under-rated classic flick. Every decade has their own under-rated classics. In the 1980s, it's the Big Chill and Breakfast Club. For the 1990s, it's Pulp Fiction, Good Will Hunting, and this one. They don't age no matter when you watch them.<br />Believe it or not, the movie is also very educational. I frequently use the the convinent store scene to make my son appreciate what happens to someone who spends too much time on video games, and the scene with what Cusack  did to the TV set in the end to show the effects of watching too much TV !<br />I'd rate it with more stars if Amazon has more stars for me to rate.
0553208845|5.0|This is pure delight.<br />Every once in a while, you stumble across a thin book with a simple tale, but an immense impact--this is one of those books.<br />Herman Hesse verifies what all of us struggle with repeatedly.<br />The softness Hesse uses to string a reader along is matched only by the stark theme that holds the whole together.<br />Read this book: simply the only was to describe its importance.

B00005JLTN|5.0|There are the people that were devastated after seeing Reloaded, and those that enjoyed it.  You rarely find the &quot;in-betweens&quot;.  That's because you will either like or not like Matrix Reloaded depending on why you are watching it, and what you like in a movie.  If you are looking for pure entertainment value and action, this movie reigns with the best.  If you are someone that always deconstructs a plot and analyzes it to make sure it is to your liking, then you may have disappointment with Reloaded.  It's not that the movie doesn't have a good plot, it just may not be what some expected it would be.  I enjoyed the movie because I just WATCHED it to enjoy it.  Some people, when waiting for a sequel to a great movie, will spend time trying to figure out what will happen, and determining what they think SHOULD happen... and then when the movie takes them totally off-guard, and ends up being something completely different than he/she expected, sometimes that is devastating to the watcher.  If you are someone that just enjoys a fun flick with interesting banter and great action sequences, you'll love the movie.  I recommend it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Before I talk about this album, can I ask one thing?  Can we leave out politics, history, etc out of it?  Geez, so their title is a clever take on the 2000 election.  Just focus on the music and not get wrapped up over trivial stuff and take your political rantings and diatribes to some political message board, but not here, okay?  No wonder why artists like Marilyn Manson sell so many albums because you have clueless individuals railing on them which in turn causes people to go out and buy the d*mn album to see what all the fuss is about!  It is called marketing, people, look into it...<br />Anyway, back to the actual review:  this is the 6th (7th counting the live album, &quot;I May Be Wrong&quot;) album by them that I have.  I love &quot;Kid A&quot; the best, but recognize the brilliance of &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot;.  I never liked &quot;Amnesiac&quot; that much, but &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; is a better album but just a level below the threesome of Bends, Computer, and Kid A.  It is like a combination of old albums that were put together, but it works well as there is more guitar on this album than the last 2, but still some elements of electronica.<br />My favorite tracks are &quot;Go to Sleep&quot;, &quot;A Punchup at a Wedding&quot;, &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot;, and &quot;The Gloaming&quot;.  &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; might replace &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; as my all-time favorite Radiohead song...it is that good!  All the tracks are solid but the ones I mentioned are the ones that stood out.  <br />Yet another solid album by the best band in music today.  If you enjoy Radiohead, I highly suggest looking at buying stuff by Sigur Ros, as they have been an influence on Thom and the boys and vice versa.  Also, for those that loved the electronica side of Radiohead, look into getting stuff by Aphex Twin aka Richard James, a modern musical genius.  He is not for everybody, but if you ever get into his stuff, you will be sucked inpermanently!
B000002WU9|5.0|this joint belongs up there with the chronic, doggystyle, and ready to die. if you love hip hop then this is a MUST. tight beats, tight production, lyrically, raekwon and ghostface are untouchable. if you have slept on this album, do yourself a BIG favor and get it, NOW!!!
0684800713|4.0|It has been said that Camus was deeply influenced by Hemingway's terse prose, which Camus employed in writing &quot;The Stranger&quot;. Having loved that novel, I was that much more impressed and satisfied when reading &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot;<br />Hemingway's narrator, Jake, is less complex than the existential rebel in The Stranger. Jake simply enjoys his life, going from bar to bar, train to train, hotel to hotel. He is unattached to the moral implications of the way his friends treat Cohn, a pathetic and desperate man, who happens to be Jewish. He experiences an almost zen-like passivity in his affections for Brett, a bold and attractive woman, which only makes him more attractive and manly in the latter's eyes.<br />Jake is somewhat of a less obvious and more appropriate existential man- because he is unattached to the idea of being detached, where as in The Stranger, Camus seems to continously make a point of his narrator's over abundance of detachment, to the point of seeming pro-active, which is a paradox.<br />Of course, this novel is not an existential one, it is mostly a fine, beautifully written account of expatriates in France and Spain, saying things to each other without meaning that have so much meaning, classic Hemingway.<br />Perhaps the best parts of the novel are the bullfighting scenes. For the first time, Jake narrates on moral terms, his tone changes, and all of a sudden, every little movement of the matador means so much to him. With Hemingway, less is always more, and we end up always wanting more, not because it is disappointing, but because it is so fine.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I rented Donnie Darko in August, of last year, and I was totally blown away. Finally a year later I was able to buy the DVD. This film is truly one of the most original films ever with an incredible story by the director/writer Richard Kelly. My rating is 5 stars and I truly mean that. Donnie Darko is a flawless film which is rare to find in movies.<br />The DVD is good too with special features, that can explain the story more for those who were confused the first time they saw it, (I know I was) like The Philosophy Of Time Travel book and the audio commentary with Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal. Also check out the official website for more extras on the movie.

B00000DQSZ|5.0|I don't understand why this album is out of print, unless Kraftwerk is in the process of re-recording and remastering their old albums.  This album is a mandatory one to get if you are a fan of techno/electronica music.<br />Breakdancers will be familiar with the title track which merges into &quot;Metal on Metal&quot;.  &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; and &quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot; are classic Kraftwerk tracks as they have drone German voices repeating certain phrases many times during the tracks (&quot;Even the greatest stars, find themselves in the looking glass..&quot;)along with the electronics that only Ralf and Florian and the rest of the gang could do.<br />Do yourself a favor and find a copy of this album ASAP.  It is a shame that it is out of stock, and I have to believe this is a temporary thing.  Kraftwerk is too important of a band in the history of music to not be able to buy their best stuff.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Enigma had good cd's in the past, but with voyageur i think micheal crety expressed the modern world and worked on a cd that will please most of the people, since this cd is the top selling in amazon and in my country, then i think people really like it and will start to apreciate enigma as an astonishing flash group.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Yes, I did give this movie five stars. And considering all of the bad reviews I have read, I will probably be taken to task for it.      So let me start by saying that I am, at heart, an unabashed &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; fan. I have been a fan of TNG since I started watching the TV series towards the end of the first season, and it would take quite a bit for me to be offended, dismayed, or even truly disappointed with the series.      That being said, I also have to state that this movie is far from perfect. But I'll get to that in a moment.      &quot;Star Trek - Nemesis&quot; is somewhat of an update of the original series &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; movie. There are many similarities between the two. Considering that the previous movie is deemed by most Star Trek fans to be the best of the movie franchise, it is understandable why many were unhappy with this latest effort.      However, there are differences. And it is these differences that set the movie apart, in my opinion, from its predecessor.      Answering the Romulans latest call for peace, Captain Picard comes face to face with his clone, Shinzon. While Captain Picard has had a life full of opportunity, Shinzon has had a life full of slavery. These two men, identical DNA wise, have paved out different paths for their lives. Jealous, Shinzon has set out to destroy Picard first, and all of Earth second.      As has always been with the Star Trek franchise, the special effects were terrific, escalating with the battle of Picard's and Shinzon's ships.      &quot;Nemesis&quot; was made with the thought that it would be the final TNG movie (signing of the cast has been more and more difficult with each movie). As a result, the intention was to bring some closure to the cast of caracters. (Basically, it was made for TNG fans only. Non-TNG fans will not like this movie, as they will be lost from the very beginning.) While their intentions were good, someone was obviously asleep at the wheel during the writing and shooting of this storyline.      The biggest story goof was with Wesley Crusher and Worf. Would someone please explain to me why they were wearing Starfleet uniforms? Wesley dropped out of Starfleet during season 7 to learn from the Traveler, while Worf left Starfleet to help with the rebuilding of the Klingon homeworld at the end of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.&quot; At no time during the movie were explanations given about this. To non-fans, this may seem petty, but to fans continuity has always been one of the shows biggest strengths.      As I stated at the beginning, I am an unabashed TNG fan. And overall, I believe &quot;Nemesis&quot; to be a fitting send-off for this crew.
B0000691U1|5.0|This is one of my favorite cds.  Ellington plays against type and delivers one of the most explosive piano performances that's ever been recorded.  Mingus and Roach are equally fantastic.  If I was stuck on an island and limited to 3 cd's, this would be amoung them.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Another Greatest Hits of Miss Summer, although it's not far from being &quot;Endless Summer&quot; repackage, this album includes the long awaited new tracks and some contemporary hits.  This Greatest Hits represent the talent that Donna has and will deliver surely in a new album soon enough, her voice is one of the most gifted in the industry. Only she can deliver sensual, bittersweet and husky voices all at the same time, so talented, and all her music is a big example of that.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the five years since you first heard Britney Spears' bubblegum pop anthem \\"...Baby, One More Time\\" alot has changed. Your age, your musical tastes, and Britney Spears. Have you noticed? After trying to show us she's grown up on her last two albums (only failing by a little, and coming very close the third time around) she is ready to go all out. Discussing more adult situations, working with a wider variety of producers, and even some collaborations make Britney Spears' \\"In The Zone\\" a fantastic musical experience. On the opening track \\"Me Against The Music\\" featuring none other than Spears' own muse, Madonna, they tell the story of a battle with a song, if you can figure out what she's saying. After listening to it over and over again though, the club anthem (yes, you read right, club, not bubblegum pop) grows on you and becomes as infectious and catchy as Britney was in her early days. On the Moby contribution to the album, \\"Early Mornin'\\" Britney sings about waking up after a hard night of partying feeling a bit under the weather over a fantastic bubbling beat. P. Diddy's contribution, \\"The Answer\\" is another standout track, which unbelievably almost didn't make the album. However, the best of the hip hop collaborations is either with R. Kelly (\\"Outrageous\\" on which Spears sings about things such as \\"my sex drive\\" and \\"my world tour\\" and \\"my shopping spree\\" and saying how sexy her underwear feel in her jeans.) or the duet with the Ying Yang twins (\\"(I've Got That) Boom Boom\\" on which Spears sets out to prove she's got the beat). The albums true standout moments come from the albums two ballads. The Matrix (Avril Lavigne, Liz Phair) contribute what Rolling Stone calls a \\"Mid 90's Aerosmith ballad\\" with \\"Shadow,\\" a truly amazing revelation for people who say Spears can't sing. She also shows off her power on \\"Everytime\\" which delivers what many are saying is a reference to Justin Timberlake (\\"I may have made it rain, please forgive me, my weakness caused you pain, and this song's my sorry\\") In one last attempt to prove she's grown up (which works surprisingly well, i might add) Britney takes on the subject of masturbation on what is simply titled \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" singing over middle eastern music in an almost Janet Jackson feel she sings \\"I don't want to explain tonight, all the things I've tried to hide\\" Clearly this girl (or woman...i don't know) has grown up alot. If only people other than her would realize it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|At times when McDonalds-ism rules even our taste of music, Norah Jones offers the listeners an alternative. Compared to the popular, greasy, cheap, fattening foods (which tastes good), she is the new diet in town. I could compare her to a professional chef who uses exotic spices to create a dish that is somehow beautifully mellow and delicious. <BR>Some reviewers state that her voice is not good, or that she is monotone - this is not true. Her voice is so rare and perfected, it is like platinum. Her rise to success brought me satisfaction, knowing that there are many people, who have class and good taste, as oppose to followers of the hype. It is the reassurance of the healthy dieters to know the existence of people who want better food. I always wondered and worried if fast food was the path music would take. People are so hyper, angry, and so entranced with the ______, ______, ______, and all the songs trying so hard to be different just to gain attention. Do we want the music world to follow the gainers of attention who are talking about killing, hurting, stealing, sleeping with as many people as possible, causing trouble, taking drugs as a life style, being lazy, hating, cursing, biting, and making life only more meaningless? Do we want to give these people awards because of their popularity? When Norah Jones came out, her album gave what the judges wanted, music for its beauty and magnificence, not works of graffiti. She is like a sparkle of light that gives people hope for a better path for music, and eventually the portrayal of our culture and time. She would, could, and should live on for a long time.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Maybe it's cliche, but in listening to A perfect Circle's albums, I can't help but compare them to Tool (aka Maynard's other band), and in the end, Tool's art rock sensibilities appeal to me far more than APC's pop sensibiblities.  <br />That being said, this is still a solid album that is leaps and bounds better than it's predecessor, 'Mer de Noms'.  There are high points and low points, but overall it feels like the band is starting to more fully develop their style and hit their stride.  It also requires multiple listens to fully appreciate it, which is another plus (nothing is  more boring than music that fully reveals itself on the first listen).  <br />Overall, this is good, solid pop music that manages to not slip into boring mediocrity (as pop music so often does).  The only bad thing I can say about this album has nothing to do with the music- it's the album cover art.  Maybe it's a silly nit to pick, but ARGH!!!  It's hideous!  3 stars instead of 4 thanks to this eyesore.

0446608955|5.0|The theme of the book focuses on a young teen, a first love and his transition from teen to manhood.  The title A Walk to Remember could be interpreted as twofold: a walk trrough early adulthood into manhood and the walk down the isle on his most memorable wedding day.  The author did a fantastic job with an emotional roller coaster ride.  In the beginning the reader experienced laughter to tears then later just plain tears.<BR>     The story evolved around a 57 year old Langdon Carter telling about his life at seventeen.  The setting was in the 1950's in a small North carolina town.  A sweet story of how a young girl Jamie changes Langdon's life forever.<BR>     Langdon Carter was a typical teen in the 1950's in Beaufort, North Carolina; he wanted to be just like all his peers.  Jamie was an unusual girl in Langdon's eyes and was an unlikely person to attract his attention. Jamie was everything that Langdon wasn't.<BR>     Langdon's family was rich and affluent.  Jamie's family was only her father who was the town preacher.  <BR>     The main focus of the story tells how a young 17-year-old kid experiences life and evolves from a fun loving boy into a young man.  The author winds the story of two teens with very different lifestyles and how each of them learns an important lesson if life.  Langdon and Jamie each learn that a person is not to be taken at face velue and that a person is much deeper than what is seen on the surface.  In a most unusual chain of events Langdon finds he has fallen in love with Jamie and the story ends with an unusual twist of events.
B00005JKZV|3.0|First thing, that movie is pretty good and enjoyable. Few scene are charm as it show the sense of humor. I laugh easy.<br />However, the important thing... I discovery there have all subtitle available in special features. It's very excellent information that hearing impaired would feel more satisfactory!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I thought the movie was amazing. The detail that has gone into making the movie is also amazing.<br />I think that those who are unable to see past the books to enjoy the movie-version, really are missing out. There is no movie in existence that has ever fully followed a book in it's entirely - yet these movies have done a good job of bringing Middle Earth alive. And for those of us out there who haven't read the books yet, the movies make me want to sit down and finally read the books!

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|When I heard &quot;Is This It?&quot; for the first time, I knew that The Strokes were something special.  What I didn't know, is that their second offering, &quot;Room On Fire,&quot; could be so much better.  The new CD has all of the great elements of the old one: great lyrics, catchy guitar riffs, and songs that are short, sweet, and get to the point without boring the listener.  Each song is around three minutes which is a perfect length, compared to all the other bands these days that drag all of their songs out.  Another great thing about the CD, is that all of the instruments sound great together.<br />Because there are no standouts on this CD, I will rate each individual song in my opinion...<br />1. What Ever Happened? (10/10)- This song could easily be the best Strokes song of all time.  Has great lyrics and a catchy tempo to it.  Great song!<BR>2. Reptilia (8.5/10)- Good song, but gets a little repetative towards the end.  Still better than most songs out there right now.<BR>3. Automatic Stop (9.5/10)- Catchiest lyrics on the whole CD.  Guitars have a reggae feel to them.<BR>4. 12:51 (7/10)- This song is the first single off of the CD and is easily the worst song.  Very boring and repetative.<BR>5. You talk way too much (8.5/10)- The lyrics are repetative throughout the whole song, but a strong chorus and a great solo make this song a winner.<BR>6. Between Love and Hate (8/10)- This song used to be called &quot;Ze Newie&quot; when The Strokes were touring, but they changed the name for the album.  They also changed a lot of the lyrics as well as the pace of the song.  I preferred the live version.<BR>7. Meet Me in the Bathroom (10/10)- This was the other song that the Strokes performed quite often on tour last year, and is one of their best songs.  Great guitar and great lyrics by Julian.  I also love the synthetic drums.  If you liked the track &quot;Hard to Explain&quot; on the old album, you'll love this song.<BR>8. Under Control (7.5/10)- This was TheStrokes attempt at a ballad, but in my opinion they failed.  Stick to what you know guys.<BR>9. The Way It Is (9/10)- This song is the most radio friendly song next to &quot;12:51,&quot; and will probably be the next single.  It's faster paced than the rest of the songs and has great distorted vocals by Mr. Casablancas.<BR>10. The End Has No End (10/10)- This song is simply amazing!  It would crush the rest of the CD if it weren't for &quot;What Ever Happened.&quot;  Best chorus on the CD and easily the best guitar on the CD.<BR>11. I Can't Win (9/10)- Great way to end the CD.  Lyrics are amusing and creative, and the instruments sound great together.  A final approval stamp on the rest of the CD.<br />Overall, this CD is easily the best release of 2003, and no one should be deprived of hearing it.  If you liked &quot;Is This It,&quot; then you will love this album.  If you've never listened to The Strokes before, please give them a shot.  I promise you won't be dissapointed.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Overall Viewpoint: <br />Well worth watching, for people who have AND haven't read the book. Can't wait for the extra footage. <br />Note to Whiners: <br />What did you expect? Tolkien's work could never be turned into another format. I've read the books six or seven times, and I'm quite aware of the atmosphere of otherworldliness that he creates. The movies are much closer to the books than most book-to-movie massacres, and Jackson DID manage to bring some of the feeling of the books to the big screen. Props to him. I don't like the changes to the plotline, but this is still a masterpiece. Not a masterpiece on par with the books, but still a true work of art.<br />Note to Prosaic People: <br />If you don't have a philosophic bent, don't waste your time on this movie. You have to be at least somewhat idealistic and interested in the purpose of humanity, or this movie will just seem way too long and overly dramatic. Put another way, you'll either \\"get it\\" and love it, or miss what it's all about and hate it. Don't worry, you'll know in the first 10 minutes or so.<br />Note to Old-School Readers:<br />There are now two kinds of people in the world---those who read the books first, and those who watched the movie first. If I ever have kids, they're reading the books first, that's for darn sure.
0767817664|3.0|Really good, campy, scary, funny vampire fun. I love vampire movies and this is one of my favorite of the genre. Pre-CGI effects are good, especially Evil Ed's death. But the real reason I come back to this movie year after year is Chris Sarandon's vampire: What. A. Sexpot. Even the gay 80s clothes and Cosby-esque sweaters could not take away from his deliciousness. He is in almost no other movies, so I watch this one at least once a year. This vampire is smokin hot right down to his great, evocative voice. Bite me, I'm yours, baby.
B00000JQFM|4.0|This album is short of being great.  Tracks 10 (Echo) and 3 (Crushing Day) are really good, especially the chord structures and solos.  Both are completely different in the ambience they direct.  <br />Personally I feel the remaining tracks are ok (with Track 2 - \\"Ice Nine\\", 4 - \\"Always With You\\", and Track 1 - \\"Surfing\\" being the better than average ones).  I've owned this album for several years now and the first two aforementioned tracks have stood the test of time.  Context is extremely important here - Satch's output on other albums has been varied, with some great tunes and some duds.  Close to inevitable comparisons with Steve Vai generally shows that Satch likes to play it \\"safe\\" most of the time, while Vai takes risks that often pay off in terms of creativity.  Still, some of Satch's work has a hint of genius, and here we see examples of it.  <br />Production on this album is pretty good as well - the drums are clean, the guitars in your face, and the bass audible.<br />Final rating - 3.5 stars:  One star for tracks 10 and 3; one star for tracks 1, 2, 4, and 5; half star for the remaining tracks; and 1 star for production.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes' second album, Room on Fire, expands on what the band so effectively accomplished on their first album, Is This It: well-written songs filled with incredibly arranged instrumentation &amp; undeniable melodies.  Indeed, Room on Fire is by a longshot much more alive than Is This It.  While more influences are worn on the Strokes' sleeves perhaps more than ever before, each track mixes those influences with the Strokes' own brand of song, making for an amazing step ahead in the right direction for the band. I also had the opportunity to see the Strokes on the first two opening nights of their latest tour. They were nothing short of amazing and energetic. Nick Valensi is very much the new Elliot Easton.
B000002OTL|2.0|Due to the fact of Link Wray not included in the soundtrack, I must give 2 stars. Three of Link Wray's songs are played in the movie. Surely the song &quot;Rumble&quot; must have, at least, been considered to be included!<BR>   Josh
B000069AUI|5.0|&quot;Parachutes&quot; was a great album; moody, melodic and beautiful.  &quot;A Rush...&quot; is better.  The guys have grown as songwriters and musicians; they have an understated eloquence to their guitar-work and the way they construct their tunes that takes several listenings to appreciate.  Sure, Chris Martin is dating an American movie star; sure, they have a political agenda to ease trade with the Third World; sure, they're the darlings of VH-1 and TV soundtracks everywhere... ignore all that.  This is a brilliant, melancholy, beautiful album by the premiere British alt-pop band out there.
B000001DZQ|2.0|I am a Roy Buchanan fan and think that he's one of the greatest players of modern electric guitar blues.  But there's some real junk on these two CDs. As another reviewer has already pointed out, the first four tracks on CD 1 spotlights other instruments or the vocalist but not Buchanan.  On one of the cuts, the other instruments jam for 5 minutes before you even hear Buchanan's guitar!!  He then plays for 30 seconds and suddenly the song is over!!  And, we're all here for the same thing, to hear Buchanan's pyrotechnic guitar--we don't care about a lot of other instrumental jamming.  Then, also on CD 1, a better, much longer 1974 version of C. C. Ryder could have been included.  On CD 2, the version of Hey Joe is absolutely dreadful.  It has a long almost guitar-free introduction, what sounds like a drunken Buchanan at the microphone and mediocre guitar playing.  Listen to Buchanan do Hey Joe on American Axe, Live 1974 or even his 1973 studio version and you'll hear what I mean.  On another song, there is a repetitious organ solo for several minutes before the guitar comes in and plays for less than 1 minute.      Some good stuff on these two CDs but some crap as well; Polydor should fire the incompetent that put this together.  Seek out the original CDs and stay away from this over-priced, under-produced insult to a great musician.
B00008DDXC|4.0|This is a great DVD! The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because this movie gets old after you watch it alot. Besides that it's excellent.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|33 minutes and approximately 5 seconds.  Time it, folks.  The Strokes are back with another speedster.<BR>It's true, the top hits on the charts are all hip hop.  Rap artists own the top twenty, for Christ's sake.  I'm not knocking hip hop, but here are the facts...rock n roll has become a formula.  It has lost its edge.  Who can tell me ANTHING new that has happened to rock n roll since 1990?  Even Nirvana borrowed sounds from their past influences.  Hell, grunge was just more punked out classic rock.  So, let's face it...rock n roll has become boring.  Most of it at least.  You can see the boredom in Julian's eyes, and certainly in the way Nikolai plucks his bass like a statuette.  <BR>Rock n roll is taking its last gasp for creativity, and The Strokes, well, aren't the saviors of rock n roll.<BR>Boo hoo.  We know it and they certainly know it.  But hell, they're not out to change the world.  The Strokes are about as pretentious as a tree, people.  They just want to play some rock n roll.  And they do it WELL!<br />So why are we knocking The Strokes?  God, I've heard it all.  And I'm not buying it.  So they're fantastic dressers.  Hell, so was Bowie and nobody found fault in that.  So they smoke.  Geez, the need their nicotine fix.  So they sound a little like Iggy's &quot;Lust for Life&quot; era, and let me emphasize a &quot;little bit&quot;.  What's your point?  The New York Dolls sounded like The Rolling Stones and they were FANTASTIC.  And the comparison to the Velvet Underground And Television is just absurd.  Those who jump onto that bandwagon read too much Rolling Stone mags.<br />The bottom line is that The Strokes could probably write undeniable and unavoidably great pop hooks in their sleep.  Listen to the &quot;I Can't Win&quot; intro riff.  If it doesn't put a smile on your face, than listen again!  &quot;The End Has No End&quot; and &quot;You Talk Way Too Much&quot; show The Strokes at what they do best.  They are constantly looking for ways to minimalize their craft.  Hence, Fab's drumming on this album sounds like a drum machine straight out of 1982.  Nick Valensi's guitar sounds like a synthesizer from Gary Numan's closet.  And Albert Hammond leads the pack in a similar way to The Pixies.  Compare a song like &quot;Debaser&quot; to one off of &quot;Room on Fire&quot;.<br />Listen, it's fine if you don't like the sound.  Not everyone digs it.  But if you liked &quot;Is This It&quot; as much as I did, than you're in luck.  &quot;Room On Fire&quot; gives you what you liked in their debut...short, catchy, cool songs that you will know the words to after 2 listens. <BR>11 songs at 33 minutes and 5 seconds flat.<BR>Okay, so it's not an epic.  If you want an epic, go listen to Yes.  <br />Rock n roll may be dead, but The Strokes are playing at the funeral, and it's a rockin good time.
0393307050|5.0|Sit back in your favorite recliner and prepare yourself for an exciting adventure!  Here, in the pages of \\"MASTER AND COMMANDER\\", the reader is introduced to Captain Jack Aubrey of the Royal Navy and Stephen Maturin, physician, linguist, scholar, spy, and then some.<br />The novel begins in Port Mahon in 1800.  Aubrey, for the moment, is a naval officer without a command, restless and impatient for action. (Britain and Revolutionary France are at war.)  Quite by accident, he literally bumps up against Stephen Maturin and a budding friendship develops between them.<br />O'Brian faithfully evokes the atmosphere of those distant times. The language may seem a bit stilted and obscure.  But part of O'Brian's genius as a writer is that as you read deeply into this novel, you'll soon find yourself swept along on the ebb and flow of events.  All your senses will be titillated.<br />Besides Aubrey and Maturin, O'Brian creates here a variety of richly textured characters who bring vividly forth the ambience of wartime shipboard life in the Age of Sail.<br />So, if you're looking for a thoroughly engaging and captivating story, \\"MASTER AND COMMANDER\\" is it!  Highly recommended.<br />(I first read \\"MASTER AND COMMANDER\\" in July 1994.  Ever since, I've been hooked on the Aubrey-Maturin series.)
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I remember listining to thier first cd while a freshman in college back in 2001 and now 2 years later(and still in college) thier back!!! The main thing i like about the strokes is thier use of guitars and drums, not too mention the great sound of the lead singer. I recommend this cd to anybody but mainly to The Strokes fans out thier, you will not miss out if you buy this cd!!! My favorite song is You talk way too much, but also Under Controll...great sound!!!GOOD TIMES
B0000AMRJC|3.0|You'd think for the 20th. anniversary of this film they would come up with a better DVD. It is being advertised &quot;with an improved 5.1 sound&quot; but in all honesty, even though the nature of the film lent itself for a great track, the results are terribly, terribly flat. The video itself could have been a lot better also.<BR>I have no beef with the film itself, either you love or hate Al Pacino's way over the top preformance. I happen to find it a riot.<BR>This is a terrible presentation of a rather good film.
B00004S6GL|5.0|I'm in shock over the sudden and unexpected loss of an amazing musician. I cannot know what was going through his mind - what pain could have inspired such an outcome. Music fans mourn the loss. I remember when I discovered the beautiful, fragile, inspired music of Elliot Smith and was happy with a singer/songwriter for once. The music of Figure 8 can make me at once elated and introspective and then I'm crying. I can listen to this album for weeks on end and not take it out of my car stereo because of the intrinsic value of Elliot's music. <BR>Elliot - we will miss you, your poetic lyrics, and your perfectly composed melodies.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Honestly, considering the longevity of her career,it is amazing it has taken this long for her to produce her first bad album.  I bought the &quot;Madonna&quot; cassette back in 1983, and have everything since.  &quot;Music&quot; was a brilliant CD, and I was excited for &quot;American Life&quot; to come out.  When I first heard the single for &quot;American Life&quot;, I thought perhaps it would take a while to grow on me.  It still hasn't.  The entire CD follows suit.<br />This CD is consistently bad to mediocre throughout.  In my opinion, &quot;Die Another Day&quot; is the only memorable track on the album.  Sadly, I wished the &quot;Hollywood/Into the Groove&quot; GAP commercial was included, as it far surpassed every track on this CD.  The addition of all the acoustic guitar seems indulgent, as Madonna doesn't appear to me much of a guitarist.  And I just have a hard time buying the criticism of fame and materialism themes here, esp. from Madonna.  If she's no longer looking to be accepted and get publicity, can you explain the VMAs. <br />As a Madonna fan, I am disappointed, but when you think of 20 year careers, most artists have a few stinkers (Elton John immediately comes to mind).  So, be patient, the next good album is hopefully just around the corner.
B000003S0B|3.0|When your first album is one of the greatest records of all time, what the heck do you do for an encore?  This was the dilemma facing King Crimson after the release of 1969's \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.\\"  Unfortunately, the band was ill equipped to follow up their landmark debut.  Greg Lake had already left to form ELP and co-writer/multi-instrumentalist Ian MacDonald also departed, leaving Robert Fripp to hold the bag.<br />Rather than re-invent the prog rock wheel (as they would do many times later in their career), Crimso soldiered on, producing a nearly exact duplicate of their first record.  And it's pretty darn good in its own right.  Had the songs been just a little better and were it not for the inevitable comparisons to the first album, \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" might also be considered a classic.<br />\\"Pictures of a City\\" apes \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" the title track recalls \\"Epitaph,\\" and the lovely \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" follows in the footsteps of \\"I Talk to the Wind.\\"  There's no \\"Moonchild\\" or \\"The Court of the Crimson King\\" here, but KC does break some new ground with the humorous \\"Cat Food\\" and the epic instrumental \\"Devil's Triangle,\\" an adaptation of Holst's \\"Mars.\\"  The band also employs a recurring theme in the three \\"Peace\\" tracks, which punctuate the album.  Crimson would perfect this thematic device on later albums, such as \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic,\\" \\"Thrak\\" and \\"The Power to Believe.\\"<br />All in all, \\"Poseidon\\" is a solid second album. If it's disappointing, it's because it's one of the few Crimson records that looks to the past rather than progressing forward.
B0000CD5FN|3.0|I loved Strummer.  I have all of his recordings.  I have been dissappointed by all of them too.  I still support him though.  He was a good person and his music is better than most.<br />But, as much as I want to like his later music, I can't.  Without Mick Jones I believe Strummer lost the center-that is I think he has a hard time coming up with a catchy melody.  Great lyrics, cool instrumentation but ulimately, not very memorable to me.<br />So fans, don't think I'm a traitor.  <br />P.S.  Try the new Stiff Little Fingers CD.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I went 4 years before I saw the Matrix. The only reason I did was because my 14 yr. old son rented it, and that was 5 days ago. I can't believe I went that long before seeing it. Brilliant storytelling. It took me seeing it twice before I really understood the movie, but I must say I was blown away by  not only the story but the acting and action were fantastic. That being said, Reloaded is twice as much fun, and the storytelling just keeps getting better. I don't understand the bad reviews i've seen for Reloaded by some people. I think they just don't really get the movie. Neo flies, sure, but he's the 'ONE.'This is one of those rare movies where the sequel is better then the original. Can't wait for Revolution.
0307155102|5.0|I just can't recommend this book highly enough.  It has page after page of interesting scenes, animals, objects, vehicles and more to look at and talk about with your child.<BR>There are many opportunities for teaching words.  I name objects for my daughter and she also points to objects that I name for her.  She has learned many new words from this book.<BR>It is truly a must have for parents!!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Look, i know people are entitled to their opinions, but comparing Radiohead to Pink Floyd?  People should realize by now that Floyd was okay way back when, but on repeated listening nowadays?  Come on, lets be honest.  Floyd sucks unless you are stoned off your gourd.  Radiohead is simply amazing at what they do and Hail to the Thiefs a perfect example of this.  Whenever a band can make a song like We Suck Young Blood, you know genius is at work.  If you think bands like Pink Floyd or even (dont make me laugh) Yes are even in the same stratosphere as Radiohead, its time to bring your head out of the Seventies and get up to date.  Oh and Hail to the Theif was the name of a paper written in the early 1900's that Thom read, not an attack against Bush.  Either way, dont let politics influence what you think of a band, let the music do the talking.
B0000029LG|5.0|I just wanna highlight the underrated joints. &quot;Money&quot; grooves like an early 80s-still hanging-on-to-disco track. &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot; is poetry, from the lyrics to the off kilter drum pattern. &quot;They Don't Really Care About Us&quot; is amazing &quot;Tabloid Junkie&quot; (the chorus is unforgettable)...even &quot;Smile&quot; is so well done, vocal stylings remind of Nat King Cole, so classy.
B000002H2H|5.0|I think that RIDE is Metallica's best, and the greatest heavy metal album of all time...It's the 1st that I've heard and It's my favourite one.<br />1. Fight fire with fire (5/5):  Acoustic intro before, The Hell after... The real point of connection with Kill 'em all<BR>2. Ride the lightning (6/5): It's impossible 6/5 I know, but Ride is an incredible song , I see that the new MetallicA have played this song many times and it's good...Great riffs, and superb Kirk's solo<BR>3. For Whom the bell tolls (5/5): The Bass solo introduced to this great mid-tempo, one of their greatest success<BR>4. Fade to black (5/5): their 1st ballad, legendary<BR>5. Trapped under ice (4,5/5): This is a furios song, but not so important in the disc<BR>6. Escape (4,5/5): My less favourite (but I also like so much it) in the disc<BR>7. Creeping death (6/5): My favourite MetallicA's song after One...<BR>8. The call of Ktulu (5/5): Great instrumental, Cliff is superb
B0000AXE8I|4.0|but matrix reloaded stands on its own.  <BR>it really deserves about 4.5 stars.<br />good movie with some awsome bullet time sequences and some really breath taking scenes. <br />only 2 problems for me in Matrix Reloaded was that some of the fight scenes are too long. when neo fights all 100+ agent smiths, it gets boring after a while.<BR>that fight scene alone must have lasted a good 15-20 minutes.<br />also, i hate the ending, &quot;to be concluded&quot;???? what was that? we're not watching some tv show here, this is the MATRIX!<br />on the upside, the bullet time here is just as good as in the original matrix. also, i absoultely LOVE the freeway car chase scene!!!<br />absoultey awsome! the music, the ghosts, the close calls with Trinity and the Keymaker on the mortacycle, and then the bullet time for the 2 eighteen wheeler crash is freaking AWSOME!!!<br />as for the DVD special features, it's worth it! big time! they go behind the scenes on the contrustion of the freeway sequence which began back in 2001! and it's not some 5 minute feature, it's a good feature that covers more than enough, and also helps the fans and viewers really understand not only how hard and how much work you have to do for just one sequence in a movie, but you come to appreciate the work the whole cast and crew did on matrix reloaded. WOW!!!
B00008NRL8|5.0|The sleeper hit of 2001/2002, most people didn't catch onto \\"The Gotan Project\\" until midway through 2002...and mostly by word of mouth, and was something of a essential purchase for the musical enthusiasts....Think Argentinean Tango daringly integrated with stylish Electronica...and the results were exceptional, first track \\"Queremos Paz\\", opens the album with expansive Spanish Guitars &amp; Lush Percussion mixing styles effortlessly, and yet keeping true to it's Argentinean roots...the Electronica side of things it used very subtly to enhance proceedings. Admittedly there's nothing here that is new or innovative, but depth of vision, and perfected Execution go a hell of a long way, to not only producing an album that is as vital as &quot;Bebel Gilberto's - Tanto Tempo&quot;, but construct an album not fashioned around current musical trends, which therefore gives this release a Longevity beyond its Contemporaries.
B00005OAIE|1.0|John Mayer is the patron saint of every guy who got laid in a dorm room due to playing the acoustic guitar badly.
B000002H72|5.0|Having always seemingly been compared to \\"Nirvana\\"...this does the `Pixies' little justice, as this...their best album is a far more multi-tentacled beast than anything `Nirvana' has done. First track \\"Debaser\\" is an ambitious accessible straight out the bag College Rock track that is one of those tracks that anybody who's heard the album always mentions. But it would be foolish to not equally praise their other exceptional tracks, \\"I Bleed\\" giving a gloomy take on Ironic Pop, but its the irresistibility of \\"Here Comes your man\\" that invokes images of `The Velvet Underground' at their very best...often bemused by peoples perception of their as a populist band, singer/frontman \\"Black Francis\\" Quoted as saying...\\"Everyone thinks the Pixies were a incredibly popular band, but we were just a Cult band\\". Cult band or not...they are one of the most consistently brilliant Rock/Grunge albums bands ever devised.
B00005JKNF|4.0|To start off with, I gave this movie four stars despite the fact that I love this movie.  This is because when i first bought this movie I almost thought about selling it back used.  It was only after a certain amount of determination on my part that I was able to come to enjoy this film.  <BR>      Yet this movie deserves to be viewed multiple times.  The way the dialogue is done, and the confusion created by all the sub-plots proves to be frustrating initially.  With each viewing however I found that once I knew the basics of the plot, I was able to grasp a lot more, and to enjoy the film.  Every time I watch it now I notice new things, various details that Robert Altman slipped into the film that did not seem to stand out before.  <BR>     It should be said, that (at least from what I remember) in one of the documentaries in the extra features, Robert Altman states that he didn't want to keep the murder a mystery.  This is Altman playing around with the conventional who-dunnit.  one.  These extra features add a further dimension of appreciation for me, over the meticulous detail put into the creation of the setting, and its authenticity.<br />So to summarize.... Pick this movie up and hopefully enjoy, but at least try to watch it at least twice... you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B000002HFU|5.0|Hardcore Rap would certainly be one way of describing Old Dirty Bastards music, as virtually every track has a multitude of expletives, Off-beat raps, rhymes that sometimes dont rhyme, incredibly graphic references of Sex & Violence that will shock & offend those not used to O.B.D (Old. Dirty.Bastard)yet his music has that certain infectious slant to ithow can anyone not listen to Shimmy Shimmy Ya and not recognise it as a club anthem??.or how about the incoherent rap ramblings of Brooklyn Zoo, or the full on Wu-endorsed (several Wu-Tang members make an appearance) on the exceptional Proteck Ya Neck II in The Zoo, that in amongst O.D.Bs more incoherent vocal assaults Drunk Game (Sweet Sugar Pie) gives his album surprising diversityso you have your Anthems/Hardcore Raps/Humorous/Interludes /collaborations/bizarre ballads/, to deliver an album, that is undeniably both musical & lyrical unbalanced.but given the sheer charisma of O.D.B is one that he is more capable than most to push to its limitshis best album, period.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Every night at around 10 p.m., as we're flipping thru channels looking for something to watch, my husband says... \\"You know what we need?  We need an All-Seinfeld, All the time channel.\\"  The show is the perfect way to relax at the end of a hectic day.  I would LOVE it if the DVD were ready by Christmas!  Any chance of it?  What do you think?
B000002AH7|5.0|Although unarguably one of the finest Jazz musicians of his generation, Having now gone back and listened to \\"Sketches of Spain\\" from a new perspective, it's now not hard to see why this is a massively influential album...as `Miles Davis''' trumpet playing, is the shining light in an overall complex &amp; stunningly intricate album. Whether it's the memorable 16 minute luxurious orchestral of \\"Concierto de Aranjuez\\", or the more English marching/ regimental-esque stomp of \\"Saeta\\", or the laid back reflective signature trumpeting blues of \\"Solea\\"...Miles is without a shadow of a doubt a Trumpeter of unquestionable greatness..but let's not take anything away from his backing band, and their subtle arrangements that not only enhance, but allow Miles' compositions to explore all available boundaries and push the envelope of a trumpeters capabilities and harmonic structures, to elevate this to a truly landmark album.
0321200683|5.0|To do justice in reviewing this book, I should depict every single pattern and give you multiple examples on how it would apply to your job as a Project Manager, Software Architect, Technical Lead or a Developer.  That would be a 500-page book all by itself.  In short, this is one great book.  The first book to actually take a complex and ever growing topic such as MOM, Message Oriented Middleware, and give you its benefits and the best practices/patterns all in one book.  <br />The author starts by giving the reader the top reasons why messaging should be chosen for the next project:<BR>1) Remote communication<BR>2) Platform/Language Integration<BR>3) Asynchronous communication<BR>4) Variable timing<BR>5) Throttling<BR>6) Reliable Communication<BR>7) Disconnected operation<BR>8) Mediation<BR>9) Thread Management<BR>The author goes into detail on each of these reasons.  These reasons would convince any software architect, but the author goes even further than that and reiterates the benefits of each of these reasons and elaborates on them thru out the book.  <br />Chapter 3 of the book starts by breaking up a messaging system into its main components and briefly explaining each one:<BR>1) Message Channel<BR>2) Message<BR>3) Pipes and Filers<BR>4) Message Router<BR>5) Message Translator<BR>6) Message Endpoint<br />Each of these high level topics is then broken down and various patterns are shown for each section.  Just like the GoF book, the reader can simply go the desired section and read the patterns that are associated with that \\"subsystem\\"<br />Each section is then followed by a full-blown example, which to me is priceless.  The examples are shown using the most popular middleware vendors such as TIBCO, IBM, Microsoft, Web Methods, SeeBeyond and a couple JMS vendors.  The examples show the similarities and differences in implementation but clearly show how EACH pattern that was just covered in the previous section applies to the example.  <BR>Having worked withmany of the MOM vendors covered in this book, Chapter 7, Message Routing, is my favorite chapter.  The author breaks down this topic into 14 different patterns:<BR>i) Pipes and Filers<BR>ii) Message Router<BR>iii) Content-Based router<BR>iv) Message Filter<BR>v) Dynamic Router<BR>vi) Recipient List<BR>vii) Splitter<BR>viii) Aggregator<BR>ix) Resequencer<BR>x) Composed Message Processor<BR>xi) Scatter-Gather<BR>xii) Routing Slip<BR>xiii) Process Manager<BR>xiv) Message Broker<br />The chances are, not many of us need to write a MOM due to the fact that there are many vendors out there that are doing that already! But one could certainly use this section for education purposes, and/or use it a checklist of \\"nice-to-haves\\" when shopping around for a MOM vendor.  By reading the book, you can figure out what \\"features\\" apply to you, your application and your enterprise, and take that list and see which vendor has implemented that feature.    <BR>In summary, Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf have done a fantastic job depicting a very complex topic.  I have made a place for this book right next to the original GoF Design Patterns book.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Although a double album, this isn't a `Best of' or compilation of his work, but more to do with the fact that during this period (1971-1976) to say Stevie was on a musical roll, would be an huge understatement, as each successive album is easily as impressive as the last. Here the 21 songs making up the album cover everything from love to Social issues, without missing a beat. You have everything from love (\\"Love's in Need of Love Today\\")...Soul-funk (\\"I Wish\\")....Ballads (\\"Knocks me off my feet\\")...and instrumental tracks (\\"Contusion\\"), as well as \\"Pastime Paradise\\" (which was later covered by `Coolio' and renamed \\"Gangsters Paradise\\"), provide Stevie with one of his most consistently brilliant albums, (bearing in mind that this album clocks in at 21 tracks as opposed to the usual 10 tracks on most of his albums), and yet manages to be a better buy than some of the some of Stevie's own compilations Albums.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|It's true.  At the Drive In is no more.  However, their music will resonate for years to come.  This release was probably their most 'exposed' album due to the major label they had signed on with.  Really though, words can't convey exactly what this band sounds like, so do yourself a favor and listen to the samples.  Cryptic yet poetic lyrics fueled by furious guitars all bringing you one of the most energetic and original sounds that you've ever heard.
B000002G7G|5.0|Most peoples introduction to `The Velvet Underground', is undoubtedly the infamous \\"The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico\\" (the one with the banana on the front cover), which was a drug promoting, Nihilistic, Confrontational classic of an album. So it probably surprised many, when they released this, an intimate, reflective &amp; gentle album in comparasion. Listen to the warmth of contemplative rock &amp; roll on \\"Candy Says\\", or the decidedly ambiguous content of \\"Jesus\\", for a delicate side to the Velvets recordings not yet unveiled. The instrumentation is minimal in its approach with a much bigger emphasis on simple guitar arrangements, with many tracks dropping the speed of the tempo for something more intelligent and dare I say it??...Romantic!!???, yet the brave &amp; uncompromising lyrical content, would ensure that this album was some of their most distinguished work.
0930289331|5.0|I've always considered Batman the greatest super-hero creation of all time.  Anyone can create a truth-justice-american-way charcter (and many did), but in Batman Bob Kane gave us a tragedy, and a protagonist that borders on the obsessive.  No super-powers, just an aray of martial arts skills and \\"those wonderful toys\\".  Probably my favorite aspect of the character is how he considers his persona to be Batman and not Bruce Wayne.  Bruce Wayne is the mask he wears.  Being Batman is simple for him, it's altering his personality and mannerisms that challenges him.<br />This graphic novel is a trade paperback that originally consisted of four issues published in 1986.  It places Bruce Wayne at age twenty-five and before he became \\"the bat\\".  Returning to Gotham City after years of travelling through Europe and Asia aquiring various skills, Bruce is anxious to begin his great work that he has been focused upon since he was a child.  He knows exactly what he must do, but the problem is he doesn't know exactly HOW he must do it.  <br />What's more important regarding this book, it's written by Frank Miller.  <BR>  <BR>   \\"If I were to introduce someone to comic books, I'd take him into a comic shop and buy him everything I could find written by Frank Miller.\\" ---Samuel L. Jackson
B000069AUI|5.0|Apparently `Chris Martin' wrote most of the lyrics for this album whilst in the midst of heavy touring for their first album \\"Parachutes\\", and remarkably it's easily as solid &amp; as confident an album as their first LP....The ballad beauty of \\"In my Place\\" wouldn't have seemed out of place if included on the first LP, and the Dreampop of \\"The Scientist\\" which won the band much music station air play, and yet although this album may not have a festival Anthem song in the vein of \\"Yellow\\" or \\"Trouble\\"... the songwriting and musical arrangements feel slightly stronger on this release, and yet it's still immediately accessible to people that don't have any prior experience from the first album, although not a album that instantly hooks you, it grows in stature with each listen, and delights in it more intimate moments, and proves itself to be an album of unbridled beauty and Plaintive songwriting that easily matches (and some would say Surpasses) the brilliance of `Parachutes'.
B00003CXXP|5.0|...although it seems more people hate this movie.  What bothers me though, is how people proclaim a movie either 'good or bad' rather than 'liked it or didn't like it'.  Like all of a sudden they're the experts on film and have the authority to state absolute facts about a movies worth.  I will neither state AI as 'good or bad'....I will simply say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />Everything you've heard is true.  This IS a futuristic story of Pinnochio.  It's a fake boy on a quest to become a real boy.  Along the way he meets his Jiminy Cricket (a robotic male prostitute played by Jude Law) who agrees to help him in his quest.  Some very patient viewers might see the wonderfully hidden underlying themes that relate to our own society and the philisophical nature of simply 'being'.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone....however, heed the warning in my title.  This is definately a 'love it or hate it' situation.
0385484518|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I thoroughly enjoyed every page.  The story is mainly about a dieing old man named Morrie who is trying to pass on life's lessons to his former student, Mitch.  I found practically all of Morrie's lessons to be true and helpful.  Morrie's approach to life and death is very light-hearted and simple.  He made me believe that this is the way life should be.  Morrie believes that we should not fear death, but accept it and try to get the most out of life with our remaining time.  I think the book really shines near the end when it is obvious that Morrie has taught Mitch the best lesson of all.  He has taught him to give and receive love.<br />My only complaint about the book would probably be that some of Morrie's philosophies seemed idealistic and don't seem to apply to real life at times.  Others I just didn't agree with at all.  Nevertheless, most of his philosophies were very insightful and helpful.<br />Overall, I thought that this was a good book with a great message.  Everyone should read it because everyone can find something in this book that applies to their own life.
B0000931OG|4.0|Blur's first effort after a split up and side project of the Gorillaz is possibly their finest. Not quite as displaced as 99's '13', Tank gives the audience the true essence of Blur's capablities from the 'Song 2' like groove fest 'Crazy Beat' to the straight forward beauty of 'Out of Time' to the punk angst of 'We Got a File on You' that sets the mood for brilliant power-punk pop with an attitude. Highlights include the drifting, subtle 'Caravan' and the blistering ballad 'Battery in Your Leg'. Tank is an experimental,well crafted piece British pop we all can enjoy.
B000065FMG|5.0|Out of the 3 great albums she has done to date (the other 2 being &quot;baby, one more time&quot; and &quot;Oops I did it again&quot;) this is her best. If you don't have any of her albums, get this one now!
B00009V7P8|4.0|Damien Rice's sweet debut is a lush, gentle beauty of an album. 'Delicate' is just that and a great opener. Rice's tender voice sweeps the listener up and lies them down with grace as the strings come in and soothe the mind. 'Volcano' may be the highlight with it's beautiful arange of strings, bass, drums and vocals of Rice and Lisa Hannigan blend and switch and come back together in the bonechilling chorus. 'The Blower's Daughter' is Rice at his vocal best and most vulnerable and what remains is brilliant craftsmanship of beautiful folk/rock sweetness.  'Cannonball' is possibly the most touching track as Rice sings, &quot;still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed&quot; and &quot;Life taught me to die&quot;. Other highlights include the distant 'Older Chests', whirling 'Amie' and the finale 'Eskimo'. This is just the start of a brilliant new artist that I am looking forward to hear progress.

The footnotes in and of themselves are quite an achievement.

B00004TDTO|5.0|Simplicity. That's what makes this Steven Spielberg's best movie. Just four years earlier, he had made his mark with the TV movie, Duel, which consists of automobile driver Dennis Weaver being terrorized by the unseen driver of a diesel truck.<br />For over half of Jaws, the viewer similarly does not see &quot;Bruce, the shark.&quot; But he gets to see increasing evidence of the works of Bruce's ... jaws.<br />&quot;It's a short season.&quot; That's what my old man, a retired contractor, always says of summer in the tourist trap Martha's Vineyard, where he has lived for over forty years (and where I used to spend my summers). Jaws was filmed on the Vineyard (specifically, the cheesier, nouveau riche, Edgartown end), which is called &quot;Amity&quot; in the movie. Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's script, adapting Benchley's novel, perfectly uses the attitude my father expressed: When a series of early season swimmers disappear, the town worthies (led by its mayor, played by Murray Hamilton) fear a business disaster. For business' sake, rather than the public safety, a price is put on the shark's head. Sounds like the Vineyard to me.<br />Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw play the odd trio that seeks to kill the shark: The local police chief, a university shark expert, and a veteran fisherman. What juices the story, is that the shark has something else in mind.<br />John Williams' visceral, Oscar-winning score is the sound of the hunt, the sound of fear. Bill Butler's cinematography is so unobtrusive, as is Verna Fields and Spielberg's editing, that you're unaware of them -- at least for the first few viewings. You lose yourself in the story. (Fields won an Oscar for her work; Spielberg did not credit himself, and thus went unrewarded.)<br />The acting, particularly by Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss, is similarly naturalistic. The most understated performance is by Roy Scheider, who is perfect as Police Chief Martin Brody, an uprooted New Yorker whose facade of restraint belies a nervous nature. But it is the late Robert Shaw who steals the show as Mr. Quint, an Ahab-like fisherman whose obsession with sharks goes back to his experience as a seaman on -- and &quot;off&quot; -- the USS Indianapolis at the end of The War. Shaw's soliloquy -- which he co-wrote with screenwriter John Milius (Patton) and playwright Howard Sackler (The Great White Hope) -- on the fate of the Indianapolis' crew is spellbinding. (In addition to being one of the most powerful character actors of his day, Robert Shaw was a novelist, screenwriter, and the author of the acclaimed play, The Man in the Glass Booth.)<br />As good as some of Spielberg's recent work -- most notably Saving Private Ryan -- has been, none is as good as Jaws, because he now strives for &quot;importance,&quot; &quot;significance,&quot; and &quot;symbolism,&quot; and for satisfying various constituencies (think Schindler's List), rather than for telling a great yarn. Let us hope that he can someday recapture his early simplicity, and wed it to the technical savvy he's since learned.
0790729725|5.0|This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it. The storyline is awesome and although its kind of cliche, its the simplicity that makes the movie worth while!
B000002GYR|5.0|30 years since it came out, the entire album is timeless and stands on its own. I've heard covers of &quot;Ol'55&quot;, and &quot;I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love With You&quot; as well as various songs used in movies, but anyone who likes the current wave of singer-songwriters HAS TO HAVE this at least. Springsteen's debut came out the same year, and it just doesn't compare. You can hear similarities between Bruce, Waits, Tim Buckley, Harry Chapin, Jim Croce,and Billy Joel around this time, but this is  also where the similarities ended. <br />This is a good starter, and a safer bet than plunging into &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, &quot;The Black Rider&quot; or &quot;Bone Machine&quot;. The famous gruff voice he'd use in a couple of years was just beginning to show.
B00006BTCA|1.0|OH MY GOSH THIS STINKS!!!<br />Turn on the bright lights must be a hint from the band for us all to open our eyes and see that we've all been taken as suckers. They're laughing all the way to the bank with their handfuls of pennies from all the CD's they've been selling to fools like me. I was so excited when I heard that there was this great new band out there slowly gaining in popularity. Not a quick one hit wonder but supposedly a group with a real unique twist on all the `THE' bands that have been assaulting our poor helpless ears with unimaginative drivel for the past few years. So I've been getting recommendation after recommendation and finally went out and grabbed the CD for myself. You see I hadn't really heard anything by them except a few song intro's and endings as I'm not really a radio listener or watch TV. <br />I've been a huge music fan and collector for the 25 years since I was finally came out from under the musical taste of my older siblings in the late 70's and though it's been difficult to not turn into a grumpy older guy hating anything that's come out in the past 10 years I really see no justification for anything but to hate all these new bands. So to get back to Interpol I thought I'd found the inspiration to keep me going, to keep my mind open to the possibilities of the unknown, to the very hope that the youth of the new millennium had finally developed taste and had stopped ripping off everything that had come before them. It is after all, within the limits of rock and roll, extraordinarily difficult to actually come up with something new. There's only so far you can go with a singer who can't sing, a guitarist who knows 1-2 chords, a drummer that can barely keep time and a bassist that falls asleep form being bored with playing the bass. So where was I? Oh yeah, is there anyone out there making decent music???<br />Interpol clearly are not. You've read the other reviews and you've heard the comparisons. And for those of you who think they're great, I say that's wonderful. Ignorance is bliss isn't it? Luckily you don't mean anything by your ignorance so I can ignore you and move on with my life. For those of you who have heard Interpol and hear nothing but bits and pieces of Post-Punk bands you know where I'm coming from. It's obvious the members of this band have fantastic taste. Come on and admit it. You're comparing them to JOY DIVISION, ECHO &amp; THE BUNNEYMEN, PSYCHEDELIC FURS, KITCHENS OF DISTINCTION, etc. Wow, those are a great list of bands to be compared to. Heck I'd be grinning from ear to ear if I could make music that would remind people of those groups. BUT... is the reminder based on praise for the similarity or distain for the lack of substance behind the similarity? Personally I can't find the substance to support these guys, Hopefully with some maturity and a lessening of desire to sound like so and so the Sophmore release by Interpol will stand on it's own and fulfill my dreams for the youth of America. Of course by that time the Brits will most likely have put out some really fantastic music and when Interpol V2 comes out they'll be long forgotten. Oh well it could be worse. They could be wallowing in absolute obscurity, but in the end they did get my 15 bucks.<BR>P.T. Barnum's great quote applies here. THERE'S A SUCKER BORN EVERY MINUTE.
B000093BDX|3.0|This is okay, but is just an upgrade of &quot;Made in USA&quot;. &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; is the motherlode, but &quot;Endless Summer&quot; is still the best collection. &quot;Very Best&quot; is misleading though. A few personal favorites left off of here...<br />A 2 CD set would at least cover a lot more territory. Esp. if you like the stuff like &quot;Til I Die&quot;, &quot;Forever&quot;, and the other great songs from the late 60s-early 70s. And to me, when I heard Pet Sounds on DVD-Audio, hearing the &quot;singles&quot; isn't the same anymore. <br />I do think that they should put out a video collection on DVD, there are more than enough documentaries explaining their story, it's always frustrating to see the footage spoiled by voiceovers (use the commentary track!). There's plenty of BB footage from TV and film, with and without beards. Maybe Brian, Mike, Al, and Bruce (and part time Beach Boy John Stamos)  can work it out just long enough to put this one together.
B0000DG00B|4.0|It's been an overwhelming year in regards to the quantity of ABB releases/goods in 2003. With a long list including the Beacon dvd, the Instant Live shows, &amp; along with the recent gem&gt; the 9/19/71 archive release... the Atlanta Pop release from Sony. (For more information, check out the offcial ABB web page.)<br />These recordings have been circulating in the trading circles(you know who you are) for a bit, but NEVER in this recording quality. The quality of these recordings is nothing short of breathtaking. There was a neat little promotion for this release through the Sony web site that included a promo poster as well(I think it's over though).<br />Re: the shows<BR>It's an essential recording that is just as important as the Fillmore East album. Their &quot;sound&quot; had yet to reach Fillmore levels, but it's an interesting contrast to the Fillmore shows as well: the large festival atmosphere permeates with an overabundance of energy. Just listening to Duane Allman &amp; Berry Oakley (listen to him on Hoochie Coochie Man) work the crowd is a guilty pleasure for ANY Allman Brothers Band fan. <br />My personal preference between the two shows is the 7/3/70, as I like the flow  of the setlist(even w/ the rain delay). Duane Allman is simply awesome throughout the gig- recommended are Dreams &amp; his solos on Mountain Jam. The guest appearance by Johnny Winter on the second MJ is a mixed bag.... he does not add anything musically, &amp; some may even find him to be a distraction. One should also note, that the Mountain Jam w/ Winter also has been edited down, as the original running time is much longer (in the 40 min. range). How do I know this? Well, I have it, as do countless other traders. So people that have had the show should hold onto their Captain Skipper remaster.... but should get this release as well due to the stunning sound quality &amp; packaging. <br />Although the recent Dickey Betts split has caused a division of sorts to the many faithful in the ABB legion, w/ many claiming who is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, there is a common ground for them all: the original line up. A dear place in the hearts of many, when Duane, Gregg, Dickey, Berry, Butch, &amp; Jaimoe were all playing music together.
B000002BE9|4.0|Every now and then I like to go into my (enormous) cd collection and throw in a cd that I haven't listened to in years. Fiona Apple's \\"Tidal\\" is just one of those cds. As much as I enjoyed \\"When the Pawn...\\", I always thought that \\"Tidal\\" was a vastly superior album. I thought that \\"When the Pawn...\\" lacked the rawness of \\"Tidal\\" and was too polished. I feel like I am watching Fiona perform as I listen to \\"Tidal\\". There is a live feel to the album. Plus with \\"Tidal\\", there is a more jazz/torch sound to the music than on the schizophrenic \\"When the Pawn...\\". Ballads like \\"Sullen Girl\\" and \\"Shadowboxer\\" takes my breath away. Originally when Fiona Apple first came out with \\"Tidal\\", I wasn't too wild about her but the more I heard the songs \\"Shadowboxer\\", \\"Sleep to Dream\\", and \\"Criminal\\", the songs grew on me like a barnacle on a humpback whale. The songs just stuck in my head. I particularly loved the haunting ballads \\"The Child is Gone\\" and \\"Pale September\\". The songs gives me goosebumps just listening to them. I love singing the opening lines to \\"Criminal\\". The lyrics are just fun to sing along to. Of course whenever I listen to \\"Criminal\\", I think of the provovcative music video Fiona shot with famed music video director Mark Romacek (sp?). After listening to \\"Tidal\\", I sure hope that Fiona manges to squeeze out another album sometime during this lifetime. Good things comes to those who wait I suppose.
0451527712|4.0|When I started this book I did not expect to be able to read it without falling asleep in the middle, but when I did begin, I realized I couldn't put it down.  My teacher assigned this book for my english class and I assumed it to be exactly like all the other ones: boring, containing lots of big words, and having a bunch of quizzes over it.  I do indeed have a test to look forward to, but the book was definitely not boring and although it had many &quot;big words&quot; they were not undecipherable.  The plot is well developed and filled with interesting descriptions and events, however, she leaves many loose ends, but I don't want to spoil the story.  Unlike the classic movie, Shelley describes Frankenstein's creature (no... Frankenstein is the SCIENTIST not the monster) as an intellectual, (how else could she use her fancy words...?  ^_^) and as the story progresses, I winced at Frankenstein's stupidity.  Towards the end, one finds it hard to decide which individual to pity, because both have suffered so much.  This novel is one that I truly enjoyed and I hope that you will like it as well.
B0000039LE|5.0|Of all the glut of slasher flicks I have been subjected to watch over the past decade, the original \\"Halloween\\" is by far my favorite film. No movie has made me so wary of walking alone in the dark on Halloween, not to mention being in the dark in my apartment at night. It is amazing how a low-budgeted film like \\"Halloween\\" totally opened the doors for movies such as \\"Friday the 13th\\" and \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\". John Carpenter created a masterpiece. Little did he know at the time...he also made a star out of a then-unknown Jamie Lee Curtis (daughter of Tony Curtis and scream queen herself Janet Leigh). Jamie Lee Curtis' performance as Laurie Strode remains ingrained in my head whenever I see Jamie on television. I was barely a teenager when I saw \\"Halloween\\" for the first time. The movie just freaked me out but in a good way. The music itself is unquestionably the scariest of all horror film scores I have ever heard. You know Michael Myers is coming when you start hearing the music. I think what makes \\"Halloween\\" such a classic is that it just isn't about blood and gore but rather the whole aspect of being stalked by a psychopathic serial killer like Michael Myers. Whenever I think of the late Donald Pleasance, I immediately think of his performace as Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Loomis. Forget Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers is the man. He scares the living daylights out of me than either of those two cheeseball serial killers. With that haunting music and that hideously evil, inside out William Shatner mask, Michael Myers is truly one of the most frightening characters in the whole horror genre. No matter how many times I have watched \\"Halloween\\", the movie surprisingly enough stands up well in over two decades since its release. Truly one of the most scary movies ever made.
0385512104|5.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time\\" by Mark Haddon is about an autistic boy named Christopher Boone. Christopher has a certain schedule that he follows and it begins to fall apart when he finds his neighbor's dog Wellington stabbed by a pitchfork. Since Christopher loves dogs, he becomes curious and decides to become a detective like his favorite mystery character, Sherlock Holmes, to find out who killed Wellington. While searching for clues and gathering all of his suspects in his head, he begins to learn some disturbing information about his family's past.<br />I love this book because it really goes deep into the mind of a boy with autism, find very interesting and intriguing because I myself have a sibling with a form of autism. I often ponder what he might be thinking and what goes on in his head. <br />I believe that anyone who knows a person with autism will be very fascinated with this book. I also think that anyone with a good sense of humor and an interest in mystery novels will find this book very appealing. I know I did. One thing to keep in mind is that once you start this book you will not be able to quit.
B00001IVOF|5.0|I'm rating this album with 5 stars cus is sick from the intro to the last track,If u think they doin'it tight in the present go and check this incredible album.Gangsta beats and mad lyrics from the infamous duo of Queens even that they still droppin' (...) I think that they can't never ever do an album like this again Wicked!!trust me strictly for urban listeners.Big up Queens!!!!!!
0451147960|2.0|I found this book outside a small bookshop while i was strolling the streets of Amsterdam. I was on my summer holidays from Ireland and was quite lost. Being an avid Follet reader i snatched it up immediately. <BR>Lets call a spade a spade. The book lacks depth, character development or any sign of tension. However, it was an entertaining read for a person who was travelling by train around Europe and was often stuck for english material. by Follets own admission the book didn't turn out the way he had planned. nobody would try to argue that this book is anywhere as good as 'pillars' but at the end of the day it is still a good entertaining read.
B0000584V3|5.0|If you have never heard &quot;death metal&quot; before, or are tired of the weakening power of better nu-metal bands, then I have a band for you. Opeth. That is all you need to know. This is the cure I needed after hearing all the junk that has been coming out in main stream rock. This is my first Opeth album, but let me say that even while I'm at war fighting for the greatest country in the world, I have really enjoyed listening to this band. Pure talent through and through. And that is in all aspects from songwriting, to actual singing and orchestration of their music. Yah sure, they growl. But yah know, you can still read the words in the CD cover if you can't figure out what they're saying. But Opeth incorporates actual singing into all their songs. It is excellent. So, put down the junk like Limp Bizkit, new Staind, Stone Sour, and all that junk that Best Buy says is good. Trust a soldier, this is good. Very very good. You will not be disappointed. When I redeploy, I'm buying the rest of their albums. Airborne!
B00008PW2D|5.0|Some things are worth any amount, and I believe that the girls from The City are priceless. The show's witty writing and sexy situations get me and my guy going every time...
0380002930|5.0|This is my most beloved book. I read this book when I was 10 years old in german language, the title is &quot;Unten am Flu&quot;. Now, some :) years lager, I have bought an english version and read it again. English is difficult for me, but this book is definitely the book I love best.
B00005JKC3|5.0|BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!<BR>BUY THIS! If you can't tell I'm using the force to influence your purchase.. seriously.. BUY IT!
B00005JM0B|1.0|The Governator really shows his age in this one. The plot was contrived and the violence gratuitous. Nothing original in this sequel. Rewatch T-2 instead. I want my money back, Ahnold
B00005YXZH|5.0|(4.5 stars) The story behind the creation of Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot album has become the stuff of legend.  The band entered the studio intending to further expand its sound beyond its alt-country roots and, after recording the songs for the album, felt they had successfully accomplished their goal.  However, creative tensions during the recording sessions led to two members leaving the band.  Moreover, their record label was less than enthusiastic about the results, concluding that the songs were commercially unviable and needed to be re-recorded.  When Wilco refused to make any changes, the band purchased the rights to the recordings and left the label.  Wilco then decided to stream the songs for free through their Internet web site and soon a buzz began to grow about the unreleased material.  Record labels anxiously began lining up to be the distributor of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  When the album was finally released, it was met with universal critical acclaim and, to add a delicious bit of irony, has gone on to be the most commercially successful Wilco album yet.<br />In light of the album's fascinating back story and its less-than-positive depiction of the music industry, it would be tempting to give the music on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot more credit than it is actually due.  So the question becomes, \\"Does the music itself justify the hype surrounding the album?\\"  Happily, the answer is \\"yes.\\"  While I'm not prepared to place Yankee Hotel Foxtrot in the pantheon of the greatest albums of all-time (as some critics have), it still is a remarkable album featuring innovative production and great songs by lead singer Jeff Tweedy that continue to get better each time you hear them.<br />Listening to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is like tuning into a distant radio station that plays the coolest music and whose signal occasionally fades in and out and periodically overlaps with competing signals, resulting in sonic dissonance.  The songs emerge out of and then recede back into acacophony of static, random instrumental intrusions, and swirling signal distortion.  Though it could have easily been a distraction, the album's production actually enhances the songs and makes Yankee Hotel Foxtrot a wholly unique listening experience.<br />The album alternates between up-tempo, pop-friendly tunes and more melancholy meditations on love, longing, and loss.  \\"Kettle Pot Black,\\" which borrows a riff from the Cure's \\"In-Between Days,\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Drummer,\\" a whimsical and nostalgic reflection on the relative innocence of youth, are the two most immediately likeable songs.  However, \\"War on War,\\" \\"I'm the Man Who Loves You,\\" and \\"Kamera\\" don't rank too far behind.<br />Of the more pensive numbers, \\"Radio Cures\\"-which makes the bittersweet observation that \\"distance has no way of making love understandable\\"-\\"Jesus, Etc.,\\" a song that just exudes heartache, and \\"Poor Places\\" are the standouts.  The album ends on an optimistic note with \\"Reservations,\\" in which Tweedy discovers that romantic fulfillment is still possible, even if it seems at times that the universe is conspiring against us.<br />With each successive album, Wilco has taken its music in exciting new directions.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot proves that the band is still overflowing with interesting and provocative musical ideas and conclusively demonstrates why Wilco is one of the most essential bands on the pop music scene today.
B000000OE7|3.0|Being a Queen fan, I can understand why the band would want to release &quot;Made In Heaven,&quot; as a final posthumous tribute to Freddie Mercury.<br />Unfortunately, the album only has a few real gems. The rest are lackluster songs that sound inferior to past works, and they feel rushed. You get the impression that Freddie wanted to sing just about anything before his final curtain (which is true), and as a result the quality of this album suffers a bit.<br />Still, it's a worthy addition to any Queen collection. The emotional overtones however make it something that's hard to listen to all the way through without getting depressed.<br />Personally, I think Freddie should have bowed out after &quot;The Show Must Go On,&quot; the final track of &quot;Innuendo!&quot;
B000005RFQ|5.0|Didnt think this album would be THIS good. I mean I'm giving it a 5 STAR RATING here, the most I ever expected was maybe 2 or 3, maybe only finding a few good songs on the CD and no more. WRONG. Just buy this album, simple as that. Maybe it's better if you are more a Deep Purple fan than a Sabbath fan, but just be a metal fan, cause this CD is all that in spades. Someone called this heavier Deep Purple, absolutely correct. It's obvious this line-up would never have continued for all that long but it would have been nice for at least a couple of more albums. Forget production talk, forgot Gillan's dumbass lyrics, he makes Sabbath sound more evil than ever. Dio was a great vocalist but there was nothing sinister about him. Gillan's odd and death-calling screams are what make this album truly scary, ok that and Geezer's bass, it's totally cranked here for max effect. And no lie, I have never in my life heard someone scream so prominately than Gillan on \\"Disturbing the Priest\\" towards the end of the song. Sabbath hasn't had this much inspiration and great songs since Ozzy was kicked out. Forget all you ever used to know about Sabbath or Gillan, get this album because it's heavy metal, GOOD heavy metal, and thats what the world needs in 2003! Favourite Picks: Each track, althought to be honest, if I could toss one it would be \\"Keep It Warm\\" not really bad, but just ehh!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This DVD captures argubly one of the best concerts from one of the most influential bands of all time! The visual and audio presentation of this disc is just absolutely incredible. I would be hard pressed to hear a concert that sounded and looked this good from 1972. The concert was filmed in Pompeii, Italy to an audience of stage hands, cameramen, etc. No fan was even in sight on this film. The only people there where the people on the crew. The director's cut of this film is a very good look into the 1972 time period of Pink Floyd. There are interviews in between songs that reveal the band's individual opinions about the band and the direction it is taking. The extras are okay, but I would rather have seen something a little different like more footage of Pink Floyd in the studio or something. Anyway, this is a must for any Pink Floyd fan!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I had just bought this cd last year i fell in love with it i never got bored. i still love her 1999 debut: &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; but i love the fact that she got to do many genres of music all in one. hip-hop, R&amp;B, SOUL, rock. She wrote most of them and produced one dirrty. even though everone trashed the video and song (which ABSOLUTELY FLOPPED and went 2 #48 on radio) was HELLO: PARTY anthem. I love her new single: The voice within. Such a beautiful ballad. BUT BELIEVE me TRUST me don't believe the other reviews. U won't regret buying this cd.<BR>       fav tracks:<BR>WALK AWAY<BR>FIGHTER<BR>INFATUATION<BR>LOVING ME 4 ME<BR>IMPOSSIBLE<BR>BEAUTIFUL<BR>MAKE OVER<BR>SOAR<BR>GET MINE GET YOURS<BR>DIRRTY<BR>THE VOICE WITHIN<BR>IM OK<BR>KEEP ON SINGIN MY SONG<BR>*****5 stars: wit that said eve though she wears 0 clothes half th time people forget to focus on her talent. so Go and pick it up
B00005JL2O|2.0|The thing about this movie is, when I saw it in the theatrSe it was hillarious and unpredictable. When I got this dvd so my family and me could watch it, we sat throught it in total silence. The movie's fine once, so borrow it or something, it's not worth buying. The special features are okay, but not worth buying it alone for.
B0000508U6|5.0|I bought Parachutes after I bought the second album and I can honestly say that I listen this one WAY more than Rush of Blood.  Every song on this album is great.  I can listen to it over and over and I am still not sick of it.  I can't wait until the Live DVD/CD comes out (I love the unreleased song they are now starting to play on the radio - I think it's called Moses).
6301763041|5.0|This movie takes place in the wild 50's when rock music is starting to grip the youth of America.  The story focuses on Cry Baby (Johnny Depp) and his gang, a group of disfunctional lovable rock outsiders who are just happy to be themselves.  One girl, Allison, wishes to escape her white-bread world, and instantly falls in love with Cry Baby.  However thre are some twists that leave her unable to decide between Cry Baby and her Republican Youth boyfriend.  <br />This is a hilarious musical comedy.  Throughout the whole movie, there are lots of great song and dance numbers which recall the days of wild rockabilly music.  Johnny Depp is a very good musical performer, and I especially liked Amy Locane's performance as Allison.  Since this is a John Waters film, there is a lot of oddball humor in this film.  If you like your comedy a little off center, this one will hit the spot.
6302787068|5.0|This movie is simply spectacular in its imagery, comedy, language, art, and romance.  Watching it transports anyone into a world of pure magic and fantasy, it's just a pure delight.  Everyone's got to give it up for the genie; the creative jokes, quips, and totally random acts he throws out are just hilarious.  My favorite part of the movie...when the nose on the Sphinx falls off...so that's how it happened!  PLEASE PUT THIS MOVIE ON DVD!
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|not a bad song on the CD in my opinion.  a front to back listen through without a song that should be skipped.  the only bad thing is that it is only 33 minutes long.  definitely a must buy, you will not be disappointed.
B00005JKC3|4.0|The movie is incredible! The special effects fantastic. The story line a bit sluggish to start but you get past that. The comic-book style is very different but effective and fun.<BR>PARENTS - definitely pay attention to the rating and don't slack on this one. It is PG-13. Don't hedge and let the younger kids watch it - or if you do - expect some nightmares. Scenes of child abandonment from a 2-year-old's perspective, animal lab testing that gets graphic, parents fighting violently behind a closed door from a 5-year-old's perspective and then just the general anger management the good doctor experiences by letting it all out in green. <BR>My husband loved it! I liked it. With all the marketing of Hulk kids toys, it seems to set this up as something it is not.<BR>Adults and *older* teens ENJOY! The little guys need to go to bed before you hit play on this one.
B00005JKC3|4.0|You've probably read all you need to about this flick from the other reviews, but I thought I should address the criticism that The Hulk doesn't have enough action.  You'll probably be disappointed if you're expecting the same sort of near-nonstop wham bang thrills as we saw in 2000's Spiderman.  However, if you're even slightly more patient than the &quot;average&quot; moviegoer, the characters scenes in this movie are acted genuinely enough that when you get to the action sequences, they're that much more intense and rewarding.  When I saw the Hulk in the theater, my jaw fell open at the beginning of the desert battle and stayed there.  Impressive stuff.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I do not understand how a person can be reborn in the matrix to have such imense powers. I would however understand it if this \\"person\\" were a program that were triggered by the mainframe to restart the Matrix. <BR>I believe in the chain theory, that there are several Matrixes in the system. This would validate how he can excist in the \\"real world\\". <BR>The reason the programer was surprised was because he choose Trinity in front of destroying the matrix. I think The One, the program, has evolved and developped feelings, something that is unknown to the rest of the program. So, in the end, it is the love that saves us!<BR>But who knows. We'll see in one week
0060007737|4.0|I write reviews on Amazon rather avidly. When I started reading this particular book, I knew it would be a good number to review. So I started marking everything in the book that I disagreed with or that I felt was worth commenting on.<br />That the Ries duo relies on sweeping statements (e.g., &quot;Quality of a product doesn't matter. It's all about brands.&quot;) hardly made my intentions any easier. Needless to say, my copy of 22 Immutable Laws of Branding is riddled with lots of ink and copious sidenotes. There is a lot I said &quot;Really?&quot; to while reading.<br />But maybe that's the thing I adore about Ries Inc.  Their books are anything but boring manuals on a topical issue so relevant to almost anyone in business. I was &quot;involved&quot; with this book like I have seldom been with a work of non-fiction. I adored and went all retrospective with the &quot;Law of the Name&quot; and the &quot;Law of Globalism&quot;. The writing is trippy, semi-provocative and hence absolutely delectable in a piece of work such as this!<br />Do I recommend it? Wholeheartedly. A wonderfully satisfying read. Just keep your discerning senses about you and think twice before wrapping your (brand management) career around all the advice this book proffers.<br />Noteworthy: The whole book is also available in a PDF version, if you are not particularly averse to on-screen reading.
B000002UUX|5.0|\\"Rust in Peace\\" features the same complex, rip-roaring-tear-your-eardrums-out-of-your-head-and-stomp-on-them-lather-rinse-repeatedly-because-the-music-is-THAT-GOOD style of Megadeth's previous album, \\"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\\"  And guess what, Dave turns his mike up in this one for most of the album!  The only songs I needed to dredge the book out on this one were 'Five Magics' and 'Lucretia'.  The Mustaine-Menza-Ellefson-Friedman lineup blow your 'drums away as much as the Mustiane-Poland-Ellefson-Samuelson combo from \\"Peace Sells...\\".<br />But don't take MY word for it...
B00005JMFO|4.0|My daughter has a very very small part in this film, so we were luck enough to be invited to the cast and crew screening in London.<br />I did love this film. It made me cry, laugh out loud and I left the Theatre with a smile all over my face. The film has 8 intertwined stories, which all come to this fantastic ending, that makes you feel good about the world. There is a fare amount of nudity, all of which is of a sexual nature, Although this is very funny I just thought it a little out of place compared with the rest of the film. The shame is because of this, it will be a good few years before my daughter can see the film she appeared in (she's only 7). Not every one of the stories has an unrealistic happy ending, this makes it more believable and leaves you wondering what happens to the characters next.<br />I do recommend people who believe Christmas to be special to see this film. It's a perfect Christmas film for adults.
B000002V0Q|5.0|No matter which band you like better, no matter how much you're pro or anti Dave Mustaine, you still can't help but smile at all the imbedded shots he takes towards his former band, the beast known as &quot;Metallica&quot;.<br />This album finally corrects Dave's microphone problems that plagued &quot;Peace Sells...&quot; and parts of &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;.  Dave's growing vocal range is evident on this album as well, and I prefer his singing on this album to it's predecessors.<br />Am I the only one who absolutely hated 'Sweating Bullets' the first time I heard it?  And the second time?  And the third time?  It took me several YEARS (like six or seven) before I came around to liking this song, and now I love it as much as the rest of the songs.  Strange...<br />Speaking of strange, did you know Megadeth was on the &quot;Super Mario Bros: The Movie&quot; soundtrack?  Yep, there they are with 'Breakpoint'.  I always thought this should have been between 'Foreclosure of a Dream' and 'Sweating Bullets' on the CD... what's that?  Yes, I actually DO own a cassette copy of the SMB soundtrack.  No, I will not go into further detail on why I own that cassette...<br />'Architecture of Agression' is one of the best songs I've ever heard.<br />This is yet another Megadeth classic.  Third album in a row that does not contain a bad song.  I like that in a band.
B000053VAZ|4.0|This movie was just too cute!  It is a simple romantic comedy.  It has a lot of light humor and just brightens your day.  The cast is spectacular, Johnny Depp is as handsome as ever.  This movie is just wonderful.
B00005JLYW|1.0|Sad to say but this is one of the worst movie I've ever seen. I regret paying $4 to rent this movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched this series and was getting seriously hooked when they started to move it around.  If they (FOX) would have left it alone it would have grown and been tweaked like most shows get after the first season.  This show had a much better set of characters then \\"Enterprise\\" and it was alot more fun to watch.  I agree that the western part was a bit overdone but if you were paying attention, the story was starting to get into the space aspect alot more, and the story was developing into something to keep people hooked until the next episode came on.  Rumor is a movie is going to be made to help sort things out and wrap up the storyline, I will see it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|i happen to think the film is cool... everything is pefect and exciting, but i don't understand why they have to show so much of arwen when, as everyone's been saying, her role wasn't that much of a big deal in the books anyway!!!
B00000IMCW|1.0|How can any sane human being who's not a child or a complete moron give praise to this movie and keep a straight face??<BR>This is not only an extremely bad horror flick, it's just an incredibly, excrutiatingly horrible movie!  I'm not sure how this can even be classified as a horror when it doesn't even come close to raising a single hair on my head.  The directing was ludicrous and the acting was just gawd awful (even for a horror flick)!  Acting and directing that poorly should really be a crime.  And as for the script...hmm... I don't think they wrote one but rather just improvised because it has to take some sorta effort and thinking to write up a script doesn't it?? <br />About the movie:<br />Four of the stupidest characters are having the time of their lives in a shopping mall full of zombies.  Sounds scary?  Not at all.  These characters end up going on a shopping spree and when they are surrounded by a dozen or so zombies, they simply push the zombies aside.!*&amp;%??  If they get too annoyed by the zombies then they would just punch the lights out of the zombies and continue on.  This is pretty much the entire movie.  And as ineffective as these zombies seem to be at killing, 2 main characters were actually dumb enough to allow themselves to get bitten by the zombies.  And there's one ridiculous part where a biker gang enters the mall and starts a shoot-out with the main characters.<br />ABSOLUTELY P-R-E-P-O-S-T-E-R-O-U-S!<br />Hilight of the film? : <BR>   <BR>Yes there were alot of gore, but if being grossed out is all you're looking forward to, then maybe there's a slim chance you might actually enjoy this movie.  However, the gory parts appeared very fake and unrealistic.  The zombies LITERALLY looked just like normal human beings except for the paleness.  I don't see how a person who's been painted lightly blue can look scary. lol<br />This film bears no logic or intellgence.  It was so bad that I wouldn't even consider it to be a movie.  It's simplya complete INSULT and DISGRACE to the film industry and to sanitary human beings.<BR>I would prefer not to give this movie a star but that was the minimum rating I could give it.  In fact even 0 stars would be a huge compliment to this movie and an over-rating.  This movie (or so called movie) really deserves -4 stars......... actually, I give it -5 stars for being so damn long! <br />btw: If you're a horror-comedy fan, I highly recommend Evil Dead 2.  Steer clear of this garbage and don't let it waste 2+ hours of your life.
B00000DFRS|5.0|I love this whole CD. Heartbreak hotel.My love is your love. All the songs are just the best since the (greatest love of all). I related to this album Its not right but it was okay!! I cannot believe that this album only peak at #13 but sold well over 3 million in the U.S.. GO whitney..
6305014140|1.0|I thought that I was going to get a good action flick. I was horribly mistaken though.<BR>First thisngs first; WAY to much sex!  I could hardly watch as the main female lead got raped almost every 20 minutes.  Thats not my idea of entertainment.  There was a whole bunch of violence too.  It seemed like the whole movie was revolvong around sex and violence.  There is NO PLOT to this movie!!  If you like loads of sex and senseless violence, this is your movie.  If not, I'll advise you not to watch.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love me some C.A thats what i call her here. This album rocks. good songs, voice remains powerful......   So far her videos have been off the hook!. But theres only one problem!!  Yes she can sing,dance but needs to slow her role. Her reputation will grow higher than record sales and her talent, and thats bad. But MADONNA has done that already and still with us today!!   GO C.A with her now triple platinum album..
6305014140|1.0|I thought that I was going to get a quality movie and a good action flick.  But I was surprised and amazed(not in the good way either.)  Don't let any child near this one!!<BR>First things first; way too much sex!!  It seems like the whole plot is made up around sex. I could not stand to watch the female lead get herself raped almost every 20 minutes!! Also, the violence is pointless. One of the few things that I like is that the English voice actors didn't drive me nuts. And there is some depth when the main characters confront each other about their feelings.  Every thing else is sex and violence.  Oh yeah, did I mention plot?  There is none.  So if you like senseless violence and lots of sex then this is your movie.  If not don't even try to watch it.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's second CD, Nevermind, changed the course of popular music in the early 1990's. Lead by Kurt Cobain on vocals and guitar, Nirvana produces a truly versatile sound. Cobain shows range of vocal styles by ranging from a somber and heartfelt voice to controlled rage. The drums of Dave Grohl and the bass of Krist Novoselic holds the songs together to form beautiful and catchy melodies.<BR>            Nevermind  is filled with musically versatile songs. Songs like \\"Polly\\" and \\"Lithium\\" showcase the melodies that are under the hard and abrasive songs such as \\"Breed\\" and \\"Territorial Pissings\\". The raw sound and the combination of Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl produces an amazing product that stands the test of time.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Loved the first one so I couldn't wait to get reloaded. For sure the effects where well done but perhaps to long and drawn out and actually became tedious and boring, and as for the Zion segment?  I thought I was having a flash back of the scene in the Ten Commandments where the people of Israel can't seem to wait for Moses and have an orgy.  Also all the caracters seemed to lose what made them special individually. What a disapointment
B000096IB6|5.0|Stan Lee may not have created Daredevil my comic lore is too rusty to remember, but as the name synonomous with all things Marvel this movie should have made him proud.<BR>Movies adapted from comic books have, let's face it been a hit &amp; miss proposition since Superman III or Batman &amp; Robin hit theatres. Yet Hollywood to its credit (or fault) has continued to mine the rich material provided by comics transporting the medium to the big screen.<BR>I was little wary about this movie, not that I doubted it would have great special effects or choreography which it does; but I was not as sure about the casting.<BR>Kudos to Ben Affleck not my favorite actor but he did a fine job portraying Matt Murdoch/Daredevil. And when I heard Jennifer Garner was Electra I thought why not Eliza Dushku who has many same qualities that Electra has, but Garner blew my mind she WAS Electra, not often you find such good acting in comic adaptations but it was superb.<BR>This movie was a little darker than Spiderman, as well it should be as he's darker hero, overall that may have been one of reasons I loved movie so much. One word for Daredevil after all previous verbiose ones haha AWESOME!
B00007E8V4|4.0|This CD is kinda thrown together, unlike the brilliantly pieced together Toxicity.  Being a CD of tracks that weren't necessarily intended to be released, it is full of highs and lows...though the lows are by no means horrible.  It might not be a 5-star album, but it is a solid album nonetheless.<br />My favorite track on the album is Mr. Jack.  It has such a haunting intro, and the whole song has the unpredictable System of a Down feeling.  It is the only song on this album that I would put right into the &quot;mandatory listen&quot; category.  Innervision, Chicnstu, and A D D are the other extremely strong tracks on the album.  Not saying that the rest is bad, its just that none of them really stand out.<br />It isn't as strong as Toxicity or the Self-Titled album, but this is still something any fan of SOAD should pick up.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I like this cd. It is different from Is this it, but at the same time it has the same essence. Great songs include 12:51, under control, and the end has no end. Seems to include a bit of Julian's experience of the response to the first album, but also, this album takes 3 steps forward and no steps back. Every song is good, and to comment on the 33 minutes of play, yes, it does seem longer because the cd absorbs one in, but also, the beatles have albums the same length. 5 stars.
B0000C0FJB|2.0|I love Rush.  After 20 years of enjoying and respecting this band, that Love still doesn't waver one iota.  But even our esteemed loved ones make mistakes.  This CD is packed with great songs and is a document of a fantastic tour, but the sound quality is truly AWFUL.  It is beyond my comprehension that a band which has released some of the best sounding albums in history (Moving Pictures, anyone?) would be satisfied with the production of this live album.  The mix is EXTREMELY guitar heavy (I'm a guitarist who idolizes Lifeson, mind you), the bass is muffled and lacks punch, and the drums are one-dimensional.  The vocals are nearly inaudible, and some keyboard &quot;moments&quot; from the 80's &amp; 90's material are stripped to the most annoying tones in the mix.  The audience, enthusiastic and fun as they may have been, should not be involved as much as they are in the production; at times, they're louder than the music.  Oddly enough, the 2 &quot;bootleg&quot; tracks, taken directly from the soundboard mix, are the best sounding on the set.  As true Rush fans know, the band is one of the best live acts out there, from performance to sound quality.  This is very non representative of even their mediocre work.  Good for the diehard collector, unwise spending for anyone else.  Hopefully the DVD is better.
B000002UB3|5.0|It is nearly impossible for me to name the \\"best\\" Beatles album but if I had to choose, then it would have to be Abbey Road. Not only are the songs excellent, but the album has a hypnotic mood. Abbey Road contains some of the Beatles' classics, including George's two gems \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", John's intense \\"Come Together\\" and \\"She's So Heavy\\", Ringo's heartwarming \\"Octopus's Garden\\" and Paul's gut wrenching \\"Oh! Darling\\" and the brilliant \\"Golden Slumbers/Carry that Weight/The End\\" medleys. The album's final message couldn't be more appropriate than the classic:    And in the end/The love you take/Is equal to the love/You make    With sage lyrics like these, is it any wonder why the Beatles continue to touch our lives?
B000007T2Z|3.0|Warning.  Do not drop acid to this music unless you are a trained, experienced shaman. This music definitely not for beginners.  It will take you places whether you like it or not and a lot of them, while interesting, sound like places I'd never want to be.  The \\"black\\" in their name undoubtedly refers to their mood, as none of what is on this album sounds anything like what we typically recognize as African influenced.  It's tempting for me to assume that Umma Gumma was GYBE's favorite Pink Floyd album but I wouldn't be surprised if they'd never heard it when they made this record.  While definitely influenced by the band, I doubt they'd have risked being called \\"copycats\\" by being intentionally as similar in style and approach.  It will be interesting to see whether they develop some pop sensibilities down the road or rather stick with these dark, amorphous swirlings that are actually better suited for the cinema than the home stereo.  This album has drawn a lot of acclaim in independent and underground circles since its release.  One reason is probably that it appears to actually be a singular, cohesive body of work, like an opera.  Perhaps this one tells the story of mankind's post-apocalyptic evolution.  Scary.
B000002P6R|4.0|Perhaps it was obvious that The Who was in its twilight years even before drummer Keith Moon's untimely death in 1978. Nevertheless, their album at the time WHO ARE YOU (1978) was their strongest release since WHO'S NEXT, mainly because it was a much better attempt at eschewing rock opera excess than 1975's self-consciously stripped-down (and appropriately titled) THE WHO BY NUMBERS. But with Moon's death, The Who unofficially went on hiatus as their feature-length documentary THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT hit theaters, and the three surviving Who members concentrated on solo work (with guitarist Pete Townshend having the most luck). In 1981, the Who decided to greet the new decade with a fresh approach (and a new drummer) on what would prove to be their penultimate studio album FACE DANCES.<br />It's almost a moot point that finding a drummer to rival the prowess of Keith was impossible, and for all intents & purposes, the Faces' Kenney Jones certainly had some big shoes to fill. While he certainly is not the primal genius Keith had been behind the skins, he still gets the job done & manages to make a good impression. Too bad he arrived at a time when it seemed The Who were no longer giving their all to their craft.<br />FACE DANCES was surely not the Who's best-selling album, yet it did feature their highest charting single in some time. \\"You Better You Bet\\" was far from just the token hit that Who albums had been providing by this time for it definitely is one of the band's finest recordings of their entire career. The band just seems to be running on all cylinders here: Roger Daltrey is more enthusiastic in his singing than ever before; Pete seems to have toned down his windmill theatrics on guitar, but his songwriting was still on point as ever; the late, great John Entwhistle still stakes his claim as the loudest bassist in rock with another great, fat performance; again, Kenney Jones seems more interested with keeping things together than showing off, but that's just fine. While \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" is still #1 in my heart of favorite Who songs, \\"You Better You Bet\\" is a very close second.<br />Unfortunately, that song was the only flat-out outstanding track on FACE DANCES, which mostly contained songs that were merely good or just servicable. Pete had just had huge success with his solo album EMPTY GLASS (1980), and it seems he had used up all his aces on that album (or at the very least was saving them for his next one 1982's ALL THE BEST COWBOYS HAVE CHINESE EYES, which had a song called \\"Face Dances\\"). Therefore, The Who seemed to be getting the leftovers. \\"Don't Let Go The Coat\\" is indication that perhaps Pete was still heavily influenced by the spirituality of Meher Baba even a decade after the fad died. Other songs like \\"Cache Cache\\", \\"Did You Steal My Money\\", \\"How Can You Do It Alone\\", \\"Daily Records\\" & \\"Another Tricky Day\\" are either passably good or just too weird & full of in-jokes to really be enjoyed.<br />John Entwhistle had been the only other really good songwriter in the Who, so I guess he was asked to step in when Pete appeared to be running low on creativity. Problem was, John had the same problem as well. His two contributions \\"The Quiet One\\" & \\"You\\" are loud rockers that sound great & prove that The Who could still shred wallpaper this late in the game, but lyrically, John just seems to be walking through his paces. Even the Ox had started to lumber by now.<br />FACE DANCES is really a 3-star album at best, but the bonus tracks (2 of them, really) on here improve on it considerably, thus adding another star. The short, demented \\"I Like Nightmares\\" appears to be Pete's attempt at writing a John Entwhistle song filled with off-the-wall humor, and he does a pretty good job. If only it lasted longer than its short 3 minutes. \\"It's In You\\" sounds promising enough, but it sounds like it is still in demo form & not yet ready to see the light of day. But the coup de grace is \\"Somebody Saved Me\\", an epic, heartwrenching ballad featuring one of Pete's greatest vocals (from someone who didn't do enough of them on Who albums). The song would be re-recorded later for ALL THE BEST COWBOYS..., but The Who's version is just as stellar. With Pete still deep into his addictions at the time, maybe he was very optimistic that someone would indeed save him. The live versions of \\"How Can You Do It Alone\\" & \\"The Quiet One\\" show once again that they sound better on stage, but that doesn't necessarily make them memorable.<br />I'm sure there are a great many Who fans who think the band should have quit while they were ahead on WHO ARE YOU, but that would have been taking the easy way out. Or simply, they just weren't ready to stop yet & wanted to see if they could still do a good job without a crucial original member. Sure enough, FACE DANCES may have proved even more that the Magic Bus was sputtering out by this point, but when you consider the album that came after this, even with its visible faults, it would have been a much better note on which to end a career.enching ballad featuring one of Pete's greatest vocals (from someone who didn't do enough of them on Who albums).

B00009TB5G|5.0|By the way, other reviewers, the Two Towers refers to Saruman's Tower and Sauron's Tower, not Gondor's towers. Saw that in another review.<br />It is nearly impossible to capture everything a book is to the readers for two reasons: poetic license and differing memories.  It's important to watch this movie as an incredible, epic attempt to recreate the book, and enjoy it.  No, it doesn't always follow the book that close and takes some liberties, but it does expose many more people to the genre, which is great!<br />The world is very well done, the acting is great. For a three hour movie about a twelve hour book, I loved it.  The main elements of the story are kept intact and the movie keeps a pace and doesn't drag us down in any long, slow distractions.  <br />I highly recommend this movie.  Please also check out Fate Rides Wicked in the book section!
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Outstanding effort! Without getting to gushy, this is exactly what I'd hoped for!!! The Strokes have defined their style and stayed &quot;true&quot; without making a replica of the ingenius first album, and without forsaking their style. Their style: relentless grooving yet metronomical guitars with oddly harmonically diverse bass ala Bill Wyman meets Robert Smith...And the sharp snarey drum. Rhythmn guitar on the beat always, lead guitar so saturated it sounds like a overdriven keyboard with a bend knob. Vocals, melodically addictive, yet sung through a harmonica mic through a 6&quot; japanese radio speaker, somehow...11 songs isn't even half enough...Love it!!!!
B0000CD5I6|4.0|I just bought the latest albums by Jethro Tull and Deep Purple, my two -all time- favorite bands. Jethro Tull have decided to put out a Xmas album and it is pleasant enough and I'm sure it will come in handy as the holidays approach, but I was almost disappointed once the disc ended, but on second listen I was happy with it. I was glad to hear Ian and company not perform standards like Jingle Bells and Silent Night. Jethro Tull seems right for the job and it's a good Xmas album. The Moody Blues have also put out a Xmas album (Oct. 28) called December. <br />On the other side of the coin is Bananas by Deep Purple. Wow! A consistently brilliant album is out on the market. I absolutely loved this album on first listen and still love it after a dozen hearings. There is so much going on below the surface, but very assessable at the same time. Ian Gillan sings great throughout and with lots of his own harmonies, like on Never A Word, a piece of folk rock meets Baroque. Contact Lost (Space Shuttle Columbia tribute) gives this CD the most stunning ending we could possibly experience. Deep Purple (as well as the Tull) are the real deal! Bananas is a winner, from start to finish! This has got to be the best album released in 2003.<br />4 stars: Xmas album<BR>5 stars: Bananas
B000055XMF|4.0|Quadrophenia is not so much an account of mod (or modernisim as it was originally known). It is much more of a conceptual piece centering itself around the experiences of Jimmy Cooper, a multi faceted personality, with the mod aspects giving a base to his predicaments. It was a story developed by Pete Townshend in the 70's with the 60's mod movement in mind. This is further developed by director Franc Roddam's use of a contempory setting. Some people have criticised the film for not being firmly rooted in the 60's, but I think the crossover works well, allowing the mix to sit in with the overall themes of the film. By using this approach the film can also unite people form different generations. I think this is important. And now to the film.<br />Quadrophenia opens where it closes, above the clifftops of brighton. From here we are transported back to sheppards bush where we are introduced to Jimmy Cooper(played by Phil Daniels). We see the surface side to his charachter as he enters the goldhawk club, well dressed and self assured. A true Mod. As the film continues though we see him repond differently to various situations, be it his home life, at work, with his friends or when chasing his dreamgirl Steph ( played by Leslie Ash.). He is basically dissatisfied and in search of what's elusive. It is during the second half of the film we see this becoming more obvious. Set in Brighton on a bank holiday weekend Jimmy and his friends join together with an army of mods, for a weekend of dressing, dancing, pills and punchups. It is when Jimmy gets evicted from the dance for jumping of a balcony he begins to drift away from the numbers. For me this is where Quadrophenia begins to apply its poetic quality. Jimmy wanders the beach at night until dawn by which point the dancing has ended and the majority of mods are re-congregating at the beach front cafe for a quick egg sandwich and the days itinerary. It is here Jimmy reconnects and the day unfolds.<br />Heading for Brighton peer, with Jimmy in centrefield, the mods unite with their chants of glory not only atracting media glare but also the attention of their stylistic opposites, the rockers. A huge battle erupts and the beach is invaded by mods and rockers at war with each other with not even the sea being able to separate them. It is Jimmy's role in all of this that is the most significant. Having joined up with Steph, he becomes euphoric, reinacting the violence for her. \\" I was there\\". For Jimmy it in this moment that everything becomes crystalised. He is a mod, he is part of the action and now Steph is by his side.This is further enhanced by the film's most famous scene when Jimmy and Steph enter an alleyway and have sex together.<It is when leaving the alleyway that Jimmy gets nabbed by the police and things start to go wrong. It is only when the Ace Face ( played by Sting) gets locked in the same van that things seem a little brighter. This does not last.Upon returning home from court, Jimmy is confronted in a series of incidents that will lead to his undoing. Firstly by his mother who spots his picture in the paper, then by his pompous boss who tells him how grateful he should be for being allowed to peform menial tasks, and finnaly by Steph who has now deserted him for His so called best mate Dave ( played by Mark Wingett)All of this ending in personal destruction.With no place to call home and no one to be with,  Jimmy Returns to Brighton where for that short period everthing was golden. The film now becomes truly poetic, by replacing dialogue for images, of a beatiful wind swept Brighton beach, upon which Jimmy treks and wonders where it all went wrong. It is here he makes his final discovery that will allow him to make his ultimate decision.<br />Quadrophenia is a doccument of a time and place that for the most part no longer exists. The film plays an important role in allowing us to visit that place. In saying this I think the real relevance of the film lies in its exploration of youthful themes. Jimmy Cooper is a complex character but he is no more complex than any person in search of a real identity or an ideal place. It is for this reason I think it Quadrophenia will be relevant to future generations, to Identify with and to enjoy. Quadrophenia is a wonderfully youthful cinematic composition.<br />             EXTRAS<br />UPPERS; There are quite a few interesting things contained on this special edition of Quadrophenia.<BR>The US trailer is good ( except for the dialogue)<BR>An interwiew with Sting is also interesting ( Pity it wasn't Phil Daniels though)<BR>The directors commentary and archival photo's were of real interest to me. Nice one.<BR>Also the trip form London to Brighton was great fun as was the 'Are you a mod or a rocker quiz\\"<BR>Finally the Restoration which on the whole was good though a little dark visually in certain places.<br />DOWNERS: This is a big disappointment.

B00005V9HA|5.0|Oh My God! RE-ANIMATOR is the kind of movie that totally strips you of your ability to turn away or stop the movie! I popped in the DVD only to watch a few minutes and found myself watching the film all the way through, only stopping to rewind scenes that I missed! RE-ANIMATOR is the funniest and goriest horror-comedy ever made! Awesome gore effects and hilarious one-liners; my favorite is &quot;You'll never get credit for my discovery; whose gonna believe a talking head? Get a job in a sideshow.&quot; I also liked the performances in this movie, especially Jeffery Combs' as Dr. West, although Dr. West comes off as a jerk. Plus, RE-ANIMATOR is scary too!<BR>You must get the Millennium Edition while you can. This 2-disc treatment is the best that this movie has gotten in years since the 10th Anniversary Laserdisc! Awesome picture and sound quality! Also, you get the original trailer and several TV-spots; alternate and extended scenes (for the R-rated video release); documentaries; and the isolated score! If you're a fan of '80s horror, RE-ANIMATOR is required viewing if you haven't seen it already. Tell 'em Dr. Herbert West sent 'ya!

B000002GK1|5.0|In my opinion, Badmotorfinger is best Soundgarden album.  The group really found its sound here for the first time on a full album.  Layered guitar textures by Thayil and amazing vocals by Cornell really pull this one through.  The album starts strong with Rusty Cage and ends with New Damage and leaves you wanting more.  Sure, theres some filler in the middle, but this is an album that all grunge fans NEED to own.
0790744295|4.0|Just watched Creepshow on DVD the other night.  This is one of my favorite horror movies.  The stories are great...both funny and scary, with a wonderful cast of familiar faces who all seem to be having a good time with the material.<br />Although this is one of the DVD's you can pick up very cheap, the picture quality is terrible.  I found the first story to be crystal clear, then suddenly the rest of the movie looked like a VHS quality print.  Blurry and dark overall.  It's a shame really, because this is an awesome horror movie.  Creepshow definitely deserves a remastered print at the very least.  Deleted scenes and some commentary by Romero and/or King would be nice too (Come on, what else is George working on at the moment and Steve is technically retired!).  Bottom line is, who knows when or if we may ever see a SE edition of this great film.  Until then, for the price, it's worth it to have in your collection, but be warned: it's overall quality pales compared to a lot of other DVD's out there.
B000089RVR|5.0|This cd is great.<br />All the songs are meant to reflect a part your life (past, present and future...).<br />Great melodies, great voice, great composition.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Definitely in the running for my favorite record of the year. Room On Fire gives the casual, as well as the die-hard Strokes fan, exactly what they have been wanting. The second record is really just an extension of the first with a little more umph put in. They added a guitar here, a new keyboard there, but really haven't mucked with the formula too much.<br />Room On Fire does it's best to stand alone next to it's predecessor. The overall record is a tad bit more slick and polished, but that doesn't get in the way of their sound. Some of the tracks like Reptilia have an overall more complex feel, again, more production work. Another track called Automatic Stop, gets it's inspiration from early 80's Blondie and a smidge of Reggae flavor (just a smidge though). <br />Room On Fire is rather short, a few minutes shorter than the first, but it is one of those discs that will be on repeat more often than not. There simply are no stinkers on it. Each tune bops along until it's time for the next one to start up. Some of the tunes that are already instant Strokes favs include the new single, 12:51, past live favorites like Between Love and Hate (which went under the title, Ze Newie, on most show setlists) and Meet Me In The Bathroom are already well known to most fans. I happen to really like how the finished version of The Way It Is came out after I had heard live a number of times. Like I said this is everything a Strokes fan is asking for and a bit more thrown in for good measure. Each new song could have appeared on the debut, and it wouldn't have stuck out at all. All this is a good thing if you ask me. Hey, if it isn't broke...
B0000A36J5|5.0|No movie protrayal can match a good book, but Jackson's attempt is the best ever effort in the history of movies.  His team's enormous amount of research, attention to detail and love of the original literary work comes through.  Yes, some plot lines are altered in minor ways to keep the off-screen characters part of the movie as it still has to serve an audience that didn't read the books, but overall anyone must admire their work.  Yes, all of us Tolkien fanatics would love to see a movie of 139 hours in length that shows every scene and includes every line of dialog from the books, including Tom Bombadil and the everything else, exactly as written, but that obviously isn't going to happen.<br />Sam - please read the books again as many of your review details are wrong.  Gollum does have an internal struggle of Smeagol vs. Gollum, it's right in the book.  It is pretty obvious in the movie that Sam is disgusted by Gollum and Frodo is more pitying him, same as the book.  There is the conflict between Arwen and Elrond about her relationship with Aragorn and her struggle with remaining elfen and going West vs. staying with Aragorn.  But it is subplot not detailed in the books as much, but Jackson is trying to flesh out characters.  Aragorn does have doubts and struggles about coming out of hiding to rise to the thrown, he sets this up more in movie #2 for movie #3 but it is there in the books.  Saruman does have control over nameless character \\"A\\" which nameless \\"B\\" breaks with a struggle and in the movie he has to make it obvious (over-do-it) what is going on or movie-goers would go \\"what the heck?\\" since they aren't reading the book.  Saruman does rip down all the trees and into forest which P-O's the Ents, moving them into action, which WAS inspired by Tolkien's dislike of the industrial age (more to come in movie #3 I'm sure as in the books).  There are warg-riding (i.e. big rats) orcs (even back in the Hobbit books) - READ THE BOOKS AGAIN!!!  <br />But some variations are needed for a movie version for the general public; I'll agree with you that all were not needed _FOR_US_, but there is the Joe Blow ticket buyer he is trying to entertain as well, to actually make money on this colossal project (which was completed, by the way, before movie #1 came out and was still a gamble then; hindsight only shows he could have gotten away with \\"less\\", perhaps).<br />It's easy to tear down pick on every detail especially when movies are based on books.  But this has to be (with the others in the series) some of the best movies ever made, and clearly the best attempt to mirror books on the screen; especially with the fantasy setting and special effects requirements.  \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is another great adaption, but it's not so hard to find a small Southern town and a guy named \\"Boo\\" as it is to create Balrogs, Orcs, Rings of Power and the Eye that Never Sleeps.  Give him a break.
0321200683|5.0|I review a lot of books, and I've written a few myself :-). This is an absolutely terrific book. Gregor and Bobby provide you with a timeless foundation to understand the future of EAI. While some authors use patterns inappropriately (as a way to boost sales, perhaps?), Gregor and Bobby use patterns to effectively capture and share their tremendous wisdom and experience. I learned a great deal in reviewing and reading this book, and I look forward to relying on its advice in the years to come. BUY IT NOW -- You'll be glad you did.
0374384576|5.0|Can you recognize a witch?  \\"The Witches\\" by Roald Dahl tells how to be able to recognize a witch.   As a child I wondered if witches were real, so this was a great book for me to read.   I really liked it because it is adventurous and full of fantasy.  A young boy gets to experience magic first hand when he is turned into a mouse.  The physical description of witches is very detailed and imaginative.   The story takes place in Europe.  I never got bored or felt like the story was too slow, so it was hard for me to put the book down.  I actually felt like I was the main character.   I loved it.  With only 208 pages and some pictures, this book is a must read!!
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|Does this kind of rock music get anybody excited?  Or does it just make you feel cool because the Strokers are &quot;cool&quot;?  Of course the media loves this band, because the media is based in NY.  Jack White alone can rock the holy hell out of these tards.  There's nothing new in their sound, it's just different compared to what else is out there.  Lame.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|This album has grown on me so much since the first listen... it is every bit as good as Origin of Symmetry (an album so good I thought they might not surpass it), and after about 50 more listens, it may leave OOS in the dust... a must for any fan of modern music.<br />I wish I had a chance to see these guys live without booking a trip to the UK!!!<br />PS do not listen at quiet levels.... only listen to it cranked!
038572179X|5.0|One of the best books I have lately read. Wonderful style, the author Mr. Mac Ewan is a magician of the pen.<BR>The story spans from the 30s to the late 90s and can be divided into three parts.<BR>The first part deals with the description of Briony's family: the Tallis, their house, their friends, their life which goes on quietly. Then the crime, Briony's crime against her sister's innocent lover. A kind of silly jealousy leads Briony to accuse the young man of child abuse.<BR>I think this is the best part of the book, the characters are so well defined, the author is able to write about their feelings in a kind of &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; which lets the reader get deep inside their minds, especially Briony's mind, because, after all, this is Briony's story.<BR>The second part is about the horrors of World War Two and about Briony as a young woman, a nurse in a London Hospital, she has to tend to the wounded soldiers, and here life is very hard and painful and this is, maybe, her atonement.<BR>In the third part we find Briony again, an old woman who is going to fall into dementia, she outlived all the others still bearing the burden of her crime to the last.<BR>Briony is not a hateful character, she was just a spoiled child who didn't even think,at the time, what her action would lead to.<BR>This is a book I heartily recommend to all those who appreciate good literature.
B00000K19E|4.0|A COMPUTER HACKER [KEANU REEVES] FINDS OUT ABOUT AN ALTERNATE REALITY. VERY VERY ENTERTAINING FILM. FILLED WITH EXPLOSIVE SPECIAL EFFECTS AND FILLED WITH EVEN BETTER FIGHT SCENES. THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY HURTED THIS MEGAHIT WAS THE FACT THAT IT WAS SIMPLY TOO LONG. BUT, DESPITE ALL THAT, THIS STILL TURNED OUT TO BE A REALLY GOOD MOVIE. FOLLOWED BY TWO SEQUELS, THE 2ND OF WHICH IS GONNA BE RELEASED NEXT MONTH.
B00004YW6I|4.0|I admit I didn't know much \\"PJ Harvey\\" before, but I was extremely impressed with this cd. She can craft the softest beautiful songs, or the aggressive rockers, and both equally well. I also really like her voice, and am almost addicted to hearing it. \\"Good Fortune\\" and \\"Is This Love\\" were two big songs off this, but my favorite without a doubt is \\"You Said Something\\". It just pulls you in, and gets you seeing just what she's singing about. \\"Thom Yorke\\" from \\"Radiohead\\" also lends his voice to this cool, dark, and sexy album. Overall I highly recommend \\"Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea\\". It will go great with your \\"Juliana Hatfield\\" and \\"Liz Phair\\" cd's.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|THIS TIME, NEO, MORPHEUS, AND TRINITY MUST STOP THE MACHINES FROM INVADING AND DESTROYING THE CITY OF ZION. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE STILL GOOD, BUT IT'S JUST THAT, WELL, THEY PUT A LOTTA POINTLESS STUFF INTO THIS SEQUEL. THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS ENTIRE MOVIE IS BY FAR THE CLIMATIC CHASE SCENE. BUT, JUST LIKE A LOT OF OTHER SEQUELS, IT'S JUST MISSING SOMETHING THAT MADE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE SO GOOD. BUT STILL, THIS AIN'T THAT BAD OF A MOVIE. ''THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS'', WHICH IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE MATRIX SERIES, WILL HIT THEATRES NEXT MONTH.
B000002UZ4|4.0|I've enjoyed the &quot;Pet Shop Boys&quot; ever since I got my copy of &quot;Please&quot; on vinyl, and once this cd was released, I picked it up right away. Fanatics may miss tracks, but for the casual fan, this has everything and more. It includes the bigger hits &quot;West End Girls&quot;, &quot;Opportunities (lets make lots of money)&quot;, &quot;It's A Sin&quot;, and &quot;Domino Dancing&quot;. Plus the covers of &quot;Always On My Mind&quot; and &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name (I cant take my eyes off of you)&quot;. Also, the songs I didn't know here are as good as the others. I like these guys because they give a warm and emotion, to a kind of music that is usually lacking it, &quot;Suburbia&quot; being a prime example. Overall it's an excellent collection, and will go great with your &quot;New Order&quot; and &quot;Moby&quot; cd's.
B000002KET|5.0|Many hard-core Sabbath fans would strongly disagree, but I love this album. With &quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath&quot; the band explorers different types of melodies on songs like &quot;Sabbra Cadabra,&quot; &quot;Looking for today,&quot; and &quot;Who are you&quot;. Most fans would say that these are the weakest tracks, but they are my favorites; of course the title song is one of Sabbath's best songs as well. I really love every single song on this album - Buy it!
B00006JSS8|4.0|This is missing about as much as it includes, but it is just one cd. For the most part though, this is the best of the best. Plus it's a lengthy 21 tracks. Everything from the very early &quot;Fingertips (part two)&quot;, to &quot;Part-time Lover&quot; is on here. Plus the huge hits &quot;My Cherie Amour&quot;, &quot;Superstition&quot;, &quot;You Are The Sunshine Of My Life&quot;, and &quot;Boogie On Reggae Woman&quot;. Basically these are all huge hits, and whether the lyrics get deep, or keep to a love theme, they'll all have you struttin' down the city streets in your head. The only song that I really miss, is &quot;I Believe (when I fall in love it will be forever)&quot;. Overall though, this is still an amazing collection, and will go great with your &quot;Marvin Gaye&quot; and &quot;Commodores&quot; cd's.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Two years after the strokes released their smash - hit debut album &quot;Is This It?&quot;in 2001, they've finally returned with another great CD. Bassically, if you enjoyed their first album, you will like this one as well. It's the exact same formula that the band used on their previous album. Alot of people have complained about the length of the album, which clocks in at about 33 minutes with 11 songs. It's all about QUALITY not quantity. So many bands nowadays overproduce their albums, but not the Strokes. I kind of prefer short albums anyway. My only complaint is the 2 year wait for &quot;Room on Fire.&quot; I guess they were touring so much for &quot;Is This It?&quot; that they probably didn't have time to write for awhile; but lets be honest - It wouldn't take that long for them to create a 30 min. CD with such simplicity.
B000002IWH|4.0|I remember when this came out it seemed custome made for my musical tastes at the time, and still does really. I mean the quality of bands here is great. Of the first five tracks alone you got &quot;Nine Inch Nails&quot;, &quot;Rage Against The Machine&quot;, &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot;, and one of the best &quot;Cure&quot; songs ever, and that's saying alot. Plus in the middle of the album you get a 1-2-3 punch from &quot;Rollins Band&quot;, &quot;Helmet&quot;, and &quot;Pantera&quot;. Then it ends with cool tracks from &quot;The Jesus and Mary Chain&quot;, &quot;The Thrill Kill Kult&quot;, and a soft finale from &quot;Jane Siberry&quot;. I'm sure the point of the music here was to reflect the feeling of the movie, and it succeeded much better than other soundtracks have. The other &quot;Crow&quot; cd's have some good stuff too, but overall they don't even touch this one.
B00005JKC3|5.0|being handicapped, and no longer able to go to the theatre, i purchased this dvd yesterday. based solely on the reputation of director ang lee, i never expected such a brilliant film, with such emotion, deep feelings, a great study in science and biology! i was astounded by the acting, the split camera work to let us see everyone's reactions as to what is taking place around them! the darn desert scene alone was worth more than the price of the dvd by it self! incredible work that has taken a beating by both most critics and theatregoers (here) alike! i blame universal's marketing strategy! this should have been a winter release where a more sophisticated audience would have really gotten into it! i feel, in years to come, ang lee's masterpiece will be a benchmark on how to really make an epic--with brains!  if you have not yet seen it-run out and get it! if you have, watch it again-the 2nd time is even better.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|This has to be one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen and this killer soundtrack to go along with it just enhances the movies overall appeal. The music might seen a little off color but thats the point. The whole movie is sort of off color and thats what makes the soundtrack just a great compliment.
B000001FRY|5.0|On the short list that includes first albums by The Pretenders, The Cars, The Clash, and Elvis Costello goes &quot;Boy&quot;<BR>Here we find a group with their own voice, their own style, their own sound that sounds like nothing on the radio at the time, yet spawns hundreds if not thousands of imitators.<BR>Like almost everybody has said, it is kinda like a concept album, but not in any sort of negative way. The songs sound just like they belong together...like they're part of a whole.<BR>You can sense an over-reaching ambition right from the start. In fact, objectively this is probably a &quot;four-star&quot; record, but ya GOTTA give them the extra star for the balls. They're clearly trying to be the biggest band in the world from the get-go. And within half a decade, they were.<BR>They've created one of the few rock careers where their entire output merits listening.
B00008PW2E|5.0|I don't have HBO so I watch Six Feet Under on rental DVDs from Netflix. Season 1 was a gas.<br />I believe the 3rd season is being broadcast now so what's the holdup with releasing season 2 on DVD?<br />Cmon!
B0000024ZT|3.0|Like he has said, this was the last time he made music without wondering if anyone would ever hear it.<BR>It shows. It's rough, but verbally virtuous. There are more lyrics on this album than on his next three combined! He can't stop. <BR>Compared to his subsequent albums, it's terrific to see his progression...but as a start, it's merely average.<BR>There are a handful of stone classics...like &quot;Growin' Up&quot; and &quot;It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City&quot;, but having been exposed more to his incendiary live versions, these pale.<BR>But, in my opinion, if you get ONE Springsteen album, you should get them ALL. Like The Beatles. Even their &quot;weak&quot; albums are essential, if you know what I mean.<BR>Besides, it's fun to put on &quot;Blinded By The Light&quot; for your uninitiated friends and watch them say, &quot;He covered this song?&quot;<BR>Then they wonder why you're laughing...
006016848X|2.0|After reading this book I have come to the conclusion that it is backwards.  While most dating and relationship books like this focus on understanding the differences between men and women I suggest one focuses on the similarities between the sexes by exploring universal laws of human behavior.  Check out the book STUMBLING NAKED IN THE DARK.  It simply makes more sense and it actually works!
B000002KLP|5.0|Prince begins here. His first two albums merely hint at this epic of raw (as in sexual) but polished (as in production) kinetic pop-rock, with both punk and \\"new-wave\\" influences.<BR>This is the first record with his trademark \\"Minneapolis\\" sound. This is his first record to unleash his blazing guitar licks on the unsuspecting public. He goes from being a tease (\\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\", 'I Feel For You'\\") to being shockingly blunt (\\"Head\\", Sister\\").<BR>And (...) is this catchy. Hooks like velcro. The announcement to the world at large of a major star, soon to hit supernova four years later with \\"Purple Rain.\\"<BR>By the way, isn't time to remaster this catalog? Hmm? Warners? Anybody?
B00004VW5A|5.0|I have almost every compilation of Elvis music and this one tops them all.  I've owned this box set for several years and it continues to get spun regularly.  The interview before Elvis was shipped to Germany is a classic and gives you a small glimpse at the quality person he was.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol's debut album is stunning.  Every track is a complete winner.  Although some of the album will start to sound a little similar towards the second half, if you dissect the tracks one by one you will not find a duff one on there.  Yes, they sound like an early 80s post-punk band, mixed with some of the dreamy sonics of several early 90s acts (Slowdive, for one--I hear a lot of their 1996 album &quot;Souvlaki&quot; in the slower cuts on &quot;Bright Lights&quot;).  The guitars are spacey and drenched in reverb, the singer is brilliant--one of the best vocalists out there in a rock scene virtually starved of good singers--and the lyrics are<BR>intelligent and thoughtful.  The reason this album stunned so many when it was first released is stated in many of the reviews below: although they do evoke many past bands, mostly from the early 80s (Joy Division, U2, Psych Furs, etc.), as well as Slowdive and--most recently--The Strokes (as in the interlocking, repetitive guitars), this band has definitely fashioned their own sound out of the influences.  Just as any great artists have done, Interpol have carved out a brilliant niche that is revitalizing the rock scene.  I hope their next album sells through the roof, because they deserve it.
B00008NRL8|2.0|If you're looking for music that has a significant amount emotion or virtuosity, I'd pass on this one.  This is very much &quot;mood music&quot; that sets up an exotic feel that is perfect for commercials, but not very interesting to listen or dance to.  The music consists of a bunch of samples tacked onto a drum machine; the melody, dynamic range, and often expressively changing tempo of traditional tango are completely absent from this album.<br />The video that is included on the bonus disk is a bit frustrating to watch for those who have ever danced in any style, as the dancing is not well synchronized with the music.  The camera shots are so chopped up that you wouldn't be able to see what the dancers are really doing even if they weren't wearing baggy clothes that obscure their movements.<br />If you want modern sounding music to make you feel cool for about 5 minutes, you'll probably enjoy this album, but if you want more meaningful/interesting music, you're much better off going to a library and checking out some classic tango, i.e. Osvaldo Pugliese, Juan D'Arienzo, DiSarli, etc...<br />One star for using a Bandoneon instead of an Accordion, and one star just because I like the French :)
B000092ZYX|4.0|After months of listening to this album, I've finally come around. Initially I wasn't too happy with this album, admittedly because I loved the previous albums, especially &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, so much. But this album is really amazing. It stands seperate from thier earlier work and the more electronic work of late. Anyway I love it now and take back my original 3 star rating and give it a 4. If you don't love this album at first, but love Radiohead, don't give up on it.
0312319517|1.0|Your plane is about to board and you buy one of those paperbacks <BR>from the airport book store.  Against your better judgment, because<BR> the author is an unknown and the font is too large, to make the<BR> book thicker.  But the cover suggests an intriguing, save-the-world premise, and sports a good picture of a submarine or a swastika, so you buy the book.  Before you reach cruising altitude, you have given up on the book and are reading Skymall.  Imagine that book.  That is Avenger.  Now you know what it will be like to try to read Avenger.  Even worse, because you were expecting Mr. Forsythe.  It is difficult to write this, because I am his best fan.  If you have not read any of the following Forsythe books, buy these instead.  You will savor the book, and honor Mr. Forsythe:  Jackal, Deceiver, Odessa File,<BR>Devil's Alternative, Dogs of War, No Comebacks.
B00005U2JL|4.0|This DVD is all live footage for those looking for his videos, I bought it hoping for a video or two as I dj a club. However once I sat down and watched it I can say I enjoyed it. I have always enjoyed Manson even though its cool to hate Manson in the whole Goth Scene, screw em =p<br />I have never had a chance to catch Manson live, however after watching this I don't think I will be missing them the next time they come though. The video footage is well shot and the sound quality is good and Manson and the rest of the band all put on a good performance.<br />I would suggest buying this if your a Manson fan, if your looking for videos this is not what you are looking for.
B00005Y228|5.0|Frisky-throated Kylie Minogue is a perfect example of the kind of voice that is spectacularly \\"right\\" for its music:  all those boring questions of range and whatnot become irrelevant when one listens to how perfectly her chirps and trills and moans become the sexy-yet-classy house-pop she wields on \\"Fever\\".  And what a sound it is!  The tracks here match populist appeal with elite production, yielding a pop record with truly universal appeal-- the kids can eat it up like Spice Girls and the Samanthas of the world can use it as a soundtrack for their \\"mature\\" adventures.  The firm, cushy basslines are as velvety as limosine upholstery, the beats as slick as a freshly-mouthed lollipop, and above this sensual swirl Kylie warbles like a warmly gushing fountain of crystaline delight.  There's an occasional tinge of lovelorn melancholy in songs like \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Come into my world\\", but Kylie, like the best disco dollies, is a survivor, and her hints of worldly aloofness make her poptart persona all the more engaging.  Her skill at channelling multiple decades is another bonus-- the title track sounds like a choice early  Madonna effort given a new gleam.  \\"Can't Get You Out of my Head\\" matches Daft Punk robochic with vampiric enthrallment, courtesy of Cathy \\"ah-ah-ah-ah-all night long\\" Dennis, and the even more spectacular \\"Love at first sight\\" (straight from Minogue's pen!) channels loveydovey dance-euphoria better than anything since Stephanie Mills' \\"Never Knew Love like this before\\".  And the whole of the album sustains a level of worthiness with these awesome singles:  \\"Fever\\" really is a Godiva grabbag of sensational, sensual, seductive dance tracks.  Kudos for achieving such a great set of songs, and kudos for not bothering with balladry!  Nobody has to dig their head in the sand to pretend this is a great record-- it really really is, and in the best of taste too.  Kylie Minogue plain rocks, and \\"Fever\\" is one of the alltime essentials.
B000000OAN|4.0|This album has a mix of rock and Queen's opera-like vocals. Some people not like it, it definately isn't their best, but this has their breakthrough songs such as \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"Best Friend.\\" I like it and it's a good, solid album, but there are a few filler songs on too which keeps this from 5 stars. Queen starts a new music genre that mixes loud opera-like vocals with Mercury's piano playing, and some nice guitar work with great bass and drums. All of the songs are original sounding with no annoying covers. This sound sparked many followers (did somebody say The Darkness?) but none of them sound as good as Queen.
B00005JKC3|5.0|Hulk is a good movie and a great comic book adaption.  The talent behind the movie is solid as well; Ang Lee is a terrific director.  The cinematography is top notch and includes some great locales from the southwest US.<br />Dr. Bruce Banner heroically saves his friend and co-worker from an accident.  Through genetic manipulation passed on from his dad, Bruce is able to survive the gamma radiation.  He turns into the Hulk.<br />My favorite thing about the Hulk is that he doesn't go up against your typical villian trying to take over a city or the world; instead, it is an internal battle with your own fears.<br />As for the special effects...they are phenomenal.  I think the hulk takes some getting used to since he's big and green, but he really does look the part.  There's excellent fight scenes with the Hulk Dogs as well as a long desert scene against the military.  The desert scene is worth the price of admission!<br />The special features are good enough.  The picture quality is outstanding and the Dolby 5.1 mix is outstanding.<br />Pick this movie up if you even think you might like it.  I highly recommend &quot;Hulk.&quot;
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Solid album. Great from start to finish, it's one of those albums u can listen from start to finish...clocks in at only 33 mins though, its worth ur money, go pick it up
6305537798|1.0|This film is just poor. The  script was terrible, really  terrible. It was so obvious that at the prom kat would find out about the money and walk out. But the scene where the aussie guy asks her to go with him as a boyfriend would, she suddenly starts questioning why he pushing the subject. Some of the gags, e.g. where the archery teacher gets shot in the butt, didn't fit in the film at all. It was more like spoof comedy and just made the film even more unbelievable. Luckily i only rented this and didn't waste my money buying it. The main characters are only just likeable, and coupled with a bad script, make this film an embrassment to the whole teen/romantic comedy genre.
B00005JKZV|3.0|I read some of the great reviews here and was tempted to give my own $0.02 on this movie.  To those who have not read the book, this is a great movie.  But to those of us who have experienced the Lord of the Rings at its best... the written words of Tolkien, this movies fars short.<br />I'm still waiting on the extended version in hopes that somehow, someway, it will be better.  I don't think I have very high expectations though, after seeing the theatrical version.<br />I know what people say about the second part of any trilogy... I disagree when it comes to the Two Towers.  It is by far my favorite book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  There was so much more left out of the movie and so many unnecessary scenes and events that were added.  Throughout the entire time I was watching, I kept saying to myself, &quot;this isn't how it happened...&quot; &quot;what happened to the part where...&quot; and &quot;now I KNOW that was not in the book&quot;<br />Needless to say, I was very disappointed in the treatment of some of the events and characters.  Faramir, like Kelly Moore had mentioned, really got screwed.  (He's my favorite male character in the books, strange as it may be.)  Kelly said it already so I'll refer you to her review.<br />Eomer also got a completely different treatment in the movie.  Whatever happened to his loyalty and standing by his King, no matter the consequences?  He got banished?  Just so he can come riding down the hill with his small band of warriers behind Gandolf?  And the whole part with the Ents and Merry and Pippin was REALLY downplayed.  Those were also some of the best parts in the book.  I'm still hoping that some of those things will eventually get picked up in the third movie.  (Pippin's huge mistake that leads to the separation of Pippin and Merry.)  Both Merry and Pippin are so much more than the silly hobbits for comic relief they are portrayed in the movies.  They have vital roles in all of it.  Yet we don't really see that.  Those parts are replaced with Arwen and Aragorn contemplating whether they should be together or not (which, incidentally, was not that big a part in the actual story of the Ring, more in the appendix.)<br />The reason the book was called the Two Towers was because there were two battle fronts.  We really only got one.  I suppose we see a little bit of Gondor when Faramir kidnaps Frodo and Sam (that's one of the &quot;now I KNOW that was not in the book&quot; scenes), but it's just not in keeping with the spirit of the book.  And I still don't understand why Shelob had to be in the third movie instead of the second one like Tolkien had intended.  It seems lots of good things were cut from the second movie to make room for the unnecessary scenes (such as more relationship time for Aragorn and Arwen... [did they think the movie won't sell if there was no overt love story in it?])<BR>I have to say, the Fellowship was a better movie when it came to staying true to the books.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let the Return of the King be true to what Tolkien had so perfectly envisioned all those years ago.<br />Now I have to go read the Two Towers a million times to try and recapture the magic.

B000002QWD|5.0|WHITE CHRISTMAS is a legendary pop song celebrating the spirit of Christmas.<br />This CD contains several songs surrounded in a musical production that will transport you back in time.<br />Alongside other infamous Christmas recordings (NAT KING COLE,  MEL TORME), this CD stands the test of time and is still a must have at Christmas.<br />Break open the EGGNOG and relive childhood memories with a legendary male vocalist and classic seasonal standards.
B000089RVX|4.0|All of these genres being thrown around...personally, I'm more likely to label this album &quot;progressive-metal&quot; long before I'm tempted to use the &quot;goth&quot; label on it.  It reminds me more of bands like Dream Theatre, Fates Warning, or Stratovarius than anything resembling Linkin Park.<br />The music is solid, the vocals are well done, and the overall album has a nice mix of music on it.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but folks who like an edge on their prog might want to give it a listen before dismissing it entirely.
B000002UQJ|3.0|I had purchased this CD when it first came out (initially purchasing the CD Single of Hope of Deliverance + Big Boys Bickering etc..) I trully enjoy the output from McCartney during these sessions.  In fact if I could find the complete sessions (The complete works, I would buy that!!) Some of the b-sides are stronger than the initial copy Off the Ground.  Anyway, my favorties on this CD are Hope of Deliverance (reminds me a little of the Ballad of John and Yoko), Mistress &amp; Maid (some awesome production and perfances !!) Biker Like an Icon ( you can tell Paul just loves this song...), Golden Earth Child &amp; The Lovers that Never were (strong  vocals / performances and production work), and my favorite (yes it might be sappy, but I feel its the most honest vocals by Paul in a while) Winedark Open Sea.  I can do without C'mon People, but I love Cosmically Conscious..(pauls version of John's Dig it....he's just having fun...)<BR>Finally, I would recommend this CD over Flowers  in the Dirt and would put it up there with Run Devil Run, Flaming Pie, Tug of War and Venus and Mars.<BR>Rock on Paul...and congrats on the new baby..<br />From a fan in Texas via Long Island NY
076790592X|5.0|I thought that this book was the best one I have read so far. I think that Mitch was a really lucky person to have a second chance at being friends with Morrie. This book is just so good it ws hard for me to put it down. I wish that everyone could have what Mitch had.
0792163710|5.0|Shane is certainly one of the finest Westerns ever made and it is the archetype for many other pictures, some good and some not. One of the things that sets Shane apart from other films is its amazing cinematography. The shot of Shane's silhouette framed within the antlers of the deer at the beginning of the picture is more amazing than any CGI effects you'll see today. The chemistry between the actors is excellent and their performances are convincing. This is a great movie everyone should see.
0374266425|5.0|Alice gained wisdom down a rabbit hole and Sophie gained wisdom through a situation with a rabbit running through it.  <br />Every human being on the planet who can read and wants to understand humanity can do it in a very enjoyable way by reading \\"Sophie's World.\\"  I promise you it will capture you and you will have it on your mind the whole time you are reading it.  And, you will be thinking about when you can get back to it and sometimes you will just push everything else aside and keep on reading because this book feeds so many curiosities you had and even those you didn't know you had.<br />As you read you will feel smarter and smarter and curiouser and curiouser and you may even start creating possible story lines ahead and see if you are right.  And, you will spend the first 150 pages making up all sorts of possible story lines about Hildy and the Major and who Albert really is and what his real connections are.<br />Imagine learning real important stuff about real philosophers within the context of a mildly mysterious novel!  Actually, just buy the book and keep it or pass it on to someone you really, really love and want to be happy.  Oh, did I mention that reading and learning what this book can teach can help you have a happier life, be happier and have better relationships?
0030672252|5.0|Cat's Cradle is the type of book that I personally love. A amusing story full that is easy to laugh with or at but chills to the bone at the same time for the relizations that it helps you make about how life can be just as ridiculous. This book amazes me and frightens me every time I read it.
B000000WHX|5.0|Review: Perhaps the smoothest, most rythmic album extant. Hypnotic, controlled, patient...the deep beat gently rocks you; the vocalists sing to you, about you, with you. The timing is pure; the feel natural, organic. <br />History: With their roots in the Bristol, England, club scene of the early '80s, the members of Massive Attack originated trip-hop, one of the most influential sound sof the '90s, combining the rythmic urgency of hip-hop, the freewheeling samples of the DJ's craft, soul-rich melodies, and dub-reggae's hebty, intoxicating bottom end.  The group began in 1983 as a loose collective of singers, rappers, DJs, and producers that stages parties under the name the Wild Bunch.  Included in its ranks were Mushroom (Andrew Vowles) and Daddy G (Grant Marshall), as well as Nelleee Hooper (later of Soul II Soul, and a producer for Madonna, Bjork, and others), and Tricky.  The Wild Bunch released a 1986 cover of Burt Bacharach's \\"The Look of Love,\\" which became a European dance-club sensation, just as legal authorities began to clamp down on the Bristol party circuit.  In 1987 graffiti artist 3-D (Robert Del Naja) joined Daddy G and Mushroom to form Massive Attack.  A series of singles led to the 1991 release of Blue Lines, which featured an array of vocalists--including Shara Nelson, Tricky, and reggae singer Horace Andy--and promoted a somnambulatory beat that ran counter to the hyped-up dance rythms of techno.<br />Importance:  As a revolutionary force in music, this album is in the highest circle--with The White Album, Exile on Main Street, Astral Weeks, The Bends, The Velvet Underground and Nico, and the new Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, by Wilco.<br />Further Listening: The only Massive Attack album which comes close to the pure form of Blue Lines is Mezzanine. Also, listen to Maxinquae, Tricky's best solo effort, and Dummy by Portishead, the other 'trip-hop' classic.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I've read some scathing reviews of Madonna's latest effort, &quot;American Life.&quot;  I've also read reviews calling it her greatest work to date.  Madonna is an artist interesting in sharing her knowledge and wisdom with anyone who wishes to listen.  In my estimation, comparing &quot;American Life&quot; to &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998) and &quot;Music&quot; (2000) is a waste of time.  With each passing year (each passing day, for that matter), people discover new ideas, new dreams, new interests.  Madonna is the same way.  People often suggest that she is consistantly &quot;reinventing&quot; herself.  To all those who feel that way, I'd like to ask, &quot;Have you had the same hair color/style for your entire life?  Do you wear the same clothes year after year?&quot;  What is reinvention, then?  Madonna is simply growing and changing, learning more about herself. Since 1998, Madonna has gotten married and begun raising a family.  It would be inconcievable for her to be writing the same kind of music that she wrote 5 years ago.  The music on &quot;American Life&quot; goes from dance (American Life, Hollywood, I'm So Stupid, Die Another Day, Nobody Knows Me), to folky (Love Profusion, Intervention, Easy Ride), to spiritual (Nothing Fails), to confessional (Mother and Father), to introspective (X-Static Process).  These same themes run throughout &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; which many consider her finest album to date.  Why then is &quot;American Life&quot; not being recieved as a gem?  A gem it is.  Ignore the bad reviews you read and hear.  Open your mind and take &quot;American Life&quot; in.  Allow Madonna to grow and change as a human the same way you allow yourself to grow and change.  &quot;American Life&quot; is inspiring and delightful.  Listen and learn.
B000003S0K|5.0|Some Eno-fanatics may argue that this isn't Brian's best solo album. I'm not saying it is. I simply won't go there. I admire just about everything Eno's done, from Roxy to the solo stuff to the ambient, and beyond. I WILL say that  I've been listening to this album for more than 20 years (hell,  I'm playing it as I write this),  and I remain stunned by its timeless ability to thrill and amaze. Yeah, it's &quot;weird,&quot; and comes out of those hazy, crazy &quot;Glam&quot; days in the U.K of the early '70s. So it's not for everyone. And OK, maybe there is a Velvet Underground influence here. But nothing on this album sounds the least bit dated, 30 years on,  and, Velvets notwithstanding, this is PURE ENO. The man has a sublime gift for melody, texture, rythmn, instrumentation, lyrics (absurd as they may be), electronics, and just plain VISION. This LP's got it all: proto-punk, grace, hard-core rock (Robert Fripp and Phil Manzanera's superb guitar), atmosphere, heartbreaking melodies. And it goes on from there. I can---no, I simply MUST---recommend &quot;Warm Jets&quot; for any rock fan with an open mind. I aim that comment especially towards those 20-year-olds out there who wouldn't think of going back to 1973 for a disc. Try it. You might love it. It might just open up a world to you.

6302477751|5.0|I show this movie to my fifth graders every Halloween.  They get a kick out of the touching story and the adults who come to the party dig the references to the classic Frankenstein movies from the 30's.  There is something for everyone in this movie.  Tim Burton showed us a bit of his budding genius with this short.  A must have for any Tim Burton fan.

0140288503|5.0|Black Hawk Down is powerful book. It tells the reader how hard war is. It doesn't glamorize it like other books do. It lets the reader be in the war with the soldiers. Although the book is very descriptive, it lets you see how war really is. I would really encourage people to read this book so they can see how war is. It shows how much courage, honor, sacrifice, and camaraderie. It also show how poorly former President Clinton was in operating the conflict. Mark Bowden has done a excellent job writing and telling the truth. I don't that he was biased at all.
B000002IKR|5.0|I have yet to buy this one on CD, but the tape has kept me happy for years.  The only weak charactaristic of this album is the thin production.  Other than that, this timeless record provides all the power and aggression that so many new bands model themselves after.  I still pop the weathered tape into my 14 year boom box and lose myself in the ripping guitar riffs, 100 mph drums, and Chuck Billy's demonic vocals.

B000089RVX|1.0|dont buy it, try some true clasic metal, i cant believe that my girlfriend buy it!
B000021YQV|5.0|I admit, this was my first System Of A Down CD.  Sure, I had heard \\"Spiders\\" and \\"Sugar\\" kicking around on the radio the year before, but this is the CD that got me to realize the genuis of this band.  Thrasing and brutal one moment than beautiful and genuine the next.  Some people say SOAD's songs are short, but that's because they are to the point.  Full out stompers like \\"X\\" and \\"Bounce\\" are plain fun. <...>  \\"Ariels\\" I still love because of the haunting aura about it while \\"Chop Suey!\\" and \\"Prison Song\\" have to be some of the hardest hitting riffs I've ever heard.  Serj's vocals are all over the place, screaming and sweltering while still being melodic and throught-provoking.  Guitars and bass go full force, stop, and than go full force again.  A second effort that improved on all the great things the first CD had.  Other standouts include: \\"Science\\", \\"Deer Dance\\" and of course \\"Toxicity\\"
B00008H2LB|4.0|meteora rulz! it shows the pure talent and balance of music that linkin park produce! the mixture of chesters vocals and mikes rap makes pure music. i adore all the songs on the album especially from the inside because it lets us hear many different depths of chesters voice! i cant wait for their next album because i have loved all their albums so far!!!<br />lp r da best!!!!
B000089RVR|4.0|Dido isn't an artist who sounds terribly original. She has strong links to any female artist who have come before her such as Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, Laurie Anderson, Tori Amos, Jewel, Alanis Morissette, Sophie B. Hawkins, Joan Osborne and, of course, Sarah McLachlan and Loreena McKennitt. However, she does have her own vision of how relationships are, and like &quot;No Angel&quot;, &quot;Life For Rent&quot; continues to explore themes of broken and unattained relationships. Dido also has a gifted vocal quality that makes her sound both depressed and angelic AND uplifting all in one. All the tracks compliment one another and no one particular track detracts from the flow of the cd. There are brilliant moments on the disc such as the chorus to &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, the lyrics to &quot;See You When You're 40&quot;, the idea to turn in a more r&amp;b flavored track on &quot;Who Makes You Feel&quot; and the meter and rhythm of &quot;Sand In My Shoes&quot;. &quot;White Flag&quot;, &quot;Mary's In India&quot; and &quot;See The Sun&quot; are all solid failed relationship songs that sound honest and true (which is what I want from an artist because the song doesn't feel disposable). I certainly enjoyed &quot;Life For Rent&quot; more than &quot;No Angel&quot; and Dido avoided the sophomore slump with ease. This is the type of cd I can listen to anytime, and I look forward to hearing future cds from Dido.
B000000H3W|5.0|In my opinion this is the bands best work to date.The speed and aggression on this album is truly amazing.All the songs are extremely aggressive but that doesnt mean that they are not well structured.The band truly displays their talent as artists especially on this one.Igors drumming is unmatched on this release and Max Cavaleras vocals are the best on this cd.Great riffage and bad ass solos are heard all throughout this cd.With this cd being remastered,the sound production is even more clean and better.If you dont have this album,what are you waiting for?
0789723107|5.0|I like the style and tempo of this book.  It gives very good advice about web site design and usability.  Highly recommended.
B000000H4V|5.0|I must admit that when I first heard this album I was a little skeptical of how good it was because I was comparing it to arise.However,it took a good listen to convince me that this is truly a work of art.This album is not as fast or heavy as arise but it is still very aggressive and good.You find some great riffs and solos here with Igors awesome display of his drumming skills.Max Cavaleras vocals are very passionate and angry with keeping with the theme of this album.All of the songs are great and my personal favorite being territory.Lyrically,this band stands up for what they believe and of all the injustice they have seen around the world.I really respect artists who truly care about whats happpening in the world and who are trying to make people become conscious of whats really going on.Go out and buy this today if you dont already have it.HAIL SEPULTURA!!!
B00001P4RI|5.0|This album immediately imparts a sense of the ancient male. Brendan Perry &quot;lives by the river, where the old gods still dream of inner communion with the open sea.&quot; His seasoned baritone voice weaves through a spacious soundscape. The music is certainly somber- songs for shadowless overcast days spent wandering through autumn fields. For those of you who think Lisa Gerard was the main force that made DCD great- don't bother. You don't deserve (and undoubtedly, will not appreciate) this album.
0688163173|5.0|This book was fantastic.  I almost didn't read it.  That would have been such a huge mistake.  After reading Mystic River, I didn't think this author could match such a good book.  This one beats it!!!<br />It is about an island where they put the criminally insane,called Shutter Island.  Teddy Daniels is a US Marshal, there with another Marshal, Chuck.  He is trying to uncover what He thinks are unorthodox methods of treatment going on in this institute.<br />When you finish this novel, you will find yourself going back and re-reading passages.  The ending really packed a punch!!!!<br />This author writes with such prose you can really envision his characters, practically see them and smell them.<br />Not for the faint of heart but an excellent book!!!!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I heard alot about how bad it was but I loved all the fight scenes, the highway car chase sequence, all the special effects. When Neo saved Trinity by electricfying her heart to bring her back was cool.<BR>In any type of Sci-Fi films it going to be weird and unexplainable.<BR>As the other review stated, just watch it for the fun of it and if you don't like it start righting your own movie.
B000089RVX|5.0|If they took away the rest of the band, Amy Lee could still have a great solo career.  She is a very sexy woman....looks....voice....she has it all!  This album stands out against all of the new artist entries this year (save maybe TRAPT).  All of the songs are quite listenable, despite their tendency to go more towards the nu-metal sound at times.  BRING ME TO LIFE, MY IMMORTAL, and HAUNTED are great highlights.  I look for Evanescence to have quite a long career ahead of them.  As long as they are able to adapt to new music styles as they form, this group will be quite okay.
B000069CWE|5.0|Linkin Park's Reanimation is hard to ignore after such a strong first release.  This CD is NOT what you hear on MTV and the radio, it's a lot deeper than that. I'll be honest, at first, i did not like this album, then after listening to it with an open mind, it grew on me so much. Now i can't stop listening to it. You must hear the depth of this album. It is at least worth giving it a shot.
B00005R87K|2.0|This dvd has my favorite soundtrack for this film, however, it is out of sync with the video! (which basically ruins it )<BR> The chapter selection is flawed also: there are only 4 chapter selections to choose from; chapter 2 is labeled chapter 1, and so on... so there is no selection for chapter 1.<BR> The title menu is also extremely cheap, showing a small photo of the cover of the dvd case on a background closely resembling the old windows 95 'blue sky with clouds' background image.<BR> Last, and certainly not least, the video quality is terrible.<BR>This one probally isn't worth getting unless you're planning on remastering the dvd with the soundtrack in sync with the video for personal use, and with a decent chapter selection menu. I hope to find that someone has already put a nice version together with this soundtrack on dvd ( I know it exists on vhs ).
0780020685|5.0|I felt compelled to check out what kind of people would rate  this superb piece of art with anything less than 5 stars. This is what I found; One reviewer gave it a 5 star review , but only 4 stars.....high standards I guess. Another 4 star reviewer ought to learn how to compose a sentence, before criticizing others. One guy gave it a star and remarked that &quot;it didn't make sense&quot;. Please don't hire this guy for flight traffic control. I wonder if he knows they were speaking Japanese. Then we have a reviewer who states; &quot;it shows it's age&quot;. Isn't that amazing, it's set in the 17th century.<BR>One reviewer dropped a star for remastering quality, not film quality. The 2 star reviewer had trouble constructing grammatically correct sentences. I didn't go any farther than Michael with the defective DVD. He gave it 1 star and asked advice from the &quot;review board help desk&quot;. Well..........no, I'm not even going there. But in lieu of insulting Michael, I'm going to watch this excellent movie tomorrow.... again.
B0000B1OE7|2.0|Ninja Scroll is an excellent work of anime and cannot be praised too highly, but the new 10th Anniversary DVD edition only offers only a false widescreen - they have merely cut off the top and bottom of the view to give the appearance of widescreen.  The DTS sound is not any fuller or crisper than the original fullscreen DVD, merely converted to DTS format.  In short, this DVD is not worth upgrading to, and the fullscreen side is the only one worth watching.  Save your money if you hope to improve on the original DVD's quality - the new anniversary DVD is actually an insult.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This album is brilliant.  The poetry is fantastic.  The songs are so catchy that they go through your head even without earphones.  <br />I always felt that George was the best Beatle.  Unassuming, modest and spiritual, not to mention cute.<br />I love the spiritual integration into the words.  This is often not well done.  I can barely stand most &quot;religious&quot; songs.  They are trite.  It also makes you realize even more that God doesn't care what name he is called by, it is his essence we cry out for.  Whether you are Christian, Jewish, Islamic or Buddhist, God doesn't care, as long as you worship His essence.  All prayers to God lead to the same one!  Who are we kidding?  We can separate ourselves, but yet call to the same God.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is a very pleasing album for anyone who would happen to like heavy metal. Much like Korn, this album STILL knocks Korn off of their feet. I think if you like metal and don't like them, you are a Metal Athiast, for these are Gods of Metal. Here be the Golden Songs:<br />742617000027 (10/10): Now this is an amazing example of the skill used by Craig Jones, Slipknot's Sampler/Media. The whole thing, I think, is sic. It leads into the next song with a friggin' smash. I love this song, it is an amazing example of Yamaha's audio equipment combined with Master Sampler Craig Jones.<br />(Sic) (15/10): Kay, folks. This song is the best one on the album besides Spit it Out and Surfacing. Man, this song has great skill inlcuded, while Joey is drumming like mad, just banging, while Shawn and Chris headbang while providing the song's most noticed percussion part.<br />Eyeless (10/10): Now, with this song, I was blown away. It knocks every band like Korn, Limp BizKit (YOU SUCK, FRED DURST!) and Metallica. You just can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes. It also has an extremely well-sounding guitar part near the end. THAT was NICE!<br />Wait and Bleed (8/10): Now, right here, you may think my expectations are too low. They aren't. I have heard every peice of Metal Music that over set foot in the record store. But, anyway, this song had a very good chorus. Shawn and Chris provide the background percussion to ensure that enough is heard underneath Corey's flawless screaming.<br />Surfacing (12/10): This is the new national anthem if you ask me. I LOVE this song. I love how Joey had flawlessly executed the drum solos near the end. That was amazing. If you headbang to that, you get a HUGE ADRENALINE RUSH!!!!!!!! That song be the bomb!<br />Spit it Out (14/10) I personally live by this song kinda, because  I love the entire rap concept mixed with the screaming and hardcore guitar. The guitar was soft, but that was just because it was being played SO FAST. Definitely one of the best on the album.<br />Tattered and Torn (9/10): Once again, the power of Craig Jones and Yamaha combined will blow you away like an Oklahoma F18 Tornado. It is also as freaky as the Blair Witch mixed with Jason Voorhees' ch ch ch ch ka ka ka ka ka sound.<br />Liberate (9/10): This is an extremely popular song between me and my friends. Probably because they are fans of Sid and Mick, who do the beginning DJ Scratch and the beginning guitar. This was great song. Recommended. <br />Prosthetics (8/10): This song was awesome in the beginning with crippled and distorted guitar and the light banging on a beer keg. I think lots of Craig's samples were used in this, because Craig said in an interview that he liked the song best.<br />No Life (10/10): This song was extremely pleasing, I loved it. It opens up into a really adrenaline pumped beat. This song was great. Also recommended.<br />Diluted (12/10): I LOVE THIS SONG! I swear if you listen to it more than twice, you'll grow on the song! WHAT THE HELL DID I DO TO DESERVE ALL OF THIS!! Best part of the song. <br /> ---- These are basically all of the good songs. The ones after these are also extremely well written and performed, but I'm running short of space to type. So the best songs are: 742617000027, (Sic), Surfacing, Spit it Out, Tattered and Torn, Me Inside, Liberate, Eyeless, Diluted, and the hidden track, Eeyore. So all you metal fans out there, I call upon you to listen to your soon-to-be favorite metal band out on earth. And by the way, if you're 555 then I'm 666.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>P.S.: The guy who posted as RIPOFF, A Music Fan from CT, USA, well, he has no taste of music. Don't listen to him, this is a complete gold mine of Rock and Roll that the world has been waiting for since Jimi Hendrix.
B000002I25|5.0|Upon this album's release, rock music was never the same again.  This is the album that changed everything.  The Doors were simply the greatest American blues/rock band of all time.  Some would say they were \\"overrated\\".  I say THE BEATLES are overrated.  The Doors, however, deserve every acolade and every ounce of respect they ever got.  <BR>The lovely, fluid guitar lines of Robby Krieger; the charming keyboards of Ray Manzarek; the extemporaneous thrashing of John Densmore; and the haunting poetic lyrics and vocals of Jim Morrison, the greatest frontman in rock history, hands down.  Yeah, talk about Mick Jagger all you want, but he sounded like a weakling compared to the mighty Jimbo.<BR>The Doors had already garnered quite an infamous reputation, mainly due to their legendary incident at the Whiskey A Go-Go club in early '66, in which Jim stunned the crowd by singing the Oedipal section of \\"The End\\", complete with the f-word.  In 1966, that was pretty much unheard of, and Jim was already showing that he had more balls than any other rock singer.  The word on the street was \\"Hey, have you heard about The Doors?  The singer is this crazy poet who's unlike anyone else you've ever seen\\".  And for the women, it was \\"Hey, dig that super-sexy guy in the leather pants\\".  Anyway, this, their first album, was the first album ever to combine poetry with rock 'n roll in such an eerie way.  It quickly established the band as something original, ingenious and, above all, unique.<br />\\"BREAK ON THROUGH\\": Probably the first true 'heavy metal' song ever recorded.  Fast, dark, heavy, unusual and powerful, the perfect formula for a Doors song.  Totally rocks.<br />\\"SOUL KITCHEN\\": This one's about a restaurant called Olivia's that Jim frequented.  Features great organ and guitar.<br />\\"THE CRYSTAL SHIP\\": If this isn't beautiful, nothing is.  It really shows the softer, more emotional side of Jim's voice, and the guitar playing is gorgeous, not to mention the lyrics.<br />\\"20TH CENTURY FOX\\": Great, upbeat guitar-oriented shuffle.  Shows more of a 'pop' side to the band.<br />\\"ALABAMA SONG (WHISKEY BAR)\\": This one was taken from a 1929 German opera, believe it or not.  Musically, it's definitely not The Doors at their best, but it's very catchy and has a great 'sing-along' feel to it.  And how did Ray get his piano to sound like that?  Or is it a harpsichord?  Whatever it is, it sounds wonderful.<br />\\"LIGHT MY FIRE\\": Ah yes, their biggest single ever.  The instrumental break is fascinating.  An anthem for the Summer Of Love.<br />\\"BACK DOOR MAN\\": Excellent blues tune.  Jim's trademark grunts and growls really add to the excitement.  Gets very intense and ferocious at the end.<br />\\"I LOOKED AT YOU\\": A silly but enjoyable Beatles-ish song.  And I never really cared for the Fab Four in the first place.<br />\\"END OF THE NIGHT\\": My God, this might be the best song on the album.  So dark and eerie that it might send shivers down your spine.  Possibly the most haunting song the Doors ever recorded.  It's pure, hypnotic bliss.<br />\\"TAKE IT AS IT COMES\\": Great upbeat song, one of the only 'happy' songs that Jim ever wrote.<br />\\"THE END\\": Lyrically, this is a masterpiece.  Musically, it's not all that memorable, other than a creepy guitar line from Robby.  Contains a brief section that talks about the Greek legend of Oedipus, who murdered his father and married his mother.  Originally, this was a simple song about faded love.  But as they played it more and more, Jim turned it into an ode to death.<br />This album changed the world of rock 'n roll forever.  And NOBODY else defined 'cool and charismatic' like Jim Morrison.  Nobody.
B000000P11|5.0|Great CD!!!  I can't believe this came out in the 80's. This is better than %90 percent of the music out there right now.  All of the Chameleons CD's are great.  This is the first one I bought so I'm kind of partial to it. Stand outs include: Swamp Thing, Tears, The End of Time, and Paradiso.  The chorus on Paradiso is absoletly amazing, I listened to that song alone at least 10 times the first time I played the cd.  Check it out!!!  Also, if you are into Interpol, you will love this band.  Interpol based a lot of their guitar stylings and song structures on this band.  Good stuff, check it out!!!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Seeing the ridiculously heated debate over the merits and pitfalls of The Strokes latest effort \\"Room on Fire\\" makes me truly glad that, in all likelihood, I'll never be famous. Admittedly, I've often claimed status as a self proclaimed music nerd and could spend an unnecessary amount of time arguing whether Richard Hell, Lou Reed, Elvis Costello or Rick Ocasic was more responsible for The Strokes' sound.  Recently I've come to the conclusion that it doesn't really matter.  Blaming The Strokes for emulating Lou Reed is like blaming Lebron James for aspiring to be the next Michael Jordan.  Similarly, discrediting The Strokes for being wealthy makes as much sense as refusing to read F. Scott Fitzgerald because he came from a rich family.  If you dislike The Stroke's it's well and good, but you should cite a more valid reason than their happening to be born wealthy.  <br />Now that I'm through ranting- The Strokes new album is a quality sophomore effort, but remains arguably inferior to their previous release.  The catchy melodies and angular guitar riffs that made The Strokes first record great are even more prounounced in the production of \\"Room on Fire\\". The Strokes have expanded their sound on this album to display reggae and even Motown influences (evidenced in the great songs \\"Automatic Stop\\" & \\"Under Control\\"). The opening track \\"What Ever Happened?\\" is arguably the band's strongest song to date, though \\"12:51\\" and \\"Meet Me In The Bathroom\\" are also highly laudable. Unlike \\"Is This It?\\", however, \\"Room On Fire\\" contains a few songs that lack vibrancy, perhaps the band's best quality.  Songs such as \\"Between Love and Hate\\" and \\"The End Has No End\\" represent a few of the less exciting efforts on what is otherwise a very solid album. This being said, I accept the fact that this is my own opinion and proceed to offer it to the wolves.
076790592X|4.0|This was a very good book to read. Once you pick it up you will not be able to put it down. The way this old man is able to deal with his death,and still keep a positive perspective on life is amazing. He had an incredible view and life and shared it ith anyone who would listen. I reccomend this book to anyone who feels like there life doesn't mean anything. After reading this book, and reading what this man has to say on life you might feel different abou your life. I really enjoyed reading this book and thik everyone should read it.
0880389052|4.0|This book is a wonderful book that has a great story. I really enjoyed reading this book because it made me want to read and read, because it held me in suspense. The thing I disliked about this book is in the beginning where it starts out in the war, and I didn't really know what was going on at the time.<BR> There is a war going on in the underworld. The underworld is called Menzoberranzen. There are different houses in this place, and two of these houses are at war, and the house with the main person in this book wins the war. During this, the lady that runs this winning house had a baby, and the baby was named Drizzt. He is born with purple eyes. The people that helped her have her baby thought the baby was blind because of his unusual eye color, but it turned out that he wasn't. He met a great magical panther named Guenhywvar, and it was his only friend when he was at school.<BR>     This book should be read by lots of people,and it should be passed around.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I had the pleasure of catching Gavin live when he opened for Maroon 5 at Northern Lights in Clifton Park.  Gavin was absolutely fantastic.  He is a rare talent indeed and his music style is something I have never heard before.  I went out and bought his album the next day and haven't turned it off yet.  Get this record, you won't regret it.  And while I'm on the subject, pick up Maroon 5's &quot;Songs for Jane,&quot;  the best album to come out this year.
0679735909|5.0|A.S. Byatt's &quot;Possession&quot; intends to be an entertainment with both wit and bite. Although it features many of the conventions that make other novels predictable--the &quot;historical story within the story&quot; conceit, the &quot;foibles of modernity and of modern academics&quot; riffs, and the &quot;social message in social context&quot; challenges, the book quite simply is an old-fashioned good read.<br />The plot revolves around the discovery of materials which hint at a relationship between two 19th C. poets. Elements of mystery and suspense genre fiction pop in and out, with the author conscious of and constantly referring to her influences.<BR>The satiric sections take on generally easy targets (literati collectors, American provincial university acquisitiveness), but the tone is so breezy it causes no offense. The natural comparison has been to Umberto Eco's work, because this work seeks to drop one into a dense set of ideas, without explaining all the contexts of each. Some will see this as a Wodehouse or Waugh type farce. Some will see this as feminist parable. Some will see this as densely layered historical fiction.<br />I see this as a simply solid entertainment. Those who find themselves bored with literature about literature will be bored here. Those who find themselves in search of work which is relentlessly profound should stray elsewhere. Those who do not wish novels to contain both rough and smooth are best suited in works of lighter comedy or deeper despair.<br />But those who want to take a keen wit, and give her a literary kaleidoscope, and see what will happen--read this. Byatt is arguably not for everyone, but she is certainly right for me.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|&quot;Oh, this is the start of something good,&quot; sings Gavin Degraw with the opening line of the new J-Records release, &quot;Chariot.&quot; How fitting.  This is the start of Gavin's career, and with his ample talents in singing, songwriting, piano, and guitar - a long and succesful career.  &quot;NYC's Best-kept secret,&quot; the secret is slowly unfolding as his voice reaches the public ear by ear.  Gavin's debut album is soul-stirring, passionate, fun, and an affirmation that good music still exists in this world where dirty divas, and mental patient rock stars rule the world.  Here is a young man, with talent to blow them all away, with the voice of a church-choir-lead-singer who listens to Stevie Wonder and Led Zepellin. He is the best of many genres blended in one performer. Just listen to the opening song, and debut single, &quot;Follow Through,&quot; and you'll understand. Listen closely to the lyrics of &quot;Chariot,&quot; with ample poeticism to make you sigh. He weaves many different views of the world, love, confidence, and faith in one album.  &quot;Chariot&quot; is worth every cent you'll spend on it. Listen closely to it. Cherish it. It will be a collectible later on.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|FIRST OFF, I WANNA SAY THAT I TOOK A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO CRITIQUING THIS ALBUM AND THIS IS ALL JUST PERSONAL OPINION (rubbish) AND I WILL NEVER WRITE THIS WAY AGAIN. PROMISE<BR>BAD SIDE:<BR>I guess it's cause I was reading a faux interview on the buddyhead website.  It really got me thinking. I want to say that I'm kind of pissed off that I like this CD.  Don't get me wrong, this album has so many redeeming qualities.  You really should like this band a lot, listen to the CD quite a bit, but for God sakes don't respect them so much as to call them the saviors of rock.  If it costs this much to save rock, then everybody start writing your own rock n' roll cos it's not worth it. I just erased a lot because I don't want you to think I'm a snob.  Everyone,including myself, will have to realize music is changing a lot.  With people burning CDs now, the industry is kind of open wounded.  Which a long theory that I have (don't have room)might prove this to be a good thing.<BR>DEFENDING THE SNOBS:<BR>I just wanna say that I like all types of music.  I think it would be awesome if I could be a record company exec or be one of those guys who scouts new talent, since I sort of do that by nature anyway.  But think about this for a second.  Did you know that the Strokes spend a sh*tload of money on this album?  Why was that necessary?  Isn't spontaneous efficiency the idea behind lo-fi?  I have to say that that kind of makes me scratch my head.  All I have sometimes is a 8 track, guitar, and a microphone.  I hated using that at first but it kind of grew on me.  I love lofi music now.  Bands like the Strokes are manufactured (I really hate to say that) to tell these kinds of artists to go to h*ll with that.  Spend all you $$$ to sound so poor.  See, the great thing about bands like Television GBV Elliott Smith (RIP) and even Spoon is that they were able to create something beautiful with so little, get paid for it, and use almost all of that money to go out and live for presenting it to people, while also trying to get by.  I personally find those people fascinating.  That's magic and a slap in the face to the music industry, which is what indie music snobs love.  The starving musician.<BR>GOOD SIDE:<BR>The Strokes aren't starving, in fact they create a nice little world for the listener.  They get 5 stars for style alone and the music gets 5 stars--- a warm lofi masterpiece all the way.  The lead singer Julian's voice is very good, sounding exactly like a rock star should IMO.  4 stars bc of what i've stated above.  These guys have mastered the art of tongue-in-cheek which is one of my favorite qualities in a band I like.  Lyrics are kind of childish, they aren't life-changing (I can't imagine why some of you are implying that this band is changing you life though) they'll make you smile.  All in all this CD is good because its paving the way for other artists and maybe thier ideas will bring about an influence on their own. &lt;wink&gt;<BR>BEST SONGS:<BR>what ever happened, meet me in the bathroom, the end is no end<BR>  I don't know the album just kind of flows so take it as a whole.<BR>I DON'T LIKE REPTILIA THOUGH
B000002JKA|5.0|I am very impressed with this album.  It can rock you hard and soften you up and make you cry.  Mr. LaBrie's vocals are just all over the place.  And Petruttci's guitars are top freakin' awesomee!  <br />My favorite track is Lifting Shadows off a Dream.  It's really beautiful.  And there three song story &quot;A Mind Beside Itself&quot; (consisting of the instrumental Erotomania, and the songs Voices, and The Silent Man) is just plain awesome.  About a man stuck between a rock and a hard place about god.  Should he stay or should he go.  Awesome stuff.<br />Inosencce Faded shows some of LAbries higher octaves.  This guy is talented!  And 6am gets you off rocking at the very begining.  Lies and The Mirror seem to be fan favorites but are the low part on the album for me, if i had to pick any that it.  They are still really hard rocking tracks.<br />This album does an excellent job showing what the mighty Dream Theatre can do.  excellent album guys!
076790592X|4.0|I though this this book taught me a valuable lesson. To live life and have no regrets. It taught me to listen and to be there for others as I would want them to be there for me. It is a great book to read if you want to understand the meaning of life.
B00004Z400|5.0|This is the best Deftones album ever released.  They were really at the top of there game here.  They took numetal and made it both really heavy and slow and melodic at the same time.  Chino can rap and scream better than any of those horrible numetal bands that exist now.  Back to School (mini magit) and Pink Maggit both rocked my socks off as well as Passenger, Street Carp, and even the ballady Teenager.  There isn;t a dud on this album.  If you want to move away from hasbeen Korn and Limp Bizkit, pick up this good album!
0446608955|5.0|Before I read this novel, I never even heard of Nicholas Sparks, and what his writing was all about, so I talked to a friend and they recommended this book, and the author, so I went to the library like I always do, and checked this out. <BR> At first I thought this novel was kind of slow at the beginning, but as I moved along with the story, I then realized that this man Nicholas Sparks has heart and he has written a good story. <BR> It is about a boy named Landon, who falls in love with a Preists daughterm but as times goes on, she starts to get weak, and he finds out the truth, I am not going to spoil the ending for the people who want to read this novel. But this is the first book that made me cry, because I got to know these characters: Landon and Jaime as like they were real. <BR> So read this novel if you want to get into a real deep love and tragic story.
0385504209|1.0|If it had been better written, and if the development of plot &amp; characters had been more thorough, then this would have been a more enjoyable book to read.  As it is, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a generally not good book that occasionally rises to the lofty heights of a mediocre work of fiction.  It certainly does not merit all of the hype it has gotten.<br />Judged strictly on the standards of a mystery novel, there is little to distinguish this book.  The excitement &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; has generated rests not in its literary merits, but rather on the supposed &quot;historical truths,&quot; sensational in nature, upon which the story is based.<br />Unfortunately, huge chunks of Brown's material have been lifted from the book &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail,&quot; by mssrs. Baigent et al.  While &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; is in itself a very entertaining book, it is also the worst example of pseudohistorical conspiracy theory masquerading as genuine historical scholarship.  Most of the theories within &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; are (even by the authors' own admission!) pure speculation that cannot be supported by historical evidence.<br />Brown appears to have cobbled together a few other conspiracy theories, relating to the Priory of Sion &amp; Rennes-le-Chateau (all equally dubious).  He also puts forth the ludicrous but hilarious contention that the Emperor Constantine practically pulled the notion of Christ's divinity out of thin air --- a contention so easily disproven by the historical record that it hardly merits mentioning.  Mostly, however,  his &quot;exhaustive historical research&quot; seems to rest with lifting big chunks of material from &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail.&quot;<br />Anybody with a few minutes to kill can search the internet for sources that can easily debunk just about all of the historical &quot;facts&quot; that are cited in this novel.  When the validity of the history evaporates, the sensational nature of the novel similarly disappears.<br />One suspects that Brown knows that he is mostly re-hashing a bunch of pseudohistorical gobbledygook, but is banking on the general ignorance of his readers, and it appears that in this case, his research was (for once) both thorough &amp; accurate.he novel similarly disappears.<br />One suspects that Brown knows that he is mostly re-hashing a bunch of pseudohistorical gobbledygook, but is banking on the general ignorance of his readers, and it appears that in this case, his research was (for once) both thorough &amp; accurate.
B000089RVR|5.0|This CD exudes all of the qualities I look for in a CD.  It is both poignant and exuberant.  The songs seem to be talking about me at any particular time.  Dido has proved once again that she is truly capable of writing music that speaks to the heart.
0471381985|4.0|The values are out there, it is just a matter of finding them and knowing what to look for.  This book has many ideas about how to find the values.<br />I was somewhat disappointed in some of the math since I found some errors, for example on pg 139 of my edition, the formula for PV contains an error.  <br />The Earnings Power Value seems to be useful for some situations, but not in all cases --- I think that point is covered in the book, yet so much time is devoted to EPV.  <br />Even with some rough spots, this book will indeed help me in my investing walk.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Too many people that have enjoyed the books over the years want to see exactly what Tolkien wrote translated to the big screen...there is no way this could happen and keep the movies under 4 hours each. I think there are a few things that were changed that I didn't agree with but that does not change my opinion of how great this movie was.<br />The scenery was yet again spectacular and the actors took their roles to heart and played each with intensity. I cannot wait to see the extended edition as I was very satisfied with the extended edition of Fellowship. Thank you Peter Jackson for providing us with a true jewel in film history.
B00000K19E|4.0|Deep, the rabbit hole takes you away from the computer-generated dream world to the horrifying real Catharsis where Machines are all dominant and aggressive against the all too organic humans, now secondary in the alimentary chain. You'll wet your pants at first sight with the Power Plant. Alas, this is the real thing, you are a Battery. Now a Myth in movie history, The Matrix is Anime style for real, or at least, close enough to the concept. Released in 1999, this little project (as little as 75 million dollars) came from nowhere to be the new philosophy in this modern science fiction / action adventure film era. Conceptually ground breaking, and visually stunning, the film blends Kun Fu (Mega Kick action), along with the appealing Cyber-Punk way of adventure, to bring something never seen before, not here, neither in Indochina. The new photograph technique Bullet-Time, showed the world how things look as clearly as possible in a 360 degrees-CGI environment, with a highly fashioned hero skipping bullets (not fast enough for Neo), and immediately, every one of us went to say, Woooooowwwww man. Quickly the film became an instant box-office success, carving in the cultural collective conscience of the so called: computer / comic geeks (from here on, its actually cool to be one, no more shame), and the rest of the normal people (the ones who actually get laid). And so, the critics and audiences all around the world applauded its directors, the Wachowski Brothers (Larry and Andy), for their intelligent and keen contribution to the already wasted action flicks. Well, actually not everybody applauded, poor George Lucas did saw how his long wanted Oscar for Best Special Effects (which is what Episode I, is all about), went into the hands of Amateurs (compared to the Industrial Lights and Magic team, that have been around ever since Star Wars). 4 Academy Awards, including Best Editing, crowned the recognition as a Masterpiece, and helped the film sell more for the already trigger-happy Joel Silver (in case you are wondering, money does make you fat, right Joel?), the rest, is all history. <BR>The Matrix has tree merits that makes its first viewing a crazy ride; first, the great combination of the smart and original script, along with specially strategic cuts of the first 30 minutes, made the What's real and what's not real topic, both confusing (in the best sense of the word), and captivating, where the spectator doesn't knows what's going on, actually, it puts you in the situation of the main character, so, you are as lost as Neo is. To continue with, the excellent Kun Fu action choreography by the great Yuen Wo Ping, made every action scene to the date felt short and boring (it was shock to know that the main actors actually performed 90% of their stunts). And of course, the amazing and never before seen visual effects that where always in service of the story (the opposite of The Matrix Reloaded, and The Matrix Revolutions, where every visual effect is for free, away from any story necessity), all reunited by a accurate direction, with the help of a First class crew, made The Matrix a cinematic phenomenon. The actors where fit in their roles (Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Ann Moss, Hugo Weaving, among others, are barely O.K. in their easy characters) as the traditional heroes (Neo is basically, a black haired Luke Skywalker), and the not so traditional ones (Morpheus), hunted by the strange looking Agents, that look more like an I.R.S. employee (a nice and fresh change). The script was good enough to sustain its story weakness and character stereotypes, ending in a great rush of action and Kun Fu fights, stunning from beginning to end. The music by Don Davis, is a mediocre work, mostly saved by the good choice of songs blended with his original score. <BR>If you watch the movie carefully, you'll notice that there are 3 minor production mistakes. One belongs to the Cut, when Neo and Trinity arrives the Agent Holdings (where Morpheus is kept), the appearing of the already dress and armed police effectives happens to fast from the time the heroes arrives (a time and editing mistake). Take into consideration that after Morpheus is caught, the Agents aren't expecting the Heroes to save him). The other mistake is when the famous Rooftop Bullet-Time scene (where Neo falls back and skips the bullets), before the Agent shots towards Neo, the hero fires at Agent first (lest say some 12 shots), the Agent skips all the bullets (a frontal shot of the Agent is shown), but behind him is a very close building all covered by mirrors, the mistake is that the building is close enough to have been hit by Neo's bullets, the CGI guys miss this one, and the building is shown intact. Also in that same shot, when Neo finishes shooting towards the Agent, he throws his pistols down (just aside his feet), so during the Bullet-Time shot the pistols disappears completely, when the scene cuts away from the Bullet-Time and we see Neo on the ground, the pistols re-appear again. Anyway, this is only if you watch the movie to many times.<BR>This DVD was the first one to sell more than a million copies, after it, everything DVD rise up in huge sells. The transferring is great (the digitally grading of the film can be appreciated at its fullest), with a clean 5.1 Dolby digital, magnifying the Bullet-Time moments. The extras are quite good, specially the: Follow the white Rabbit mode, gives a different inside of the movie (the Audio Commentary is terribly boring, John Gaeta's Big Shot attitude, kills Zach Staenberg's effort to give away an entertaining and deep commentary). So, get kick into this un-realistic world of computer intelligence and Kun Fu punches.
078324228X|1.0|This film is WRONG WRONG WRONG... the glorification of this man should not be allowed to continue unabated. The historical &quot;inacuracies&quot; are not limited to just the &quot;compression of a few characters&quot; or the &quot;cutting of a few corners&quot;. It instead attempts to convince an increasingly gullible film going public that a twice convicted triple murderer was an honourable and gentle, scholarly &quot;buddha&quot;. <BR>This is not a mere distortion of the truth to make the story more watchable but a complete misrepresentation of the truth in every single part of the film.<br />The Bob Dylan song in the film (which incidentally, rather tellingly, he has not performed since carters second conviction in 1976, shortly after he beat the hell out of the woman who led the campaign for his release) is as much of a work of utter fiction, but was inspired and written in a time when the civil rights movement in America was at its most fiery.<br />There is however NO excuse for making a travesty of a film like this. I advise anyone who &quot;liked&quot; or &quot;enjoyed&quot; this film as entertainment or was taken in by the ludicrous portrayal of this savage brutal murderer to visit [...] to see the REAMS of evidence that runs contrary to the twee hollywood nonsense in this film.<br />There have been PLENTY of civil rights heroes that could and should be glorified ahead of and above Rubin Carter.<br />People like to believe the warm fuzzy story of a wrongly convicted man getting justice in the end, but the facts are being ignored.<br />1. Rubin carter had lost 7 of his last 15 fights and was in no way &quot;number 1 contender for the middlewight crown&quot;<BR>2. Rubin Carter, as a young lad, did not stab a paediophile to protect his friend, he bottled a guy to get his wristwatch and $50<BR>3. Rubin Carter was discharged from the army after 4 courts martial, involving violent conduct.<BR>4. Rubin Carter beat a woman almost to death after his first release. She had been the leader of the campaign for his release<BR>5. Rubin Carter refused to take a lie detector test 4 times, even though he was promised he could walk free if he passed<BR>6. Rubin carter had in previous interviews admitted to firing guns at people for fun, and to numerous incidences of unrepented and severe public violence<br />There are so many more facts about him..... not including the evidence aginst him with regard to the lafayette grill murders.<br />This film leaves me feeling physically sick and reeks of all that is wrong with Hollywoods greedy championing of any &quot;cause celebre&quot; that they can make a fast buck out of. DO NOT BUY THIS FILM.
0920668372|5.0|My son, now 4.2 yrs, and I have read this book often.  He received it as a gift on his 2nd birthday. He enjoys it and will recall, &quot;I'll love you forever and like you for always, Mommy&quot; when we're together  This book does tug at the emotions of young children as well as Mommy's.  It's also a good jumping off book for talking about aging Grandparents et al.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Loved the show and was mad as all get out when they took it off the air. Nathan Fillion, is one of my favorite actors. I would like to see him back on the tv again and I would also like to see this complete set available on VHS also.
B00005JKZV|3.0|Much more so than &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, this chapter focuses too much on overrated special effects. Like Lucas, Peter Jackson seems to believe that these CGI effects are better than they are and that they can carry a movie.  I felt this way when I saw the movie at the theater and feel even more so having seen it on TV- the battle scenes have little substance and attempt to (ineffectively) fool you into believing that there is actually a detailed scene occurring on the screen.  In reality, I find them blurry, dark and confusing.  Battle was certainly a key part of Tolkien's work, but was really only peripheral to a much larger whole.  I don't want to see a fantasy version of &quot;Braveheart&quot; when watching LOTR (at least &quot;Braveheart&quot; used real people to recreat its battle scenes).  <br />Gollum, on the other hand, was wonderful and his scenes are the redeeming feature of this chapter.  He's no Jar Jar Binks, that's for sure.  I had always imagined Gollum to be a black, froglike creature (no doubt this was formed by watching the cartoon version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;).  However, this pale, more human version seems much more accurate to Tolkien's vision and I can easily adapt my imagination to accept this thing as how Gollum should truly look.<br />I'm not one to insist that a movie be a literal adaptation of a book- it should be an interpretation but not a scene by scene reenactment of the author's every word.  I think the Harry Potter movies, as good as they are, are a bit too sterile and took the safe path when adapting those books.  However, some of the added and changed scenes really detract from Tolkien's works- I won't give away spoilers, but this veered much further away from the book than did the first movie.  Again, I think a lot of that was done in order to emphasize the battle scenes.  But there are some major changes to some important characters (Faramir, the Ents, Saruman) that really detract from my enjoyment.  And the added scene with Aragorn and the worg and the cliff is almost comical.<br />This movie is still essential viewing, especially if you invested time in watching the first one.  I suspect that when these films are finished, it will be best viewed as one long movie rather than three individual parts.  Worthy adaptations of Tolkien, but too much emphasis on superficial qualities and overuse of overrated and unproven technology.   They LOOK good and are technically proficient, but somehow don't quite capture the spirit of what I took away from the books.
B000089RVR|5.0|\\"Life for Rent\\" is absolutely amazing.  She's taking more of a leap on this album than \\"No Angel\\" (which I still love).  Her song and voice are one of the best because they're beautiful and I have an easy time singing along because all her songs are in my range.  Get this.  It's magnificent.  There is also a hidden track at the end of the cd.  Just leave it on for a few minutes after the cd's done playing and it'll automatically play a 12th song.  What a pleasant surprise :)
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|People will say the strokes are just a bandwago band, but its incredibly unfortunate that these people have to be wrong. Room on Fire is an incredibly good cd, and if the pretentious people buying this album cant see that they shouldnt be allowed to listen to music. Room on Fire is even better than Is This It? because not only did they do the same thing they did on the last record, they did it BETTER. Its an excellent release because the band knows that they dont need to experiment and advance their sound with anything new because its fine the way it is right now and no band needs to jump to new heights on just thier second release. This is an incredible album by an incredible band and whoever doesnt buy it is making a huge mistake.
B00005NTJM|5.0|This Is the best Tull album.  Not too ambitious like their later material, and fun to listen to.  I disagree with some of the other reviews, the songs on this album are great: bluesy, simple, and often light-hearted.  The best is Song for Jeffrey with its distorted vocals and slide guitar.  A couple of their follow up albums are solid, but I find myself coming back to This Was more often.

0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere, by Neil Gainman, is a bizarre, fascinating, intriguing novel.  It is the story of Richard Mayhew, a young businessman.  He is living in London for the first time.  Richard is enjoying relative success in his job.  He also has a beautiful fiance, Jessica.  It looks like everything is going right for him.<BR>Richard is taking his fiance and her boss to dinner one evening when he sees a dirty young woman lying bleeding on the sidewalk.   He rescues the girl and carries her to his apartment.<BR>Next morning, two weird men come to Richard's apartment. One has rat-colored hair, and the other has fox-colored hair.  They are looking for the girl.  Richard doesn't want to let them in, because the girl is right there in the bathroom, but they go in anyway and search the apartment.

0446677450|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Being a high school student I need to know as much about money as I can, since I will be living on my own in the near future. THis book had many helpful concepts including things that my parents (established medical doctors) didn't even know. The concept about liablities versus assests are very interesting. This book calls the United states to reasses the style and content of education regarding money and finances. THere is no class about this type of subject and we all need to know about it since that is what our life will be like when we leave the comfort of our parents.
B00009W8N2|5.0|Opeth a band beyond brilliant. One of the finest bands I have listened to for 30 years of my life. Orchid, Morningrise, Still Life, Black Water Park and My Arms, Your Hearse are classic and incomparable to any band in the world. Deliverance and Damnation is great, but doesn't hold up to Opeth style.     It's just grand.    RAJ
076790592X|5.0|I was required to read this book for a sociology class for school. No one wants to read an assigned book, students dread it, but after reading the first couple of pages, I had found myself engulfed in it. It was very interesting on how Morrie dealt with his inevitable death and how he looked back on how he lived. I'm not going to give you a synopsis of the book because its probably been done over and over again on this review list but would just highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn on how to deal with people who are about to pass. Morrie makes a good point on this, he says something of the sort that you shouldnt just send sympathy, you should call, visit and just spend as much time as you can with that person as his students, friends, and colleagues have done with him. His other thoughts on life are very interesting and promising on a guide to living a good life.
B0000DD79B|1.0|Great, just what we need.  A 2-album disc set that features the overrated, introspective music of two of the most annoying hippies alive.  Didn't these guys break up because one was jealous that the other guy had hair?  In any case, I've heard almost all these songs and they're about as boring as all get-out.  The only tune worth anything is &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&quot; and even that got overplayed to death by commercial radio.  <br />I'm telling you, if you want to discover true hippie music, check out Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Grateful Dead or Bon Jovi.  At least all those hippies managed to rock out at times!!  These guys just strum their acoustic guitars like stoned losers - which they are!!  <br />What can I say?  If you're a hippie, run, don't walk, to discover these &quot;masterful&quot; songs.  Hey, you might &quot;dig&quot; it, man.  Otherwise, steer far clear from this travesty on wheels.<br />By the way, is Halen coming back with Roth this December?  That's the rumor, I'm told.<br />LaTeR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000DJZAH|5.0|I have the old Tommy remaster from 1996, which was ok, if you ignore the pops on a few tracks, especially &quot;We're Not Going To Take It/See Me Feel Me/Listening to you.&quot; This is the way I fell in love with this album, but as far as this new release: It was like experiencing Tommy a whole different way.<br />Those of you who remember the old remaster will probably remember the CD insert mentioning that the master tapes had been burned... well, they haven't! Pete Townshend discovered them, and this CD is remasted off of the actual master tapes! I was a bit skeptical when I picked this Deluxe Edition up yesterday, but as soon as I put it in my CD player, I was shocked.<br />The new experience has no clicks and pops, none of the overmodulation problems the last release had, and you can hear the harmonies much better. The flat sound from the harmonies in songs like &quot;Christmas&quot; and &quot;Tommy Can You Hear Me&quot; are gone, these songs are experiences in themselves. You will hear so much more in &quot;Sparks&quot; and the &quot;Underture&quot; than you could discern in the old remaster.<br />Overall this CD is an excellent purchase for any Who fan, or anyone that wants to hear the first Rock Opera ever. The outtakes are OK, they allow you to hear the evolution of the album. I am very happy with the B-side of Pinball Wizard being included (Dogs Pt. 2). I am, however, disappointed with the most obvious thing missing from this release: The Libretto. The last remaster had the Libretto with it as did the original LP. The Libretto really helps you to understand the plot better, as it shows which characters are saying what.<br />As for the comment about The Who trying to rip off of Oasis, all I can say is that this album was released in 1969, just approximately a couple of decades before Oasis.<br />I highly reccomend this for any Who fan, or someone that simply wants the album Tommy. It is an audiophile's dream ;-).
B00004YRQA|5.0|Works pretty good. Has lots of storage, good for the games that take up a lot of space.Loads very quickly. However won't work for ps one nor will it save ps one games, but for ps2 games it does pretty well. Plus because it's by sony you know that it wont delete your cherished games.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when iron Maiden released yet another album.  I wan't hoping for much more than a rebuffed &quot;Brave New World,&quot; and nothing that would even come close to their greats like &quot;Powerslave.&quot;  It contains so much more energy and feeling than any previous Maiden album.  I'd have to say that this is possibly a better album than Powerslave simply because all the songs never get boring.  The album starts out with 2 mediocre songs and just rips after that.  &quot;No More Lies,  Dance of Death, and Paschendale&quot; have to be my favorites, but I never skip a song on this album.  It's inspiring to see such an amazing and talented band still playng at their full potential and beyond.
B00005JM0B|5.0|I really enjoyed Terminator 3, contrary to my negative expectations. <BR>After nearly a decade since the huge commercial success in both theaters and DVD market of Terminator 2,a film that James Cameron has invested so much technically, and creativally, I had a slight aversion towards this third installement, being disappointed before with similar revivals of classic films like Star Wars, but I was very much surprised by how well this film is made, and I made few observations,<BR>First I felt that T3 was closest to the original Terminator film. T2 was surely a very ambitious and exciting and extravagantly directed film, but it had something which personally I found off putting: The robot/terminator had a deeper almost three dimensional approach..a robot who experiences human feelings is an angle that can easily fall in the trap of the one S word I hate in  movies, sentimentality.<BR>Speilberg fell into that trap in AI and Cameron did border it in T2.<BR>(The only robot with human feelings movie that works so well is Ridley Scott's masterpiece Blade Runner).<BR>So the fresh thing about T3 is the fact that the terminator returns to his non-nonsense tough self with a very determined mission, and no time for cheesy emotions,quite similar to the first film.<BR>The other fresh addition is of course Kristanna Loken. She adds an invaluable sexiness to the movie, a deadly and very pretty robot..not unlike Natasha Hentsridge in Species minus the nudity and love scenes.<BR>Jonathan Mostow's direction was very good, and all the cast played their roles very well..but it is Arnold Shwarzenegger that I was mostly impressed with.<BR>He is back on top form, and with the aid of make up and a still super fit body, he appears to be more comfortable than he was in any of his recent roles.<BR>And while he traded signing film contracts and carrying guns, with signing legislations and carrying babies, in T3 he was able to demonstrate that the huge fan base he has acquired over the years was the result of the tough charisma and the cheeky humour he posesses.<BR>And T3 is full of funny lines.<BR>One example: When terminator goes with Stahl and Danes's characters to see Danes father, he says is a straight faced manner: 'We can reach CRS in an hour depending on the traffic! which I found hilarious!<BR>T3 is also full of non stop action, a roller coaster of a ride that is crammed with very impressive digital trickery that will have you gasp in amazement.<BR>Finally, I was totally surprised by the ending! a twist that will truly shock you and a perfect end to the movie. <BR>So, thanks to producers Mario Kassar and Andrew G Vajna and to Jonathan Mostow and 'Governor' Shwarzenegger that this franchise was revived again to give us a very entertaining movie, full of heart pounding stunts, pleasent humour and a DVD experience you can enjoy over and over again.
0393312836|5.0|I decided to read this because I loved the movie so much, and Burgess didn't disappoint.  The language was a lot of fun and the story was very exciting again, even though I knew it well.  It's a great book to read and will give you hours of good enjoyment.
B000001FLA|4.0|After this, it was all downhill. His albums began to get a bit \\"samey\\", containing songs of dubiously similar, commercial style, with the occasional left-field entry of a real metal epic. This album shows him wanting to try the radio-friendly thing with \\"You Don't Remember\\", which is probably his least bubble-gum flavored pop song, but overall it isn't very  commercial. And it was the last one to be without one of his ultra-cheesey ballads, which gains MAJOR points for TRILOGY. <BR>Nope, there are definitely NO songs on TRILOGY that your girlfriend would like, which is how it should be. Well, the aforementioned \\"You Don't Remember\\" might actually be a chick song, but besides that one it's all dungeons and dragons and shreddery. <BR>Yngwie will never be called a poet, but he at least covers some fairly interesting topics with \\"Queen in Love\\" and \\"Dark Ages\\". \\"Liar\\" sees him seething at someone who backstabbed him, whilst \\"Crying\\" is a nice little acoustic solo vehicle.<BR>Undoubtedly the final tune is the piece-de-resistance. \\"Trilogy Suite\\" is in my useless opinion his best, most interesting instrumental. It wears many more faces than the throw-away 3 minute shred-fests he tacked onto his subsequent albums, and never loses your attention. The blistering acoustic break towards the end is To DIE FOR.<BR>Yngwie also plays bass on the album and does an amazing job at that, especially in the Trilogy Suite where he routinely does his Bach schtick on the four-string. <BR>Apparently the singer Mark Boals has found some disfavor amongst Yngwie fans, which I can't really relate to. I find him much more interesting than any of the other singers Yngwie's had, especially the \\"middle-namers\\": Jeff Scott Soto and Joe Lynn Tuneless, rock star extraordinaire.<BR>Yngwie's first 3 albums show him doing it his way. After that, it was Yngwie doing it the financial way. Turns out it never really paid off--he was never a radio staple--and part of me is glad that it backfired on him. Serves him right for abandoning his integrity to greed.
B00003003R|5.0|Look, here is the deal with live albums.  I'd say that there are five criteria that a live album must have to be considered great.  If the album doesn't have all, or at least three of the qualities, why buy it?  We already have all the same old music on the prior CDs.  In my opinion I think a great live album must sound good (Live Era sounds GREAT), contain a cover song or two (It's Alright), have different versions of a couple tunes (Used to Love Her, Patience, You're Crazy (great mix of Lies and Appetite versions, by the way), Some cool jams (Move to the City, Estranged, November Rain (Piano intro is about three minutes long!), and I like to hear the band speak a bit (Rocket Queen, Knocking' on Heaven's Door, I hate it when it's cut out.  This album is fantastic, it has them all.  Think about some of your favorite live albums, Id bet they have some of these qualities.  Best spots on this album are Move to the City, You're Crazy, Pretty Tied Up, November Rain, damn they're all good, BUY IT NOW!
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin true hard rock musical &quot;misfits&quot;people were almost frightened by them.So much power and some absolute truthful &quot;rock and roll&quot;They played and you were lifted out of your chair,that group had a magical new way of haunting lyics and guitar riffs that certainly blew most of us out of our chairs and heads as well.Time moves on but Led Zeppelin is fortunately timeless.Listen to this and be revived once again...
B0000AYJXR|4.0|The new \\"Space Jam\\" 2-Disc DVD is a fun addition to any Looney Tunes or family DVD collection.  <br />Disc One features the film, which can be enjoyed with commentary from the director, as well as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.  Most DVD commentaries are a bore to sit through--and this one does have its over technical moments (especially if you have young children who \\"believe in\\" Bugs or Daffy), but the comments from the characters are very witty--including a jab that Bugs throws at Michael Jordan early in the presentation (concerning his brief baseball career).<br />Rounding out the first disc is the theatrical trailer of the film (this is almost a MUST with me for any DVD).<br />The Second Disc is a nice bonus and could have easily been packaged as a stand-alone item.  It features a \\"Making of Space Jam\\" and several Looney Tunes shorts (from the 1980's and 1990's), as well as the 1988 television special, \\"Bugs vs. Daffy:  Battle of the Music Video Stars\\".  Speaking of music videos, the second disc also features \\"Fly Like an Eagle\\" and \\"Monstars Anthem\\".<br />This is a great gift for any Looney Tunes fan.  Folks who liked it as children in 1996 (when the film was released) should still like it as teens.  Children who have never seen it will also enjoy it. In short, it's a keeper.
B000002I27|5.0|ray manzarek is a master musician,this album is so convoluted and out of sync only to show morrisons and manzareks true talent.convoluted,usually polluted,but the uniquely placed words that morrison tosses out like shiny dimes,are brilliant yet still have a patina of a street hustler.All the doors albums were good,some just different,but you always knew you were in for a surprise and some new found emotions due to Jim Morrisons eclectic song writing.Stephen........
B0000AKCLS|5.0|JOE's other 2 releases are constantly on my CD player. I have introduced many people to this outstanding talent and this CD again confirms him as one of the modern greats. Someone found him lacking in comparison to CLAPTON / KWS and others. I am not sure how anyone can make such a misguided statement. I have seen KWS and JOE BONAMASSA would play better solos on 2 strings than KWS can conjure up over a whole evening of mindless SRV cloning. JOE with 3 fingers would still be able to teach CLAPTON a whole repertoire of new stuff. Yes I have seen CLAPTON live and base this assessment on first hand knowledge ( have seen him 3 times actually ) JOE BONAMASSA dodges the easy option of SRV cloning and creates styles that are recognisably his. His vocals are first rate for the blues and his choice of covers is excellent. If you like electric blues, you simply must have this CD. You might have to reassess your whole blues collection after this one.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|This is a better album.  Although, anyone looking to disprove that, will find a way.  &quot;Is This It&quot;, was a new sound, from a new band. It was exciting.  (OK, so you can say they ripped off everything they did, but it still sounded great, didn't it?)   &quot;Room on Fire&quot;, is a further experimentation of their influences, but it's really beautiful in parts.  The Strokes show that they have gotten better at playing their instruments.  Casablancas has shown he can write more complex tunes.  But this one takes a while to sink in.  It's not as accessible, that's for sure, but that might be directly related to the fact that they are getting more complex.   The two songs that remind me most of the last album, in terms of being pure, simple,  pop hits, are &quot;12:51&quot;, and &quot;Under Control&quot;  These two could go pretty far on the charts.  It's not that the rest of the album is completely subversive, it's that the songs are more atmospheric, more moody, deeper in lyrics and music.  They kind of sound angry in parts.  I think they want to prove they'll be around for a while.  No problem there, but they are basically talking about themselves now, and I think that this album is a meditation on their new existence as pop stars.  I think the expectations were so high because they basically were the freshest sound to come around the rock scene in a long time.  Unfortunately, we as fans or critics, expect something mindblowing, and not just enjoyable.  This is the second album, relax.  If they have mindblowing in them, it will come. Patience, patience.  I think these new songs came strictly out of the desire to create more songs..to launch a second album, not to create a masterpiece.  But as a second record, it works pretty damn good.  Essentially, they are getting closer to what we expect of them.  After this, as fans, we should demand more.  But lets enjoy the record.  Strokes fans will love this CD and defend it until the next one comes out, just like the first.  &quot;Give 'em some time, they just need a little time.&quot;<BR>Bottom line: it's still more interesting and pleasing than most anything out there.  It might even be amazing, but hey, I've only listened to it 20 times in the past two days.  Give me a little time here.
0783230893|5.0|Reviewed Date:  October 2003<BR>Studio:         Universal Studios<BR>Genre:          Drama<BR>Exposure:       Color<BR>Running Time:   130 Minutes<BR>Rating:         PG-13<BR>Release Year:   1991<BR>Directed By:    Jon Aunet<br />Starring:  Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Jessica Tandy.<br />Co-Starring:  Gailard Sartain, Stan Shaw, Cicely Tyson, Gary Basaraba, Grace Zabriskie, Richard Riehle, Grayson Fricke, Lashondra Phillips, Enjolik Oree, Nick Searcy, and Ginny Parker.<br />If you want to see a good movie for the whole family, &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; is the movie for you.  It shows friendship, compassion, humor, laughter, and real life encounters.<br />The setting takes place in the late 1980's and takes you back in time a half century to the town of Whistle Stop, Alabama.<br />&quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; is a movie for anyone.  It can make the best of us laugh and cry through the entire movie.  &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; is a movie that gives you two different stories within itself.  One story takes you back to the 1930's.  The other part of the story takes place in the 1980's between Ninny Threadgooda, telling the story of her past to help her new friend Evelyn get her life together.<br />The frienships made within the movie show that this woman do hold their friendships in very high regards.  The friendship in the 1930's would help both women to get through some really tough times.  The friendship in the 1980's between Ninny and Evelyn keep these two ladies on track.<br />I give this movie 5 stars because it is a movie for anyone.  Also because it shows how good friends will help a loved one in need of there help at a drop of a hat.   This movie is just a well rounded movie, filled with emotion.
B00006878K|5.0|I got this on vinyl in the 60's and it was one of the albums that really turned me on to the blues. It's been out of print for years, and unavailable on CD, for unfathomable reasons. &quot;Crosscut Saw&quot; has been covered many times (by Clapton, among others) but this is the  original and best version of it. &quot;Laundromat Blues&quot; is also a classic. This is a must-have for any electric blues collection (but pick up some Freddy King while you're at it - he's hot too).
B000002H97|2.0|People are always going on and on about how this album is Metallica's best. Um.. look at the name METALlica and you'll see the name \\"Metal\\" in there. Their previous albums were masterpieces, just works of art. Then they pretty much go downhill after \\"... And Justice For All\\". Is it a coincidence that after Metallica's self proclaimed \\"Black Album\\" that their other CDs turned out to be total crap? This CD is the one that killed Metallica.<br />\\"Enter Sandman\\" - I think that they were trying too hard on this song. The guitars, drums and bass guitar were decent, but by no way standard to any of their talent.<br />\\"Sad but True\\" - They sold out with this song. Listen to Kid Rock, and you'll know why.<br />\\"Holier Than Thou\\" - This song is actually very good. One of the better songs on the CD.<br />\\"Unforgiven\\" - If Ulrich wrote this song, he should die. But if Hetfield did, he should just be whipped.<br />\\"Wherever I May Roam\\" - Just.. blah.<br />\\"Don't Tread on Me\\" - Actually one of the better songs Metallica has produced. Reminds me of the old Metallica.<br />\\"Through the Never\\" - This song sucks so much, I can't even remember how it goes.<br />\\"Nothing Else Matters\\" - What.. in the hell.. were they thinking? I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a good song. But it's too slow.<br />\\"Of Wolf and Man\\" - Lyrics are horrendous, riffs are original. But it is a catchy song.<br />\\"God That Failed\\" - Bass guitar was good, that's about it.<br />\\"My Friend of Misery\\" - Reminds me of the last song.<br />\\"Struggle Within\\" - Cheesy song.<br />If you're a true Metallica fan, you will agree with me that this is not even near their best album.
0743216458|5.0|I didn't expect such an emotional reaction to Stephen E. Ambrose's Band of Brothers. Having recently read his historical account of the D-Day invasion at Normandy with its mostly just-the-facts style, I was prepared for more of the same. What I got was that  ... and a whole lot more.<br />Band of Brothers chronicles the travels and travails of Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division, which dropped behind enemy lines in France on D-Day, June 6, 1944, and marched on through battle after battle--including the Battle of the Bulge--right to Berlin. Surprisingly, even after all they had been through they were reassigned to the Pacific to continue their heroic efforts against the Japanese, and were prevented from doing so only because Japan surrendered before they got there. Like Ambrose's D-Day book, Band of Brothers provides step-by-step detail of the movement of men and materiel, the key weaponry, and the significant events that shaped each major battle involving Easy Company. But where D-Day focuses exclusively on the Normandy invasion and is colored by anecdotes and quotes from a cross-section of the men participating, this book focuses on one group of men and their experiences. The reader develops a more personal connection to the characters and the harsh realities of their ordeal.<br />The book's title is significant because Ambrose endeavors to explain the rare relationship that develops between men in combat, particularly those in elite outfits that see so much action. In proving this he touches on the mysterious allure of war, which is more than the quest for glory or political righteousness. Despite the manifest horrors, those with no combat experience are left feeling almost envious of the close kinship bond these men enjoyed. They often hated the Army, their officers, the training, the conditions, the combat, the death, and only occasionally glimpsed the value of their sacrifice. But they would--and did--march through hell for one another.<br />The emotional power of the book is in the quotes from the participants themselves. These are men of the Greatest Generation. They speak simply, with little pretense, and with no apparent attempt at exaggeration. None is needed; the truth is plenty shocking. I was reminded several times of the tear-jerking final scene in the movie, Saving Private Ryan, when an elderly Ryan finally musters the courage to visit the Normandy memorial and pay homage at the gravesite of his war savior (Tom Hank's character, who was killed saving Ryan in the war, and who'd asked with his dying breath that Ryan live his life in worthy fashion). This book evokes a number of similar feelings, but with the real words of real people recounting real events. A magnificent achievement. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of BIG ICE and WAKE UP DEAD
B00004D3C1|4.0|This album (actually all Fu Manchu albums) strongly resemble Ace Frehley's &quot;Rocket Ride&quot; in many completely different ways.<br />That is a good thing.
B00006GFAB|5.0|Don't let the fact that this is the umpteenth KISS Greatest Hits collection outthere put you off. Kiss never fail to deliver and this is a great starting point for new fans and a good little collection for the die hards, like myself. My only complaint about the album is that some tracks (&quot;God Of Thunder&quot;, &quot;Cold Gin&quot; &amp; &quot;Black Diamond&quot; for example) aren't on here but you can't please everyone i suppose... But this best of truly is the best of the bunch along with Double Platinum and should be the starting point for new fans.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Every high school has its misfit, and Bates High school has Carrietta White, played with heartbreaking conviction by Sissy Spacek.  Her posture, frumpy clothes, and timid mannerisms make her the object of scorn from her classmates, who miss no opportunity to tease her.  Carrie doesn't even know her own body, explaining why she freaks out in the gym shower where she has her first (!) period.  But the minute the movie introduces us to her religious fanatic mother (done to near camp effect by Piper Laurie), it's easy to see why she's such a basket case.  And as if that weren't enough, Carrie has the &quot;gift&quot; of telekinesis.  She uses these powers to unleash hell on the night of her prom, where her main tormentor Chris Hargenson (a wonderfully catty Nancy Allen) plays a vicious prank on her.  &quot;Carrie&quot; is not only my favorite movie by director Brian DePalma, but it's also my favorite film based on a Stephen King novel.  DePalma's touch is all over this movie, and that's mainly evident through his signature camerawork.  What also makes this movie such a horror classic is the way it builds suspense to a near-intolerable high.  The scene where Carrie and Tommy Ross are crowned king and queen is done in agonizingly slow motion, creating a buildup of tension that literally ties a knot in your stomach.  The movie also works thanks to the performances from Spacek and Laurie, both of whom earned Oscar nominations.  The DVD has a very interesting documentary featuring interviews with the cast (sans John Travolta, who played the doofus Billy Nolan) as well as a photo gallery, a trailer, and another documentary on the technical aspects of the film.  After over a quarter century since its release, &quot;Carrie&quot; remains a convincing movie that excels both as a revenge fantasy and a horror story.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|I loved this CD, but of course... it's missing quite a few songs. The Hattori Hanzo sword song and every song missing from the cd can be found at killbill2.net in the rare music section. Would've gotten 5 stars if it had those songs in the first place.
B000002LCK|5.0|There are quite a few New Order compilations on the market (&quot;[The Best of] New Order,&quot; &quot;Retro,&quot; and &quot;International&quot;), but none can top 1987's &quot;Substance.&quot;  On these two discs, we have extended and (some) remixed versions of all the group's essential singles including the then new track &quot;True Faith.&quot;  While other best-of sets do a terribly botched effort compiling the group's material, &quot;Substance&quot; does the best job at covering their 1980s work.  The group's crowning moment, for me, is the disco pump of the classic &quot;Blue Monday,&quot; while we get treated to earlier nuggets like the raw &quot;Everything's Gone Green&quot; and more recognizable hits like &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; and &quot;Perfect Kiss.&quot;  Two other favorites of mine are the re-recorded versions of &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Confusion&quot; which are given dance-friendly makeovers.  While this set doesn't include any tracks from later (and lesser) albums like &quot;Technique&quot; (1989) and &quot;Republic&quot; (1993), I still think &quot;Substance&quot; is the best New Order retrospective around.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Like Nirvana after Nevermind they were under pressure for an uber album (and thats gotta be tough because nevermind was an uber album)  They came up with In Utero and opinions were divided.  People who cared for music and the band liked it.  Loved it.  Realised it was better than the last one.  Then other people snubbed it after one listen.  Which was the main mistake of the snubbing, then give a silly reason for not liking something.  Yes, i can understand not liking something but you better have a good reason!  anyway...<br />After i heard this i was not as impressed after my first listen of is this it.  Is this it was fresh strokes playing fresh songs.  This was very samey at first.  But that isnt always a bad a thing as people would have you believe.  After all, if it aint broke, dont bother fixing it.  But the strokes have still given things a right once over and shown 200% commitment otherwise.  Its the Strokes doing reggae beats (Automatic stop), metal intros (The way it is), brilliant ballads (Under control).  they once again pay homeage to the Velvet Underground and Television.  (Reptilia to me sounds very Television!)  but where they really hit the spot is being the Strokes.  The way you could imagine being in that New York apartment with beer cans strewn all over the place with band members mingling around other people at 12:51 in the early hours of saturday morning...its just a brilliant album i cant be bothered doing a 'proper' review.  I wouldnt wanna spoil the fun.  Every track is a winner, every track is better than the majority of is this it....I can already smell the 'best of' in the air.  I wont be buying it, not because the songs would suck but because I will already have every album they do.  Im into Pixies territory with this lot now- I honestly cant see them dissapointing me!
B0000A36J5|5.0|I have to say that Peter Jackson is an artisitc genius and the care that he has used in attempting to transform the greatest books of all time into excellent movies.  Everyone knows that when a book goes Hollywood not everything can be transfered word for word, but Jackson manages to capture the heart of the books performing phenomenally.  Not only are the special effects above par, but they are blended smoothly with exceptional acting and breath taking scenery.  An exceptional movie that raises the bar for Hollywood
0688163173|2.0|I've not heretofor read any of Mr. Lehane's books, and this one was recommended by our librarian to read while awaiting for &quot;Mystic River&quot; to become available. I read &quot;Shuttered Island&quot; with continuing interest although the story line was becoming a bit bizarre. When I finished the last page, I just sat there somewhat stunned at the ending--&quot;What??????&quot; I really felt I had just wasted my time. I certainy hope &quot;Mystic River&quot; makes more sense!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I love this soundtrack; think it's one of the best albums I've bought in ages... but what with the number of songs that were in the movie or affiliated with the movie, or whatever, that AREN'T on the disc... I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that maybe what QT and his posse are planning is to release TWO volumes of music for volume 1 of the movie (sort of similiar to what they did for the movie &quot;8 Mile,&quot; the first disc being songs inspired by the movie, the second being the songs actually IN the movie), and then two volumes of music for volume 2.<br />It's a shot in the dark, but a possible one. I for sure would pay for another volume similiar to this collection. It's top notch, like pretty much everything else in the Tarantinoverse. :)
B00009MGQL|3.0|&quot;JEFF&quot; is the third JB album in the last 5 years. Beck continues to push the guitar to the max. The guitar playing in this album is even more amazing and ferocious than most of his previous catalogue. Unfortunately, you must get past the overtaking drumbeats, sound effects, and numerous voice sampling to actually enjoy Jeff Beck himself. The fact that this album is a difficult listen causes it to end up as a &quot;what could have been&quot;. There is no other guitar player who matches JB, but this album, while still very interesting, cannot really stand as a single proof of that.<br />The tracks are creative, hard-hitting and powerful, but I'm always tempted to play other Jeff Beck albums such as &quot;Blow By Blow&quot;, &quot;Guitar Shop&quot;, and &quot;Who Else!&quot; right after this one. Why? Because on those albums, you can listen all the way through not having to struggle to hear Jeff play. While &quot;You Had It Coming&quot; drew a substantial line between rock guitar and electronica, &quot;JEFF&quot; completely immerses itself with electronica. The last thing I'd want to happen is for someone to take these tracks and play them for trendy TV commercials or dance clubs.<br />I give this album 3 stars. The guitar work is absolutely fabulous and the album's overall daring task is chilling. However, it will probably take some time to appreciate the album as a whole as well as ranking it among the best Jeff ever recorded. As usual though, it's all about personal preference. Check out this interesting album and discover it on your own terms.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Modern day hard rock doesn't get any better than this.  It really is one of the best albums to be released during the new millenium.  The album is loaded with good songs and I think a person would be hard pressed to find many better albums over 5 years.  Of course it isn't the best album over that period of time, but it ranks highly among the classics that have been released.  It's nice that the band is able to mix accessible hard rock The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret and still throw in raging hard rock like Tension Fade.  I highly recommend it for anyone with a liking for hard rock/alternative metal.
1881273156|1.0|Marriage is an institution that reflected the economy of an agrarian nation. Single family farms do not exist in suburbia. Trying to cram yourselves into an arrangement that was created to have many children to help with the endless physical work needed to survive is making the USA c r a z y and idiots like Ophra and Dr. Phil filthy rich selling how to make it work!
076790592X|5.0|The novel, Tuesdays with Morrie, is truly an inspiration that makes many people think about the things they take for granted. For example, smelling flowers, the warm breeze in your hair, or even the sound of small children playing outside. What may seem like an annoyance is really a gift that all of us (even me) take for granted. It's something I've learned by reading this great novel. Although Morrie said, in the novel, that he doesn't wish he was younger, enjoying youth, I bet he would love to be able to dance again, and even some of us take that for granted. I know I have tried to appreciate the small things now. With many lessons filled within the book, this novel will have you in tears and it will make you think. I recommend this book to any individual. I already have my family reading it.
B00005OC0G|5.0|I am perplexed by some of the previous reviews. The concerted dislike of ASM's performance was almost visceral. Admittedly, I am nowhere as technical as the authors of those critics, but I was so moved by her performance that just went out and bought a bunch of her RECENT recordings.<BR><BR>Yes, her interpretion of this great masterpiece departs early and far from orthodoxy. I understand some of the uneasiness people must have felt. But people should understand the difference between artistic improvision and Hollywood style showmanship. Beethvon was a helplessly romantic soul trapped in a classic frame (dare I say bohemian? Afterall, how many composer would have melodized bodily sounds into a symphony?). Had he been living today, God knows how he would have composed or played his works?<BR><BR>IMHO, what ASM did was liberating, she projected a heavenly piece of music to a landscape our mortals live in. For that, I am grateful.
B0000DF3PN|5.0|Congrats Celine! Again. She made it. Another big success for releasing this new French CD. Debut #1 in Canada, and France. [...]Anyway, she has tried to sing a little bit more rock 'n' rolls kinda style this time.   It's a good try for her, but I still like her ballad, and I highly recommend \\"apprends-moi\\" and \\"je t'aime encore \\".
B0000028PI|5.0|The blisteringly visceral rock music on four Alice Cooper albums - `Love it to Death' to `Billion $ Babies' - accompanied me though many a formative bungle.  Alice the snake draped, cataleptic, baby killing, desperado.  The razor stealing, dentist abused, attic dancing, victim of domestic pet attack.<br />But it's now late 2003 and, with the notable exception of `Welcome to my nightmare', and a few lesser hiccups, where has Alice been since?  Bulldozed into the ground, and replaced with soulless, inferior imitations, just like so many of my old haunts?<br />With my expectations of another spectacular album slipping, like the spinning wheels of an accident bound Cadillac, I was introduced to Alice's finest resurgent moment, 1994's `The Last Temptation'.<br />Sideshow gets off to a melodic, acoustic start, and then rips into an up tempo stadium stomper, reminiscent of `Department of Youth'.  The album's central character is bored and wants a kaleidoscopic distraction.  Buckle in and enjoy the ride, but save a little thrill for the way the track disassembles itself, and for the sideshow barker's taunt.<br />Nothing's free sees Alice being cajoled with the freedom imparting benefits of signing a nefarious contract.  Deeds without retribution could be yours, but you'll spend your retirement as the devil's butt monkey if you relent.  The vocals almost rap along, only in a non nausea inducing way, and include the album's first rhyme of `fire' with `higher'.<br />Lost in America is, like a smear of black eye make up, simple yet classic.  A catalogue of gripes from a disaffected youth drives us (in, presumably, his fantasy girlfriend's car) humorously forward to the intentionally discordant end.<br />Bad place alone is `Gutter cat' for grown ups, and finds Alice in fine voice, as two deceased, monikered, low lives recount their undignified demise.  The chorus tinkles along on a funky/punky electric piano, which strongly suggests that the Jets are sharpening their switchblades in a nearby alley.  The change of tempo in the chorus will catch you out and, if you're like me, when you first hear the track right through you'll have to play it again.<br />You're my temptation seems to be a less heavy outing of the `Deeper' riff from `Dragontown'.  It's a cracking track, which extols the attributes of an irresistible siren who will lead you to hell.  If her celebrated assets are not being exaggerated, this temptress will unquestionably earn the satanic version of performance related pay.  The devil beckons and, I believe, plays the guitar solo from the depths of Hades, reminiscent of Brian May's work on `Innuendo'.  Beatles fans will spot similarities with `Blue Jay Way' during part of the track, which terminates with some sinister intonations not discernable to those with aspirations of playing the celestial harp.<br />Stolen Prayer has the acoustic guitar front and centre again, for a change in tempo.  With the devil at the door, it's a litany of desperate hopes spent in silent prayer.  The chorus gets in your head and stays there, and there's a choral contribution from kids - always good for a spot of evil inference when done properly.<br />Unholy war starts with a forlorn guitar, rather like that in Who will save the world?/Groundhogs, but it's not long before Scary monsters/David Bowie take over.  Old Nick flexes his muscles threateningly, and lets us know that there's no escape.  Not the best track on the album, but it still drops on you like a spider in the dark compared to any other post 1976 Alice album.<br />Lullaby begins with.....well just what are those demonic voices saying!?  Don't play this one when you're alone.  Alice and Satan converse with intelligent humour, and the latter gets his marching orders with the belting chorus and the memorable lines commencing `I'll tell ya right now.....'  It's so good that we can even excuse the album's second use of the rhyme `fire' and `higher'.  This is high camp on the hellmouth - anothertrack with the classic Alice feel.<br />It's me is a mandolin driven ballad, which has hints of `Every day hurts' by Sad Café.  There's nothing offensive about this ode to commitment which, despite its solemn subject matter, is breezy rather than a blast from an open mausoleum door.<br />Cleansed by fire is a classy piece of work with which to finish the album.  In 1974 the Alice Cooper band came up with the rejected `Man with the Golden Gun', and Cleansed by fire shows that Alice can interpret the Bond style better than most non John Barry offerings.  This powerful song throbs along, has subtle harmonies, and even wanders in the direction of `I am the Walrus'.  Oh yes, and has Alice slamming the gates of hell in the devil's face.<br />Intended as a morality tale, this concept album was meticulously planned, rehearsed and (pardon the word) executed.  The cover features a nightmarishly bizarre collage, carrying through the sideshow theme with Japanese symbols which translate as `Nothing like it in the world', `Honored by being viewed by the Emperor three times', and `Stupendous illusions'.<br />With this album, Alice blows the funhouse wide open and takes us on a freak show guided tour to hell and back.  I've tallied long enough.  The sideshow's in town and another scary ride on the `carousel' beckons.  You won't find better value for money, so climb on board.
B00005RIKD|3.0|&quot;...All This Time&quot; may be the only Sting album some casual fans will need, especially those who are familiar with most of his hits from the radio and TV and like to hear something different. This live recording has also its undisputable historical importance, recorded on a quietly chilling evening on September 11, 2001, in Tuscany, Italy. In an acoustic, often jazzy setting, Sting offers some of signature songs from both his solo and Police career. However, the tragic events of the day had apparently influenced the song selection (the opener &quot;Fragile&quot;). One could imagine some more songs that would easily fit into the concept, such as &quot;Englishman in New York&quot;, or &quot;They Dance Alone&quot;, but these might sound too disturbing given the time the concert took place. But even the quiet mood is not too quiet at times, with tunes like &quot;Set Them Free&quot; and &quot;All This Time&quot;, not lending themselves well to the concept. Much better sounding are &quot;A Thousand Years/Perfect Love... Gone Wrong&quot; medley and &quot;Roxanne&quot;, jazzy coolness is just revelatory at &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me&quot; and bonus track &quot;Mad About You&quot; (not on US album) simply soars. &quot;... All This Time&quot; is not an album for all occassions, but stands as a testimony to how Sting can reinvent himself. And it is a quite decent overview of his songwriting and musical skills.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is a special note for people who have NOT YET seen either of the Godfather installments, or at least who haven't yet viewed Part III: I am utterly appalled by the widely irrational amount of negative comments on THE GODFATHER PART III. Yes, one has to admit that Part III is different in style and narrative approach than Parts I &amp; II, AND one also has to admit that it is also an EXCELLENT movie that does deserve all the praise that Parts I &amp; II attracted. I am currently writing my Master's in Philosophy and I have to say that I really enjoyed the \\"GREEK TRAGEDY\\" aspects of the Part III -you will see in the BONUS DISC F.F. Coppola explain why he chose to give this Part an additional level of moral questioning, another layer of PHILOSOPHICAL depth (that perhaps Parts I &amp; II lack a little -just a thought). DIRECTOR Coppola has worked extensively with AUTHOR Mario Puzo (by the way, do read the book, it adds another very distinctive flavor  to your experience of the movie -the end is quite different, enough said!) and that is perhaps why Parts II and III are so excellent too (Part I is more or less already in the book, but II and III had to be invented). Thus, Part III has extraordinarily moving quality that makes the whole series complete. THANK GOD I had never read the other Amazon reviews that say Part III is less good before watching all three movies - I would have then expected to be disappointed. Instead of that, I was warned that each Part was quite different from each other but that all were INDISPENSABLE to create the full range of nuances that make our UNIQUE experience of THE GODFATHER. As I work in a movie theatre, I am acutely aware that more than quality as such, it is beforehand `expectations' about the movie (\\"it's a nice and cute little movie\\", \\"it's the greatest masterpiece of all time\\"...) that create satisfaction or disappointment after the viewing. So, please, `expect to see' three very good and very different movies. Forget about comparing one with the others, just enjoy the cathartic* experience and let yourself be transformed. (I couldn't resist the fact of adding the meaning of `cathartic' because it depicts SO WELL what happens to the GODFATHER fan watching the series: \\"producing a feeling of being purified emotionally, spiritually, or psychologically as a result of an intense emotional experience...&quot; --Encarta World English Dictionary  1999 Microsoft Corporation.

B0000DJZAH|5.0|Don't know what the guy speaking of OASIS is talking about...but no one is holding a gun to your head to purchase WHO reissues...I would say the WHO's TOMMY is worth buying in the newest format because of the added material and the fact the already released material is refined even more than ever before. I would certainly have to say WHO'S NEXT was a great reissue because it gave you part of the famous or infamous life concerts that was abandoned early on.  I would accept the fact that someone who doesn't truly enjoy the WHO's music might not need a deluxe packaging...I for one like a little extra WHO material...and I certainly like the fact it's on SACD as well...my generation was also re-re-released on SACD and it's a little bit better than the regular release...again it's a matter of preference...if your a WHO wondering if the record company and/or the WHO is taking advantage of it's fans...the answers not exactly...I think someone has to be held accountable for releasing Live at Leeds 6 or 7 times but that's how it is...TOMMY is a great album...you don't need me to tell you what makes it great because we probably heard 50 or more times already...the WHO is a great band...exciting as all hell...Keith Moon and John Entwhistle live on!!!!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I dont get it.  Matrix 1 was a very good, exciting, clever, intelligent, visually stunning movie.  It was one of the first DVD's I bought, in fact.  Before I saw the sequel, I had been looking forward to further exploration of the universe of the Matrix for some time.  I am a huge sci-fi fan who has learned to distrust movie critics when they knock films in the genre, so, despite negative reviews, I went it to 'Matrix: Reloaded' with an open mind.  To say that it was a disapointment would be a wild understatement!!      Clearly, the sole focus of the movie was the big, over-the top Keanu-fu fight scenes that were so innovative and fresh in the original movie.  While the special effects were quite competent, the action was flat.  There was no real tension-- never even the vaugest thought that Neo couldnt whip 10 gazillion Mr Smiths, or whatever bad-guy he might have been up against at the moment.  They were just pure exercises-- an attempt to cram as much pointless CGI on the screen as possible.     Then there is the story-- there was a story, right?  Pointless, pseudo-philsophical claptrap that could not possibly have any interest to anyone besides a roomful of 13 year old, pimply-faced Dungeon & Dragon geeks (by age 14, same D&D geeks would be rolling their eyes at this piddle, too!!), some utterly pointless party/orgy scene that even lost its eye-candy appeal because it was so repetetive, and other assorted pointless twists and turns to plod through the space between fight scenes.  Yawn.      The only semi-redeeming moment of the film was the big car chase, but even that went on so long that it lost most of its tension.      Worst flick I've seen in many years.  Avoid this movie at all costs!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|27 pieces that changed music and many people's life for good.<BR>the music that sounds simple and naive but is really wonderfull and showes that Beatless were one of the most talented composing bands in universe<BR>Why not to love &quot;Help!&quot;,&quot;Eight days a week&quot; or &quot;yellow submarine&quot;? these are gorgeous songs!!!<BR>Thank you Paul,John,George and Ringo for making such a timeless music that everyone can still enjoy - it is the best band in the world - even if you don't like them they still are the best!
B000069HK2|5.0|The whole CD is great, but I'm only going to write about a few (my favorite) songs.<br />The Taste of Ink - overplayed on my local radio station, but when I FIRST listened to it, I liked it.<br />Poetic Tragedy - this song moves me every time I hear it. \\"Then on that last day he breaks, and he stood tall, and he yelled...and he takes his life.\\" That's so beautiful. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.<br />Buried Myself Alive - plain awesome. \\"I think the chain broke away and I felt it the day that I had my own time. I took advantage of myself and felt fine.\\" I melt to those lines.<br />Blue & Yellow - The chorus makes me weak, it's so beautiful. Great song, beautiful lyrics.<br />On My Own - Also has beautiful lyrics, reminds me of myself. 5 star song. <br />I think these guys seem to outdo themselves more with every song they sing, the lyrics are so touching, and the meaning behind them is just...fantastic. I love it.
076790592X|4.0|This book is a lovely story about a dying man and a young man who learns to live through his stories.  Morrie is a teacher from Mitch's college years and Mitch stops his own hectic lifestyle to say goodbye after hearing of Morrie's illness (ALS).  Drawn back in by Morrie's stories and his charm, and Mitch's own nagging sense that something in his own life is just not right, he keeps coming back, every week until Morrie's death several months later.  Within these months, Mitch takes in Morrie's warm wisdom and becomes a better, stronger man for it.  It was a touching story that left you wishing that someone had touched your life in the same way, but also feeling as if someone HAD done just that.
B00008NGHI|5.0|I'll second the 2 previous reviews before mine, and just add the following:  I have recently gotten into SACD, and there is no benchmark as to the subtle or heavy (or anything in-between) use of the surround speakers, so be aware that most SACDs sound different from their brethren, the mix being left to the individual engineer.  That said, I now have about 40 SACDs, and I must say the subtle use of surrounds for &quot;live&quot; ambience in this 2-disc set is simply beautiful.  The front speakers carry a clean, in-your-face, startlingly real vocal and instrumental palette (the harmonies most noticeably dripping like aural honey)<BR>that will take you aback!!  The surrounds then complete the &quot;realism&quot; by putting you about row 5 center in the mix.  Other SACDs (ie, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, Peter Gabriel's Up) make much more use of the surrounds, with different sounds coming from 4-5 distinctly different speakers, and this works marvelously in those cases.  The more subtle use of surrounds for the Alison Krauss disc shows the engineer's savvy, and works most beautifully for this disc.  You will be amazed!!
B00008PW2D|2.0|Okay, first of all let me preface this review by saying that SATC is my all-time favorite show.  I am in love with each girl on the show and find a piece of myself in all four.  I think the beauty of this show is the depiction of strong, vibrant women who are trying to make it in the world by supporting eachother and using honesty in their lives.  They encounter the same pitfalls and joys that many of us have experienced and I am indebted to the creators and cast for taking the time to make such a realistic show that unabashedly addresses many taboo subjects.  That being said, let me just say how disappointed I am that the price of Season 5 is as high as any other season.  I understand the writers changed the entire season once they discovered that SJP was pregnant and I don't fault them for it.  What I do fault HBO for is the ridiculous notion that we loyal fans won't notice the short, obviously slap-dashed-together Season 5 and spend the same amount of money to view it over and over.  This was not a good season for fans of Carrie or Samantha...their characters looked a bit desperate at times.  Miranda and Charlotte do not disappoint and P.S. Will some one PLEASE at least nominate Kristin Davis for an Emmy?  All in all, not the best season and a silly price because after all, the loyal fans will notice there is not the same value here and do you really want to alienate the loyal fans?
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|if you liked \\"Mer de noms\\" for it's melodic and catchy dark metal songs you can be suprised with A perfect Cricle's new material.<BR>It starts with \\"The Package\\" which remains different than anything from the first listening.Heavy bass groove (Jeordie white Aka Twiggy ramirez plays great here),very strange drums and trance guitars.it sounds really hypnotic although it becames more straight-forward metal in hte end.\\"Weak and powerless\\" or \\"Pet\\" are more standard tracks (if you can call the band Standard) with huge massive guitar wall and Maynard's incredible voice.<BR>as i mentioned before songs like \\"Lullaby\\" or \\"The Package\\" are very different from group's previous songs but they are really stunning when compared to whole Nu-metal stuff - the melodies are difficult sometimes - it doesn't mean \\"The thirteen step\\" is bad but it is just not like everyone were thinking.<BR>Everyone will miss Paz Lenchantin,Sexy lady playing awesome groves on her bass guitar who left Perfect Circle for Corgan's Zwan and later for Papa M (small avantgarde rock group).her playing was great and her appearance too - Jeordie is not so sexy i think....<BR>In the end - if you search for something original and not quite \\"normal\\" get this album.If you prefered more melodic Metal (Linkin park,Limp Bizkit or even Metallica) you can pass it because it can be too dark for you...anyway - not as great as Maynard's tool \\"lateralus\\" but it is another step in Perfect circles Evolution
B000002VMH|5.0|The greatest thing about &quot;Diva&quot; is the voice. The CD is front loaded with it's 2 biggest hits, the stunning, ambient &quot;Why&quot; and the baroque-influenced &quot;Walking On Broken Glass&quot;, both flawless pop songs in thier own right, but the handful of bass heavy, techno drenched tracks that follow tell the real story. While hearing rich singers complain about how empty they feel inside despite the trappings of success (&quot;Money Can't Buy It&quot;)is still a tired topic, Lennox's delivery here makes the sentiment go down a little smoother. My personal fave on this collection is the piano based ballad &quot;Cold&quot; an austere, haunting performance that bears repeated listening and at 4:12, doesn't overstay it's welcome. For more than 20 years now, Annie Lennox has mastered the art of pushing music forward through sound and image (with longtime partner Dave Stewart) but manages to humanize even the coldest, sterile musical settings by adding one key ingredient: Soul.
0739307312|2.0|Two smart women recommended this book to me because, they said, it is about reclaiming the sacred feminine. Even though the dust jacket blurbs do not mention this project, I began the text with excitement and hope. Indeed I found that the sacred femnine echoes - moans, sings, even screams - throughout the text. But once I was a third of the way into the story, I realized once again why feminists often yield to the temptation to assume that no text by a man can be trusted.<br />  Of 23 characters in the text who appear several times, 19 are men and 4 are women, which is the usual 5:1 ratio I find when I do textual gender analyses. So much for modern progress against sexism. Furthermore, of 9 principal characters who appear throughout the novel and carry the plot line, 1 is female (Sophie Neveu) and 8 are male: Sauniere, Silas, Langdon, Collet, Fache, Aringarosa, Teabing and Vernet.<br />  Worse is the role given to the female in the text. Sophie provides women's intuition and vulnerability, despite her career path, while the men solve all the code puzzles, take all the risks and protect or threaten her. All of the other females are present only to serve the male charaters and most of them are unnamed. The epitome of this is the woman whose \\"body was plump, far from perfect\\" (according to whose gaze??) who facilitated the attainment of the man's moment of orgasmic access to spiritual union. A woman's spiritual union is never mentioned - not once!<br />  I enjoyed reading the book. I grant the pleasure of its rich tapestry of \\"facts\\" and its thick web of thriller features. But, as do other reviewers here, I worry that the hype for the book and the slickness of the story mask for far too many readers the actual non-historical and sacred feminine-bashing project of the text.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I've never heard this album. Could someone tell me who Madonna is? I've never heard of her before
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Following up \\"Is This It\\" could be one of the hardest tests in the music industry of late. However, the Strokes seem to be unmoved by the pressure that has been put on them to deliver. \\"Room on Fire\\" is exactly what one could ask for for a follow up to an album that is as good as they come. This record picks up where the last one left off. The songs are still short and sweet and have the same energy as the last album. They added some hand claps and Cars sounding guitar which work really great with their style. If you liked \\"Is This It\\" you'll without a doubt enjoy this. However, do listen with the understanding that this is a different album and your expectations might be too high. With that said you will not be disappointed!
0671688782|5.0|How thrilled I was to find [her] website. I read Dr Welch's book \\"Holding Time\\" before my first child was born, and thought it was wonderful. I practised her therapies with my girls but did not carry on with them. I remember looking for Dr Welch on the Internet about 5 or 6 years ago, but did not find her. It seemed as if she had disappeared off the face of the earth with her wonderful ideas. So, how exciting to see that Holding Time is still \\"alive and well\\" and that Dr Welch continues to hold seminars and conferences. If ever there is one in London, I shall be there! God bless her and all who work with her!<BR>Mrs Anderson
B00004SCX6|2.0|britney is not treading any new ground.  it facinates me that someone like britney always stays on top.  can someone explain what makes her different than cristina or pink or any of the drones she has paved the way for ? what makes her so special?  <BR>    this cd has some really good songs.  songs like LUCKY and STRONGER have some irrestible melodies and some decent grooves although the king (or should i say queen) of grooves lies in OOPS but the ear candy dies here.  Personally, i prefer artists that write their own material and britney rarely writes any of her stuff.  read the credits and you will be shocked to see DIDO in there (i forget if it is on this album or on another) as well as Shania Twain and Mutt Lange who wrote DONT LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW.  despite help from Shania, i think that song is your generic, typical ballad and falls flat.  <BR>     Britey is simply a more updated version of Tiffany.  maybe a little sexier, little racier but in the end she is just another pop diva who sings ear friendly bublegum style music on top of a (usually repititive) disco/dance beat with the occasional slow song or \\"ballad\\" thrown in for good measure.  it is a tried and true formula and seems to be working for Britney but at the same time i find her stuff so generic and regurgitated.  there are moments where my feet cannot help but to be tapping but in the end i think the difference between Britney and say for example PINK is that Britney is straight pop whereas PINK fuses elements of Punk, dance and rock to give her musical soup some flavor.  Hell. i hate dance/disco and even i like Pink's 2nd album.  the riff to NUMB is incendary and incredible and the delivery is intense.  you will not catch me using words like that about Britney.  You can dance to Britney but there seems to be no feeling.  <BR>    I do hate comparing PINK (or anyone for that matter) to Britney but i am trying to show why Britney is generic while others catch my ear.  They call Britney the next\\"madonna\\"  you need to do alot more than crank out the same old same old to even approach madonna and top of the list is putting some emotion into that lifeless studio created music.
B0000C7PSW|2.0|Someone made a mistake down at the CD plant and stuck a copy of the original cast album from The Boy From Oz in the jewel box for the new Rufus Wainwright cd.  Wait, no, Hugh Jackman can sing better than this.  This laughable, self-absorbed, ersatz Broadway piffle *is* the new Rufus Wainwright cd. Quel horrors!
0790729652|3.0|Tim Burton's Batman is phenomonal, unfortunately the DVD transfer by WB is terrible.  The picture looks crappy, and of course, there are no special features.  Buy it cheap if you can, just to add to your collection.
0385504209|5.0|This is not intended as a literary review.  instead, this is intended as a thank you to the authour for the production of a piece of fiction that has made me anxious to learn and discuss.  I normally read non-fiction.  The Latin teacher on my hall said &quot;You have to read this!&quot;  I did.  I passed it on to an English teacher who in turn passed it on to another English teacher.  My entire high school wing has read, enjoyed as well as delighted in the discussions arising from this book.  This book incited us to research and discuss meaningful topics.  We have been re-inspired by this piece of fiction to seek out the truth and revel in discussion.  Thank you Dan Brown for a reintroduction to the world of wonder.
0446677450|3.0|Being a student and for a class assignment had to read a book dealing with economics. My teacher recommended this book and I found it rather interesting. This has truly helped me prepare me on what to expect of the real world. Even though, Kiyosaki is not the greatest writer repeating facts through out his book it helps you understand what he is trying to say. It would have been wonderful to use facts from today's wealthy men and women instead of the rich and dead.<BR> I do recommend this book to anyone stuck in the rat race and to prepare themselves for every unexpected turn they will find.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this release. I am glad to say that is way off the mark. From the first strains of &quot;Coma Girl&quot; to last stirrings of &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; this is a blueprint for<br />what made Joe so special. From the great cover songs, heartfelt messages and the flat-out rockers. I hope Joe is up in heaven looking down proud of what legacy he has left for the world. Lastly, I am happy to see the Clash and Joe Strummer being honored for what they have contributed to music and life.
B00006AFUR|5.0|My friend and I were listening to an alternative-rock station on satellite radio when the song \\"Capricorn\\" came on.  We could both tell this one was solid, so we found out that it was from 30 Seconds to Mars, and I went and bought the album.  What an amazing find this was!  Like many of the other reviewers here, I have routinely had it in my CD player listening to the whole thing through, and I have lots of good CD's, so that's really saying something.  Every song on this disc is well above-average.  I would probably say the weakest songs on it are \\"End of the Beginning\\" and \\"Year Zero,\\" and I'd still give them an 8 out of 10.  Very impressive, considering that with most CD's I buy I expect at least 1 song to kinda suck.  Not so here.<br />Their style could best be described as \\"space rock\\" (if there is such a thing), with some futuristic techno-sounds infused well with powerful alt-metal rock that results in well-crafted hard songs that are surprisingly melodical.  Their style is unique enough that I can't think of any one band that they sound similar to...<br />\\"Capricorn\\" and \\"Fallen\\" have to be two of the best songs on this album--certainly they have been catchy enough to have parts that just stick in my head all day.  \\"Edge of the Earth\\" and \\"The Mission\\" also come highly recommended, but I can't think of too many songs I've ever heard that are better than \\"Echelon,\\" which just blew me away from the first time I heard this disc.  I can't explain it--you just have to hear it for yourself.<br />I certainly hope this band catches on well enough to keep at it and put out some more music.  If you haven't heard it, check it out!  Buy it!  Tell your friends!  You won't regret it!
B0000DJZAH|5.0|Um... this album was released in 1969... the fellas in Oasis weren't even BORN.  Do a little research next time, genius.<br />I can't wait to get my hands on this CD.  An entire disk of unreleased material including outtakes!  I'm foaming at the mouth!!
B000000WJ2|5.0|They're both great discs but in my humble opinion I lean towards putting this one in before Talk is Cheap.  <br />It's tough in a forum like this because I hate to read how someone raves about a disc and then I go out and get it and I hate it.<br />Maybe I like it because it is a little rawer but also Keith has some great fills and there is tasty playing throughout.<br />Do what I did, get them both from your local library system and you decide, there's worse ways to spend an evening.
B0000C9V3T|3.0|This CD is great.  It includes many of the Songs from the film, however there are just as many songs on the CD as there are ones missing from the film.  <br />Similar to the Pulp Fiction Soundtrack, this one includes tracks of pure dialogue that is fun to listen to.  There are also hidden tracks included on this CD to look out for!<br />The song everyone has been ranting and raving about that is played at the beginning to the final fight scene is not included on the CD.  This song is by Ennio Morricone - Death Rides a Horse.  Hope that helps anyone who has been looking for it.  There is also a previous listing of more tracks from another reviewer.
B00000G3AZ|2.0|I was disappointed in this version of Emma. As much as I enjoy watching Gwyneth Paltrow, she did not achieve the essential chemistry with her co-star (Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley).  In BBC's version, the young Kate Beckinsale shines and her co-star Mark Strong is any woman's heart throb.  I highly recommend BBC's Emma, but only weakly recommend this version.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Siemese dream is undoubtubly the most underated album ever. It is, to put it simply, the greatest rock album ever by far and i would very seriously bet $1,000,000 that it is the greatest thing you have ever heard or will hear.It brought tears my eyes and my soul if there is such a thing the first time i heard it and when you listen to it you honest beleive that Billy Corgan is pouring out his soul to you and you come away feeling completely joyful and that nothing can ever hurt you. Please i beg you to buy it and if you have a heart beat you will know what i'm talking about.

B000002J29|5.0|It was Feb 27 1977. A friend had 4 tickets for the WIND AND WUTHERING (SECONDS OUT) tour. I never heard of this band at that time, and was about to receive the musical education of my lifetime. This was the final tour for Steve Hackett (no one knew this at that time). As the band entered the stage, an unbelievable roar irrupted from the audience, that told me this was no ordinary gig. And two drum sets for one band. What's up with that. I quickly found out why. And have seen every tour since, until they departed in 1992. No band ever opened for these guys. Never! It was a Genesis only, show. This was perfection in every musical way. Band of all bands. Other musicians have never come close to the instrumental masterpieces that this band produced. SECONDS OUT relives the greatest era in musical history. Farewell Tony, Steve, Mike, Phil, Chester, (and Pete).
0792841344|1.0|I can't believe people actually like this movie.  It was as about as dumb as they come.  That's all I can say about it.  I read everyone's reviews, was expecting to watch a great movie and it was so stupid I had to log on again and make sure I was watching the same movie everyone else on this page was.  Like I said...As bad as they come!
B000089CJI|5.0|When I haerd \\"Dream of Evan and Chan\\" on DNTEL's \\"Life is Full of Possibilities\\", I was amazed at how the blend of gentle but carefully constructed electronic music and lighthearte, breezy vocals would fit together so well. The track practically became my favorite track on the album. Now, this. With DNTEL's frontman Jimmy Tamborello's soothing beats/melody and Gibbard's (Death Cab For Cutie) emo vocals and lyrics, this album is a perfect mixture of electronica/synthpop with the emotional aspect of emo. Probably the album of the year for me (yes it beats Peaches Fatherf**ker). Plus, the frontwoman from Rilo Kiley (another GREAT band) shares her vocals on a few of the songs too! Like what else could you ask for!!!!???
B00005JM0B|4.0|With a very huge budget( rumored to be over 180$ million ) ,director Jonathan Mostow had plenty of work to do ,but the most important thing to do is getting safe from this dark web where every fan of the series are waiting for his finished product and see if they will continue being a fans or not , actually he succeeded with some important notes which we should be aware of .<br />The deadly female terminator X (Kristanna Loken) is coming to our current time with deadly agenda ,which is killing all the potential leaders of the futuristic resistance group against the governing machines , in a quick pacing scenes we see her assassinating all of them ,and only John Connor (Nick Stahl) the group's leader remains , her plans for completing the massacre are delayed by the arrival of the hero of the glory old days Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) ,both of them enters a deadly fight with different purposes .<br />The plot of this movie was hesitating between two desires ,the desire to introduce a movie which satisfies the Summer's audience and bring them the enjoyment of watching their beloved terminator again ,and the desire to approach the Terminator series with new style ,look and layout , but actually it didn't always succeed ,for the action scenes (which 90% of them were impressive) it gained benefit from the huge budget ,allows for more cars to be destructed and the more important allowed for more space for the action scenes ,but it didn't succeed in creating a purely new action scenes which we can remember and attach with our memory about this movie ,because some scenes were produced as an extended version of some of the action scenes of the previous movie (check the cemetery scene and you will notice a resemblance with the scene from the second movie where Arnold was shooting the police Vehicles ) ,also for the first half of this movie I myself felt somehow troubled and unable to get engaged with the characters or worry about them and that wasn't helped by the long road carnage scene ,but things got improved in the second half till reaching the brilliant climax .<br />Other good elements includes a good performance from Stahl ,Danes  and above all of them is the desired icy performance from Schwarzenegger which is not less good than his performance in the first two parts in the series ,the special effects didn't give the feel of overusing and was implemented wisely during the movie ,but I couldn't help thinking about James Cameron and what he would have made with this huge budget ? I'll leave the answer for your imagination ,but that doesn't mean that Mostow's directing was bad ,it's just the director's decision about how he would use the resource that were put between his hands .<br />This movie would have been put in the average directory but there are one thing which lifted it from this position ,what I am talking about is the climax of the movie ,I think that it has one of the most brilliant climaxes I have ever seen ,I won't reveal it here ofcourse but i really liked the brilliancy of this climax ,it wasn't created with the regular stereotypes of twists ,it relies actually on the audience's beliefes which they have acquired from the first two movies ,and then taking them as a standpoint to launch into absolutely new direction which personally left me paralyzed for a while trying to fully understand it ,not only this but it had a very poetic atmosphere which enhanced the overall audience's sympathy with the main characters ,and above all giving all of us a new and fresh memory of this legendary series .road carnage scene ,but things got improved in the second half till reaching the brilliant climax .<br />Other good elements includes a good performance from Stahl ,Danes  and above all of them is the desired icy performance from Schwarzenegger which is not less good than his performance in the first two parts in the series ,the special effects didn't give the feel of overusing and was implemented wisely during the movie ,but I couldn't help thinking about James Cameron and what he would have made with this huge budget ?

B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a great cd, a must buy!
B000002UV9|5.0|To this day, a staggering number of people insist that to entertain is to sell out and surrender growth and innovation. Granted, the frequncy of the stars aligning just right is about as often as a snowball forming in that dark place down below, but it HAS happened, it STILL happens, but never more noticably than in the all-around musical masterpiece &quot;Empire,&quot; from the &quot;progressive&quot; &quot;metal&quot; band, Queensryche.<br />Those quotations are there because Queensryche deserves more than routine catagorization. Their music is at times heavy, and often intelligent, and that's about all the description you should need. If you realize that the past 10 years of mainstream music has been a case of record companies shooting themselves in the foot, this review shall serve to educate you that this album was one of the last appearances of greatness to strike mainstream popularity - it's a good thing Queensryche got this album in before it all went down hill!<br />The album; dashes of Pink Floyd/Rush/Bon Jovi/Def Leppard/Wagner!<BR>One of my favorite songs ever is the closing track &quot;Anybody Listening?&quot; Epic emotion, powerful vocals, sustained guitar landscapes `a la David Gilmour, operatic theatrics `a la Les Miserables. The song is an adventure, a journey, with changing keys, moods and sections. Everything that a best-song-ever should be is in this unique composition.<br />Then there's the song that &quot;broke them&quot;, despite a very successful prior album (&quot;Operation: MindCrime&quot;). If you only know Queensryche for one song, it's &quot;Silent Lucidity.&quot; Granted, it's a bit simpler than much of their work, but just as with &quot;Anybody Listening?&quot;, it is a wonderful journey of the mind, &quot;trying to explain to someone the unexplainable,&quot; in the words of vocalist Geoff Tate. It is a highly emotional ballad that fits in just fine with the rest of the band's repertoire.<br />Most of the album is very strong with no filler, but the other big highlights are the songs &quot;Empire,&quot; and &quot;Another Rainy Night.&quot; These songs deserve some of the highest praise ever, because they adhere to this intelligent-meets-popularity formula better than almost any other song. They deserve even MORE praise, because they are not ballads. They are hard rocking songs, and the former (the title track) was actually quite the popular 'hit.' Can you believe, thinking of a 'hit' as actual good music? It IS possible. These songs are in the normal verse-chorus format, with amazing solos and guitar harmonies, intelligent lyrics, creative chords, and pure heart and soul. They rock like nobody's business, but also allow many people to relate to the music, who normally would be satisfied with bands that only make 10% the amount of effort. It just doesn't get much better than this.<br />The hardcore fans want their &quot;...MindCrime&quot;, but I am going to cave in here - &quot;Empire&quot; is my [just barely]favorite Queensryche album, and the fact that it was very popular doesn't change the fact that it deserved what it got and more. MindCrime is also great - but for once in music history, selling less records doesn't mean it must be better music! &quot;Empire&quot; is the epitome of &quot;exception to the rule.&quot; Commercial music hasn't allowed for this much creativity since.
0553278398|5.0|I want to give a Four star (for lack of character development) but the ideas Asimov works with and the way the story shifts and turns force me to give the exalted &quot;five&quot;.  The one thing I particularly liked about this book was that it was necessary to read the Foundation Trilogy to enjoy it.  So many times, writers make the assumption that you have read all the other books of a series and present the reader with strange and unexplained ideas and people.  <br />One advantage Asimov had in writing this story was time.  He had over 30 years to think about the original series and how it fit in with the other works.  He also could update the science which made it much more believable.  We are on Trantor and this is the story of Seldon, his fights, his studies, his love life (very high-level as in all Asimov novels) and his triumphs.  <br />Robots play a part in this prequel that they do not in the series itself for the obvious reason that Asimov had not yet come up with the idea of tying them together.  After 30+ years he has most of the pieces in place and can manipulate them at will.  The revelation of his &quot;wife&quot; was only too good.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Many people look for a band to recreate the same style of their previous albums.  However, any real music fan would not want this to occur.  Who wants to hear the same music produced over and over with different words? I for one do not.  All good musicians are constantly changing to deliver a unique musical experience with each work they release.  Like the good musicians they are, The Strokes have changed their style slightly for Room on Fire.  Fans of 'Is This it?\\" will find Room on Fire weird at first.  It is much faster, and shorter than 'Is This it?\\".  However, it goes very well.  Think of it as a fast car ride.  Although it goes by quickly, it is extremely fun and exciting.

076790592X|5.0|Morrie is the kind of teacher that many students would want. He was Mitch's favorite teacher. When he contracted the Lou Gehrig's disease he received much attention from everyone in the world, that's how special he was. Everyone cared about Morrie because he cared about everyone else. He was not afraid to die because he was satisfied with his life. He did everything he wanted to do and the most important thing he wanted to have before he died was to have all of his loved ones nearby. He and Mitch do a project together, which tells about Morrie's story. Their &quot;final thesis.&quot; In this book, he teaches the meaning of life. &quot;Once you learn how to die, then you learn how to live.&quot; Knowing that you are going to die any day makes you appreciate life more and realize things you never knew was there or existed. Morrie remained optimistic and cheerful even though he was suffering. It makes it hard for Mitch to learn how to say goodbye. <BR>He is an inspiration because he shows the world that there are more important things than the materialistic things everyone considers important. Love is one of the most important element in everyone's life. When you love people and they love you in return, you die but your memory lives on forever in the hearts of the ones you touched, just like Morrie. &quot;Dying ends a life, not a relationship.&quot; He makes me realize what I want out of life and what I did wrong. He makes me want to become a better person and love everyone and learn how to forgive people so I can be at peace when I die. Staying strong and optimistic is a hard thing to do when you know you are going to die, which is why I admire Morrie because dying did not stop him for living his life to the fullest. He was able to help people and give people advice on life. <BR>This book was very heart warming and it made me tear. It really got to my emotions. If only there were more people like Morrie, this world would be a better place.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|To me &quot;Exit... Stage left&quot; was longtime winner of live performances. It is great joy, to find band making it once again so many years after. Sensitive ear can complain about sound misqualities, but wasn't that, what differed from studio recordings for ages? And wasn't the atmosphere of the live event always to cover these troubles plentifully? So does it once again. And since this record is doubled by DVD with Dolby 5.1 for sound lovers, there is no reason to complain. For audio-record collectors, this show is just another great achievement. Thanks, the band! Frankly, we did not expect that much was possible!
B00005JCA9|5.0|In my opinion, I believe Julia Roberts is a natural and she is a great actor, even though some people disagree. I read the web site and a girl had a different oppinion about Julia Roberts. She believes Julia Roberts is not a good actor. To me Julia Roberts is a natural. She is different from other actors. She dosen't need make up, or other things on her to look nice. I've seen all Julia's movie's and she acts good in all of them. The best films were Pretty Woman, Notting Hill, and My Bes Friend's Wedding. I would like to add that I admire Julia Roberts because she plays many different rolls...

B00009TB5G|5.0|I am so tired of hearing people .... on this film, because TOM BOMBADIL isnt in it. Like the one writer said in an interview, if you like, the Hobbits COULD HAVE encountered him, and the movie doesnt mention it. After all, film is a different media than books. It's closer to PAINTING. It's closer to THEATER. It's closer to SYMPHONIC MUSIC. And, if you look at all the adaptations of FAUST over the years, into operas, paintings, and so on, they are NOT direct adaptations of Goethe's masterpeice. Nor should they be. No one should go into this film expecting the book to be transfered word for word. As for Arwen's role, well, there are almost NO female characters in the book. Arwen's tale is in the apendix, so I accept it. BUT, the extra footage in the TWO TOWERS might help. (It certainly did in FOTR.) You will get to see Smeagol's tale told. You will see more of Sam and Frodo wandering around the mountains, more of the Steward of Gondor's family relationships. The ent draught scene is reinserted, where Merry and Pippin grow 3\\". The Ent battle scene at Isengard is longer. 40 minutes is a lot of time to add more Tolkien vision, so I expect the expanded edition to blow the original film away.<br />Honestly, compaired to the HORRIBLE cartoon adaptations from the 1970s, people should be worshipping these films. I am utterly amazed that they were able to bring THIS MUCH of the book into a film. The technical challanges, of having the Ents go entering the battle of Helm's deep, would have been nearly impossible. In fact, having Elfs show up, makes a bit more sense. I didnt understand why Aragon had to fall off the cliff. But, i suppose it was to set up part of how Eowyn feels about Aragon, and her unrequited love, as well as Aragon's supernatural powers. These things have to transfer visually, since in film, you cant have long narative dialogue explain it all. However, I suppose it will be the third film's removal of the distruction of the Shire by Saruman, that might upset people the most. It must have been nessacary for shortening the film's already 11+ hour lenght, if you add together all the extended versions. If you will never accept that film and book, are two different artforms, then just stay at home, and ignore the film. Why cast your vitriol all over the film, for those that will NEVER read the books? At least they got a taste of Tolkien's genius. A morsel of food is better than no food at all, especially if the food is LEMBAS. And you are starving for ANYTHING.ople the most.

038533348X|5.0|For those who haven't read Vonnegut, you must read this book!  This short, simply written novel manages to reveal the latent absurdities in our most cherished institutions: politics, religion, and science.<br />The novel centers around ice-nine, developed by the idiot savant Dr. Hoenikker (sp?).  Hoenikker invents it as something of a game, but its first use will cause the oceans to freeze and the devastation of the world.  We see clear parallels to the nuclear bomb and the rationalizations of its creators: according to them, they are advancing &quot;pure knowledge,&quot; and the consequences are not their concern, even if it results in worldwide devastation.<br />The novel also targets religion in the form of Bokononism, a religion whose own creator admits that it is &quot;foma&quot; (lies).  Even so, the Books of Bokonon cited throughout the book are absurdly sweet and insightful.  The Bokononist practice of &quot;boko-maru,&quot; or merging of soles, also seems to be one of the rare ways to achieve genuine pleasure with one's fellow man.  We see how religion, even where it may be technically false, may give great peace to its believers.  When I first read this book in high school, I was tempted to become a devout Bokononist myself!<br />Vonnegut always emphasizes the importance of family and genuine interhuman relationships, rather than the abstract absurdities of &quot;granfaloons&quot;: nations, parties, sports teams, etc.  This short, spare novel tears apart such granfaloons, and through it, we may see a glimmer of what is genuinely important in our lives.
076790592X|5.0|I read this book for my sociology class. Seemed a little sappy in premise, but it is a book with a 'big heart' and an important message for those who might question some of the central issues in life such as love, aging, materialism and death.<br />The main character, Morrie Schwartz, is a well-loved professor of sociology at Bradeis University. He is renowned for his gentle and caring spirit, and he has touched many individual lives in a way most university professors don't. At the age of 75 he falls ill with ALS, an incurable disease which he knows will end his life slowly and painfully. Despite this condition, he maintains his positive attitude and busy schedule with classes and students and family and friends. As he starts to decline, a friend collects his aphorisms, little snippets of advice and wisdom, into a newspaper column. This column leads to an interview with Ted Koppel on NBC; this national exposure brings his former student, Mitch Albom to to his bedside. <br />Mitch, a graduate of Brandeis and a student of Morrie's, has achieved great success at an early age. He writes a sports column in Detroit, and mingles with talented and wealthy athletes and team owners. He has an incredibly busy schedule flying to sporting events all over the country and he has acquired many of the vestiges of success. But when his unionized co-workers at the Detroit newspaper go on strike, he can't work and has the perfect opportunity to visit with Morrie and talk about life. He begins showing up every Tuesday at Morrie's home, to sit by his bedside and ask Morrie his opinion on topics such as love, marriage, forgiveness, and death. <br />These conversations take place as Morrie declines week by week, his disease slowly creeping up his body. Morrie slowly surrenders to its grasp, becoming utterly dependent on his caregivers to feed, clothe, wash and thump him on the back so he can breathe. Mitch records this process of disintegration with pain and guilt, and is amazed that Morrie still maintains his appointments with friends and even strangers who were touched by his wisdom. Mitch carefully looks at his own life, and you can see him grow as they spend these last days together. At the end of Morrie's life Mitch is feeding him, holding his hand, and rubbing his feet, things which would have been unthinkable to him to do two months before. He is profoundly affected by this relationship.<br />I took a lot away from this book about the mentor-mentee relationship. It started out in the formal educational system, in which Morrie was doing his job teaching Mitch in sociology classes. But it grew into a friendship both at Brandeis and after, as Morrie took the time to talk to Mitch, to have lunch, to give advice and to support. Their relationship grew as they embarked on this book, which Morrie called \\"their project,\\" knowing it would find an audience and bring comfort to others. Mitch as the mentee actively sought out Morrie and steered the conversations to topics which troubled him or interested him. This contradicts what many people might think of these relationships - Morrie certainly had advice and enjoyed giving it, but he also asked questions and listened humbly throughout their many days together. Both gained, as Mitch absorbed Morries' wisdom and applied it to his own experience, and Morrie was loved and comforted in his final days. <br />The truism I got out of this book was about the incredible importance of giving yourself to others. There are times when you would rather be alone, or you think that you don't have the energy to listen to others. But it is the kind of gift that is so easy to give and brings joy to yourself and others. Morrie gave generously of his time and elevated personal relationships to the highest level in his life. He danced every weekend, ate lunch with students and friends, took walks, always expressing his feelings freely to men, women, students and his children and wife. It was a lifetime of this giving that came back to him when he was dying. He even scheduled his own memorial service before he died, so that he could join in the remembrances. <br />This was a wonderful book to read. At times the style is like a newspaper column, with short choppy sentences and paragraphs, but it is clear that this book has an incredible amount of heart. I of course want to know how Mitch lives his life differently because of those Tuesdays with Morrie, but I guess I won't really know without talking to him.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I don't know what the viewer from San Antonio was smoking, but I've checked several other websites and the back of my DVD to get the correct running time for this and they all say 360 minutes, or six hours which is the complete miniseries!
B000002LRX|5.0|Let's go back to the time that this album was recorded.  You are a band that has been around, even to the point of being on your 2nd lead singer in Mike Patton.  Your last album was a surprise breakthrough mainstream hit thanks to the surreal song, \\"Epic\\", which broke into the Pop Top 10 and the video was constantly on MTV.  Your band seems destined to break out and become a major commercial star.  So what do you do?  You release an album in \\"Angel Dust\\" that was so commercial unfriendly that you kill any chances of being pop successes.  And what is wrong with that you ask?  Nothing - it is just a gutsy move to say the least by this band that has influenced all kinds of \\"nu-metal\\" bands these days (none are as good as FNM).<br />Anyone familiar with Patton's other band, Mr. Bungle, will feel that \\"Angel Dust\\" is an album that would seem more appropriate for Mr. Bungle than Faith No More, but it showed the variety of styles that this band could play.  Sadly, this would be the last album for eccentric guitarist, Jim Martin, with the band, but he is in fine form along with Mike Bordin, Patton, and the others.  All of the tracks are great, but my favorites include \\"Mid-Life Crisis\\" which might be the only real close commercial track on the album, \\"Crack Hitler\\", \\"Be Aggressive\\", which has cheerleaders and is an ode to oral sex, and \\"RV\\" which is a hilarious song, partly because Patton sings it in a white trash type of voice.  His range on this album is incredible.  The album ends with a version (instrumental) of \\"Midnight Cowboy\\", and considering that you hear all kinds of stuff on this album like organs, choirs, cheerleaders, etc, it seems appropriate.<br />You will probably not like this album on the first listen, unless you are a weirdo or a Mr. Bungle fan, but give it a chance as it will continue to grow on you the more times you listen.  One of the most underrated albums of all-time, in addition to being one of the most daring.  Faith No More, essentially, was never the same band after this album.  And little wonder - as not only did the album destroy any commercial hopes they had (which was probably zero) but more than that, it was such a brilliant album, that it was impossible to top it.
B000096I9G|4.0|The disclaimer on the box reads something like, \\"This is a concert DVD.  It is meant to be listened to with the volume up.\\"  A great piece of advice, because that is the only way one can truly appreciate the depth of the Cure's musical genius.<br />Staged in Germany over three nights, it is the entirety of their classic albums \\"Pornography,\\" \\"Disintegration,\\" and \\"Blood Flowers\\" played live in a fluid, linear fashion.  A unique experience in that you have only a few singles and a plethora of deeper album cuts, all of which sound magnificient here.<br />Smith's angst-ridden lyrics are haunting and poignant, offering the viewer/listener a new depth to these old Cure standbys.  The unrestrained instruments and vocals flow well with the cinematography, and while the Cure has never been considered--to some--a live band, this DVD shatters all conceptions and assumptions, proving that while Robert Smith has aged, his music still withstands the test of time; \\"Plainsong,\\" \\"The Hanging Garden,\\" \\"Lovesong,\\" \\"Fascination Street,\\" \\"Disintegration,\\" and \\"Bloodflowers\\" are classics old and new, played here in a fresh manner that leads one to change their minds about which versions of the albums are preferrable, studio or live.<br />Visually, it is stunning; with pans to the crowd, the band, and close-ups of Smith and company as well as focuses on the crowd, one has the impression that they are at the concert themselves.  Energetic, bombastic bounding is downplayed by the moodiness of the lyrics, but this only enhances the performance; Smith is no Eddie Vedder or John Mellencamp; his is a quiet energy expressed through his playing.<br />This is a must-have for any Cure fan and anyone who can appreciate one of the founders of Modern Rock and a great stage show with awesome music.
B0000AI44Q|3.0|Pop Kulcher Review:  I'm really torn about what to say about this. It's either Neil's best album in ages, or his worst -- probably a little of both. Greendale is a full-fledged concept album, a confused tale about a middle-American family dealing with Bush-era America -- corporatization, intrusive media, attacks on the environment. Like the very worst &quot;rock operas&quot; (i.e. the Kinks' Preservation saga, Genesis' Lamb Lies Down On Broadway), the album is bogged down by its muddled narrative. Neil's need to tie his broad themes to the characters he created is distracting, banal, and downright embarrassing; by the end of the album, if I had to hear one more song about Grandpa and Earl I would have taken the cd and tossed it down a sewer. On the other hand, musically speaking, it's the most enjoyable Neil Young album since... hell, maybe 1990's Ragged Glory. Crazy Horse delivers its usual amateurish thonk to the tracks, and the songs tend to run on and on with repetitive, unimaginative blues-based riffs, but they're also Neil's most natural, organic-sounding songs in some time. Now, unlike some longtime fans, I think Neil had some decent work in the '90's, and even the worst of his albums in that era had some commendable tracks. But there was a certain blandness to the work, as if in his determination to escape his bizarre slew of experimental '80's albums he was trying to make music that sounded like Neil Young was supposed to sound. Greendale sounds completely unforced, a guy just making stuff up off the top of his head in the studio. (And it's a great recovery from last year's Are You Passionate?, which I found to be one of the worst albums he's released in his 30+ year career.) Unfortunately, all the narrative lyrics about Grandpa and Earl make it unlikely that any of these tunes will ever work well as stand-alone tracks in the Neil canon. The one exception is the remarkable &quot;Bandit,&quot; the lone acoustic song and one of the most beautiful songs he's ever offered (which, in a career that has included the fabulous After The Gold Rush and Rust Never Sleeps albums, is truly saying something). And for all the album's weaknesses, it's hard not to have immense respect for an artist who continues to push himself in new directions after 35 years in the biz. More than you can say about the Stones and the other dinosaurs who are still kicking around out there.ver offered (which, in a career that has included the fabulous After The Gold Rush and Rust Never Sleeps albums, is truly saying something).

B00005IC2H|5.0|I had heard about Sigur Ros from reading about influences of Radiohead.  After seeing so many 5 star reviews here, I decided to buy this album.  I was bewildered, to say the least, when I first listened to \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\".  First of all, as most people know, Sigur Ros does not sing their songs in English.  They don't even sing in Icelandic!  They sing in a pseudo-Icelandic called \\"Hopelandic\\".  But it does not matter, Jonsi's voice is one of unbelievable beauty.  Don't worry about lyrics; focus instead on his voice as another instrument.  Other than Radiohead and My Bloody Valentine, I have never heard a person produce sounds from a guitar like Sigur Ros can.  The texture of these sounds are mind-blowing.<br />All of these tracks are outstanding but it is hard for me to single one out because they all seem to flow as one long track.  However, I will single out \\"Svefn-G-Englar\\", \\"Olsen Olsen\\", and \\"Flugufrelsarinn\\" as the truly special tracks.<br />I cannot recommend this album enough; this is simply some of the most beautiful and inspiring music I have ever listended to.
B00009V7PJ|3.0|I was expecting very much from that DVD - after all it's a production made by Cher, and she, as we all know, cares about her shows like anyone else. Her concerts ara always an amazing demonstration of fantastic effects, which are subdued that they stay only a bonus to great music. How is it this time? Unfortunately not that good. Of course the quality of picture and sound is great, but if we're talking about the content-related part of disc, it's worse. The first part of show is boring. Unfortunately it is not my mistake - viewer often looks at counter because he's curious how much time he spent watching this. Despite artist efforts, it is not what people expect from her. The second half of the disc pulls out the whole concert from this boredom. The better songs begin. They're played better, more dynamic and theylook much better. We'll even see a classic Cher costume! As I said, the DVD has a huge content-related lacks - where are such big hits (and great songs of course) as \\"\\"Love and Understanding\\", \\"One by One\\", \\"Walking in Memphis\\", \\"The Music's No Good Without You\\", \\"Song for The Lonley\\" or \\"You Take It All\\"? As you can see 1/3 of the material is to change for other, better tracks. Now lets get to Cher image - it also leaves a lot to be desired. If in \\"Strong Enough\\" clip or even on the cover of this DVD she looks good, during the show she often (but not always!) looks... well, not so good. I like Cher very much but, unfortunately, I can't tell much good about this disc... what a pity! At the end I can only add that if you're interested in buying Cher DVD, you should choose the previous one - \\"Live In Concert\\" recorded in Las Vegas. As a matter of fact I didn't watch the Las Vegas DVD, but I saw the same show on HBO. Even in TV it looked much better than the newest concert. Unfortunately I don't know if the version that is in sale is different from the one I've seen on TV, so I advise you to check it out first, because someone could recklessly make this amazingshow same average as he did with \\"The Farewell Tour\\". Great climat, much great hits, beautiful visualisations, amazing sound (even on TV!) and of course Cher, who looks much better than in \\"The Farewell...\\". Unfortunately I have to admit that I probably won't watch this DVD very often...<br />Oh, and one more! Don't get me wrong - this disc is not that bad, I just expected much more...
B00005JLYW|1.0|Without a doubt this is the worst movie I have seen in years. Had I seen it in a theatre it would be a definite walk-out. I don't expect a story, but the stunts and effects were idiotic and were edited in that seizure inducing way that I guess is targeted at 16 year olds. Smug, unfunny, and a complete wast of time. Just because all the actors showed up, does not warrant this mess.
B00008IAMD|5.0|It is sad that this is Johnny's last album, because he had so much more he could give us.  His renditions of more modern songs are magnificent.  The DVD of Hurt is worth the price pf this CD, and all the great music is a real bonus, or visa versa.  You can hear Johnny's authentic feelings and voice in each song.  It seems as if each song was written just for him.  This album made my son a Johnny Cash fan.<br />Get this CD and DVD.  The DVD is hauntingly beautiful.  It is as if he knew this would be his last, so he made it his best.
0345451325|5.0|I received this less then a week ago from my Amazon.com order, and I just finished this book tonight.  It is without a doubt an incredible story.  I'm not one for Sci-Fi, but I had a hard time putting this one down.  If you are a HALO fan you will love this book, it provides you with the background info you never knew.  It ends right where the HALO game picks up.  I won't ruin anything or give spoilers to the novel, but this book is a gem.  I also picked up \\"The Flood\\" and will be starting that one tomorrow.  So do yourself a favor, if you love the game, buy it.

B00005RERU|1.0|THE WORST video transfer I have ever bought! It is NOT in widescreen as some other reviewers have suggested and it is NOT in Dolby Stereo. This DVD also wins the award for the worst packaging and extras features: that is, nothing! And can you believe that a film of over 2 1/2 hours has only 4 chapters?<br />Do not buy this DVD unless you have a perverse collection of dud DVDs. As much as like this film and the star this DVD is heading straight for the trashcan!<br />There should be a law against putting out such low quality DVDs like this out on the market!

B00008H2LB|1.0|my god is this CD ever awful! giving this one star is about 5 stars to many. i listened to every track on this CD (thankfully i didnt buy it, i just listened to my friends copy) and i couldnt tell you the diffrence between any of the songs. they all sound exactly the same, 15-30 seconds build up then a loud crunchy poorly constructed guitar riff comes in bashing you over the head followed by an incoherent rapping verse that makes the Insane Clown Posse look like it were Run DMC. then you get their angry bald white guy screaming about teenage angst (with his vocals heavily fixed on computer and doubled up i might add) even though hes probably pushing 30. and, occasionally youll get the above 2 reversed and/or someone elses music spliced into the song to make it sound ever so slightly diffrent.<br />the only nice thing i can say about the CD is that it doesnt fall into the all to common cliche of the \\"curse as much as you can as quickly as you can\\" song than befalls bands like LIMP BIZKIT and even good bands like KoRn.<br />however, even that small shining light is destroyed by the CDs length, usually i like getting a long CD, more bang for my buck. but here it is pure agony. <br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TIME AND BRAIN CELLS ON THIS CD! instead buy a quality heavy metal CD like...i donno...anything by QUEENS OF THE STONEAGE or and old LED ZEPPELIN album. or better yet buy PINK FLOYDs ultimate opus DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.<br />if you like metal and concider yourself to be more than a consumer [shill] and sheep avoid CD. its not music, its not art its just dhearia...its watered down, but ultimatly still [junk].
B000007T1M|4.0|There are very few bands out there who have the balls to say the political thigns that system of a down has, This was an amazing cd not my favorite SOAD cd but One of the best debut albums i have seen in a while, I enjoy there broad range of songs they have angry songs, politecial songs &amp; some sad songs very few bands do that and its nice to know that there are still a few out there like SOAD. I say you should buy toxicity then there self tituled &amp; them steal this album but thats just an opinion not a fact.
B000002LLC|5.0|IM BREATHLESS, Well I wasnt to sure, at first but later when i get the tape, I really liked, Hanky Panky  cracked me up, it was cool ( i just thing a little ruff and you better no disagree) oooooh yeah!!. And of course this the home of a almost B-side to keep it together, VOGUE. All theses track went well together except vogue, When vogue it the scene it was huge, the song still rocks today just with 90's sound. anyway this is collectable for all M-fans maybe non too.
B000002H33|5.0|With two very different cds before this ( kill em all &amp; ride the lightning) I believe they mixed both of those albums together and what do you get? &quot; master of puppets&quot; it seems like everybody has somethign good to say about this record, for good reason also. I think Kirk &amp; James did a great job with the riffs, James lyrics &amp; vocals are just magical. Lars's drums are as good if not better on there previous records. This was sadly cliff's last album due to his death of course. ( i personally think that they wouldn't have gone on a lighter side with the black album, load, reload &amp; garbage inc if cliff had still been alive) Now to the album it starts out with heavy riffs &amp; great vocals. Now to the title track and also an amazing one The riffs go perfectly with the drums &amp; vocals which is why i believe makes this such a great song. The things that should not be is more of a layed back feel to it which is good for the lyrics in this one. Now to my favorite song on this album, welcome home (sanitarium) before i tell you my opinion on this track i think its INSANE that a sellout band like limp bizkit got to place this at the mtv icon. Not the point though when i heard the opening guitar strings I knew this would be an amazing song. The lyrics are the high point, Lars does an incredible job on the drums here, probably the best drumming he has on this cd. Now on to disposible heros, i think its a meaningful song, i really enjoy the way the opening guitars mix with the drums. Leper messiah, its not a bad song but i don't think its the best song here. Now on to orion the insturmental i think this is an amazing insturmental song i didn't think you could put so much emotion into a song with no lyrics. Damage inc. is the perfect ending to this album its great how it starts off with a slow electronical then quickly goes into heavy guitar riffs. Most metallica fans have this so i don't have to say go buy this, but if you want to get into metallica buy this 1st.buy this 1st.
B0000004UB|5.0|I still like samatha fox. Touch me, I wanna have some fun,and the BIG naughty girl's need love too. Everytime I play theses it takes me back  to 1987-88 5th grade. Cool tracks. they are defenetly lates 80's classics....
B00005LC6Z|4.0|It is rare for me to like a sequel to a horror movie. \\"Nightmare On Elm Street\\" immediately jumped the shark with the sequel. \\"Friday the 13th\\" jumped the shark when the original came out. That was one movie I just cannot enjoy. \\"Halloween II\\" is an exception. It actually picks up where the first film ended when Dr. Sam Loomis shoots Michael and leaves the house to check to see if Michael is dead or not, only to find Michael had gotten up and walked off into the shadows. Laurie Strode is taken to the Haddonfield hospital and that is where the fun begins. What bothers me the most about the movie is: a) where the heck were Laurie's parents? and b) the lack of lighting in the hospital is so unreal. Plus shouldn't there be more people on staff at a hospital? Then again Haddonfield is a small town. It ain't Chicago that's for sure. The body count in \\"Halloween 2\\" increases. This was one of those movies where you want to scream at the person in the film for being so stupid. The suspense from the first film may be lacking in the sequel but I enjoyed the movie. It sure beats the heck out of its predecessors (although \\"Halloween IV\\" is a major guilty pleasure of mine).
B000002LGQ|5.0|I was 12 years old in 1989, when this album was release, I remember hearing it alot, Its took a while to hit me do to the different sound madonna brought in it wasnt pop like that i was used to.  But when it did i begged to get it, Lots my friends turned to paula abduls forever your girl stuff,who said madonna is over, not me I stayed with Madonna, My all time favorite song is here, express yourself, hey hey hey hey! do go for second best baby!!!!! And 13 years later this record still sounds fresh.  And i ask those paula abdul fans, wheres your girl now?   Go MADONNA!!!!
6302150930|3.0|Warning: Spoilers.<BR> The one major complaint I have about this movie is its tendency to drag on.  Many scenes were slow-as-life, showing Tess walking through a field or thoughtfully gazing off into space.  Although I felt that the film was moving unnecessarily slow, I was certainly never bored.  My attention was kept, I believe, by the fact that I had read Hardys novel prior to watching the movie.  For the most part, Polanski stayed true to Hardys story and intentions with the exception of two major themes.  First, I felt that Polanski didnt make it clear that Tess felt an extreme responsibility to work for her family as a result of her accident that killed their horse, Prince.  The fact that they had lost their horse was mentioned in the film, but I felt that an integral reason for Tesss leaving home to work for the DUrbervilles was because she felt responsible for her familys financial woes.  The second major departure from the book was the fact that Tess submitted to Alec in the woods.  Hardy made it abundantly clear that Tess was disgusted with the man.  In the film, Tess willingly kissed Alec back for a long while before he took advantage of her, thus leading to her misfortune throughout the rest of the story. <BR> As a high school student, I realize that many students watch the film versions of novels before writing a paper.  I must strongly recommend against this.  While the film follows the plot of the novel almost exactly, there are many elements presented in the book that even the most masterful filmmaker could not be able to incorporate, such as Tesss helplessness, Angels self-confidence, and Alecs wild lust.  All of these characteristics are magnified much greater in the novel.<BR> As a whole, I am impressed with Polanskis ability to stay relatively true to the classic novel.  If you have read the novel and can get past the two major flaws that I mentioned, you should enjoy the movie because it is a decent stand alone film.
0812548094|4.0|Well, just finished Stone of Tears, and overall found the book pretty good.  I enjoyed the pace of the book, character development, and the storyline- I couldn't set this book down.  That said, I do have a few complaints.<BR>I DID enjoy the character development.  But, are you supposed to look forward to the parts of the book that don't involve the protagonist?  I loved the development of Chandalin,Kahlan, Sister Verna-and Ive always liked Chase.  THe jury's still out on Zedd for me.<BR>I also find myself slightly irritated at the way that Goodkind does conversation between the characters, and at the actions of characters.  There is just a little too much hugging that goes on, and the verbal dialoge just seems to be a little- I don't know-forced?  <BR>One last complaint, and maybe its because Im a little more used to the writing of George Martin, or Jordan.  I felt that more description could have been used in general.  You rarely get to see the world through the characters eyes except for an instant.  I remember at one point, Richard is holding a dead assasin in his arms, and the only description that we get of her is that she was female. I also tend to forget exactly what the characters look like, because they are mentioned so infrequently.  What color are Kahlan's eyes?  I think green, but im not sure.  Richards?  No idea.  Maybe I just dont have the reading comprehension that I like to think I have, but I would have liked it if descriptions and appearances were mentioned a bit more frequently.<BR>  It was however, a great book.  I enjoyed it greatly, and would recommend it to any Fantasy reader (already have, in fact) despite my complaints.  Im looking forward to the 6 + more books in this series that I have yet to read.

B000003TB6|5.0|Having long since been highly regarded for not only their exceptional `Live' performances, as well as Old-School Hip-Hop. The Roots have cultivated a hard-core following, through their incorporation, of musical influences such as `Jazz' &amp; `Soul', into their musical template....that have produced a distinctive style of their own.....With second album \\"Do you Want More??!!\\", the band have taken a `Live' approach to this album, with a rawer feel to it than their subsequent albums....which provides the band with much room to bring Songs together wonderfully, as well a them appearing to be having a great time just jamming. Not that the songs pack any less punch than their more conventional albums....far from it in fact!!, because of the rawer more instinctual approach, the majority of songs rock hard, and speak for themselves...in fact to emphasis this point, track 10 \\"What Goes on Pt7\\", starts with some human beat boxing, cascades into soul/funk...and half way through the track, cuts into a impromptu `Sound check'....which then perfectly leads into track 11 \\"Essaywhuman?!!??!!\\", which is a glorious Jazz / Hip-Hop fusion that epitomises the most influential qualities of `The Roots'......and yet another sublime effort for Philly's most regarded Hip-Hop Band.
B00006RINF|1.0|To each his own but i can't see how a person can listen to these songs or clips of song and then buy this cd.  No wonder people are switching from alternative rock to hip-hop.  This band has nothing special just an efensence spin off.
B0000508U6|5.0|Although hard to believe that they were once namechecked as `The New Radiohead', anyone that has delved into Coldplay's market cornering brand of Piano led indie Pop/Rock, will know that such comparisons are futile &amp; incorrect. Although `Pop' music can (and sometimes justifiably) come into criticism, Coldplay are reassessing people opinions and putting real substance, Passion, &amp; poignancy into Indie Pop....and rejuvenating the Britpop anthems so long since seen when `Blur/Oasis/Pulp'....had a stranglehold on Britpop. And with `Yellow' the British nation found a sing along anthem they could be proud of.....although in no way can `Yellow', with it's Delicate Piano chords, swishing percussion &amp; Reflective choruses soar with a dynamic passion, can be reasonably be considered a `One Trick Pony', as \\"Shiver / Trouble / High Speed\\"....easily match the brilliance of `yellow' (in fact \\"Trouble\\" is arguably the best track Coldplay have ever produced). And with this release Coldplay have effortlessly straddled the gap between appealing to the mid to late teens, and capturing the imagination (and wallets) of the discerning 30+ market, and with the second album \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" providing that the first album was `No fluke', and being as magnificent at this release, Coldplay (in terms of potentially huge broad appeal), might actually make those `New Radiohead' claims not seem so far fetched.
B00005JM0B|3.0|I love Terminator 1 & 2, both of them were excellent(***** star quality!), But Terminator 3 seemed almost it was a rip off money making scheme istead of a truly incredible experience like what the others did. Sure it has flashy special effects and yes ARNOLD is the only terminator ,but its not satisfying. The story is really weak, and the casting of the other characters isn't as good(uhh John Connor!)and where's Sarah Connor? Tell me why is there a girl cyborg(aka Terminatrix)? Too many questions left unanswered.You decide if Terminator 3 is good enough, its disposable ,but maybe cheap thrills is your kind of entertainment. Stick with the first two.
B00006LLNU|5.0|A difficult one to review, think `Radiohead' (Kid A / Amnesiac)...'Pink Floyd' (Dark side of the moon)... `Spiritualized' (Lazer Guided Melodies), but still something completely unique in the sum of it's parts....although this isn't really an album for Casual listeners, as the completely lack of any descriptive information regarding the band, Track names, Track listings are all notably absent, and likely to infuriate general observers....but delve a little deeper and it's hardcore following is justified...as it elegant strings / Guitar arrangements impress, its half-heard singing/warbling is strangely soothing, gradual minimalistic interplay moves to beautifully textured music / soundscapes forward...and each track builds in structure &amp; stature, revealing a subtlety more prominent with each listen that firmly does justice to their unique sound, admittedly at its worst...it's beautifully disguised sound collages, but at it's best it's a precious, ambitious stratospherically towering record of ambient sound.

We loved it, albeit there were some critics of the actual writing.  We liked it so much we decided to research certain aspects of it further, and last night had another lively discussion about Leonardo, Opus Dei, and Miriam of Magdala.  what a fun, intellectual tour!(with apologies to the previous reviewer). Some of my friends said, that I had missed the second wave of feminism, and that the  story was old already-well, I had great delight in reading it and will look forward to the next story by this gifted author!

With the RZA handling the production side of things, Method Man shimmy's &amp; Skims his way Uncompromisingly through: (Tical / Bring The Pain / All I Need / Release Yo' Delf / Method Man (remix), that fortunately for him, all went on to became so heavily remixed, played in clubs, &amp; bootlegged...with such ubiquity, that they all became Hip-Hop Classics, thus propelling him into a far more successful &amp; lucrative solo artist than his Wu-Tang stablemates....Method Man's Finest Solo work.

B00007FOMP|5.0|Arguably one of the most gifted, visionary, positive thinking musicians of our time, that took the negativity of the issues around him (War, Urban Crime, Moral dissatisfaction), and used parts of his music to promote social awareness of the world around us....(although his music always carried a strong undercurrent of Love/Lust & Sex!!), and fused incredible soul grooves to unprecedented effect (that has yet to be better)...regarded as controversial at the time because he choose such `Taboo' topics such as \\"Unemployment, Civil rights, Urban dysfunction, Social injustice, Black solidarity\\" as well as calling into question \\"Government ethics, the Police departments integrity, ethnic groups social standing, And Americas Wide-spread racism\\". It's possibly due to Marvin's ability to construct Soul of such a life-affirming quality through the expressive mediums of Sax, Guitar, Drums, Keyboard & Piano that its very easy to become immersed in the music and completely forget the message that is painfully trying to be broadcasted here!!....and admittedly such social matters have improved significantly since then, and one of the then Motown bosses hated the album (probably due to it's topical content)..but it isn't enough to say that this is `One of the Greatest Albums ever made\\".....it's deserves much more than that....It's probably more just to say \\"That Its one of the most `Important' albums ever devised'.
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|Not a single song on the album distingiushed itself from any other and not a single song warrants listening to again.  The entire album runs just over 30 minutes, but it plays like one continuous, mediocre song.  \\"This Is It\\" was a fine album and a great departure from the monotony of popular radio, but this new CD shows nothing us nothing new and certainly nothing nearly as inspired.
0345451325|5.0|...       \\"Halo the Fall of Reach\\" is the prequal to the hit xbox game \\"Halo Combat Evolved.\\" A group of soldiers have been specially bioengineered and technologically augmented(faster and stronger than anyother human) to become warriors known as SPARTANs. They have been trained there whole life to defend Earth from an alien species known as the Covenant. Thier civilization is much more advanced than the human race. The Covenant have been studieng humans for a long time, and they want to take over; but the humans will not let that happen. At least not without a fight.<BR>        If you have played the original game, Halo Combat Evolved, from Bungie, then you can say that it is quite an enjoyable game. If you are a HUGE Halo fan I concider reading the prequal, \\"Halo the Fall of Reach.\\" You will discover many of the mysteries that were not present in the game. You will understand how everything comes together that leads into the game. <BR>        I really enjoyed this game. If you have or played the game then this is a must-read for all Halo fans. Even if your not a big fan you should still consider reading this. This is a great science-fiction book and I am planning on reading it again soon. <BR>                    CAN'T WAIT FOR HALO 2!!!
B000084T18|3.0|He's one of the better contemporary rappers.  Unlike rich and bloaded P. Diddy and others, he lived the thug life.  He's only singing about it now.  Rap is not what is used to be, but this comes close.
0345457684|4.0|Not many first time authors turn out a novel this good. Great character development, fascinating science, gets right to the heart of the story without dancing around with superfluous page filler. The plot struggles a bit as the who-dunnit sorts itself out, but a good story anyway.
B000066NW0|1.0|This girl does not sound punk at all!  She's just a whiny brat in her daddy's clothes.  If you want real punk or something like it, Courtney Love will serve just fine.  She does not have a hard edge to her voice at all.  She sounds like an Alanis Morrisette clone.  She whines incessantly in Losing Grip and I'm With You.  Then she pretends that she's tough stuff while singing in a little girl voice in Skater Boi and Complicated.  There is no edge to her voice at all.  She is a total phony.  This is not punk.  It's the punk fm lite.
B000001FA4|5.0|The album that I would likely view as their most non-commercial album that they have ever made to date, U2's 1984 magnum opus \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" could very well be my favorite album of their entire catalog. This builds upon the greatness of their previous albums and their 1983 breakthrough album \\"War\\". For those whose familiarity with U2 is confined to just to the \\"Joshua Tree\\" through their \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" eras are likely to be surprised at the vastly different style of this album but still, this is worth checking out. I think that this album is more keyboard oriented than any of their other albums from before or since then. It's probably that my tastes lean more towards keyboard-oriented music that makes me love this album so much. I find it very hard to believe that this album came out way back in 1984! A lot of music that came out around that time period dated pretty quickly and sounds extremely dated today and sounded so even by the time \\"Joshua Tree\\" came around.  \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" on the other hand, was many years ahead of it's time when released and as it approaches it's 20th year of existence, it is every bit as fresh and vibrant and doesn't even sound dated at all. I could play this against \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" and still hardly notice it's age. Quite a large number of reviews have labeled this album as uneven. Uneven? Yeah right! This album is strong the whole way through. All of the songs are absolutely delightful, ALL OF THEM! <br />We've all already heard \\"Pride In The Name of Love\\" as well as the haunting and passionate \\"Bad\\". I definitely believe that these two songs deserved all the popularity that they got then and still get today as they are among their best singles to date. There are two famous hit songs that are entitled \\"Bad\\". One is by Michael Jackson and the other is the other hit single of \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\". No offense to MJ but While I enjoy the MJ song quite a lot, U2's \\"Bad\\" to me is far superior and has such a haunting mix of passionate dynamic vocals, haunting keyboards, and a dark moody undertone to it and the result is one of my all time favorite U2 songs.  The song grows more and more passionate and builds up towards the last two minutes and climaxes with such incredible power that \\"Bad\\" is just phenomenal. I love the haunting moody ambience that fades into the night after the beats and guitars end.  While Bono has written passionate and mature music in the years since then, his abilities have never matched what he had done on this incredible song. What's even more amazing is that this song uses mostly just two chords and still comes out being a masterpiece track! With Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois as producers, this song has some keyboards that sound similar to those on Peter Gabriel's \\"Red Rain\\" although no where near as strong as those on the latter. <br />The non-singles on this album in my opinion are among my favorites though. \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" is in my opinion, the best opening track on any of U2's albums beginning this album on a passionate and haunting note with passionate lyrics and dark yet intense moody atmospherics to create a truly marvelous and unforgettable. \\"Wire\\" is just energetic mayhem with a high-pace rhythm and edgy guitar playing by Adams. Many seem to really dislike the fifth and sixth tracks \\"Promenade\\" and \\"Fourth Of July\\". It's a deep shame as these really do such a fantastic job of blending moodiness with dark ambience, electrifying guitar bubbling guitars and breezy atmospheres. To me, this is my favorite 'lonely cloudy evening' theme song. The title to \\"Fourth Of July\\" may be a bit deceiving as it has no explosive styles that would make one think of actual fireworks but on the other hand, it would evoke images of seeing the fireworks but from a great distance as to not hear the popping sounds of them at all and thus I have to say that I absolutely adore this song. \\"Indian Summer Sky\\" is very much like \\"Wire\\" butas multi-rhythm like that track is and is slightly more acoustic than the former but still is a good song. \\"Elvis Presly and America\\" is a great and odd track with pounding pulsating drum beats and a mix of ambient blues and alternative rock. This is an excellent song and I totally defend it on here. The final track on here \\"MLK\\" is an odd and haunting closer to this haunting and elegant masterpiece with a hazy and ghostly ambient breeze for the melody and the sound of a breeze that fades into the night. <br />U2 may have struck multi-platinum with their next two albums \\"Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Achtung Baby\\" but from my perspective, U2 reached their early artistic pinnacle on this record and while U2 have been the masters of reinvention throughout their career, I cannot deny that U2 have never toyed with passion, poetic lyric writing, atmospherics, darkness and moodiness the way they did on \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" and this album is an album that must be included by ALL U2 fans' collection, both casual and die-hard fans. And so U2 closes out their early period on a phenomenal note and ushered in the era of superstardom and selling millions and millions of albums while retaining their artistic ability and punch to this very day. Please buy this album. I cannot recommend it enough. When I was done listening to this album, I felt like I had floated off the surface of the sidewalk during the album playing and finally softly touched back down when \\"MLK\\" faded into the night. It's that good! Just sheer and utter imaginative brilliance this record has! Even if you have the singles on the 1980-1990 hits CD, the non-single tracks on here warrant buying this album anyway. If only I was old enough to experience this when it was in it's heyday (I was barely two when this album came out), it would've been unbelievable! To Henry Rollins, no pun intended but take a chill pill man! ::-)
B000068PQ0|4.0|If you are in the mood for something very different than usual pop crap(like Avril Lavigne, Britney, or Justin), get this now!!!  It's unique, strange, and brilliant!

B00006LPEY|5.0|Reading over many of the reviews, it seems that Akira is somewhat of a love/hate sort of movie.  I remember back before even the word 'anime' was known to every highschool kid and his grandmother, there wasn't much a debate on whether or not this movie was any good.  If you had seen it, you loved it.  And you were automatically held in high regard by movie fans for even being aware of its existence.  Many people nowadays don't seem to like this movie yet claim to be absolutely obbsessed with anime.  Mind you, I don't doubt their sincerity, but I have come across far too many 'fans' who assert their status because they &quot;watch Toonami everyday&quot;.  *sigh*....Akira, in my opinion is the perfect example of what anime was like in the pre-dragonball era.  Most titles were like this.  Grim, violent, and always highly original in its concepts.  With enough cryptic meanings to instigate philisophical debates amongst any group of movie geeks.  Maby it's just nostalgia on my part, but it seems I can pop in this DVD now and enjoy it just as much as I did when I first saw it twelve years ago.  If you haven't seen it yet and you're still unsure about this alledged masterpiece, look at it like this: if you liked Ghost in the Shell, there's a good chance you'll have fun with this.  If your anime interests consists of whatever is being shown on Cartoon Network this week (which is not bad, mind you), then you're probably not ready for this.
076790592X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and by the end I was in tears.  Morrie is an inspiration to many because he remained positive until the end.  I really liked the part when he said he would pretend that there is a bird on his shoulder and would ask the bird if today was the day he was going to die.  People don't really think about death until someone around them dies.  This book gives you a different perspective about death and about life.  It teaches you that you need to live your life like it was your last and not to have any regrets before you die.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is not happy with their life because it really helps you to appreciate all the things you do have.

B000003CMB|5.0|se trata del mejor disco de la historia del rock, sin duda, y se debe a varias razones: tener un repertorio inmejorable, un ritmo bestial del bajo y las dos bateras, dos de los mejores guitarristas de la historia (Duanne es posible que sea el mejor), un vocalista en estado de gracia, unos juegos de guitarras que ya les gustara a los Skynyrd, las mejores improvisaciones del rock... en resumen un disco imprescindible, una joya.

B00005JM0B|2.0|so sad what they did to this series.  should have just left well enough alone.  they fight in a bathroom and hit each other over the head with urinals for crying out loud.  where the first two ended with a sense of hope, this ends with the end of the world, making everything before a giganto waste of time.  yea, arnold looks amazing here, but thats just not enough!  WHY!!!
B00000IP4H|4.0|\\"Demonic\\" is more aggressive than anything Testament has done before. The album doesn't have the melodies of earlier releases (due to Alex Scolnick's departure), but it is still Testament 100%. Chuck Billy sings with a death metal voice growling almost all along the album. The drum duties were shared between the \\"virtuous\\" Gene Hoglan and Chris Kontos. On bass, Testament's original bass player (even before than Greg Christian), Derrick Ramirez. Testament bases itself on the Billy-Peterson duet, the only two that have survived the test of time. \\"Demonic\\" is angry, punishing, chaotic...You have fast songs such as \\"Murky Waters\\", where the band gets closest to death metal, \\"Ten Thousand Thrones\\" or the opener \\"Demonic Refusal\\", that gives you the vibe of what the album will be like. \\"Jun-Jun\\" or \\"Burning times\\" are other high points of the album. I've been a Testament fan for 10 years now, and I also love death metal so, I'm glad to see Testament's \\"extreme side\\"... This might not be \\"the\\" Testament album, but it's something different. And in this era of musical mediocrity, where most of the bands change to a more commercial approach (justifying that that is \\"musical evolution\\"), it's a relief to have a \\"great band\\" such a Testament that doesn't follow any trend, and mind their own business, staying true to the fans...and metal!

B000002UJQ|5.0|Think of the bands that people consider the best. The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, stuff like that. I like Led Zeppelin, I like The Doors, the Beatles, well I dont really care for them, but these are the bands people consider the best. There will never any bands better, all other bands are just a copy of them, blah blah blah. Think of this. The first cars ever built could go 25 mph or something like that. A car now can go a heck of a lot faster. Just because the cars now are copies of the first ones, doesnt necessarly mean that the first cars built were the &quot;best&quot;. The are not, no one thinks they are, so how is it any different for bands. None of these bands have done anything as good as this album, as advanced, as mature as this album, and they never will. It is as simple as that. This is the greatest album ever recorded.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|This album is one for everything, the road, the home, and the life. I recommend popping it into the old player and relax for the story to unfold.<br />'Room On Fire' is the sophomore album from the acclaimed band, 'The Strokes.' Having been a follow up to one of the most fascinating albums to hit in the past few years, 'Is This It', they had a lot to overcome, nevertheless, the feat is finished. 'Room on Fire' is nothing under pure genius, it is what rock 'n roll is meant to be, something amiss in the standards of rock today. Here we have stories, we have passion, we have emotion. The band is rock's answer to Radiohead. Muffled Julian may sound, but we understand.<br />The album shines and the album glistens. 'What Ever Happened?' surprises us and at the same time, tells us to come in and listen. Up beat tempos provide us the halo necessary to complete that task. From there we carry on and waiting is the only negative aspect of the album, you just can't seem to stop wondering, 'What's next?'<br />'12:51', the band's new single, is by far no 'Last Nite', it is different. With a sound almost ripping out of 'The Cars', we see the inevitable change 'The Strokes' underwent to reach this secondary position. Personally, this song underachieves compared to the rest of the album, but this was the band's point. Songs such as 'I Can't Win' and 'Under Control' are so revolutionary yet at the same time, remind us of the past, maybe, a better time?<br />'Meet Me in The Bathroom' echoes off the walls of the room and triggers us into a story, of cheap love and booze flowing at a party's bend. We can't help but wonder if this is a true story. Retro in a sense, this song is the theme to the band and leads the album.<br />The album continues, but that is for the listener. There are highlights and there are songs, the album is a winner. At the beginning of the year, 'Rolling Stone' magazine claimed the album as going to be this year's best. Let's just say Rolling Stone magazine have some good psychics on hand, this album is 2003's leader.some good psychics on hand, this album is 2003's leader.

0553208845|5.0|I love this novel because it's a novel about spirituality that isn't the least bit dogmatic, preachy, boring or self-indulgent. It's actually a fairly simple story of one man's unlikely spiritual journey. Siddhartha goes from golden boy, to wandering Brahmin, to successful businessman to humble ferryman. Ultimately, he learns more by listening to the river than he did from Gotama the Buddha, riches, or self-denial. Just read it!
076790592X|3.0|Sadly, this book was not on par with the hype.
B00005Y228|3.0|As musical candy goes, you can't beat Kylie Minogue. Her girly, sexy, sugary dance/pop songs practically give you a cavity after too much listening. \\"Can't Get You Out of my Head\\", the insanely infectious song that re-introduced her to Americans, is probably the best track on this CD. Songs like \\"More More More\\" and \\"Come Into My World\\" are romantic and completely transparent carnal come-ons, and tracks like \\"Love Affair\\" and \\"In Your Eyes\\" are charming techno-infused dance tracks. As a pop icon, I'd put Kylie somewhere in between Madonna and Britney. Although no where near as challenging, arty or political as Madonna, Kylie has better pipes than Britney and serves up her sexual persona with tongue firmly in cheek. If you're just looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, you could do much worse.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is definitely one of Linkin Park's best albums. I simply can't get enough of this CD. Linkin Park does a great job of mixing a wide range of beats and rhythms together to get me bouncing my head and moving my feet. Lead singer, Chester Bennington, does an exceptional job showing his fans what amazing vocals he has and how he can use them in a broad manner. His vocals also mix extremely well with the rap verses in some of the songs. My favorite songs on the CD are \\"Nobody's Listening\\" and \\"Faint\\". These songs automatically get me moving to the beat. This Linkin Park album does not only come from one aspect of music style. Instead, by mixing hard rock and rap, Linkin Park proves that they have true talent and the ability to attract people with all tastes of music.
0066214122|3.0|Prey is a good read. It's fast, it's entertaining, it's even educational a little. I enjoyed reading it. It is a sold Crichton book, and a good beach or plane read.<BR>The thing is ... it's not original enough to earn more than 3 stars. Crichton, while not being a great novelist (let's face it, his characters are not very well developed, they are just there, so the plot can move), nearly allways in the past was original. Before Crichton we haven't read about deadly viruses, nearly sentient gorillas (not counting &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; or several comic-book characters), or dinosaurs in the modern world.<BR>But deadly nanomachines ... well, we even had Mulder and Scully dealing with the problem in one of original X-files novels (&quot;Antibodies&quot;). The fact that the nanotechnology is not a novel idea in books is not, of course, the authors fault, but it makes the scientific aspect of the novel (which allways was one of Crichtons strong points) less interesting.<BR>Also, I found the first part of the novel a bit too long. This is the part of the novel, which shows the life of the mysterious occurances, and the main character wondering about what's going on, etc. It is well written. But let's face it - you've read the back cover, so you allready know the reason behind all this.<BR>That's the problem with many of todays novels, or maybe not novels, but books. Having to sell them, the publishers put too much information on the cover, and sometimes it spoils the experience of reading. I think that when it comes to Crichton or King, the publishers can wet our interest not by giving away plot points, but by surrounding the book in mystery - like the 5th Harry Potter book. If I've approached this book without any information about what i'll find inside, I would've definetly enjoyed it more.
B00005JKC3|4.0|This is a much better movie than I feared it might be. I'll keep this brief. When Bruce Banner gets mad, the movie easily fulfils all hopes. So often computer graphics disappoint in that there is no sense of \\"reality.\\" The action has no weight, and there is no sense of real power. That is not the case here. The special effects folks did an amazing job in conveying the Hulk's sheer size and terrifying strength. When the green giant tangles with the tanks, It really seems like steel is being torn.  And, suffice to say, the &quot;dog fight&quot; scene is literally worth the purchase price (as was Nick Nolte's final raving scene).<br />The Hulk was (and still is) my favorite comic, and I do not feel cheated by this version. But, it must be said, I think Mr. Lee missed something essential in the Hulk myth. What drove the Hulk/Banner character throughout the comic book was an extreme sense of isolation, of being an outsider from the rest of humanity. Bruce Banner was always a man on the outside because of this terrible beast within him, a terrible dark side that could tear loose at any second.  He could never have normal attachments, and he could never lead a normal life. He was just a drifter. Lost. Director Lee went instead with a very modern &quot;dysfunctional family&quot; theme as the source of the Hulk's rage. While it was an interesting take on it, I prefer the more traditional take on the Hulk; i.e. Bruce Banner drifting from town to town with his terrible secret haunting him at every step. This was the aspect that the television series, and original TV movie with Bill Bixby, captured so well. Perhaps we will see more of this in the sequel, as, admittedly, this was kind of an \\"origin\\" movie.<br />Still, there is more to admire in this version than curse. I will buy the DVD.
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten.  What an album.  Where to start? I bought this CD when it was released, having already been a fan of Mother Love Bone.  Not only was I initally impressed that Pearl Jam was not just MLB with a new frontman, continuing in the same vein musically, I was also deeply moved by the awesome weight that the album manages to shift around.<br />Twelve years later, with significant changes in the landscape of popular music, including a metamorphisis of Pearl Jam themselves, the significance of Ten has not dwindled.  It's far from an obscure title, as you'd be hard pressed to find someone that hasn't heard most of the cuts of the record, and probably owns it.  However, many individuals I have spoken with over the years put it away after listening to familiar cuts like 'Evenflow' or 'Jeremy.'  And who hasn't at one point or another either sung themselves, or heard others singing \\"do do do do do de doooo\\" the familiar refrain from 'Black,' or wailing lyrics from 'Alive' (which, consequently might have the one of the best guitar solos in recent popular music, even at approx. two minutes long, it never tires)<br />But take a look past track 6 (Jeremy), and you'll find a whole other side to the album.  Cuts like 'Garden,' 'Deep,' and 'Oceans' captivate the attention of the listener, with soulful vocals, deeply textured guitar tones, and beats that envoke feelings of John Bonham on Zep's 'When the Levee Breaks.'  Fan favorite live anthem 'Porch' doesn't go unnoticed with its raw intensity coupled best with album opener 'Once.'<br />For this listener, however, the gem of the album is its final cut 'Release.'  This seemingly personal piece envokes so much emotion and intensity all while being the most mellow track on the album.  I highly reccomend listening to this song with a good pair of headphones, so to pick up subtle nuances that only enahnce an already great work.<br />So why review an album twelve years after its release, when everyone and their six brothers owns it, hatesit, or thinks it priceless?  First answer: Why not?  Second answer: Ten deserves to be revisited, each time a little 'Deep'er.  This album can truly captivate when listened to in the right circumstances.  Fall into it today.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Many people claim that the music on this album is more of the same from The Strokes.  This simply isn't true.  The Strokes have developed a particular sound.  It is this sound comes through in much of their work.  Many other artists have created their own sound, and nobody accuses them of being repetitious.  Can anybody honestly claim that Bruce Springsteen or The Rolling Stones haven't been writing the same song for the past 30 years?  I didn't think so.  But yes, this album contains more distorted vocals and most of the songs have a driving beat energy to them, but these are the things that create The Strokes's sound.<br />Some people will claim that while the album is good, it isn't as good as their first offering \\"Is This It\\".  This simply isn't true.  The songs are more complicated, the lyrics more comprehensible (both from a logical and listening standpoint), and the hooks are 10x better than \\"Is This It\\".  Every song on the album is strong, but \\"The End Has No End\\" and \\"Under Control\\" are masterful. <br />After having put more time into listening to the album I must say that I am very satisfied with Julian's (lead singer) songwriting on this effort.  While there is still a level of complexity to many of the songs, his message in most pieces is clearly available for the listener to decipher.  Some parts dabble less with complexity or subtlety and just get straight to the point such as, \\"I'm not your friend.  I never was.\\"  This seems pretty haunting when you get right down to it.  It is this type of mix that I really enjoy and I feel makes for a great album from a songwriting standpoint.<br />It is also interesting to find that The Strokes have done a nice job of interpreting those artists who came before them in an effort to try and push their own work forward.  For instance by his own admittance Stroke's guitarist Nick Valensi has stated that some of the baselines on the album come straight from various works by The Cure.  There is also a guitar riff in \\"TheEnd has No End\\" that most definitely seems influenced by GnRs \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\".  The main hook in \\"12:51\\" bears a remarkable similarity to the work by The Cars from almost 20 years ago.  There are those who will say that it is unfortunate that The Strokes have had to resort to using \\"samples\\" just to try and make some sort of semblance of difference from their last album.  I disagree wholeheartedly and believe that instead this gives the listener some familiar tie that will only encourage additional listening and create the opportunity to study the work more intensely and explore the deeper regions of each track.<br />I am a cynical jerk, but this album is so beautiful it makes me want to cry.  It is the best of 2003 w/o doubt.
B00005JM02|5.0|Everything good you've heard about this movie is true it is a fantastic animated film. Now on to the DVD.<br />Oh all the fun you will have with this dvd! There are many extra features here on this two disc DVD including several easter eggs. The main menu features the voice of Albert Brooks. The deleted scenes are fun to see. There is a documnetary and an exploring the sea featurete. The sound is excellent and the picture is fantastic. You can even use the underwater backgrounds has a screen saver. One disc is in widescreen the other is in full screen. Both discs hold special features and easter eggs. The deleted scenes are always my favorite thing to see on dvd and I'm glad they have included several here. The delted scenes are all rough animation and not completed so it looks much like story boards that move and have some voices and sound added. The first scene is my favorite and is a touching bed time story given to Nemo of how the sea took away his mother. It may have been nice to have seen this kept in the film. Another favorite of mine is a scene titled Gill Lies. In that scene one fish in the background states revelations always happen on Friday and what follows is Gill telling a story to Nemo ala Kevin Spacey in Usual Suspects. It was a great scene that would have been a little too much extra in movie. The picture is very clear, however I did notice a glow around the clown fish from time to time. I enjoyed all the many features on this two disc set and would recomend it to anyone looking to see Findind Nemo.
0671042858|4.0|Well, What can I say, I wasn't surprised by how great this book was written. Before I read the book, I thought that it was going to be a traditional Stephen King horror story, but it wasn't. It was a survival story about a 10 year old girl who got lost in the woods and is desperately trying to find a way out. I loved the way King expressed the characters feelings and thoughts. After reading some of his other books like &quot;Salems Lot&quot; and &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, it's almost refreshing to read this book. I would recommend this book for ages 12 to adult. Great Book!
078401213X|5.0|I saw this movie, and I just loved it. But, I could tell that this would be one of those movies that either gets five stars, or one star. This truly is a piece of art. There aren't many ways to describe it. It's just beautiful! To all those people who gave it one star, if you can't take the heat, step out of the kitchen.
B00005JKC3|3.0|This movie was just OK.  Not great, just OK.<BR>It spends over 40 minutes setting the story up<BR>when a quick 5 to 10 minute epilogue would have<BR>done the same thing.  I mean, come on, is the origin<BR>more important or the action.  This movie was 30% action,<BR>80% setup.  Should've been the other way around.<BR>Also, the movie did not stay true to the comic book<BR>and even reinvented the origin.  I know comic purists<BR>are disgusted, rightfully so.  For a great comic <BR>movie check out Daredevil instead.  This movie didn't<BR>suck, but was just ok.  This is a shame considering<BR>the source material.
B00005KARK|5.0|There is nothing I can add to all of the heartfelt and insightful reviews I've seen on this site.  But I've yet to see a sample of its international reknown.  Check it out!<br />     At the 1947 Cannes Film Festival DUMBO won the Palm D'Or.  Not too shabby.  Even though the animated classic was 5 years old at that time it was still honored.   I believe that the French judges wanted to catch up on all of the films they would have recognized had not a little thing called WWII begun on the eve of the first scheduled Cannes Film Festival, causing it to be sort of postponed (yet another decent thing those wretched goose-steppers messed up!).  Disney has not received that honor a second time, putting DUMBO truly in a class by itself.
B00005O3VC|4.0|This is my favorite Monty Python movie! If you can appreciate the British's sense of humor, you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie. Eric Idle and John Cleese are at their best and you'll never look at the medieval ages the same again. For a good many laughs, check this one out.
0788812807|5.0|Anyone with an eye for beauty cannot help but admire the light and color of this enduring and endearing Disney Masterpiece.  But great art must take into account content; it must hit you on a visceral level.  And there's no finer example of this anywhere in filmdom than the final chase sequence.  From the moment the old bloodhound resolves itself to set things right, to his ultimate sacrifice, there is no more touching pathos ever set between sprockets.  I cannot even think of it without becoming overwhelmed by emotion.  I can actually steel myself against DUMBO's Baby Mine, but no matter how I coach myself (&quot;It's just paint on plastic, for Pete's sake!&quot;) I am swayed by Disney's band of geniuses.  And I am actually proud that I am so swayed.<BR>Such boldness and honor are rarely evinced so well on a screen or presenium.  All dramatists could do well to study it.  It is truly high art.  Ahwoooooooo!
B000002LFZ|5.0|This is a great CD for people who are interested in only having Fleetwood Mac's best hits from the radio. For the fans who are looking for the more obtrusive songs, this may not be what you are looking for. Either way the music is classic Fleetwood and you will definately be singing along. :)
B00003CXDG|5.0|It's funny that people take action movies so seriously. Action movies are like popcorn movies and are made for just a fun movie experience. So from the beginning when you go to see an action/popcorn movie you shouldn't expect to see an in-depth storyline, 3-dimensional characters, or great acting (though this film does a bit better in that area than most). What you should expect to see is of course good action, good cinematography, cheesy one-liners, and good special fx - which this film has in spades. <BR>So if you don't like action movies, then you won't like this one (I would've thought that was obvious, but some people have a rough time with it). <BR>This is the most skillfully-made action movie in the past 10 years - or since Hard Boiled, though Desperado definitely gives it a run for its money - and Kill Bill has now topped MI2, but that's my opinion :P. <BR>Good action movies are hard to come by and few people appreciate them, either because they insist that every film should be art (in its defined form) and/or that in order for a movie to be good it must succeed on every area (i.e. acting, cinematography, dialogue, etc.). I agree with these and truely enjoy well-thoughtout and artsy movies (Glengary Glenross, Taxi Driver, The Man Who Fell to Earth, Memento, Adaptation, too many to list). Every once and while though it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't have too many levels working at once. One that's focusing on just one thing and it does that one thing very well -MI2 is that kind of movie.
B00005JM02|5.0|Don't think just because it says Disney/Pixar on the cover that the movie is only for kids. Adults will also enjoy the journey of Marlin and Dori searching for Nemo who has been caught by an avid collector of tropical fish. Ellen DeGeneres is hilarious as the voice of Dori, the fish whose memory is nearly non-existent. The movie is visually appealing as well and the humor will make children of all ages laugh.
B000060P79|4.0|Simple Plan's debut CD, &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls,&quot; is no punk or even pop-punk venture, but rather a fun and catchy power pop album. The album's title states a lot about the maturity of the songwriters; much of the content is youthful lamenting of heartbreak, loneliness and boredom. Do not buy this CD if you are expecting anything deeper or more enlightening than what is implied by the title! Juvenile content, catchy vocals and upbeat guitar tunes make this CD good for parties and other light-listening ventures. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone seeking enlightenment or salvation, but if a good sing-along fits your fancy, this CD is worth picking up.<br />Simple Plan writes simple music that sounds good even without being overly complex. Their style is similar to that of Blink 182 and its clones. They focus not on depth but on a catchy melody and solid beat, and the songs on this album you will likely find yourself singing for hours. The music captures a certain youthful energy that much of today's music lacks. Simple Plan achieves well what it set out to do, and that was to create a radio-friendly set of fun songs to which the youth of North America could easily relate. I recommend this CD to anyone who does not consider him or herself punk, as this CD is by no means punk, and seeks a fun album. If that's what you want to hear, Simple Plan truly delivers, and you won't be disappointed.
B00009W0U4|1.0|Just a warning, there is no special effects segment.  There are no deleted scenes, just two music videos and a teaser/trailer segemnt that don't add up to squat.  On the other hand, the film itself is just jaw-dropping.  It's an endurance test.  It's an emotional stranglehold.  It has the balance of being both repulsive and beautiful.  The way the DVD is presented on screen is also unique. Five stars for the film...1 for the misrepresentation of Lion's Gate.
0446677450|3.0|I must admit that I enjoyed reading this book.  The prose is simple but fairly fluid and the financial advice comes off as genuinely enlightening.  As I put the book down I really did feel more capable of becoming rich.  The problem is that I feel the book has some shady morality around the edges which are easy to glaze over.  Are we supposed to simply overlook the fact that &quot;Rich Dad&quot; does everything in his power to keep down the wages of the people working for him?  We are able to sympathize with him because he helps our narrator achieve wild riches, but still, that does not make up for the fact that he has so little compassion for the people upon whom his wealth depends.  &quot;Rich dad&quot; throws in a little bit here and there about charity, but there is obviously something lacking in his concern for his fellow human beings.  <br />The book repeatedly spouts typical conservative doctrine, saying essentially that the poor end up that way because they do not &quot;produce.&quot;  The irony is that the whole point of the book is to assert that the only way to get rich is by owning things (assets which provide income).  <br />If I own a townhouse and sit in my pajamas all day, playing Nintendo gamecube while collecting rent checks and asking my maid for more Nutter Butters, what exactly am I &quot;producing&quot; again?  Or is the point that we should all strive to escape the &quot;rat race&quot; so that we no longer need to &quot;produce&quot; in order to survice?  Isn't that a great goal, to reach a point where we are no longer expected to contribute to society?  Whatever happens to the rest of the 'rats' is up to them, right?  <br />In the end, if you want to get rich I would recommend this book.  I think it would really help.  If you are looking for a coherent, balanced approach to attaining wealth without sacrificing your integrity, this book is going to come up short.  <br />I would be lying if I said I got nothing out of this book.   It was a breezy, interesting read; I just don't feel like reading the rest of the series.  But then again, if the economy keeps going on like this....<br />Kidding!  I'd rather be homeless and starving than treat another human being like merely a machine for making me richer.  But that's just me, another sucker who will probably never get out of the 'rat race.'
B000002NAK|3.0|Francamente es una lastima que en esta grabacion, hecha a mayor gloria de MADONNA, que proporciona una 'Evita' muy bien cantada pero que peca de distante por momentos, se hayan descuidado algunos papeles, como el fundamental 'Che', que aqui esta a cargo de un ANTONIO BANDERAS muy bien el la vertiente psicologica del personaje, pero muy flojo en la parte meramente musical. Lo mismo puede decirse del 'Peron' de JONATHAN PRYCE, que es actor pero no cantante. <BR>Cumple mucho mejor como 'Magaldi' un JIMMY NAIL, que sin tener la fuerza de un tanguero real sabe sacarle partido a su rol. De lujo la 'Amante de Peron' que nos brinda ANDREA CORR (la vocalista de &quot;The Corrs&quot;, que aqui se luce con ganas.) Secundarios y coro cumplen con suficiencia, y algo mejor la orquesta. <BR>Un disco que para los amantes de Madonna puede tener mucha calidad, pero para los amantes del musical es francamente de un nivel de correcta suficiencia, pero es que acaso no se puede hacer nada mejor a dia de hoy con 'Evita' que una version solo correcta?
B000002UAR|2.0|This album is often held out as being such a step forward for the Beatles and rock music, but the energy experienced in A Hard Day's Night and Help are mostly absent in Rubber Soul.  Songs like And Your Bird Can Sing reach back to Beatlemania but songs like Here There and Everywhere and Eleanor Rigby are what resulted in boy bands like the Backstreet Boys (The Shape of My Heart).  Thank goodness the Rolling Stones stayed with rock and roll and Led Zeppelin came along to drive music in a good direction. Once that happened, even the Beatles got back on track with The White Album and Abbey Road.
B000066NW0|1.0|So it's a nice change from bubblegum pop acts such as Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson, but that doesn't make her rock.<br />Sheesh, why do some people say she wrote her own songs? She CO-WRITES. Maybe she did write a lot, but it is very likely she just mumbled some rhyming sentences and other people turned it into a pop hit.<br />Get this: A team of songwriters called 'The Matrix' helped writing. Do you know who else they wrote for? Christina Aguilera and newest teenybopper idol Hilary Duff. I guess this shows how 'different' and 'punk' Avril really is. Of course, if you like these songs that's YOUR taste, but it still doesn't mean they are 'hers' or 'talented'. <br />SHE has absolutely NO talent. She sings awful. I heard (actually, saw) her live on a fansite. Whoa. Makes ya wonder how much of her voice is computerized.<br />Of course this review should be about her songs, not the person herself. I gave it only one lonely star because I think the CD is awful. Sk8er Boi (ugh, the spelling) and Complicated are too overplayed. The other songs bored me, and the lyrics were terrible (which means that even if she DID wrote the most stuff, she still isn't talented)<br />I recommend the following bands: Metallica (early stuff), Nirvana, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Megadeth, Slayer, Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Ramones, The Sisters of Mercy, Siouxie Sioux and the Banshees, Bauhaus, Nightwish, After Forever, :wumpscut:, Velvet Underground, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Judas Priest, Christian Death, Buzzcocks (if you want some real pop-punk), Minor Threat, Misfits, The Exploited, The Unseen, Black Flag, Apoptygma Berzerk, VNV Nation, Kraftwerk, Einstürzende Neubauten, Front 242, Front Line Assembly, Throbbing Gristle, Winterkälte, Project Pitchfork, Kompressor, Hocico, Fiendflug, Skinny Puppy, The Cure, and the Dead Kennedys to name a few.
B000002UB3|2.0|&quot;Not only are the songs excellent, but also the mood of the album is hypnotic.&quot;  Oh, please.  Side one of Abbey Road doesn't flow at all, especially with the goofy Maxwell and Octopuses Garden.  Hypnotic is Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon.  This doesn't come close.<br />Here Comes the Sun very good, but can't save the album. 2-stars.
0385504209|4.0|I loved the Da Vinci Code. Any truly serious biblical scholar has to accept many a premiss put forth therein. If you have read 'New Testament Revelations of Jesus of Nazareth' and/or  'What Happens After You Die' (two books which contain many of the messages received by James Padgett between 1914 and 1923 via automatic writings from Jesus and other Celestial and historical characters,) you will be very at home much of what is written in the Da Vinci Code. The debunking of the Trinity, the Virgin Birth, and Jesus as God was all revealed to James Padgett over 75 years ago by those who were there. Mary Magdalene wrote as did Mary the Mother of Jesus. Jesus himself wrote Padgett of his true mission on earth. As a Christian minister I can happily recommend all the above.
B00005QIPH|5.0|There is one word to describe this CD and that is \\"Chill\\". You can over-analyze their roots to whatever extent you want but at the end of the day what you have is an album full of some of the greatest songs ever. And for all of you who think all the songs sound the same all I have to say is that you clearly haven't TRULY listened to them. There is so much depth to every one of these songs that they never get old.  If your looking for a CD that is great for any mood or everyday than this is it.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Musically, Spears's third record shows her making an attempt to move forward and evolve without abandoning the sound which made her. While for the most part this is not a radical departure from &quot;Oops!&quot;, Britney's baby steps between albums are definitely more apparent when comparing &quot;Britney&quot; with her debut. The result, rather than an album with a clear direction, is one with some tracks which would have sounded at home on either of her previous records. To Britney's credit, these filler tracks are almost as catchy as most of Britney's past singles(save, of course, the now-legendary &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;). Max Martin's most effective dance pop contribution is Britney's independence anthem &quot;Overprotected.&quot; But by far the best music to be found on &quot;Britney&quot; is that which finds her experimenting with new styles, like the Neptunes-produced first single, &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; and its companion, the bass-driven &quot;Boys.&quot; Other standouts include the rock-tinged &quot;Lonely,&quot; the sole ballad &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,&quot; and the complexly-muddled-yet-oddly-spare &quot;What It's Like To Be Me.&quot; In later years, this record will probably be looked on as the bridge between the teenage and adult Britneys, but for now, it's simply one of the most enjoyable pieces of guilty pleasure fluff you'll come across.
0792107683|5.0|What about Best Movie? Best Director? Best Actor (Alan Ladd playing the role of his career as the stranger with a shady past and a golden heart)?  Best Supporting Actor (Heflin, Palance, Meyer, Cook, or even de Wilde)?  This is hands-down one of the top Western/Romance/Friendship/Come-of-Age features of all time.  A near-perfect piece of mythic Americana.<br />Those 'low-down Yankee liars' who cast the ballots for the Oscars...
038572179X|5.0|What an amazing novel.  If you are a fan of well written thought-provoking books this is for you.  This was my favorite book of the year.
0142000663|5.0|I can remember reading this book in high school, and again in college. It is a powerful book, about a time in American history that was among the most difficult we have ever faced. This book is a story of the survival of a family that manages to keep their dignity and spirit; no matter what hardships they must endure. Steinbeck's writing grabs you and draws you into the story of the Joad family, along with a vivid portrait of America. It's a book that once picked up is hard to put down. It has been called one of the greatest novels ever written, and that is an opinion I heartily agree with. No other book that I have read captures this period in America's history better than The Grapes of Wrath. Highly recommended.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is a great musical work!  Brings back the memory of the film. A great cd to wake up to.  Highly recommend this to everyone. This one should win awards!
B00005YW4H|5.0|In a time of over-produced albums and sales based on marketing rather than beauty, Norah Jones's first album is remarkable return the essentials of what makes music so impactful in each of our lives.  This is an album focused on beauty and simple songs that a musician enjoys singing for her own sake.  Thank God that Miss Jones has opened a window for us to her tranquil world to share moments of quiet and contentment.  Come Away With Me is remenicient of the original groundbreakers- Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith, voices who were who they were.  No pretention, little polish, but they were voices who conveyed the depths of the human heart in a way that touches each of us still.  This young lady is putting into practice the lessons taught by the masters without showing off and she lets her words, each note and line speak for itself to us.  Some people need to be told what to listen for or how to listen.  Come Away With Me speaks straight to each of us without pretention, whispers of peaceful days forgotten in todays busy world and and soothes our hurried rush, a reminder of when life was quiet and at ease.
B00005V9HH|5.0|O men where do i beging?<BR>Well first of all its one of my favorites movies, and you have to be careful with this one, cuz a lot of people just say it was too slow at the begining, so they dont finish it. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR get this movie, the plot its incredible, and the actors ufffffff just look what kind of people are in this movie.<BR>im keeping this one short cuz i dont intent to ruin the movie by telling the story and the plot. THE FACT IT THIS &quot;&quot;GREAT MOVIE&quot;&quot; END OF STORY.
B00004XONN|5.0|When this album first came out 3 years ago I read a lot of negetive reviews.  Radiohead had strayed too far from OK Computer.  They had experimented and failed.  They had become self-indulgent and pretentious.  Heeding these warnings, I never bought the album, even though I loved OK Computer and the Bends.  After picking up Amnesiac and Hail to the Thief I finally decided to round out my Radiohead collection with Pablo Honey, and of course, Kid A.  I'm at somewhat of a loss for words.  Kid A is flat out brilliant.  Three years later it still sounds a decade ahead of its time.  The critics and fans who reacted negatively to it were probably just not ready for it.  They wanted what they were used to from Radiohead: big singing, soaring guitars; classic rock for the new millenium.  What they got was an album full of &quot;Climbing up the Walls&quot; on computers.  Sometimes paranoid, sometimes nostalgic, always haunting. <br />The only disappointment here is that Radiohead apparently listened to their critics and never fully explored the path they start on with Kid A.  Sure, Amenesiac and HttT are great albums.  But neither have the dark, fragile beauty that makes Kid A.  I guess what I'm trying to say is this: I've been listening to music for about three quarters of my life, and really loving it for about half. I'd like to think that I've heard a great deal of the popular music of the past decade.  Quite simply, Kid A takes me to a place that no other album ever has.  Take this album, listen to it with an open mind, and let it show you all the things you'd have never seen otherwise.
B000084T18|1.0|This man is the best male vocalist since Frank Sinatra! He sings beautiful songs such as the soaring and optimistic \\"In Da Club\\" which promotes sex and not making love which is the kind of messages our young people need to hear! And who couldn't love the gorgeous ballad \\"21 Questions???\\" Just listen to Cent's precise vibratto and the leghatto flow. Then of course we have PIMP and other terrific pop ditties. I just love positive and optimistic music that preaches the thug life in such wonderful terms to the world's young people so they can get shot up too. :)
B00004XOWM|5.0|i listen to this album again,after i 'v heard their 4th album &quot;Results May Vary&quot;<BR>i still love this album,this is the best Rap Metal album i'v ever heard(despite the lyrics).<br />so many &quot;beautiful&quot; easy-listening but angery songs.almost every track in this album is the kinda that i like,the riff is hard but the melody is &quot;sweet&quot;<BR>LB mixed all the element perfectly together:Guitar,Bass,Drum,DJ and our angry Fred Durst's vocal :)
0060931671|3.0|I was told that this book was a very good intellectual read.  I am someone who had previously struggled through Joyce's Ulysses.  As difficult for me as that book was, this one was a lot tougher to get through.  I am not big on stream-of-consciousness writing and enormous difficulty understanding and following what was happening in this book.  <br />I can see that the book has some good writing.  I am sure that the book is quite good if it is your style.  That is why I am still giving it 3 stars.  It is quite possible that this book is like an IQ test.  Only people with Mensa stats can get what's going on here.   I guess I have not arrived at that level.
B00008EY9G|4.0|As if Psycho weren't enough to scare you off rundown motels in the rain, Identity comes along to drive the point home. This is a solid thriller with a great cast. You'd have to include the storm as a character, since it is the rain that drives ten strangers to a decrepit motel in the desert, and the lightning and drenching water are a constant presence as bodies begin to turn up and tensions heighten. Toward the end there are, of course, two main twists -- one works very well, the other is goofy and predictable, though it doesn't spoil the film. While it wasn't the best thriller I've ever seen, it was not merely a slasher film either -- something I was counting on based on John Cusack's presence -- and when the movie was over I didn't feel ripped off.  I always enjoy Cusack, the rest of the cast was great, the editing was very good, and the premise was quite interesting.<br /><br />Extra features include a director's commentary, a trailer, a featurette, 4 deleted scenes, a (slightly) extended ending, storyboard comparisons and a filmography for some of the cast and crew members. Audio and subtitles are available in English or French.<br /><br />Solid. Creepy. Not for kids.
0679309411|2.0|There is no dispute about it, the book is beautifully written in a very poetic language.  But Roy is terrible at telling the story and portraying characters.  Other than the general image of sadness and tradegy, the book offers nothing more than a superficial exotic shadow.  This is a major Booker disappointment.
B00006690G|5.0|First off, let me say that this cd is awesome. Eminem is THE best rapper out there, with great beats, funny lyrics and terrific production.  The songs are very personal, and my favorites are: White America, Square Dance, Without Me and Hailie's Song.<br /><br />Eminem has had a tough life. So have a lot of people. But what makes him inspirational is that instead of wallowing in victimhood, he worked hard, he didn't give up and he found his voice. I admire this artist for channeling his anger into something creative. Furthermore, even as he criticizes his mother, he says &quot;I'm sorry, mama, I never meant to hurt you&quot; -- this to a woman who was too busy fighting her own demons to be a mother to her talented and intelligent son. (Couldn't she PLEASE just tell him that she screwed up and she's sorry?) Another emotion that comes through, over and over, is his love for his daughter. What's not admirable about that? Also, I don't see half-naked women writhing in Eminem videos. I see intelligence and humor, and this is what I really love about Marshall Mathers. He is very very funny, and more power to him for taking his pain and his anger and creating humor and art. It's easy to perpetuate wickedness, tough to end the cycle of bad parenting and violence, but he seems to be trying.<br /><br />While I can't speak for all librarians, as a group we're against censorship, and I believe that you should never let anyone tell you what to think about music -- or literature or politics or how to run your life, for that matter. If you're not afraid to open your mind, then check out this terrific group of songs, actually listen to them, and then make up your own mind about it.<br /><br />I wish him all the best and hope he finds happiness. He has brought joy to me.
B00009P1O5|3.0|Neil Young again throws a curve ball by following up his acoustic and country album Hawks &amp; Doves with 1981's thrashing Re.ac.tor.  The album, like its predecessor, was universally panned by the critics upon its release. While the album was definitely thrown together as the last album to fulfill his Warner contract, it captures the raw and trashy energy of Crazy Horse.  The songs are clearly just thrown together with little or no lyrical cohesion, but the pure energy and power of the band makes up for any lack of creativity.  The epitome of this is song \\"T-Bone\\" which repeats the same line about mashed potatoes and t-bones over and  over for nine plus minutes.  But despite the inane lyric, the band's crashing and crunching riffs are mesmerizing.  The album's final song \\"Shots\\" is another standout with a riveting and threatening vibe.  For the most part, Re.ac.tor is a hodge-podge of an album and really only for Neil Young aficionados.
B00003CXB4|4.0|This is not my favorite Disney film. While the animation is gorgeous and Nathan Lane is a hoot, the violent themes detract from the story and make it inappropriate for young children -- just the ones who want to see it. I just can't believe that with all the creative minds at Disney the plot they come up with has to include the murder of Simba's father by his uncle, the attempted murder of Simba, and the ultimate death of said uncle as he's ripped apart by hyenas. Gracious, isn't the world violent enough without Disney piling on?!<br /><br />That rant aside, the film is beautiful to look at and hear, and this two-disc special edition gets the royal Disney treatment, with tons of special features including both the extended and theatrical versions of the film; commentary tracks; games; featurettes; and music videos. The film can be heard in English or French with optional English closed captioning.<br /><br />If you love this film, you can't go wrong by adding this special edition to your collection. If you are buying it for young children, let this go for a few years and get a less violent film.
B00000HZHS|5.0|What?  the title's different.  buy this one it kicks ass.
B000002H33|5.0|Purely stated, this is the defining album in heavy metal.  Master of Puppets.  3 words that mean EVERYTHING in the world of metal.  8 tracks of pure genius.  A heavy metal dream.<br />There simply is no metal album of the planet that matches this album top to bottom.  The album's weakest track (Disposable Heroes) is better than the best tracks on 99% of everything else out there.  And there is some real gold on here too...Battery, Master of Puppets, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), and Damage Inc. are simply required listening in the world of heavy metal.<br />It truly is a shame that this is Cliff Burton's last album.  He sure left a mark on the world of metal.  Orion doesn't have a single word in the song, but it is one of the most powerful and emotional pieces ever written.  With that being said, Cliff RIP!<br />GET THIS ALBUM!  SHAME ON YOU IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE IT!
B0000DJZBA|5.0|Yes, we know - Axl Rose will probably still be working on the \\"very long-awaited\\" new Guns' album for years to come; with Guns N' Roses, however, it's just good to have ANYTHING new from them, even if these DVD reissues of \\"USE YOUR ILLUSION I & II: LIVE FROM TOKYO 1992\\" concert films and the '98 video compilation \\"WELCOME TO THE VIDEOS\\" are only new to DVD. I always wanted these clips, and the VHS format is so boring, so it's good to finally have them on DVD. But these three DVD's could have been two in a single slimline jewel case: the two \\"ILLUSION\\" concert videos could have fit on one DVD, and then the \\"WELCOME TO THE VIDEOS\\" on the second DVD.

B000059TPI|5.0|Elwood P. Dowd has always been one of my very favorite creations of the stage and screen. As James Stewart points out in the introduction to this classic film, he was also one of his.<br />  You see, Elwood was a man of the world, with brains, personality, and friends- then he met Harvey. Of course, Harvey didn't really change any of this; Harvey just appeared at the moment Elwood really needed him. You see, Elwood had wrestled with \\"reality\\" for 35 years, and he was glad to say that he finally won out over it. Perhaps Harvey was his reward for winning out on it. Elwood had been \\"oh, so smart\\", and then he had been \\"oh, so pleasant\\"- and he came to find that he greatly recommended pleasant over smart. Perhaps this was why Harvey chose to watch out over him. In any case, Elwood spent the rest of his life visiting bars and taverns, taking the time to listen to all classes of people, inviting them home, taking their minds off of their troubles, introducing them to Harvey.... And Harvey is a very useful being to know, for as Elwood points out, he cannot only overcome Time and Space, but any objections.<br />  What is Harvey you ask? Well, Harvey is a Pooka. A Pooka is a mischievous nature spirit known to be fond of rumpots, crackpots- and how are you Mr. ________?
0385504209|5.0|I am not done with the book yet, but it is the most fascinating, thrilling, book that I have ever read.  I can never put it down, unless it gets to about 1 am in the morning :)<br />The book is so interesting that I never knew anything besides Da Vinci painting the Mona Lisa, The Last Supper and others.  But to find information on the Holy Grail (not sure if it is true), that was a big impact when I read it.<br />I give this book 5 stars.  Because that is what it deserves.  Can not wait til Dan Brown's next adventure of Robert Langdon.
B00005JKC3|4.0|If you are not a fan of the Hulk, or comic books in general, then you probably won't like this movie.  I did like the Hulk comic book as a child and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Many have complained that the beginning was too long and drawn out, but I thought it was nicely paced and provided plenty of background detail.  The performances were good, the writing was good, and yes I liked the use of the split screen to show simultaneous action.  My biggest complaint is that the Hulk animation was not very realistic and they made him a bit too big and over-the-top.  The director, Ang Lee, should have applied the &quot;less is more&quot; principle and showed less Hulk with more partial/distant/limited light shots and brief glimpses much like Steven Spielberg did in Jaws.
0446310786|5.0|I'm not going to go into all the depths of what this book is about, and what it symbolizes.  If your 9th grade English teacher did not make you read this book, or you only read the cliff notes, you must read it.  It is a classic for a reason, and everyone should read it.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|The Strokes have improved upon their already brilliant sound with &quot;Room On Fire,&quot; and by this I mean that each musician is putting out a lot more technically and musically than we heard the first time around on &quot;Is This It&quot;.  <br />The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is due to the fact that I feel they made one mistake; they used the same mixing and effects on \\"Room On Fire\\" as on \\"Is This It\\" (i.e. - distortion/fuzz effects on Casablancas' vocals; tin-pan sound of the drums on some songs, etc.) giving the final polished product a very similar sound.  I thought that was a really impressive and original idea on the first album, but I was hoping they would go for something different on this one.<br />This mix alone, I think, is what's throwing off a lot of the critics out there saying The Strokes have repeated themselves with \\"Room On Fire.\\"  After really listening to the songs, one finds this not to be true.  In fact, it's obvious The Strokes have grown and evolved quite a bit in the last 2 years, which is really amazing given they've been touring the world this entire time.<br />What stands out the most about this album is the song-writing and thoughtful compositioning of all 11 gems.  They keep it simple, but only in the overall product, for there are many little touches and changes throughout each song; they don't weakly repeat verse-chorus-verse, but slip in some tweaks and switch things up just enough to keep it all interesting.  It is so great to hear the Strokes' music because it rocks you, makes you smile, and sends chills up your spine because of the sheer pleasure and ingeniousness of it all.<br />It's great to hear the guitarists exploring more complicated and interesting riffs/solos, and Fab proves he's one of the most tasteful drummers to come around since Bonham and Ringo (yet he really rocks out at times and shows how capable and tight a drummer he is...i.e. - check out the incredibly quick kick drum on 'The Way It Is').  Even Casablancas is trying different phrasing techniques, reaching more soulful highs, and overall gives us much more feeling and gut.  Last but not least I have to rave about the bassist who creates such a warm foundation to the Strokes' music and fulfills his role in the rhythm section nicely with simple yet well thought-out and complimentary bass lines.<br />The Strokes are a smart band and nowhere is this more evident than with the awesome songwriting and arrangements found in \\"Room On Fire.\\"
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Now, I'm not purporting to know very much about punk music, but I do know that I love this CD.  I bought it about a week ago, and it's the first Clash CD I've ever bought.  It was different from anything I'd ever heard and I'll admit it took a little getting used to (this also may be because the album originally came out when I was an infant...) but there's not a single song on the album that I don't like.  My favorite tracks are the title track, Rudie Can't Fail, Hateful, Guns of Brixton (I love how it sounds all sly and dark), Train in Vain, Wrong 'Em Boyo, and The Card Cheat, but like I said, I love all the tracks.<br />And to FredDurstsNumbaOneFan:  BWAAAA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!  Man, that was the funniest negative review I've ever seen.  Like I said I don't know very much about punk music but I do know that Avril Lavigne is NOT PUNK.

B0000C9ZLD|3.0|I so wanted this to be a good album, unfortunately, it's only mediocre. It's really too bad they released this CD at all; I was under the impression they were a rock band. It sounds like their trying to market this to thirteen year old girls. Oh well, the first album was good... go buy that CD.
0671027344|5.0|I thought this book was just really charming, the kind of book that makes one look at life with a new perspective.  The characters are all so different, but they all bring out the best in each other; it's the way a group of friends should be.  Charlie's letters are written with such honesty and grace; he is intelligent and observant, but naive all at once.  I found myself trying to read just a few pages at a time because I did not want it to end.  &quot;I feel infinite&quot; is an absolutely perfect way to put into words the feeling this book evokes.  One of my favorites.
0553277472|4.0|In all probability I never would have picked this book up on my own, but now that I have<BR>I find it hard to put down.  Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was not written<BR>to change the world; it was written by a man who learned to change himself.  This book<BR>was also not written to be a self-help book that gives easy answers.  Most of its answers<BR>aren't that easy to come by; this book has very challenging ideas and concepts that at<BR>times take a great deal of patience and gumption to wade through.  One can't pick it up<BR>expecting a light, easy read.  And as the title itself should imply, it is not for adventure<BR>buffs, romantics, or people who need a lot of character action in their reading.  It is for<BR>those who wish to broaden their views of understanding their world.  I've used quotes<BR>from this book on different occasions in conversation or for school reports.  The things<BR>Robert Pirsig has to say apply to many facets of life, or rather they can apply to as many as<BR>the reader wants them to.  This book can only be read with time and an open mind.  If the<BR>reader has these two qualities, I highly recommend it.
B000002BPS|5.0|Being a MASSIVE fan of the Offspring, I have all their CDS. Everyone goes on about SMASH being the best album. Ok, so that was the one which made them famous, and had all good punk stuff on it- I like Ixnay more! It is loaded with goodies from the fast punk &quot;Mota&quot;, to the ska-punk &quot;Don't Pick it up&quot;, and then there is the slow, tear-jerking &quot;Gone away&quot;, plus loads of different songs to keep you listening! Also, after the last track wait a while for the &quot;kiss my ass&quot; stuff- it rocks! Basically buy it if you love punk!
076790592X|3.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is a simple book with a simple message for life.  It is a brief novel with an unembellished style of writing, but just the same Morrie is a person whose words<BR>resonate in the mind.  Many people have read Tuesdays With Morrie, and will continue to read it over time.  Each person who reads it will find his/her own meaning in Morrie's revelations on life.  The book is played out like a teacher's lesson plan, and that is exactly how Morrie and the author, Mitch Albom, intended it to be.  The lessons are easy to<BR>understand but important and relevant to all people and areas of life.  These lessons are gentle in tone, and the frightening subject of death is in this way put on easier grounds to read about.  However, the lessons do at times seem to repeat themselves, finding different ways to say the same thing that was said only a chapter before.  This repetitive nature makes the book at times seem all too much like a lesson in school.  And it is often easy to fall asleep in school.  However, heart and soul were put into the creation of this book; parts of both Mitch Albom and his professor Morrie Schwartz reside within its pages.  And for that Tuesdays With Morrie is a commendable read.
0671027344|2.0|Personally, I was disappointed. Based on the great reviews this book is getting on Amazon, I assumed it would have a lot to offer. I found Charlie flat and somewhat one-dimentional. Chbosky's attempts to build a character based on lists of his favouriute books and songs just don't cut it for me. Nor did the ending evoke any feelings of pathos- I found it to be a cheap trick by the writer to try and make his story moving and touching with the ending he wrote for TPOBAW. I will credit him that the letter-format added a personal touch but this was annihilated because I could not become close to a character when all the time the protagonist showed through so clearly Chbosky's attempts to build him into something deep, causing him to come across as shallow -quite the opposite.<BR>I'm sure this book does have something to offer because so many reviewers have raved about it but in my opinion this book left me empty and dissatisfied.
B000002E5J|5.0|This is probably the second best album by Shakira. It sounds fresh and fine. English songs are also good, but not so naturally simple and moving.

Shakira is my favorite spanish singer. First I recommend to buy Donde Estan Los Ledrones?

If you are a big Shakira fan, try this one.
B00003CY6M|4.0|John Cusack and Jeremy Piven go way back as childhood acting buddies in Evanston, Illinois.  Any time they appear in a movie together it's worth a look.  Check out 'Grosse Pointe Blank,' 'Runaway Jury,' plus Piven bit parts in early Cusack films like 'The Grifters,' 'The Player' and Cusack/Crowe classic 'Say Anything.'  Here in 'Serendipity,' their buddy schtick is in top form.<br />Also worth noting: Kate Beckinsale, who can't possibly look as good ever again as she does in this film.  Except in this one out-of-place scene where - trapped in a rainstorm - she unsuccessfully tries to light up a cigarette.  In the theater I saw this in, the audience literally groaned with disgust and disappointment.  I'm not sure if director Peter Chelsom got hoodwinked into some bizarre product placement here, but it was a completely offputting moment that upset the momentum of the film a great deal.<br />A second 'also worth noting': Cusack's erstwhile fiance&eacute; is played by Bridget Moynahan, who is also known for playing Mr. Big's fiance&eacute; in early 'Sex and the City' storylines.  [She's the one who Carrie nicknames 'the idiot stick figure with no soul.']  Meanwhile, Beckinsale's erstwhile fiancee is played by John Corbett, who - coincidentally enough - became Carrie's fianc&eacute; Aidan in another 'Sex' story arc.<br />Will it go round in circles...

B000002H70|5.0|The genius of Robert Smith is that he takes incredibly simple melodic lines, ones that are maybe too simple. By themselves, they'd be almost childish. But he layers them, one after another, until what results is a sensation not unlike wave after wave of water of alternating temperature. On good headphones, the songs on \\"Disintegration\\" allow for multiple levels of complexity. Each layer is opaque, as well; you can hear through each one, and catch a glimpse of another beneath it. <br />This may well be the best Cure album, in terms of execution. Robert Smith has said that what he wants to create are moods; on \\"Disintegration,\\" he creates a dusky, rainy, dimly-lit place filled with moving melodic lines, distorted guitars and propulsive bass. While the lyrics tell the tale of the album's title, the music is tightly-structured. An atmospheric masterpiece.

Pirsig's journey may remind some of A Beautiful Mind -  a genius trapped within and by his own analytical mind and thoughts.  <BR>For me, this book gave me permission (as if I needed any) to care, to find passion in the task at hand, and to pursue quality in all things.   A wonderful and inspiring book.

B00008J4P5|4.0|I missed the boat on the first couple of White Stripes CDs and was fully prepared to hate them when I bought ELEPHANT--talk about a boatload of hype being forced down down your throat by Rolling Stone and every other out-of-touch music rag--but after four straight days of listening to ELEPHANT at top volume, I am here to say that the White Stripes have got it going on.<br />&quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; is getting the airplay, but the whole album rocks. Kind of like Sweet meets Smashing Pumpkins, with Guns &amp; Roses and the Spiders from Mars playing backup. I mean, they ROCK. There is a lot mure THUMP! to the White Stripes than your typical 21st century band; they appreciate big guitars and are a thousand times more creative than anyone else going right now.<br />As far as I'm concerned &quot;Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine&quot; is thE Rock song of 2003, an absolute ass-kicker with some of the best singing I've heard by a guy on a Rock record since Kurt Cobain fled the scene. Jack White also plays guitar like Mick Ronson, and you can't beat that.<br />The shortcoming of the White Stripes, as with a million other bands, is that they can't be hard and soft on the same LP. The lighter stuff here--and there isn't much--sounds forced, contrived. If the Stones, Beatles, Zep, Who, and other classic Rockers can point to one thing that sets them above most of the other bands that have attempted the crown since then, it is that they could play both sides of the coin--the Stones had &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; and &quot;Angie,&quot; the Who had &quot;Love Ain't For Keeping&quot; on the same LP as &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again.&quot;<br />Jack White comes really close on &quot;I Want to Be The Boy...&quot;, and Meg White attempts some kind of subtlety on &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night,&quot; but it really just sounds like one of those blank-generation Goth things Concrete Blonde used to do. There comes a point when a singer needs to put across something deeper; when the White Stripes get to that point they will be a truly great band. I suppose the secret may be to keep Meg behind the drum kit while Jack stretches his vocal chops.hite Stripes get to that point they will be a truly great band.

B00005BL2A|5.0|It always takes awhile to get into the music, but this album has really grown on me. All of the songs have their own special quality, but the ones that stand out for me are \\"Shine\\", \\"When the Body Speaks\\" and \\"I Am You.\\" As always, Martin's lyrics are dark (in a good way), profound, and thought-provoking. Simply put and poetic! Classic lyrics! I know this review might seem vague, but the bottom line is this is a BEAUTIFUL album for anyone who appreciates deep, introspective songs and music. Depeche Mode still has it's trademark edge and grit on some of these songs, but the ballads are very beautiful and touching without being sugary. Something about them tugs at the heartstrings and makes you think of love in a more meaningful, passionate way. I don't think there are any love songs that are as expressive as Depeche Mode's are. There are many sides to Depeche Mode, and this album further proves that. This album is a must-have for any DM fan!
B0000AM6K2|3.0|I love the sound of \\"1972\\", and I'm OK with Rouse's soft vocal delivery. The dorkiness of the second tune, \\"Love Vibration,\\" and its backing vocals, I can get past.<br />But the inclusion of the second, \\"bonus\\" disc--really just a bunch of self-serving clips to play on your PC--and the additonal cost it ads to the price of the CD, combined with the pretentiousness of Rouse's lyrics keep me from really enjoying \\"1972.\\"<br />Here's Rouse's idea of an oh-so-sexy, good lovin' tonight line, from the song \\"Under Your Charms\\": \\"It's the end of the night and I'm feeling sexual. Can I get some love back that you concealed?\\"<br />Makes you nauseous, doesn't it? Try this one on for size: \\"Is it just a love task, or do you feel it?\\"<br />Yech. Most of the record sounds good, but you have to find a way to listen to it without noticing that the lyrics appear to have been lifted directly out of a highschool sophomore's notebook. I keep waiting for Rouse to sing \\"Two good two B Fourgotten\\" or tell me to party hardy all summer long. The word juvenile doesn't begin to cover it.<br />There are a couple of gems here, though, including the title song and the great \\"Flight Attendent,\\" though Rouse should thank his lucky stars that Lorne Michaels hasn't sued him for plagerizing Saturday Night Live's closing music for the song's coda.<br />I've heard \\"1972\\" described as sounding like the Beach Boys or even Carole King, and there is something to those comparisons, but I really think the arrangements come closer to an old Glen Campbell record, minus the lower E-string guitar solos.
B0000DBJDM|3.0|Firstly I'd like to say that the original Pompeii is on here and that is the only reason to buy this DVD. The new directors cut is garbage. It has computerized fly throughs of Pompeii that wouldn't make it  on the History channel, as well as new shots of Pompeii and other stock footage that really has no place in this classic Floyd concert film.  The only thing of interest in the new version is the black and white interveiws from France. But these should have been added as extras on the DVD. Adrian Maben has totally ruined the flow of this film. <br />The extras are weak at best and the interveiw with Maben is of little interest to anyone but perhaps this never-was's mother.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|It doesn't matter how Beatles CD's are issued and re-issued, not everyone is going to be happy and compiling Beatles CD's based on a certain criteria is always fraught with danger. Hence  the rather large amount of quibbling over the contents of \\"1\\".  Me, I don't have any problem with this CD...27 #1's on a single CD is a phenomenal effort (eclipsed in number only (but not content) by the Elvis equivalent). <BR>The content itself was (mostly) the soundtrack to my life. The Beatles had a huge influence on mine and so many other lives. The MILLION SELLING hits are all here. Yeah, \\"Please, Please Me\\" & \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" are notable exceptions which is unfortunate. But  \\"She Loves You\\", \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", \\"We Can Work It Out\\", \\"Ticket To Ride\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"Get Back\\", \\"Something\\" are all here. All of these are key signposts to the Beatles massively prolific, successful & influential career. <BR>As one reviewer put it, the only real way to do justice to the Beatles is to buy the whole collection which is available as a boxed set (see my review of that). There you'll really hear the band's progression and inventiveness.   However the development of their style on this CD shows a band that didn't stand still..they were real trend setters during a rather exciting period in music history. In the meantime, if you just want the hits, then this is the CD to get, all 80 minutes of it. If you want something slightly broader, go to the \\"1962-66\\" (Red) & \\"1967-70\\" (Blue) double CD's. Just don't complain about the length and price of the Red one. <BR>In the meantime ENJOY!!!

B00005JKJA|5.0|I have a somewhat conflicting interpretation of the story - I wonder if I overlooked something that one of you could point out.<BR>At the end of the film I had the impression that Camilla did survive the accident very badly burnt and that &quot;the face&quot; behind Winky's is hers (consider that she has the blue box). The plot has a real strand and a dreamlike strand. The former are the attempted murder, the accident, and the scenes at Winky's. The latter are ramblings of Camilla's mind as she is trying to make sense of the accident while her memory is partially coming back. She is confused about her identity and sees everything from Diane's perspective. The &quot;coming back&quot; is reflected in her gradual realization that the roles of Diane and Camilla in the &quot;dream&quot; are reversed. Camilla is initially the protege and Diane is in control, but we later find out that it was the other way around: Camilla, the star, used Diane, the commonplace debutante, and then dropped her. In her recollections, Camilla gets to the point where she wakes up in the night and begins to realize it's all wrong somehow. Then the movie tells who Diane really was and how she brought about the accident. The story ends with the opening scenes: Camilla has not recovered her identity, the hitman continues to look for her (he asks the Winky's waitress to keep her eyes open for anyone new in the neighborhood). The young man with the visions of &quot;the face&quot; sees her ...
B000002KB8|4.0|I like this album, because this album had started the magic of metal. The 5 tracks on this album are great. &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; sounds great from the many live versions I've heard. Kinda spooky but it's nice. &quot;The Wizard&quot; nice harmonica in the beginning, but new listners won't be attracted to this song unlike the old metal listners. &quot;Wasp/Behind The Wall Of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B&quot; beautiful medley and enjoyable, but things gets cooler when N.I.B kicks to make this track my personal favorite on the album. &quot;Wicked World&quot; it's not bad and it's not good; kinda in the middle of the mood. Finally, &quot;A Bit Of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning&quot; cool medley, but I prefer on track 3. This one is too long and parts it gets boring. Liked how it started and how it end.<br />All in all, nice try by the Gods of Metal Black Sabbath to introduce to the world something called Metal Music.
B000092Q4U|4.0|I myself am not a terribly huge fan of death metal screaming, not to say this band is true death metal. When I first heard the lead single &quot;Ruin&quot; I was disinterested to say the least. However I did have to give amazing props to the singer's screaming. Incredible. The song was okay, but then out of nowhere...BAM! A harmonic guitar solo the likes of which havn't been played in quite sometime. After which I started getting into it a little more. And then about three minutes into the song it kicks into an old school 80's style thrash section reminescent of Pantera and Kill Em All era Metallica. I say that even if your not a fan of nothing but screaming give this CD a shot. you might be surprised.<br />And also, as one of many who went into buying Metallica's St. Anger with high expectations I would just like to say that I am completely pissed that I wasted $20 on that piece of crap. i bought it the day it came out and have not listened to it once. All it took was 10 seconds of each song to realize what crap it was. As a drummer, I was pissed. As a fan, disappointed. And as a music admirer, completely stupified. Even though this has very little to do with Lamb of God, just trust me and buy this over St Anger. As a matter of opinion, this is better than any post Black Album Metallica. Sorry to rant, but hey I'm just saying what we're all thinking. Maybe James and Kirk will read this and think again before using Bob Rock. Oh yeah, bring back Jason Newstead.
0446310786|5.0|I was curious how a few years might change the perspective I had on this book from the first time I read it, in grade 10. Indeed, I think I have benefitted from having a more grown-up view to this material, given how much weight it carries, even if the story is told from the point of view of a youth.<br />&quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; tells the story of an Alabama family, the Finch's, who get caught up a racial battle in their small town as Atticus, a father and widower, defends a black man against the charge of rape. The story is told rather wonderfully from the point of view of Scout, a naive and hot-headed young girl with a nose for a fight, who wanders among many stories, from the eccentric Radleys, to playground fights, to wondering why her father continues to defend that man everyone seems so intent on lynching.<br />&quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is a wonderful story. It's sweet and poignant and principled without ever being schmaltzy or loaded with sentiment. Among the strongest points, in my opinion, are the little conversations Atticus has with others explaining why he's doing what he's doing, the court sequences, and the subplot with Arthur Radley. There is a pervasive theme of not judging others before getting to know them which is a lasting, timeless message.<br />Recommended to everyone.<br />Matthew D. Johnston
B000002KFJ|5.0|This cd is so awesome, thanks largely to songs like, &quot;Hole in the sky,&quot; &quot;Symptom of the universe&quot;, and my favorite Sabbath song ever - &quot;Megalomania.&quot; When the fast part of the song kicks in at about 3:30, you have to listen to the rest; the riff kind of sounds like cat scratch fever, but it's different. Buy this cd.
B000060P79|1.0|Okay, if youre going to name an album that has inuendos about the male genitalia (or even the slang of a blatantly honest disposition), make sure your music backs up the statement. Simple Plan is nothing more than a band that made it famous due to good timing.Over the years, Canada has popped out so many...\\"rock\\" stars, that I'm surprised most of America's youth hasn't seen through the hype. <BR>    Anyway, one listen of the album shows that this CD has boy-band lyrics to barely exceptional guitar riffs. I'm just curious to why thier first single \\"I'm Just a Kid\\" was written by \\"kids\\" that are pushing 30. \\"I'd Do Anything\\" is an example of the boy-band lyrics to crappy guitar riffs. \\"Addicted\\" is the whiny-est song I've ever heard. \\"When I'm With You\\" probably sucked away the [anatomy]mentioned in the album's title. Oh, how about they show everyone how 'Punk' they are by making a song called \\"God Must Hate Me\\" (and I'm sure he does). I don't recommend this album to anyone.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie has been one of the best books I've ever read. I love to read about life and how people sometimes do not<BR>realize they are alive. This book will make you feel very fortunate that you have the opportunity to live life. A never ending cycle....
B00000099Y|5.0|This CD will always be a CD I never get sick of. Aenima is one of (if not THE) greatest albums ever made. \\"Eulogy\\" is deep and intelligent and \\"Jimmy\\" has complex lyrics that one would think about. \\"StinkFist\\" is among my favorite songs on the CD. \\"Hooker With a Penis\\" was the very first song I ever heard by TOOL, and still, I love it. \\"H\\" was a great track too. Yeah, I know that \\"Intermission\\" sounds like ICP, but I like ICP! This was deffinitely in the top 3 of my favorite tracks on the record. \\"Third Eye\\" was good, but come on! 13 minutes?!?! Needless to say, my definite favorite song on the album was \\"Aenima\\". This song is one reason you need to buy this album. Listen to it and you'll see why. The rest of them, are really good. You might not like them at first, but they'll grow on you. I can guarantee it...
B00000HYXB|4.0|This being the 2nd album I've purchased from BG after Night at the Opera, I definitely thought that while it didn't match up to NATO, it still faired very well on its own. I also heard that this is the first album BG truly went full on in their new direction of music; by that I mean that this has more of an epic fantasy harmonic sound and less of the thrash power metal influence (like on the Somewhere Far Beyond album, which I'm still in the middle of listening to so i'll put up a review soon). <BR>This is a concept record based on one of JRR Tolkiens novels (i forget the name) so every few tracks there is an interlude of dialouge or sound effects which progress the story further as do the song lyrics. A very creative idea and BG pulls it off very well. <BR>Anyways, on to the music. I thought the majority of songs on this were definitely very good, but just didn't have that magic that made NATO so amazing. I guess it might've taken BG a little more time to really master their new sound. There isn't one BAD song on the album, although every now and then you might find yourself skipping through a few, but just a few. It could be due to some songs which feature verses that drag at few moments and a song or two that don't sound too inspirational, but what I've learned about BG thus far is that you CANNOT just listen to it once and judge by that. Their music just has so much to pick out and discover you really need at least 2 or 3 listens to know what you're talking about. What I love most about these guys are they way they sing, mostly the chorus's; they layer voices upon each other to give this choir effect that just makes each song so epic and inspirational, only BG could create such spendid harmony. I was deciding for a little while whether to give this 3.5 or 4 stars, but I went with 4 just because this IS Blind Guardian and they are one of the best power metal bands in the world.<BR>Overall, I might just have been spoiled by NATO and was just expecting something equally as good, which could by why I'm not drueling over this as everyone else on this webpage is. So this just comes off at me as just another good album, but nothing extravagant. I definitely recommend a purchase but a higher recommendation must go to Night at the Opera. I would like to start listening to some old BG just to contrast the different styles of music.
B00005JLYW|2.0|I am a huge fan of the first Charlies Angels. It was funny, exciting, clever, and Drew, Lucy, and Cameron were hilarious. However, what made the first film so much fun is completely gone in the second and it gets old real quick. The slow motion special effects, the constant giggling between the 3 girls, and the lame jokes all get annoying. Theres barely a plot, and the film just moves from one fight scene to another, so after about 20 minutes, I lost interest. Demi Moore is the only thing the film has going for it. She is evil and sexy, but is underused. I recommend seeing this film for Demi Moore only.
B0000BHI26|5.0|If you like hardcore, in your face metal, that isn't played on MTV or KROQ, than this is an album for you.
B00000273M|5.0|Michael Steele, Susanna Hoofs, and Debbi and Vicki Peterson make up Bangles, one of the best musical acts to come from the '80s.  With hits such as &quot;Manic Monday,&quot; &quot;Hazy Shade of Winter,&quot; &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian,&quot; and many others, their '60s-influenced style and great vocals made them a stand-out group.<br />This album showcases some of their best work.  They covered many styles, such as the rock influenced cover of Simon and Garfunkel's &quot;Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; to the more romantic touches of &quot;Manic Monday&quot; and &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; to pop rock with &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot; and &quot;In Your Room.&quot;  Some of their best work is from their first album &quot;All Over the Place&quot; and is represented by &quot;Hero Takes a Fall&quot; and &quot;Going Down To Liverpool.&quot;<br />This is one great album and is a must-have for fans of the '80s and of Bangles.
B00005JLT5|2.0|I realize it is fashionable to rave about this film, but I found it dull.  It is well acted and well photographed, but the Brody character is just not very interesting.  This guy escapes the holocaust through the efforts of a series of other people, does very little to help himself other than scrounge for food, does essentially nothing to save others and shows little gratitude towards the people who help him.  There are seemingly endless scenes of Brody sleeping or staring out a window.  This is a yawner.  There must be a lot of politics behind all the awards this film got.
B00005JLYW|3.0|I enjoyed the first Charlie's Angels movie.  It had some good laughs and the fight sequences were so well done, it didn't matter that the plot was non-existant.  Unfortunately, everything that worked in the first movie is hardly used in &quot;Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle&quot;<br />   The biggest problem is Demi Moore... or rather, THE COMPLETE LACK OF DEMI MOORE!!  After months of advertising this movie as Demi's big comeback and hyping how Demi would play an Angel gone bad, Demi only appears for about 7 minutes of screen time.  Despite that it was told in advance that Demi was the villain, the movie is played as a whodunit, where Demi doesn't even appear until towards the end (except for a brief cameo on the beach).  Even worse, her character is poorly written, and the interesting idea of an &quot;Evil Angel&quot; is completely misused.  The only saving grace is Demi Moore herself, who is such a great actress, her performance alone makes you care about her and distracts you from how awful her dialogue is. <br />   Another baffling decision is the lack of martial arts sequences.  While the first movie was packed with great Angel fighting, this movie only has two fight scenes.  One in a warehouse that is shot rather poorly and nowhere near as good as what we saw in the first movie.  The second one is at the end, and ends way too quickly.  Instead of fight sequences, this time the director went with vehicle chases instead, which are not well-filmed or exciting at all.  (A certain dirtbike sequence especially seems to drag on forever.)<br />   Also, the movie is stuffed with lame subplots.  If you think it's not at all funny when Alex's (Lucy Lui) father (John Cleese) thinks his daughter is working as a prostitute, just wait for the almost sickening moment when the father APPROVES of his daughter being a prostitute... &quot;as long as it makes her happy&quot;.  Natalie (Cameron Diaz) doesn't fare much better, with a drawn-out subplot involving her boyfriend that fizzles to a unsatisfying ending.  Instead of going off in these directions, the movie should have used this time to delve more into Madison Lee's (Demi Moore) character.  And don't get me started on Bernie Mac, who's talent is wasted as much in this movie as Bill Murray's was in the first one.  Speaking of underused characters, why is The Thin Man (Crispin Glover) even in this movie???  The Thin Man has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot, and after being a villain in &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot;, now he's suddenly a good guy.  It feels as if the Thin Man was only thrown in for the audience to go, &quot;Cool, that's the guy from the first movie&quot;!   Only Dylan (Drew Barrymore) is spared, as her subplot involving an abusive ex-boyfriend is effective enough to give her more depth<br />   Still, the movie isn't a total waste.  The acting is actually very good.  Demi Moore wasn't given much screen time but made the most of what she had to work with.  Also, all three angels were well-played, especially Drew Barrymore, who I truly think is one of the most under-rated actresses in Hollywood.  Drew makes you feel for her character.  Justin Theroux also comes through with a truly frighting performance as Drew's violent ex.  And for every 10 jokes that don't work, there is one that actually does.  So if you lower your expectations enough, you just may find yourself enjoying this movie...
B000067CPX|5.0|If you want your favorite band to record the same album over and over for 20 years, then you are probably narrow-minded and like being bored. But if you appreciate artistry and talent, and applaud your favorite band when they reach out a little, mature and create something beautiful, then this is the album for you. Just because something is well-crafted and harmonic, full of feeling and introspective, does not mean that they are stupid sell-outs. I am a different person than I was 20 years ago (when I used to listen to heavy metal), and I assume the Chili Peppers are different as well. Tastes change, people mature, and they have different things to say than they did when they were 20. This is what is happening with the Peppers, and I'm glad they're sharing it with us.
0446677450|5.0|I loved this book. It really changes your perspective on the way money works and it allows you to take control and make money work for you. I know it's changed my plans for the future, it might change yours as well. As I said in the title, this is a must read since everyone would like to be financially successful and be able to retire young if they wanted.
B000002LAC|5.0|If ever there was perfection in ensemble vocals, it is in the recording TRIO, which finds Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton, and Linda Ronstadt throwing off the shackles of stardom and creating an overall sound that completely transcends their individual sounds.  On this recording, decisions have been made more on the basis of vocal suitability rather than on star power, with the opening \\"The Pain of Loving You\\" a case in point.  Originally written by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagner, this would seem an obvious selection for a Parton lead vocal--but here the lead is supplied by Emmylou Harris, with Parton and Ronstadt providing flawlessly blended backups that avoid overshadowing Harris' less authoritative singing style.<br /><br />Throughout the recording, the artists play a sort of musical round robin, each taking the lead in turn and each serving the other vocalists with perfectly placed support--with no one artist overshadowing the other, all three speaking with the same musical intent.  It is a truly remarkable accomplishment made all the more so through its complete simplicity: there are no complex vocal arrangements, no fussy instrumentals, no studio tricks.  This is musicianship pure and simple and flawless in execution.<br /><br />After a memorable \\"Making Plans,\\" on which Parton assumes the lead, the ladies move into what is possibly their single most remarkable cut: a country-tinged version of the memorable 1950s pop hit \\"To Know Him Is To Love Him,\\" in which their voices blend and merge to such a degree that it becomes impossible to say which vocalist has assumed the dominate role in the production.  Linda Ronstadt comes to the fore with the 1930s Jimmy Rogers tune \\"Hobo's Meditation\\" and a remarkably powerful \\"Telling Me Lies\\" and \\"I've Had Enough;\\" Parton provides understated and lovely leads on the self-authored \\"Wildflowers,\\" the slightly bluesy \\"These Memories,\\" and the traditional \\"Rosewood Casket;\\" and Emmylou Harris gives a remarkable beautiful lead on the haunting \\"My Dear Companion.\\"<br /><br />While it is extremely difficult to select a favorite from this recording, if pressed I would give my favorite as the closing \\"Farther Along,\\" a traditional country gospel tune that features each of the ladies in turn to truly remarkable effect.  But it is all good.  TRIO is goose-flesh music: so perfectly done that each selection in turn makes the hair stand on the back of your neck.  You'll not find finer music this side of heaven, and if the angels really do sing in paradise, this is the sound they make.  A truly rapturous, miraculous recording that deserves much greater recognition than it has to date received; strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon ReviewerDear Companion.\\"    While it is extremely difficult to select a favorite from this recording, if pressed I would give my favorite as the closing \\"Farther Along,\\" a traditional country gospel tune that features each of the ladies in turn to truly remarkable effect.

B00005YUNY|4.0|These guys are clearly awesome, but this DVD is only &quot;very good,&quot; as opposed to &quot;great!&quot;<br />The song selection could be better, and the 5.1 seperation is not all it could be.  Some DVDs have the ability to transport the viewer to the show and make him/her feel as if he/she's right there in the front row.  This is a well-direced video which may have created such effect, but for some stupid logo which kept appearing in the lower left hand corner of the screen.  That was a bit of a mood-buster.<br />All in all, though, most viewers will not be disappointed with this DVD.
B0000524CY|5.0|This is a film that goes way beyond the horror genre for which  it has been labeled with so many other monster movie offerings.  It is an exploration of faith, a complex struggle of good versus evil that stems from the conflicts that are present in each of our lives, combined with a theology lesson and the belief in something greater than ourselves.  Ultimately, it is an exploration of the worst kind of horror, the horror that exists in the belief that for every good, there is an evil, and to that end, that even the ultimate good has an ultimate darkness lieing in its shadow.<br />This film, based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, and directed by William Friedkin, is the story of two priests and a family living in Georgetown University, just outside Washington D.C.  Blatty, who wrote the novel and screenplay, based the story of a child's possession by the devil on actual events that he had read about many years before writing the Exorcist.  <br />The story begins with an elderly priest, Father Merrin, who is working as a missionary in Iraq.  A former exorcist, Merrin is confronted by a vision of the demon and is given a premonition of events that will unfold later.<br />The story continues in counterpoint, introducing us to Father Damien Karras, a young, Italian priest whose mother is dieing of poverty.  A student at Georgetown University, and the psychiatrist on the staff of Saint Michaels, Karras's faith is shaken when his mother dies while in the custody of a sanitarium for the poor and impoverished.<br />The other half of this counterpoint is the story of Regan, daughter of movie-star Chris MacNeil, who is at Georgetown University filming a student-rights movie.  They rent a home on the campus, and while they live there, Regan begins to refer to an invisible friend who she refers to as &quot;Captain Howdy&quot;.  As the story progresses, Regans disposition begins to change.  She starts complaining of headaches, and has outbursts that are completely uncharacteristic of her, and before long, all that see her begin to believe she is either medically insane, or possessed.<br />Chris MacNeil implores the help of Father Karras to aid her in exorcising her daughter.  Uncertain what to do, Karras turns to the head of his order and seeks the assistance of Merrin, who has since returned from Iraq.<br />The story works on a number of levels.  The visual experience of the film is horrifying, as Regan is transformed from an innocent little girl into the demon that possesses her.  The film is dark, graphic and often very disturbing in its imagery.  But what makes this film far more frightening than the visual images is the psychological effect it has on its viewer.  This movie transcends the screen, and plays out like a literary work, giving incredible depth to each of its characters, making them very believable and easy to relate to.  <br />By the end of the story, the movie examines everything from the power of faith, to the power of darkness, and leave the viewer with an experience that will effect them to their very soul.<br />The DVD edition of this film contains many extras, including interviews with the director of the film and the author of the original novel (who himself was a Georgetown student).  It also contains footage that has never been seen in earlier releases of this work.  The film is controversal, and still one of the most disturbing pieces of all time.  It is an important film, and not one to be taken lightly.  <br />Scott Kolecki
B0000AQZYM|5.0|I still remember going to the theaters with my dad when I was 7 and sitting on his lap and giggling at toy story while a snow storm raged outside. Now, I'm too big to sit on his lap, but we still go to see the Pixar movies. They're classic with a modern twist. With their 5th installment of their timeless saga and \\"The Incredibles\\" coming next year, Pixar just seems to be getting better and better! I'm almost 15 now and I was laughing at some of the same jokes as my little sister that saw it with me. It's really cute and amusing. The characters are REALLY lovable and you feel really empathetic towards them. It's also really suspenseful and the animation is remarkable! Other reviewers have said they didn't like the short, but I thought it was really creative and well-done considering it was done over a decade ago! Nemo is the story of a fish trying to prove himself to his overprotective dad and finding out the hard way that you always pay the price for stepping out of line when he's sent off to live in a dentist's office in Sydney. There, he meets possibly the most eccentric characters you'll see in a Pixar film. They let him join their ranks as they desperately try to hatch an escape plan before the dentist gives the little fish to his niece who is known for not being so nice to her fish... (x_x) Meanwhile, his freaked out father scours the ocean floor with a dim-witted fish named Dory, desperately trying to secure info on his whereabouts while running into surfer turtles, organized sharks, and some other \\"interesting\\" fishy fellas. The ending will leave you with a warm feeling inside and it's meant to be shared with the whole family. I highly recommend it for any Pixar fans or any movie-goers at all. This is one of those films that belongs in your collection.
0066620996|4.0|This book has one flaw, the author's definition of &quot;Great&quot; is not what many people would think is &quot;Great&quot;. For example, companies like Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, and GE does not qualify as being &quot;Great&quot; in the author's opinion. If you can agree with that, then this book is GREAT!, but if you think the author is little flawed in leaving out the most profitable and fastest growing companies from his list of &quot;Great&quot; companies, then this book is merely Good.

B0000931QR|4.0|This guys nailed it. Since Mecano no one in Spain was able to master the formula of doing simple, cool and different pop. With obvious references to the 80's Mecano in voice and in some cases musical style, &quot;la oreja&quot; manage to be an all around excellent CD. Not just one song but a full track list of memorable pop in spanish, with even surprising good lyrics.<br />Is good to know that Spain is not only exporting reality show formulaic singers but also a creative and powerful pop bands.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This cd is great and should be added to anybody's collection and has held up pretty well over the years.  As for Fred Dursts nummber 1 fan or whatever the hell you call yourself you obviously have no taste in music at all. Bands like Good Charlotte are just bands created by MTV to make money in other words total crap.  Am I correct in hearing you say that &quot;The Clash also wasn't on TRL which isn't a good sign.&quot;  Well I don't know if you noticed but this was recorded in 1979 which is before MTV even started.  And calling Good Charlotte better than the Clash should be a sin.  Well anyway this cd is for anyone who has good taste in music so BUY, BUY, BUY.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Words can not define how bad this movie was...  I wasted my time watching it, and my money to buy the DVD.  If it were possible, I wouldn't even give this movie a single star.  The CGI looked like something you'd expect to see in Gumby, the fights looked like something out of 'Darrin's Dance Grooves', and the plot was stupid at best.  I expect that the only people who 'enjoyed' this movie were the die-hard Matrix fans who would give it 5 stars even if it was B&amp;W with Arabic audio and Greek subtitles.  If you want to get the same amount of pleasure you could expect to get from this video, while at the same time saving a few bucks, find a nice wall and stare at it for 2 hours.
0754043355|4.0|Not the most life changing of books but certainly worth a read (slightly gritty, if anything a little strange). Its perhaps the honesty of the book and the main characters feelings or lack of feelings towards the purpose of her life that makes it quite a harsh read but one with great meaning behind it. I didn't find my self sympathising with the characters trouble but instead I found my self willing her on to rediscover and appreciate her life once again. Certainly a book that gets you thinking, some interesting points are made. Definitely a clever idea to the story, one undoubtedly film worthy. If you liked the craziness of Girl interrupted then this books for you.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I had pretty low expectations when I bought this album, but was completely blown away.  I was a big Maiden fan in the eighties but went off them around the time seventh son was released.  <br />Anyway, I thought I would give it a go and I was hooked from the first song.  I would rate this album as a must have for any Iron Maiden fan.

B000002UA0|5.0|I put this Floyd CD into my player. By the time Track 3 started, wonderful flashes and flushes of repeating hot and cold flashed through my mind. Once my girlfriend's 10 foot head got out of my view, and after she saw that I was doing fine, I saw my apartment like it was a completely different world. First thing I looked at was the acoustic ceiling and it appeared of wonderful dots of pastel green and pastel maroon on a white background. The dots were in constant motion but mainly moving medium speed to slower speed while occasionally temporarily stopping while becoming fuzzy then moving again (the effect of flowing syrup down a slope, then changing the slope another direction). Occasionally the colored dots would chase each other, playing cat and mouse and on that note I went into around a 5 minute visually mental trip of cats and mice chasing each other. After I came back from the 'mental chase' trip I looked at the ceiling again, this time all the dots aligned themselves into splendid designs looking exactly like the curly designs found on Indian and Arabian carpets. The patterns were in constant motion but still symmetrical to the point of perfectly making an entire pattern instead of a pile of random dots occasionally aligning up. What was real fun was standing up and getting closer to the ceiling and watching the dots not scatter but remain in the same changing but symmetric shape. All the songs on the album brought to reality that this vintage Pink Floyd, especially when concentrating on Syd's voice and guitar, doesn't just knock your eyes out of whack or anything similar, but truly does alter one's perception to the point of making real audibly, mentally, emotionally and visually things that truly do not exist except in one's mind.<br />Syd Barrett is God.

0385504209|5.0|Ok- first off... I really did enjoy this book. However, now that I have read 3 of Brown's novels, I have noticed a certain formula that Dan Brown uses.<br />1- Use the word &quot;Indredulous&quot; as often as possible.<br />2- The bad guy MUST be known by a term/phrase instead of a name.<br />3- The bad guy is double crossing the good guys... and you are NOT supposed to suspect this.<br />4- The novel must take place in the course of one day.<br />5- Your hero must wake-up and not have a clue that he will spend his entire day many miles away from home, while being chased by bad guys.<br />6- All good guys must be experts at something very arcane.<br />7- The ending must be weak.<br />If you follow these steps you too can write a Dan Brown novel. ORRRR you can use this formula to figure out the book you are currently reading after about 100 pages.<br />This is clearly a case of diminishing returns. One book is Awesome, two is fun, but by the third... you are ready to turn on the television.<br />My suggestion- read the Da Vinci Code (However, remember it is still &quot;fiction&quot; and despite the authors claims- some of his facts are seriously flawed- for instance - &quot;The Gosphel of Mary&quot; is hardly widely accepted as legitimate).<br />&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is extremely face paced, and quite thought provoking. It challenged me to do a little research into the foundation of my beliefs (However, it did not change my beliefs... I found that my views on religon are on much sounder ground that the author's supposed &quot;research&quot;). Enjoy...
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is an amazing album from an amazing group.  The Clash is really much more than some people realize.  It's not fair to call them punk first of all, because they're musical styles range from hard rock to ska to even reggae.  Also, this album was created in 1979- that was still in the Zeppelin days!  This was an album unlike any other in a time where music seemed less like a passion and more like a business.  All together this album squeezes 19 songs on your compact disk, ranging from the 1:40 &quot;Kola Kola&quot; to the 5:00+ &quot;Revolution rock.&quot; Some highlights of the album include &quot;London Calling,&quot; a good opener and basically lays out The Clash's game plan.  &quot;Rudy Can't Fail&quot; &quot;Revolution Rock&quot; and &quot;Wrong 'em Boyo&quot; are excellent ska songs while &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot; experiments with some reggae and &quot;Death Or Glory,&quot; &quot;I'm Not Down,&quot; and &quot;Clampdown&quot; just plain rock.  I recommend this album to anyone who wants to try something new; the Clash will satisfy anyone's musical tastes.  As a die-hard classic rocker, I was a little skeptical at first, but this has become one of my all time favorites...
0671027387|3.0|Ok- first off... I really did enjoy this book. However, now that I have read 3 of Brown's novels, I have noticed a certain formula that Dan Brown uses.<br />1- Use the word \\"Indredulous\\" as often as possible.<br />2- The bad guy MUST be known by a term/phrase instead of a name.<br />3- The bad guy is double crossing the good guys... and you are NOT supposed to suspect this.<br />4- The novel must take place in the course of one day.<br />5- Your hero must wake-up and not have a clue that he will spend his entire day many miles away from home, while being chased by bad guys.<br />6- All good guys must be experts at something very arcane.<br />7- The ending must be weak.<br />If you follow these steps you too can write a Dan Brown novel. ORRRR you can use this formula to figure out the book you are currently reading after about 100 pages.<br />This is clearly a case of diminishing returns. One book is Awesome, two is fun, but by the third... you are ready to turn on the television.<br /><br />This is the weakest of the three novels that I have read by Brown (the others being Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons). The plot had more flaws, and the ending was even weaker than his other books. However, it was the third of the three, so using the FORMULA I pretty much had it figured out. Let me put it this way- this is the most forgettable of the three that I have read.<br />My suggestion- read the Da Vinci Code (However, remember it is still \\"fiction\\" and despite the authors claims- some of his facts are seriously flawed- for instance - \\"The Gospel of Mary\\" is hardly widely accepted as legitimate).
B00008OWZC|5.0|This album is 100% live and that's the way it should be.  Led Zeppelin was not meant to be heard on professionally mixed tracks.  They were meant to be heard raw and reckless, which is basically what their music as all about.  With this album, you can also really appreciate the sort of telepathy that seemed to exist between them (nearly half of the music was improvised.)  Do you think they planned on busting into &quot;Mary Lou&quot; in the middle of &quot;Whole Lotta Love?&quot;  That is what makes Led Zeppelin so great.  Not many bands can say they sound 10 times better live than on their albums.  Not to mention Jimmy Page's wild solos.  This is a must-have for anyone who thinks stairway was decent on Zeppelin IV. (wait till you hear the live version)  Any Zeppelin fan will love disk one, but disks two and three are only for those who have the patience and the appreciation for the 20 minute masterpieces, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; and &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;
6304288433|5.0|This was the end of the great Halloween movies in my openion. I mean part one is with out a doubt the best and part two is great as well but after this one they got band, I mean Michael Myers isnt even in part three? Whats up with that. Part four and H20 were alright but they were never the same after this. Jamie Lee Curtice is always great in these movies but I think she gives her best prformance here, she really knows how to play a victom! She goes through hell in the Halloween movies and some how she manages to survive and get out, and amazingly some how Michael does the same! If you are going to get into the Halloween movies only get this and the first one because after this they really dont make since and the acting starts to slowly suck!
0684853523|5.0|I don't even like Stephen King, or didn't, until I read this book... and it is the BEST!  I have every book imaginable on writing and most are by people I've never heard of and probably never will be anymore than one-book authors... but Stephen King writes from a masterful life of writing bestsellers... and just looking at his life and commitment in the midst of all the obstacles inspired me more than I can say!  A great big thank you to you, Stephen!  He is thoroughly humble... as I said, I didn't even like him, could never imagine liking him... until I read this book... and, to triple repeat myself... it is THE BEST!  If you want to be a writer... this IS the book to have... not a book to check out of the library... one to own and underline and re-read and cherish... an utter inspiration.  When I read his chapter on mental telepathy and writing... I had to put the book down for a day just to let that sink in... he says that we aren't even in the same place, not even the same year, and yet he can communicate something clearly... telepathically send you a picture with writing... and he is right... powerful stuff, this writing business!  Buy it!
B000001ESP|5.0|Many People conceder this to be the best album Rush ever made, and for good reason none of the tracks are bad or weak or are lacking in any way. But many also conceder this to be to comercial. I am in the middle, while I agree that this and Permanant Waves were both very commercial albums, I still love them.<br />Rush is a very talented band and the comes across loud and clear on Moving Pictures. The song writing is great, though its not as good as on 2112 it is still very good. Each song is about something, and the music to each song tells a story if you listen carefully. There are no big elaberate guitar solos or anything like thats from Alex Lifeson but his playing is still very good and skilled here. Geddys bass was never better, and Neils drumming is over the top as always! 'Tom Sawyer' 'Limelight' and 'Red Barcetta' are all here and all went on to be big hit singles. But Moving Pictures is more then that the lesser known tracks are amazing as well. For example 'The Camras Eye' and 'YYZ' are both Rush classics. So you see there is really nothing bad with this album, as long as you dont mind really good music played by extremly skilled players. I dont know wether Rush is a Prog band or a hard rock band but either way they rock harder and better then most bands did back at that this came out!
B00006EXL5|1.0|So I guess every band like this gets a record deal ever since Thursday got big. We don't need another band like this!! Do something new, or  if you're in My Chemical Romance, save the world from this horrible music and break up. That would make my day.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|I wish I was there that night when Rush took the stage in Rio, I mean this sounds amazing, the tone, the clearity and the over all showmanship of Rush comes across load and clear here on Rush In Rio. I wasnt a big Rush fan before I bought this I mean I had 2112 and Moving Pictures as everyone should and all but untill I got this I didnt really have a good idea of how great Rush was. I knew that Neil Pert was one of the top five drummers of all time but who didnt, and the same can be said for Geddy Lees bass, and Alex Lifeson is extremly underrated as a guitar player I mean the man can ripp it up! I think 'Tom Sawyer' is the best track here it's pulled off flawless and I love it when the crowed is singing along with the words and you can almost hear them better then Geddy, It must feel amazing to hear 10,000 people screaming the words you wrote back at you. And the encore with 'Working Man' is just amazing, I mean that solo has to be in the top 30 of all time, I am deffinatly going to get deeper into Rush since hearing this great live album. Rush is truly one of the best bands of all time, and they show that here and its so sad that they are over looked and underrated!
B000002OZY|5.0|What's Clarence Thomas talking about?  <br />8 tracks Tommy?  a double album by The Who?  <BR>Do you have any idea what it this all about?  <BR>Tommy hilfblahblahblah<br />Shoot yourself please!
B000001ESF|5.0|When I first got this I wasnt sure to expect. I was never a big fan of Rush before I bought this. Then I was hooked. I mean I could just sit and listen to Neil Pert play his drums for hours. He is truly one of the best drummers in the history of playing! But now on to the album.<br />  I always kinda liked prog but never really owned any prog music that was worth a damn but this is truly one of the best albums of all time. The bands instrumental skills are just down right amazing. Geddys voice is origanal and can be picked out any where. 2112 is the best song on the album! It has every thing any music fan could ever want in a rock song. Every other song on the album is just amazing. This is one of those albums with out any flaws. This is concederd a concept album but I really cant see why, because most concept albums are not this good. To me this is Rush's best album nothing they ever did after this was as good, dont get me wrong Permanant Waves, and Moving Pictures were both great and amazing albums but none of them had the passion of this, and I think the song writing was at an all time high here on 2112. I would recomend this to new and old fans of Rush because it gives a good since of what the band was really about!

0385484518|5.0|This book is wonderful.  I am very glad that I was able to read it.  Morrie Schwartz was an exceptional man that even though I could not meet him, I feel very close to him thanks to the openness he shared with Albom.  Morrie was dying, and was not afraid to admit it.  He decided to help others, as he had done his whole life through teaching, one last time.  This book teaches us about many life lessons that we all know that we should do, be kind to one another, always say I love you, and hugs are wonderful tools of communication.  I would recommend this book for anyone who needs a new reason to live.  That reason is purely for the joy of loving humanity and those around you.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Combining the awesome vocals of Chris Cornell and the instrumentals from one of the best hard rock bands of all time turns out to be a very entertaining move.  This new band has a lot to offer I believe.  It is clear when listening that though the instrumentals often kick it up to their rage days on many songs, they also often make a compromise to slow themselves down, something that is no less moving.  Conversely, Cornell seems to be changing his style occasionally just slightly in the direction of a &quot;RATM&quot; style.  I don't know much about Soundgarden (though I sure want to after hearing this cd), but I do know that Cornell has a great voice and this band has already made some great music.  Personal favorites, besides the overplayed &quot;Like a Stone&quot;, are &quot;show me how to live&quot;, &quot;set it off&quot;, &quot;What you are&quot;, &quot;exploder&quot; and &quot;I am the Highway&quot;.  Though many of these songs take a while to get into because they're a little slower than songs like &quot;cochise&quot;, they will certainly always be good songs to just sit down and relish in.
0671027344|5.0|To tell you the truth, I have never read such a wonderful book. I looked at it this way, what Charlie was writing, is a lot of what I am feeling. After this book, I sat there and cried... it made me feel so different, my outlook on life was completely changed. I know everyone can't feel that way about certain books, but this book did. I read 'The Perks of being a Wallflower' in such a short time, but I felt like I was living the book. After reading the book, I listened to The Smiths' song &quot;Asleep.&quot; I had never felt so happy and sad at the same time. This book is a definite read.. I reccomend it to anyone and everyone.
