B000FSME1A|3.0|Ok, this is one of the biggest movies that defined Viet Nam for a generation.  Today it is still one of the best War Movies around and a must own for any \\"Guy Movie\\" collection...  That being said, I strongly recommend staying away from this collection.  As a person who usually waits for the super dooper bells & whistles mega ultra shiney special editions I think this one falls short of a good collection.  True, you can choose if you want to watch the origional or Redux versions, and it has tons and tons of special features and extra/extended footage not included in any other versions I've ever seen.  The biggest problem comes from being split across 2 disks.  Most collections have taken to the trand of put the movie(s) on one disk and the special features on the other, or put one movie and some special features on one disk, and the other version and more special features on the other... But for some reason the studio must have been smoking some bad crack, because they decided to split both movies across both disks.  Each disk holds a slew of special features, and you can pick which version you want to watch (original or redux) but only half the movie is on the first disk.  When you get about 1h30min into the movie, the disk ends and you have to put in the second disk, and then rechoose which version of the movie you want to see, then it will finally start \\"Act 2\\" of the movie...  If they would have just thought for a second and kept each version of the movie contained entirely on a single disk this collection would have reached the perfection that only few special editions ever reach... unfortunately they dropped a ball on this one in a major way, and have made me decide to sell my copy and just buy each version seperately...

B000JK8OYU|1.0|Since the Beatles disbanded in 1970 a misconception has developed that they were all about Love.  Forget those songs of alienation, biting wit, loneliness, satire, and detached surrealism . . . man, those cute moptops were just all about love.  Love, Love, Love.  Their edge, the sardonic humor, the attributes I've most valued have been worn away and in the popular view that has evolved we have Saints John, Paul, George, and Ringo beatifically preaching their gospel of love.  (Can one be a saint while still alive?  I'll leave that one for the religious scholars to debate.)  The hard-edged songs - \\"A Day in the Life,\\" \\"I'm only Sleeping,\\" \\"I Am the Walrus,\\" etc. have all been de-clawed.<br />The Messrs. Martin have pulled off a very clever musical feat, but when I hear the results of their labors, and imagine the unlikely contortions the Circque de Soleil performers no doubt perform while that music is playing, I give the click wheel of my iPod a quick twirl.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|While it is no Gladiator this can be a fun little movie if you don't read to much into it.   <br /> <br />I will say that: <br /> <br />- it wasn't an especially coherant or well-thought out adaptation (best bit - Aeneas introduced three minutes from the end; sole character development: \\"I'm Aeneas\\").  <br />- it wasn't subtle. <br />- it wasn't fresh or original.  <br />- it didn't have good dialogue.  <br />- it attempted to do moral ambiguity and screwed up totally.  <br />- it was pure Hollywood. <br /> <br />At least when the movie is over you know that you don't have to see it ever agian if you don't want to.  You also know that you never have to see Brad Pitt's naked butt agian if you don't want to.

B00003CX5P|5.0|We bought this for my son, he loves Star Wars.  He loved it.  It kept him glued to the T.V.  I know if you asked him, he would give it two thumbs up!
B000I0QK74|5.0|Although I thought I'd never buy another Christmas album, I had to have this one after I heard the samples. His version of Jingle Bells is THE BEST! Whether it's classic James Taylor style - just him and his acoustic guitar - or a grand production, his voice carries the song.
B000000OMB|4.0|Many people drubbed this album when it came out.  They didn't like the \\"sell out\\" mentality of it.  Mind you, this was the same set of critics who kept giving the progressive rock groups bad reviews, calling them pretentious and pompous.  So, is this a good album?  Absolutely.  It is certainly more commercial than ELP, Yes, or King Crimson, but you don't get the feeling of a blatant sellout.  This is really the only Asia album you need.  This is their best.  They pretty much collapsed after this album, making only one more album with the original lineup, then splintering off into various offshoots to the point no one knows who's really in the band anymore.  I've always loved Heat of the Moment and Only Time Will Tell, and Wildest Dreams is good too, with Carl Palmer getting a chance to show his chops (he's subdued on this album in comparison to his ELP workouts).  This is Asia's best, and the only one worth having.
B00003CXAA|5.0|My husband was interested in these movies.  He had never seen the three movies in their entirety.  We do not exchange Christmas presents but he always ends up getting me something so I thought after 3 years of marriage I would purchase something different, didn't cost too much, something that he was truly interested in and would enjoy.  I hit the jackpot.  We both would sit together in the evenings until we completed the collection. Not only did we spend time together but it was a truly fantastic collection.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|Themes of love, fear, sin, death and redemption march heavily in The Black Parade to the tune of soaring guitar solos and piercing operatic anthems. The sheer magnitude and over-the-top theatrical flair is impressive, calling on influences that span three decades of the best in classic rock, brit pop and alternative music. My Chemical Romance draws you down into the murky depths of one mans psyche as he battles a cabaret cast of personal demons in the underworld, desperately seeking redemption. The rock opera closes on a grand, soaring note as the \\"patient\\" is ressurected, having faced his fears and finally conquered them.
B000056HE9|4.0|It is a delightful movie. It is one of the few movies that has harmless entertainment. The performances are exceptional. A wholesome family movie.
B000002V1D|3.0|From the mid-80s onward, Duran Duran began to decline. By the onset of the 1990s, the salad days of the Rio-era were a fading memory. Albums like \\"Big Thing\\" and \\"Liberty\\" had seen the band floundering with bland new rhythms and with mediocre songwriting. \\"Duran Duran (II)\\", aka, \\"The Wedding Album,\\" brought the band back to the limelight with two marvellous hit singles. But does the rest of the album hold up as well? <br /> <br />We begin with the rather heavy \\"Too Much Information,\\" a track that marriers then-contemporary grungyness with cynicism towards the media. It's a solid starter, albeit a bit too much of a distorted departure from the Duran Duran sound that 80s fans were familiar with.  <br /> <br />The hit single \\"Ordinary World\\" follow, and with its fabulous guitar work and socially aware lyrics, it remains a timeless gem; trully one of the highlights of Duran Duran's canon. <br /> <br />\\"Drowning Man,\\" which melds an odd vocal cadence to effect-laden guitar work, is the third track on the album. Some hate it; I find it rather enjoyable. It's different, and it works. <br /> <br />\\"Shotgun\\" is crap, pure and simple. It's about 40 second of whistles and drum machines that amount to absolutely nothing. <br /> <br />\\"Come Undone,\\" the other classic, melds a trip-hop rhythm and soul back-up vocals to a more refined Duran Duran sound. It's yet another welcome addition to the canon. <br /> <br />And after that, it all sounds the same. Aside from the Brazilian-tinged \\"Breath After Breath\\" and the annoying stab at Price (\\"UMF\\"), all of the songs have identical production values. This homegenized delivery, coupled with uninspired vocals, make for a huge let-down. Even the Velvet Underground's \\"Femme Fatale\\" is not immune to this process. <br /> <br />To say that this album is top-heavy is an understatement. The bulk of the substance is at the beggining of the album. The rest is cookie-cutter filler. But still... that first half is worth 5 stars. The rest, though, bogs down what could've been a great EP. Or just a better album.
B00005JPAM|5.0|I wouldn't have imagined that a film focused on Queen Elizabeth's response to the sudden death of her daughter-in-law, Princess Diana, could be so interesting and multifaceted. But thanks to a great screenplay, a wonderful direction and the incredible acting of Helen Mirren, \\"The Queen\\" is surprisingly good.

6305907145|1.0|The filmakers should have decided either to be true to Austen's original or to forget the book and make a good, solid movie.  In trying to do both, and without managing to reconcile these goals into any coherency, they have created something that is illogical and ridiculous.  A bad rendition of Jane Austen and a bad movie in it's own right. <br /> <br />\\"Mansfield Park\\" not the easiest of Jane Austen's books to be made into a movie.  It's tone is far more melancholy than that of her other novels, and it involves two major problems for modern audiences:  the romance is between a pair of first cousins (not incestuous in Regency England), and the family that supports the main characters made its fortune in the slave trade (a fact which the book glosses over).  Combine all this with the fact that the painfully shy and endlessly patient Fanny Price is not exactly what a modern audience looks for in a heroine, and it becomes very understandable that the makers of this movie took several liberties in an attempt to modernize it.  The problem is not that the plot and characters were altered, but that those who did the altering made a horrendous job of it. <br /> <br />In attempting to update the character of Fanny Price, the filmakers made the interesting decision to combine the character's actions in the novel with biographical details from Austen's life.  Early in the movie, Fanny is portrayed writing wild and absurd stories in letters to her sister that sound suspiciously like Austen's unpublished childhood writings.  Later in the film, instead of rejecting an unworthy suitor outright, this Fanny accepts his proposal as a marraige of conveniance one day, only to take everything back the next morning when a good night's sleep has strengthened her conviction that marraige ought only be undertaken for love: a series of events that is nowhere in the book, but that Jane Austen herself actually did to one unfortunate gentlemen.  By the end of the movie, Fanny shows her new fiance a manuscript she has written that she hopes to get published.  Combining the life of Jane Austen with the life of one of her characters would have been an intriguing interpretation if it were not for the fact that the film-makers chose the character in all Jane Austen that is probably the least like the lady herself.   <br /> <br />Fanny Price is a tender, subdued character who is so used to mistreatment by her adoptive family that she is actually moved to tears when her uncle allows her to keep a fire in the room where she spends most of the day.  Not much like the woman who penned the biting caricatural satires that Austen-fans know and love.  The inability to reconcile these two different characters into one creates a movie that is disjointed to the point of absurdity from beginning to end.  The character of Fanny Price is changed so much from book to movie that whenever Fanny does or says something actually taken from Austen's novel, it looks out of character.  This Fanny goes from bold and satirical to self-concious and frightened and then right back again so often and so suddenly that viewers trying to follow the story are likely to end up dizzy and confused. <br /> <br />If the bizarre changes of Fanny's character aren't enough, Edward (her cousin) is completely indecipherable.  The film suggests that he knew himself to be in love with Fanny from the beginning and never really felt much for Mary Crawford, making all of his decisions but especially his courtship of Mary and the length of time before he declares himself to Fanny completely mysterious.  There is also a bizarrely homoerotic interpretation of one of the scenes taken from the book between Fanny and Mary Crawford that comes out of nowhere and is never touched on again.  The entire film is a continuous non sequitur from beginning to end, from the first letter Fanny writes home to the bizarre tribal drum-beats that score the end credits for no apparent reason. <br /> <br />In the interest of fairness I will say that it is visually a very pretty movie with gorgeous lighting and that the actors seem very talented, leading one to believe that it might have been a decent movie if it had had an entirely different script and entirely different direction and if the people in charge had made entirely different decisions every step of the way.  But despite what I've seen in the other reviews (were we really watching the same movie?) and whether you're an Austen fan or not, the only reason to see this movie is to indulge in an MST3K-style mocking.
B000002OVJ|5.0|...which is Latin for \\"it doesn't get any better than this.\\" Hands down the best live rock album ever recorded. There are others that come close -- Hendrix's Band of Gypsies, the Allman Brothers at the Fillmore East, the Stones' Get Yer Ya-Yas Out, a handful of others that capture a time & space -- but this one gets my vote. Pure unfiltered rock bliss. \\"Young Man Blues\\" by itself grabs you by the collar (or whatever) and won't let go. Go ahead and invest in the double-CD reissue that has the full-length performance of Tommy if you want to, but you will probably play the first disc more often. Play it loud, it'll do you no harm.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|2 Fast 2 Furious: 5/10: Okay so it's car porn. It's rather well done car porn. Stunningly brainless but rather fun in places 2 Fast 2 Furious gives us a candy colored version of street racing with a plot that is best not even discussed.  <br /> <br />After all you don't watch this for the plot. You watch it for the cars. A giant product placement for Mitsubishi among others the cars and characters are right out of a video game (the paint jobs match the personalities) and kudos to the filmmakers for keeping the CGI to a minimum. The movie made me want to trick out my old Dodge Dart.(Electric Blue paint job with matching neon on yeah baby).  <br /> <br />Director John Singletary moves the cars around like he has been directing Burt Reynolds's movies all his life. (This is not a criticism and the fact he avoids Cannonball Run style humor is another plus.) Singletary who usually films much more important movies, (what's next Scorsese's Jaws 5 or Spike Lee's Ella Enchanted 2 Ella in Da Hood? Actually the way some of Spike's recent films have gone this may not be a bad idea) keeps the pace tight and the actors attractive. <br /> <br />However all is not peachy keen. For example I haven't seen African American hairstyles this bad since Cotton came to Harlem. The Tyrese character comes across as a complete idiot almost sinking the movie once or twice. (Now I know Tyrese can act I saw Baby Boy.) Another quick note I have driven cars with nitrous oxide and they give you a burst of acceleration not warp speed effects from Star Trek. (And lets face it the Mitishibishi cars are pretty but not fast. These cars are dragging down a strip after a minute and the speedometer finally moves from 90 to 120 my Dart has better acceleration after 60 sixty seconds. <br /> <br />The movie, to its credit, acknowledges when the cars get whooped by some old American muscle. I know I promised not to discuss the plot but one thing. If you needed someone to drive a couple of million dollars from Miami to Key West (all of 2 hours on Interstate 95 and Route 1), would you A: hire and old couple in a RV B: Drive it yourself or C: Hire two ex-cons in the flashiest cars you have ever seen and who had to this point been incapable of rounding the block without causing an accident and attracting various state and local agencies. I guess that's why we are not criminal masterminds.
B000I0QK74|4.0|I heard a few tracks from this CD while holiday shopping and decided that I could do worse. Actually it's a very good holiday CD. As always, James Taylor has assembled a tasteful collection of tunes and the psuedo jazz stylings go well with his voice. If you choose to, purchase any \\"feel good\\" holiday music next Christmas, make this one the first on your list. Also, everyone I played it for immediately liked it, so I guess that means something.

B000J103N4|4.0|This CD turned out to be one of my favorites in 2006.  With players like Jerry Garcia, Phil Lesh, and most of the Grateful Dead along with Nash, Young, and twenty other maestros from the San Francisco scene of the sixties how can you go wrong.  The sound on this album is excellent.  They did a great job of re-mastering this work.  I just don't understand why I never heard of it before it's re-release.

032147404X|5.0|This was an impulse buy waiting in the checkout line of barnes and ignoble, and I'm glad I got it.  Earlier in the shopping day, I went through their collection of digital photography books, and at least half of the pages were on photoshop manipulations.  I don't want to mess with photoshop, but get things right in the camera to start out with.  This book has a lot of tips and tricks (some obvious, some not so obvious) explictly for getting things right in-camera.
B000BNI99K|5.0|It was shipped in a timely fashion, the condition of the 4 CD set was in very good shape. I was pleased with it overall.
B000001GPX|5.0|It is comforting that occasionally a performance of a piece from the basic repertoire transcends the clamor of our feverish opinions and ascends to its singular place in the pantheon on wings of almost universal approval. Carlos Kleiber's incisive reading of Beethoven's C-Minor symphony <br />produced a singular recording that seemed to set a new standard of excellence. It is a clinic on conducting: propulsive, seamless, trance-inducing. But for this listener, Carlos Kleiber's always-interesting dynamism and fierce attention to detail does not eclipse his father's earlier performance with the Concertgebouw, available on both CD and an excellent vinyl recording. Erich Kleiber's band, excellent in its time, sounds a little scruffy compared to the VPO. There are a few intonation problems here and there. But the performance amounts to an excavation and reinvention of Beethoven's spirit. The finale achieves a white-hot redemptive power that must have exhausted and liberated the musicians at the same time. They play as one, invincibly sprinting on the high wire. Carlos Kleiber had his father's cunning instrumental sense, his steely discipline, and probably excelled him in his ability to maintain orchestral balances. But his father was one of the few musicians to have captured the C-Minor's Sisyphean journey in all of its impossible striving. Whenever I listen to Carlos' version of Beethoven's Fifth, I contentedly marvel at his command of his orchestra. Whenever I listen to Erich's version, I am consumed, emptied, replenished, and somehow changed.
B0000B1OE7|1.0|The best part of the DVD was in the interview, where the director was asked what he had been trying to say about the role of women in Japan during that era. He replied, very sensibly, that the characters were ninja's and demons belonging to secret organizations, and therefore did not and could not say much about society at that time. Elsewhere in the interview he made it very clear as to why he DID make the movie - as a rape and violence fantasy to separate lowest-common-denominator teenaged boys from their parents' money.  <br /> <br />All this had been obvious just from watching the movie. My co-watcher and I made cruel fun of the interviewer for asking such a dumb question. Imagine my surprise when I came here. For some reason, some who have actually seen the film are going to try to convince you that it is trying to say something about the oppression of women. Other than \\"It is fun to watch!\\" -- not really. Far from critiquing the treatment of women at the time, the heroine is portrayed as desiring the normal woman's role, but tragically denied it. The gratuitous rapes and other unpleasant sexual content are there to be enjoyed by creepy adolescent boys with anger issues - a lucrative demographic, to be sure, but not one renowned for its feminist sensibilities.  While we are at it, the gory violence is not here to make a statement about the horror of war or the Plight of the Common Ninja. It's there because watching blood gush like a fountain all over the place is really reeaally kewl. If you want a film that says something, or even that you just want to pretend says something, rent RASHOMON or SEVEN SAMURAI or IRON frigging MONKEY fer crissake. If you want something pretty, violent, and stupid, but that will kindly refrain from scarring you for life, rent VAN HELSING!!! If you want to see buckets of blood and some horrid sexual content - but combined with actual characters, human emotions, and a plot even -- try QUEEN MARGOT.  <br /> <br />NINJA SCROLL opens well, with a lone ninja hero (lacking in charisma a bit, but fairly solid hero material) on the one hand, and a band of demonic black clad horsemen riding through a lightning storm on the other. There are some lovely images; a heron by a river, the play of shadows under a bridge, a swordfight in a bamboo forest. But the demons are simply grotesque bad guys, with dull and earthly motives involving politics and power. Their \\"demonic\\" nature is expressed through their ugliness, foul language, and fondness for ripping arms off of unfortunate ninjas. They are not genuinely supernatural or otherworldly, just stupid, cruel and a bit disgusting.  There are none of the eerie shivers one gets from Japanese folklore or (good) horror based on it. <br /> <br />The plot is your generic \\"Search for the MacGuffin\\" which you might find in filler episodes of KUNG FU or in a B Western. And what a mortal, money-grubbing MacGuffin it is. It is a disappointment to find out that those demonic Night Riders from the beginning were up to something so dull. The heroes fight a series of villains to move the action along, and the villains back-stab each other whenever an \\"unexpected\\" twist is needed.  <br /> <br />The hero and heroine are pretty grumpy, which is totally understandable seeing as her friends all died and she was raped by demons, and he, you know, lost a tooth. They give the increasingly grumpy viewer somebody to relate to. Their relationship is not normally what I would consider good characterization, but without it there would be zero characterization at all, and so one clings to it as to a life raft. It also provides a few good laughs - such as when our hero demonstrates how NOT to administer first aid to a lady ninja. Alas, for the ending to have played as \\"moving\\" (as intended) rather than silly (as is) would have required a far more lyrical and less crass approach to the film as a whole. Not to mention that if my beloved and all my friends went splat, and I got raped by two different demons within a twenty-four hour period, I'd have something else on my mind than pining after the Grumpy Ninja Hero I'd known all of a DAY. Or moping about how I'm not a normal woman, when I should be worrying about all those demons after my posterior and thankful that my arms are still firmly attached. But I didn't write this thing.  <br /> <br />My anime experience up till now has been mostly Miyazaki films and Adult Swim cartoons. The quality was consistently impressive enough that I presumed a \\"classic\\" of the art form would be . . . good. Instead, NINJA SCROLL is an uninspired potboiler, which would make a barely passable time killer were it not rendered unwatchable via the sadistic, pointless, and juvenile nature of its \\"adult\\" content.  That I have seen worse is the best I can say for it. True, it has one seriously pretty heron, and I learned the phrase \\"Tokugawa Shogunate\\", which makes me feel slightly smarter. Considering what else I have stuck in my head now, it wasn't worth it.
B000J103PC|5.0|I bought this movie as a Christmas gift, before watching.  All I have to say is I'm glad it's staying in the family!  Meryl Streep was something else in this movie!  I would recommend it to anybody!
B0002ZEU4U|5.0|This is the most intensely upsetting and uncomfortable movie ever made. Every scene in this movie could be captured and used as a photograph for an art gallery. Regardless of what idiots who have no understanding of this film and it's usage of real sex and lingering meticulous filming style this is the most sincerely introspective film about loneliness, regret, and solidarity I have seen. If you identify well with loneliness and inaccessibility this is your film. If you are uninteresting, a dime a dozen type person, don't bother. <br /> <br />This box set is amazing, huge brown box with a huge poster, nicely packaged dvd with plastic and hard mat liner notes. Very nice shirt. The commentary is very interesting - you really find out about how intense making this film was for the director. He put himself in debt, lost his girlfriend, didn't spend his best friend's last days on earth with him, ruined his body, dealt with terrible responses from critics - but this is what he considers the best thing he has ever done with his life.
1582701709|4.0|I found this book to be very interesting and readable.  It can easily be read a paragraph at a time, or a chapter at a time, and then put down for awhile.  It takes a bit of time to integrate the information into your daily life practice. Most of the information is familiar but it is presented in a way to stimulate thinking.  I enjoyed the book and look forward to the movie.
B0000026WD|5.0|Quite simply put, this may be the best dance/pop/r&b album ever recorded, as he effectively combined those three genres into one mind-blowing disc. All of what pop music has become today owes itself to this album. Does anyone realise the number of beats that Timbaland, Timberlake, Britney, etc. have lifted from this masterpiece? \\"Remember The Time\\" and \\"In the Closet\\" are as good or better than any song in this genre since the days of Marvin Gaye, even surpassing Michael's previous works. Unfortunately MJ's reputation took a huge hit during this time period, and for good reason I'll admit, but the sad thing is that this record is now ignored by many because of it. If you love this style of pop/r&b, buy this because of the music itself and don't ignore it because of the man's life choices. We have all done things we regret, but everything is magnified with MJ because he lives in the spotlight. Maybe he's guilty, maybe not, but the man has lived under a microscope his whole life. Give him a break at least until there is proof of his wrongdoings, because as a musician, he has done everything right on \\"Dangerous.\\"
B00003CXCW|5.0|I received this movie as a Christmas gift after my husband and I and a group of friends were trying to figure out where the character of Norma Desmond that Carol Burnett used to spoof on her show came from.  None of us knew so I looked it up on the internet and found this movie, and my husband decided to buy it for me.<br /><br />I have to say that old movies have never appealed to me.  I felt that the acting was stilted and unnatural, black and white was boring, and I usually ended up turning them off after 20 minutes or so.  Well, maybe I was watching the wrong ones, because from start to finish, this movie absolutely mesmerized me.  Initially I had to laugh when first seeing Norma Desmond because all I could think of was Carol Burnett (and boy, did she nail it!), but even while thinking of the spoof of her, Norma Desmond was seriously disturbing to watch.  Some people think Gloria Swanson overacted a bit, but I disagree.  I think that an eccentric, somewhat shut-in former silent movie queen might just be as over-the-top and bizarre as Norma Desmond was.<br /><br />Another surprise was William Holden.  I had seen a couple of movies he had been in, notably The Towering Inferno and Omen II, when he was an old man.  I didn't even know him on screen in this movie when they first showed him because I'd never seen him young.  If he was a young star today, he'd be number one on the People's Sexiest Man list, no doubt.  And I loved his deadpan sarcastic delivery of all the great lines he has in this movie.  I'm now officially a William Holden fan and have been renting everything that he's been in.  Since I've never really seen any movies made prior to 1970 or so, I'd never seen Stalag 17, in which he was also terrific.<br /><br />Bottom line is, if you aren't a classic movie fan, watch this movie and you will be.  I've since made a list of all the old movies I've never seen (Casablanca, The Grapes of Wrath, Citizen Kane, and of course anything starring William Holden) and am now trying to catch up on 60 years of Hollywood that I missed.olden) and am now trying to catch up on 60 years of Hollywood that I missed. <br /> <br />

B0002VL0KQ|5.0|A beautiful voice, beautiful music, great for a baby or a mom.  Makes a great gift.
B00003CY6M|2.0|I'm baffled. Is it fate or just chance that this happens to be one of the cheesiest, most poorly written movies ever made?<br /><br />I weep for John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale for being roped into this horrendous excuse for a romantic comedy. Eugene Levy, Molly Shannon, and Jeremy Piven all fared well because of the quirkiness of their characters, but this movie as a whole is painfully bad.<br /><br />So, two people (Cusack and Beckinsale) meet at a Bloomingdale's counter over the last pair of black gloves and over the most inane conversation somehow decide that perhaps fate brought them together. But that would be too easy. So they write their information on some random items (a book and a dollar bill) and decide if those items come back to them then they were meant to be together.<br /><br />Oh how cute right? No, don't be fooled. Supposedly the two lead characters are so sure of the fact that they're \\"fated\\" to be together that they stay in their current relationships for SEVEN years, until they're both about to get married, and then they become obsessed with finding each other. What's funny is that the basic concept of the film is that the fates will pull them together, but the lengths they go to find each other should be considered border-line stalking, yet we should set that aside in order to enjoy the joyful reunion they have at the end.<br /><br />The film leaves the significant others of the main characters totally out of the picture when it comes to this love story. Hey, if you're not happy with your relationship, get out of it, don't string your fiance along. But, that's not the lesson of Serendipity.<br /><br />The moral of the story is, if you meet someone and hang out with them for a few hours you can be sure that they are your soulmate, and if you stay in the same relationship anyway for the next seven years and even plan to get married, really it's still more important to find that person you spent a few hours with several years ago. Why? Because you had that \\"connection\\". You know that deep connection you can only get when you spend a few hours with someone.<br /><br />This movie is the most lightweight, illogical, cotton candy-laden, plasticy story to ever hit the screen. If fate can keep you away from this film, let it. And if you meet someone that has this DVD in their collection, and wants you to watch it with them, run. Run away very quickly.Because you had that \\"connection\\".

0393061434|2.0|I was so excited when I came across this book. I've had Apple products since the Apple II and the second year they made the Mac in 1985 with a whopping 512k of memory. (Up from 128k the year before.) <br />Sadly, this is not the book I had hoped it would be. <br />It does fill-out the early early years of Steve and Steve and the emergence of what became the Apple I but then trails off into technological alleys that leave you trying to find reverse to back out. <br />If you are looking for Woz's side of the relationship up and downs with Jobs at Apple in the early years, you'll only find ONE reference to ANY disagreement and this was after Woz left. <br />Woz goes from building the first Apple I to life after Apple in half the amount of space he devotes to his childhood. <br />Lastly, I used to think no matter how great I think Jobs is I always had a soft spot for Woz feeling he got shafted at the company he co-founded. <br />Now, after reading iWoz, I feel it was Jobs more than ever who really created and re-created Apple. <br />Woz is a brilliant engineer who gave us the original personal computer but we and the products have moved on and it's sad that he has not been part of that journey with us. <br />RIP Woz
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|What a disappointment!! My mother and I have loved the book, reading it many times over and found the BBC production amazingly accurate. But this one was so off we couldn't watch it. It was so obviously Americanized and did what so many productions of classics do, they play fast and loose with the plot and miss the subtleties completely. Nothing seemed be right, the mood, the dress, the actors all too modern, too flimsy. I found the scenes dark and much of the sound too low. We would highly recommend the BBC version but for those who love the book stay away form this one.
B00004U8JV|5.0|Not really sure why this is my favorite ... maybe its the trailer scene where the trailer drops over the cliff while the stars are holding onto a rope inside the trailer ... that is one cool effect! Unfortunately, tv stations don't seem to like this one ... they only show the first and the third Jurassic Park! THAT IS ANOTHER REASON TO BUY THIS DVD!
0618526412|5.0|I first read \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" in the ninth grade, and revisited it recently after it appeared on \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" list.  I even prevailed upon my own book club to read it, to mixed reviews.<br /><br />I find this book is one you think about long after you've finished reading it.  No, it is not by any means a plot-driven book, although I take exception to those who say there is no plot.  There is one -- each character has a conflict, and in his/her own way, resolves the conflict.  The tragedy of the misfit in a callous society is mirrored in each of the characters' lives.  Each is searching for a connection, and the times they live in and the town they live in prevent most of them from making that connection.  I don't think this is as unusual as some readers seem to think.  There are many people in our society today who don't fit in, and their loneliness is profound and isolating.<br /><br />Read the book for it's exquisite prose -- prose that is still very understandable, by the way -- for it's extraordinary character development, and for those who study the craft of writing, McCuller's ability to weave 5 characters' points of view effectively in one novel is breathtaking.<br /><br />But, as I said, if you've never been lonely, and you aren't introspective in the least, don't bother reading it.  You won't get anything out of it and you'll head over to the next potboiler bestseller in a hurry.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I went to great lengths to acquire this movie when it was first released. One of the theaters here actually pulled it shortly after the first sceening. I thought this was a fantastic movie. I was only able to rent it the first time as none of the video stores would carry it. Personally, the movie didn't bother me in the least and I have been trying to acquire it for some time. Because of the content a lot of places refused to carry it. It's not for the faint hearted. Myself, with my taste for this sort of film, thought it was not as graphic as most people will find it. It takes a certain type of person to view it. I watched it twice while I had it as the video store would only let me have it overnight. In fact, the scene where they beat the perpetrator to death in the club, led me to believe that he actually enjoyed being murdered since he was a sadist to begin with. If you can't stand extreme images, I wouldn't recommend it. But for myself, I loved the movie. I am a fan of sadism and torture so it was definently a film I enjoyed.

B000000XBC|5.0|The band CCR formed during the turbulent times of the 60s and early 70s, they gave poetic justice to that period with original compositions and made even greater classics out of old tunes.  They created entertaining melodies with political fore-thought.  They did this without profanity nor by debasing the religious beliefs of others...unlike many of today's young artists. This album deserves five stars.

For the 'afficionado' of the Arthurian legend a 'must-have'.

0140157352|4.0|I have not read any books on negotiation before this so when a friend of mine recommended that I pick this book up to refine my negotiation skills, I wasted no time. First of all the writers are from a group (Harvard Negotiation Project) that deals continually with all levels of negotiation and conflict negotiation. The Harvard Negotiation Project is part of the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, a consortium of scholars and projects from Harvard, MIT, Simmos, and Tufts working to improve the theory and practice of conflict resolution. If that is not credible enough, I don't know what is.<br /><br />If you are looking for out-of-this-world-strategies in here, I will have to burst your bubble. There won't be anything in this book which you do not already know at some level of your experience. What these guys have done is to organize common sense and common experience in a way that provides a usable framework for thinking and acting. Reading this book was half the battle, learning from doing is the other half. I can feel that I am now a little calmer and way more confident when I am negotiating so yes, it definitely helped me. The text is often deep and many paragraphs require a re-read, that's because I really wanted the material to sink in. I have decided I will re-read this book in a month or two, so this one gets 4 stars.
0679731725|4.0|The narrator of this book is Mr. Stevens, a very prim and proper English butler who is reminiscing about his service to one Lord Darlington.  These musings occur while Stevens is on a motor trip provided by his current employer, Mr. Farraday.  The book is beautifully written, and Stevens' musings portray an almost comically obsessive man, so dedicated to performing his duties that he totally ignores his human side.  His favorite topic of conversation is how one becomes a great butler and it is evident that this is his goal in life.  When things threaten to become emotional, such as when his father dies, he keeps a \\"stiff upper lip\\" and congratulates himself on performing his duties in his usual impeccable manner.  He is so dedicated to perfecting his service that he even works on shortcomings such as the ability to \\"banter\\" which Mr. Farrady seems to value.  When Miss Kenton, a fellow staff member, begins to show an interest in Stevens, he is blissfully unaware of her interest or her intentions.  The pace of the book picks up gently as the story progresses, and it eventually becomes clear that some elements of tragedy are beginning to build up in Mr. Stevens' life.  Author Kazuo Ishiguro picks up all the right nuances and does an incredible job of getting inside the head of this sad, one-dimensional man.
0609610570|3.0|Have a lot of respect for both Larry Bossidy and Ramcharan, and know of their achieements.  The importance of Execution is the exact other half component of a business (the first half is to bring the vision/idea).  Without Execution, vision or idea has no value and Execution can only follow a vision or idea.   <br />Book has some good tips, and good to use lessons, and some examples as well;  it is not that I did not get enough value out of this book, but unable to figure out why the book has so many pages for delivering the base concept alone.  I wish the book had more specific guideliens, tool tips to improvise on some one why may lack focus on execution.
B0006J28MI|4.0|Great movie for the family. Positive message about it not being what you have, but what you have inside you. Also the proverbial good guy wins theme
6305609721|5.0|This is a lot lighter hearted than the previous movies of the Star Trek series.  It continues the story started in \\"The Wrath Of Khan\\", but it is a unique movie.  Both this and the previous one were directed by Leonard Nimoy, but there is nothing in common between the two pictures aside from the director and the cast.<br /><br />A lot has been made of the \\"Save The Whales\\" theme of this picture.  It also, though, shows why Trekkies love Star Trek.  True, we enjoy the imagination of science fiction, but the best part is the characters and their interaction.  Can anything match Russian Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Uhara (Nichelle Nichols) on the streets of San Francisco asking where the nuclear weapons were?  Or Scotty (James Doohan) making a deal with a businessman for some plexiglass?  Or Spock (Nimoy) asking if it was time for another colorful metaphor?<br /><br />This movie does have the worst language of any of the Star Trek movies, but in context it is easy to laugh at even if you disapprove.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B00005OCMR|4.0|I can't say I liked the movie, but it was bought as a gift for my boyfriend.  He loves it!  I guess it's a guy thang.
B000059LGC|5.0|First question:  Did they make a mistake casting Peter Ustinov for Hercule Poirot?  His interpretation (let alone appearance) is quite different from Albert Finney's, but I enjoy him in the role, especially by the end of the movies he's in.<br /><br />Mia Farrow gives a disturbing portrayal of a woman deserted by her lover for a heirress.  The scenery of this picture is great.  Angela Lansbury has a great cameo in this movie, and David Niven makes a great Col. Hastings.<br /><br />Okay, this is the end of it.  I won't reveal that the murderer really is . . .
0195067142|5.0|I read this book for a class titled \\"World War II in the Pacific\\".  I can honestly say if I hadn't read this book, the class would have had less of a personal impact on me!  When I was done reading it, I gave it to my grandpa who fought in WW II.  He served in the Army and assaulted Utah Beach on D-Day with an artillery battallion.  I wanted to give him an account of the \\"Pacific side\\" of the war from a soldier's viewpoint.<br /><br />This book tells truly haunting and chilling tales of real battle conditions.  The author does a great job of describing the various places he served and those with whom he served.  These are characters and places that become more and more real to the reader as the book progresses.  Sledge spares no details in describing the true nature of the battles for Peliliu and Okinawa.  It's almost as if he's experiencing the battles again when you read his stories.  You can feel the pain, despair, and disgust at what he sees and experiences around him.<br /><br />This book is a must read for anyone who is a WW II history buff or even veterans themselves.  The combat techniques and battle fields have changed so much since WW II that one can read this and realize how different 21st Century combat really is.  I highly recommend this book!!
0783240503|5.0|I used this video for my Sunday school class in the hopes that they would do a play. Although they only ended up writing about the movie, it was a perfect follow up lesson to the Bible lesson that we read. I loved the creative parralel to the Bible and the color and acting in the film.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Maybe the best way to compare Presence to the other Zeppelin records is to say that it's different. And the main way that it's different is its focus on the groove. Some of the previous records had contained groovy/funky moments (\\"Custard Pie,\\" \\"Trampled Underfoot,\\" \\"The Ocean,\\" etc.), but Presence seems pretty much committed to it. That's why I like it. I don't know that I like it better than Physical Graffiti or IV, but that's not a burning issue for me. I just like it.
B0000DEO90|5.0|I had forgotten how much I liked this set.  I bought the 3 LP album when it first came out in the 70's and then put it away when cassettes and then CD's arrived on the scene.  It was ridiculously expensive when I first saw it available on CD.  When Paul released the \\"tripping\\" live set I bought that.  When Paul released \\"back in the u.s.a.\\" I received it as a gift.  Both are fine live sets with good bands, but I kept thinking that WOA was better.  Well, after buying this thru Amazon and listening I am wondering how it took me so long to return.  It's just fantastic.  His voice is still youthful and strong and at its peak, and the band is probably the best that he toured with (imho).  I would trade any 3 of the beatle songs on this set (and throw in richard cory) for Let It Be or better yet Hey Jude just to hear how he would have performed them at the time.  My personal highlights are Venus and Mars/Rock Show/Jet, Maybe I'm Amazed, Band On The Run, Hi,Hi,Hi, and even My Love.  Paul has always had an eclectic library - Beatles to You Gave Me The Answer to Band On The Run to Let Em In to Soily - makes me think of Honey Pie and Helter Skelter on the White Album.  This is one of the great live shows recorded and I highly recommend it to fans.  My new WOA playlist is now constantly going in my office at work.
B000H30B2C|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre when it was first released and I was dazzled. I am a big King Kong fan and I came into this movie very skeptical. However, I was so pleased with it that I had to go out and buy it on DVD. I waited and bought the extended edition which makes the movie even longer. However, the added scenes actually make it even more enjoyable to watch, rather than detract. I will go out on a limb here and say that from this writer's perspective, this version of Kong is better than the 1933 original not just because of superior technology (although I am a sucker for giant, realistic,life-like creatures battling it out with each other), but the overall acting, pacing, character development, and above all, interaction between our heroine Ann and the giant ape far surpasses the original. This version of Kong is the most believable and expressive creature you will ever see. Regardless of its length, King Kong is BIG screen entertainment. From the arrival on Skull Island, to the magnificant climax on the Empire State Building, this is just a cinematic masterpiece that you will want to own & watch over and over again, rather than toss in the forgotten DVD bin. Highly recommended and worthy of 5 stars.
0553382179|5.0|This book is such an enjoyable read that you find yourself nodding and laughing and crying.   This author, is from the heart and honest.  Just test the shining sink theory and you realize she is exactly RIGHT.   <br />After my moms death, I am decluttering and cleaning my childhood home and once again, the flylady routines fall right into place.  Its like therapy for the soul and definately a MUST if you are terrified of people coming to your house and seeing the reality of your home.    Now I can have folks drop by and find myself inviting people over!  Life Changing and worth every milli-cent!

Fall out with this one for  best of class good sounds!

B000JJRIN4|4.0|This is more of Gwen as she is and if you like her say it as it is style then you will enjoy this CD. The use of one profane word on one song is a gimick that they could have done without, just to get an explicit rating. If you like how she uses her voice and promotes her feminity then for the price I suggest adding it to your collection. If you expect earth shaking changes from her lasst CD then borrow a copy and listen to it once as those changes are not on this CD.

While the Guide may be exhaustive and accurate, it is neither satisfactory as a field guide nor enjoyable to read at home. Were the text less verbose and even conversational, perhaps a larger font could have been used. I had hoped for something analogous to Sibley, \\"Field Guide to Birds of Western North America\\", which has a clear layout and a binding that opens properly.

B000E0WJIC|4.0|Although there are a lot of emo style metalcore bands out there right now,This band steps in up a notch. At leats in terms of executing their vision. There is some good angst that is lyrically down to earth. Personal subject matter unlike most emo styled metal bands who can basque in darkness yet seem empty. I dig the lyrics that are relateable.<br /><br />Production wise it is crisp! the guitars can shred and then sound gorgeous a moment later. Drumming is spectacular! The actual sound of the mix is perfect making for a fresh sounding disc instead of being muddy and 'underneath' which a lot of the darker styled bands tend to use. An apocolyptic setting is not necessary when you can pull it off musically like these guys do.<br /><br />There are a few draggy tracks like '10 years today' which is obviously a personal song for the lyricist. But for the most part they hit hard. especially on '4 Words', 'Suffocating Under..\\", 'Hit the Floor', 'All these things..' and 'Room 409'. Just refreshingly cool stuff. Can see why they have taken Britain by storm. Be interested to see their direction next time out as they are young and have so much potential.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|So I heard about MCR on NPR, of all places. This album is one of the recommendations from Fresh Air.  NPR played \\"Teenagers,\\" which isn't like any of the other songs on the album, really.  (Teenagers is kitschy and old school-ish.)  And the previous reviewer was right - I kept hearing elements of older songs (Mama and Black Parade have Queen's four or five-stage setup - a song broken up into pieces), and some of the best words are taken from older songs (Paint It Black and something by Phil Collins). They also switch sounds and get into other characters - \\"House of Wolves\\" sounds like it IS another band than \\"I Don't Love You\\" - much like the Gerard Way in the video of Helena is not the Gerard Way of \\"Famous Last Words\\" or the GW in \\"I'm Not Ok.\\"<br /><br />So the reason I recommend it - even though this music is totally unlike my usual fare - is that it's damn passionate.  Before I knew anything about the band - it's a group that's giving their total heart to the music.  A geeky way of saying it would be it's a combo of Nirvana & Metallica and musical theater.  It's the feeling that you've found something wholly new, and something that is personal to you.<br /><br />The band itself also has a leetle tiny bit of the School House Rock element.  The album is cohesive, interesting and strangely addictive.  And a little perfect.  If you learn to love it, go back to the older songs - they're a little less perfect, and become a little more desperate and awesome.
069111966X|5.0|I know the original version seemed like it would be great for someone that study math or physics and was heavily involved with proofs. However after reading the whole book and with some time I was able to really apply it to how I solve engineering problems. I will be honest it took some trial and error but within a year I was able to completely changed the way I solved problems (i.e. it needed an overhaul). The area I use it the most is thermal fluid systems and have had many complements on the way I articulated or solved problems, and I'm not a genius. The book is helpful and for the price you could take away a couple of items with out a hit in the pocket and just be that much better at figuring out problems.
B00004TJKI|4.0|This was a very good movie, with suprisingly current themes for a movie from the 50's. It focuse on getting a technically guilty man off because it was the right thing to do from a human standpoint. James Stewart, George C Scott, Ben Gazzara, and Lee Remick were all excellent, especially the courtroom joisting between Stewart and Scott. Also an interesting primer on the social mores and attitudes of that time about rape and attitudes toward women in general.
B000LC3ICY|4.0|It's hard to believe, after watching this third installment in the uber-gory Saw series, that a fourth is in the making. This is not because the movies are running out of ideas (the twists, although expected, still have some creative bite to them) or because they are lacking a certain gruesome appeal (the films have a faithful fan base that has made the movies a Halloween tradition). Instead, it's because the makers of this third flick, by the last frame, appear to have painted themselves into a corner with a bucket of pig guts and brain juice.<br /><br />But, if there's one thing the Saw movies have to teach us (and they go out of their way to pretend that they have a lot of teaching to do), it's that appearances can be deceiving. This lesson I believe. The rest of Saw's lecturing, well, it's hard to listen to a sermon when the pastor is ripping your arm off.<br /><br />All of the usual suspects are back this time around, with Jigsaw (a pale-as-rainwater Tobin Bell) and his accomplice, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), providing us with yet another meticulously macabre experiment in death and personal redemption. This time the primary subjects are Jeff (a man subsumed by grief for his son, Dylan, killed by a hit-and-run driver) and Lynn (an ER doctor who is addicted to pain killers and her own ennui). Jeff is given the opportunity, in a series of tests, to watch those responsible for his son's demise (a witness, a judge, the driver himself) meet their maker. Or, if he chooses the moral high ground, Jeff can save them. Lynn, meanwhile, has a much easier task: keep the dying Jigsaw alive long enough to watch this last game play out. If Jigsaw's heart stops beating, so does hers.<br /><br />How Jeff and Lynn are connected is anyone's guess (and your first one will probably be right), but, as per usual, the film still has a few bloody aces up its sleeve. Shot in a line-up of primary colors (each scene has its own color schema) and grittily textured, it's the most visceral Saw, yet. Thankfully it doesn't trade (too much) of its brains for blood; just as the second film capitalized on elements of the first, this third covers the bases in all of them and -- if you watch close enough -- does, in fact, set up a few questions to be answered in a fourth.<br /><br />Some might not be interested in questions like these, though. Although the franchise hasn't really lost its edge, it does appear to be losing steam. Each Saw is staged, in some way, as a morality play, with people trapped inside their own brand of sick salvation. The first movie was both inventive and focused. The second widened its aim and, as such, missed a few targets. This third film, with its ever-more-intricate web of wicked wisdom, almost collapses under its own weight. Here's hoping that the next Saw tries to cut out its Deeper Message with a chainsaw, instead of a finely-edged scalpel.al Saw, yet.

B00004XONN|5.0|Even though OK Computer is their most successful album to date, they didn't stick with that sound and went in a new direction (which they always do) and this is part of the reason why they are my favorite band.  They don't make music that their fans necessarily want them to make, they make music that THEY want to make, and they'll keep doing it.

B000002G87|5.0|by an all-star group of musicians.  Using several members of the Delaney & Bonnie group of the 1960s/1970s, adding in Duane Allman and topping it off with Eric Clapton yielded a powerful, memorable group named Derek & The Dominos.  It released just this one album, but what a way to come in and go out.  \\"Layla,\\" of course, is known as the prime cut on the album, and itself is a classic song, but the other thirteen cuts contain a host of other great songs, such as \\"Anyday,\\" \\"I Looked Away,\\" \\"Key To The Highway,\\" and many more.  It's an excellently performed, mixed and memorable album that is a terrific addition to any collection.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I wouldn't really call this a punk album.  I think that it falls somewhere in the spectrum between rock and emo.  It has the heaviness of rock, but the choruses of emo.

If you like sissy punk bands like New Found Glory, or if you like heavier bands such as Breaking Benjamin, you will enjoy this album.  I'm just surprised that I haven't heard these guys on the radio more often.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|\\"Casino Royale\\" (2006) directed by Martin Campbell is different from the Bond movies I've seen but it is very good. Based on the first novel in the Bond series, it shows James Bond (Daniel Craig) in the beginning of his career. His mission is to destroy a corrupt banker LeChiffre (Mads Mikkelsen} at the poker tables where he never loses and wins a lot of money to supply the various terrorists' organizations. To accomplish this extremely dangerous task, Bond has to rely mostly on himself; there are no fancy gadgets that Q would provide him with. There is no Q either. I think it is the only Bond movie that lets us look rather briefly behind the Super-agent facade to see more human side of Bond. I don't remember any other Bond movie where he would be tortured in the way that made me truly uncomfortable. I also believe that it is the only (or one of very few) movie where Bond fell in love and as the result of that affair, he would never fell in love again. I have only seen Daniel Craig in two movies before \\"Casino Royale\\", \\"The Mother\\" (2003) and  \\"Munich\\" (2005) but he was memorable in both. As new James Bond, he is fabulous - a marvel to look at, he has unbelievably blue eyes, he is in a great shape (remember, he has to rely only on himself while chasing, fighting, shooting, and killing bad guys) and he delivers a very convincing James Bond, sharp, tough but vulnerable - the Bond for a new millennium.<br /><br />8.5/10

B000K7VHQE|4.0|I really don't want to talk about the plot of this movie, because it isn't all that complicated and watching it unfold is part of the movie's charm.  And, even more, I don't want to talk about the characters in this movie in much detail, although I am sure many others have.  I don't want to discuss the characters in detail because getting to know them individually and as one motley family is really the point of the whole exercise.<br /><br />The film has a terrific cast and each plays his or her role superbly.  Each makes a terrific contribution to the film, and given the special aspects of some of the characters, that is more of an achievement than you might at first expect.<br /><br />But how can I review this movie?  I think I describe what I took away from it (although you might take away very different things) and maybe offer you some suggestions of what to watch for as the story unfolds as you view the movie.  While the story is simple, it is exceedingly strange.  It might even disturb some to the point of turning it off.  Things are said that more crude than I remember ever being said in my family.  However, there are cruel things that are said in deep hurt that do ring true in their depth of pain if not in their specifics.<br /><br />What finally came from my exasperation with these characters is that they don't realize how much their own focus on what they need from outside of themselves to be happy is keeping them unhappy and keeps tripping them up.  Notice the difference in their individual happiness and joy as an extended family as they set aside these conditions and accept life for what it is offering at that moment.  One of them knows that all the way through the movie.  Notice her role in saving them even when they think it is the other way around.<br /><br />For those of you who avoid \\"R\\" rated movies, this has that rating because one member of the family stupidly uses drugs, there are some F-bombs and other profanities (but it doesn't swim in them), and there is a side issue with some porn magazines.  No, this isn't a movie to watch with young kids.  However, it ends up with some fairly strong values even in some very strange contexts.  It is also a group of characters and a van you will never ever forget.ith some porn magazines.  No, this isn't a movie to watch with young kids.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|I love musicals and this version of \\"Cats\\" has three great stars in it:  John Mills as Asparagus, Elaine Paige as Grizabella, and Ken Page was Old Deuteronomy.  The staging was fantastic and the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber is magical.  In my opinion, this is my favorite musical by A. L. Webber.  It's a movie that can be enjoyed by children and adults. <br />
0618680004|4.0|This is a well written, thought-provoking book that finally enabled me to come out of the closet as an atheist. However, I see two pronounced weaknesses. <br /> <br />First, Dawkins seems to have a personal vendetta against organized religion that detracts from his examination of the central question, \\"is there a god?\\". God either exists or it doesn't; the atrocities promulgated in the name of religion and the contradictory inanities in religious beliefs really have little to do with the answer to that central question.  <br /> <br />Second, as Dawkins freely admits, his expertise is in evolutionary biology. His knowledge of cognitive psychology is quite limited, and he wisely refrains from arguments based on this field. However, I found the most provocative ideas about the existence/nonexistence of god to come from the psycholgists, and specifically Atran's \\"In Gods We Trust\\", which should be read to supplement the information in Dawkins's book.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|The art of the swashbuckler is demanding and few make the grade to the very top, as does \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood,\\" starring Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHaviland with Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as the chief villains. A gift I gave to a ten year old grand nephew, who loves it, it combines perfectly lively action, suspense, romance and humor in a beautifully evoked if hardly realistic medieval setting. Recent commendable effors at swashbuckling like \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" which relies too much on gimics and special effects, even if it has a light touch; and \\"Master and Commander,\\" which strives too much for realism and becomes too serious, I believe fall short. For pure swashbuckling, with this \\"Robin Hood\\" I'd include \\"Gunga Din,\\" with a stellar cast that includes Cary Grant, and \\"The Sea Hawk,\\" again with Flynn, at the very pinnacle. 1939's British \\"Four Feathers\\" comes close; the 2002 Heath Ledger version I find a disaster. Most of the rest in the swashbuckler stratosphere are also from Hollywood's golden years, 1935-41, although a few have appeared since, but these, such as \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" aim for historical drama and lack the light touch of a true swashbuckler.
B000002LBH|5.0|This is by far the best Smiths collection you can get. Not only is it the biggest(24 tracks) but it's also a great glimpse into The Smiths back catalog of b-sides. Some of the tracks I could of done without (Unloveable, Golden lights) and had them replaced with some classic tracks (That Joke isn't funny anymore, barbarism begins at home)but it's a great collection none the less. One of the jems on Bombs is the collection exculsive \\"Asleep\\" which is one of the most beautiful and tear jerking songs The Smiths ever wrote, and as we all know they wrote alot of them. So yes. Pick this up if you're tired of your Best of Vol 1 and 2 and want to listen to the real meat of The Smiths. you won't be disapointed
B0007TKNL0|5.0|First, you have to like musicals. Second, you have to like the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Third, you have to understand that a movie is a different animal from a stage play. And fourth, you have to be open to a different, younger interpretation of the story than the stage version. If you accept those four conditions, you will love this film.<br /><br />The two-disc special edition is well worth the extra money. There are two extensive features: one tells the story of how the stage musical came to be; the second, how the film originated and developed. If you ever had a question about either the play or the film, they're answered here.<br /><br />In taking Phantom from stage to screen - making it the most expensive independent film in history - Webber increased his orchestra to over 100 pieces. So the music has never sounded better, making the CD equally necessary for the Phantom fan. In addition, he wanted to use a rock-and-roll voice for the Phantom, rather than a trained voice like Michael Crawford - thus, the choice of Gerard Butler (Dear Frankie, Beowulf and Grendel) for the role. This is probably the stickiest point for Phantom fans that expected the rich tones of a Crawford or Hart. But Butler does an admirable job. My only complaint is that he is so covered up with mask, wig, makeup and costume that there is very little of Butler left to look at. If you've seen him in other films, he has a strong masculine look. So you get little more than his voice. But even with those restrictions, he creates an emotionally appealing Phantom.<br /><br />It was director Joel Schumacher's (Batman Forever, Phone Booth, The Lost Boys) idea to give Phantom a younger cast and look, so that it would appeal to younger audiences. Part of his justification was that Christine is so naïve and innocent, how could she not be younger. Emmy Rossum (The Day After Tomorrow, An American Rhapsody) fills the role perfectly, with a beautifully mesmerizing face and equally beautiful voice - though not with the vocal strength of a Sarah Brightman, for whom Webber wrote the role as a testament to his love. Patrick Wilson (Oklahoma on Broadway, The Alamo), as Raoul, fills out the three main principals, and is probably the most solid of the group, both dramatically and vocally, though his role is the smallest.<br /><br />The supporting cast is equally stunning, headed by Miranda Richardson as a compelling Madam Giry; Minnie Driver as a delightfully self-obsessed Carlotta (dubbed vocally by Margaret Preece - except for the final, hauntingly beautiful credits song, \\"Learn To Be Lonely,\\" which was nominated for an Oscar); Ciaran Hinds as flamboyant opera owner Firmin; Simon Callow as Andre his partner; Jennifer Ellison as winsome Meg Giry; and Kevin McNally as devious Buquet.<br /><br />The production design by Anthony Pratt (2001: A Space Odyssey) is exquisitely colorful - certainly romantic, but not gothic or scary enough for many Phantom fans, even though it was nominated for an Oscar. The cinematography by John Mathieson (Gladiator) was also nominated, and is breathtaking, for the most part, with many standouts, including the \\"Overture,\\" the transition in \\"Think of Me,\\" \\"Prima Donna,\\" \\"All I Ask of You\\" (rooftop scene), and the chandelier crash; as well as the grainy black-and-white sequences. My favorite is the shot at the end of \\"Prima Donna,\\" in which the camera cranes back from the stage, through the curtain and into the house, with the curtain closing behind it. That shot was masterful, and one of the finest in film history, in my opinion.<br /><br />It is no easy task bringing a stage musical to the screen. They rarely succeed. Most successful movie musicals (e.g., Sound Of Music, Singin' In The Rain, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, An American In Paris) were written for the screen. There are exceptions: My Fair Lady and West Side Story; but it's always a gamble. In spite of the critics, I think Phantom is one of the better ones. I wish there were more.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith
0446615625|4.0|The Camel Club centers around a rag-tag group of conspiracy theorists who find themselves witnessing a murder that leads them directly into the type of things they hypothesize about.  The plot moves along at a swift pace with seemingly unrelated characters coming together throughout.  There were some areas in the book where it seemed Baldacci was either trying to get us into the mindset of the terrorists or trying to make a political statement to show where the US is or has been wrong, in his mind.  But that aside, I did enjoy this book as I have all of the Baldacci books I've read.

B0000797IO|5.0|Every once in a while, a movie comes out that is very subtle, yet very direct. A movie that is both depressive, yet laugh-out-loud funny. These movies leave you playing with your thoughts, looking at life from a different point of view.  \\"The Good Girl\\" is one of those movies.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston made a complete U-turn by making this movie, because it is incredibly different then her signature character, Rachel in \\"Friends\\". In \\"Friends\\", she is quirky and goofy, but here, she is confused, depressed and, simply, amazing. Her portrayal of Justine Last, a woman who is mentally brought down by life and obligations, is sincere and Oscar-worthy. Aniston makes sure Justine is someone the audience can relate to, as she copes with the themes of solitude, love, infidelity and honesty.<br /><br />Justine works in a ridiculous store, where every day is the same and nothing is ever interesting. Her husband paints houses, is stoned all the time and doesn't give much thought to whatever happens behind Justine's façade. Things change when she meets the new clerk, Tom a.k.a. Holden, who is a \\"Catcher in the Rye\\"-obsessed existentialist. Partially because of his mysterious appearance, partially because of his age (he is ten years younger then she is) and mostly because he seems like he understands her, Justine falls for him and they start a relationship that is impossible to get out of. This provides a crucial decision Justine faces - is life about expectations and obligations, or is it about that little dose of craziness that is needed in order to stay sane.<br /><br />What makes this movie a believable drama instead of a pointless downer, are the characters. John C. Reilly plays Justine's husband, and it seems like it is the role he shines in (remember \\"Chicago\\", or the very similar \\"The Hours\\"?), whereas Jake Gyllenhaal nails Holden, his feelings and conflicts he faces. However, the show is stolen by Jennifer Aniston, who makes a statement with this movie, that she is a great actress. Her timing (both comedic and dramatic) is flawless, her walk, posture and accent believable and in character.  She makes this movie worth-buying and watching at least once a year, when one feels shallow or monotone. \\"The Good Girl\\" works on many levels, and the catharsis it provides is the reason why they make movies in the first place.Her timing (both comedic and dramatic) is flawless, her walk, posture and accent believable and in character.

Her words are like poems (words to the songs are included with the cd).  I love her two most popular songs right now.  \\"Put your Records on\\" is a song for the girl that feels like she doesn't fit in anywhere.  She's telling her to just be herself and don't care what others say.  Her other song, and my favorite, is \\"Like a Star\\".  This is the most beautiful love song that I've ever heard.  Buy this cd.  This is the best cd for those days when you've had a hard day at work and just want to come home, drink a glass of wine, and relax.  Great cd!

B000ICL3KG|4.0|The film is simply one of the best illustrated science films you will see.  The graphics are superb.  Better than just that, they are spiced with very thought-provoking vignettes from Al Gore's life.  The most touching is the story of his sister's death from lung cancer, followed by his father's recognition that being a tobacco farmer did not cut it in the moral sphere.  By the same token this business of global warming through our societal addiction to oil, coal and other \\"cheap\\" (if you don't count the consequences) fuels, is also brought out as a moral issue for our generation.  So this film is not just a science film, it is a morality play in which you and I are players.  It won't get you depressed, but it will get you in action.

B00005JLT5|5.0|I'm ashamed to admit that it's taken me four years to finally see Roman Polanski's The Pianist.  Why?  I have absolutely no idea.  I guess I thought I wouldn't enjoy it for some strange reason.  I will say that I've always considered Chinatown to be Mr. Polanski's best film, but I now have to change that and put The Pianist at the top of the list.  This film is literally his masterpiece.  Why it didn't beat out Chicago for the best movie of 2003, I don't know.  Maybe the Academy members were smoking too much weed that year and didn't realize what film they were actually voting for.  Whatever the reason, The Pianist is definitely an Oscar-caliber motion picture, while Chicago is only a decent musical.  Of course, I didn't know that at the time.  About the only thing I remember from the 2003 Academy Awards is Adrien Brody putting a real lip-lock on the beautiful Halle Berry when he won for Best Actor.<br /><br />With over three hundred reviews, I think most everybody now knows that The Pianist is a true story based on the personal experiences of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew and concert pianist who lived in Warsaw during World War II and struggled to survive the Holocaust with the aid of both Jewish and non-Jewish lovers of music, especially a German officer who fed him and allowed him to hide in the attic of the German field station as the Russians made their way into Warsaw.  That Mr. Szpilman was able to survive the horrors of what transpired in Warsaw is a testament to his perseverance, inner strength, and the kindness of others who risked their lives to hide him.<br /><br />Mr. Polanski was able to bring to life the cold harshness of war-torn Warsaw and the infamous Ghetto through his brilliant Production Designer, Allan Starski and the Director of Photography, Pawel Edelman.  There was one scene in particular when Szpilman climbs over a wall to escape from burning up in a deserted hospital and sees the skeleton remains of hundreds of buildings in the near distance.  This was a jaw-dropping moment of pure movie magic.  The cruelty of the German soldiers, though not as explicit as it was in Schindler's List, still resonates with the poignant message of what evil man is capable of perpetrating on his fellow human beings.  There were scenes in the movie that left you utterly speechless like when the Germans throw an old man in a wheelchair off a third floor balcony because he's unable to stand when they enter his home, or when a German officer orders several Jewish prisoners to lie face down on a street for no apparent reason, and then shoots each of them in the back of the head, having to reload for the last person.  That grabbed you in the gut and made you feel a deep sorrow for what was allowed to happen.  It's difficult to believe that this was only sixty years ago and that forms of genocide are still taking place in the world of today.  Needless to say, The Pianist is an extremely powerful movie with an amazing performance by Adrien Brody, who's in almost every single scene.  This man certainly deserved his Academy Award, not to mention that delicious kiss with Halle Berry.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed Schindler's List, or simply loves an excellent movie with great performances.near distance.

B000002IVF|3.0|As I'm in the process of rounding out my David Crosby collection, it was finally time to get \\"A Thousand Roads.\\"  I knew nothing about the album, and after reading all the reviews here and elsewhere, I downloaded it with one eye closed and a slight grimace.<br /><br />The good news is that I was well-prepared for what was to come.  Based on what I'd read, I knew there was going to be a lot of \\"stuff\\" behind David that I wasn't used to, and there was.  Right off the bat with \\"Hero,\\" I shuddered a little.  It's not offensive, it's just not the sound you'd expect from a David Crosby song (although it's exactly what you'd expect from a Phil Collins song).  The tracks got better from there.<br /><br />Even though there's only one song fully penned by David (the title track), the songs are beautifully written and complementary to his incredible voice. Of course some I liked better than others, notably \\"Yvette in English,\\" the Joni Mitchell track.  Think about it.  Could David Crosby singing a Joni Mitchell song possibly be bad?<br /><br />And hearing the occasional familiar voices in the background (Jackson and Graham) and Jeff Pevar's unmistakable mastery on the guitar was an added treat.<br /><br />There's only one song that I really dislike on the CD and that's \\"Coverage.\\"  It's just not David in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />Overall, I would say if you're like me and just absolutely love David's voice, by all means get this CD.  If you're a fan craving more of \\"If I Could Only Remember My Name,\\" then you should probably skip it.<br /><br />Below is a track list with the songwriters' credits so you can see who wrote what:<br /><br />HERO (Phil Collins/David Crosby)<br />TOO YOUNG TO DIE (Jimmy Webb)<br />OLD SOLDIER (Marc Cohn)<br />THROUGH YOUR HANDS (John Hiatt)<br />YVETTE IN ENGLISH (Joni Mitchell/David Crosby)<br />THOUSAND ROADS (David Crosby)<br />COLUMBUS (Noel Brazil)<br />HELPLESS HEART (Paul Brady)<br />COVERAGE  (Bonnie Hayes)<br />NATALIE (Stephen Bishop)
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|THE ILLUSIONIST is a great film filled with enchantment, mystery, and real emotion.  Edward Norton delivers a stunning portrayal of Eisenheim, a magician who has captured the attention of audiences throughout Europe with his masterful illusions and sleight-of-hand.  Jessica Biel co-stars as Sophie, and Paul Giamatti is an absolute delight as Inspector Uhl.<br /><br />The movie is narrated by Inspector Uhl throughout, and that device -- so much like Sherlock Holmes's Watson -- is at once deceptively trustworthy and likeable.  Everything we see and hear is filtered through Uhl's perceptions and own involvement with the principal cast.<br /><br />The movie opens up with Eisenheim performing one of his nightly routines, and Norton is at his seductive best in this opening.  His voice, his mannerisms, and his look drew me in and put me in one of those seats.  I was astonished to watch what he did.<br /><br />But the story only began there.  It quickly segued back into Eisenheim's childhood, and his adolescent romance with Sophie.  According to Uhl's account, Eisenheim was the son of a carpenter who barely made ends meet.  Then one day the boy met a magician who showed him some magic tricks.  Seized by what he had seen, the boy taught himself magic, created tricks, and learned from anyone who knew anything.<br /><br />During that time, he met Sophie.  The children played together, but Sophie's parents found out and took her away, telling the boy he wasn't good enough for her.<br /><br />Now, in Vienna, Eisenheim and Sophie's paths have crossed again, and they find that the love they had for each other has never wavered.  I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a love story, and this one was so well done it just takes the breath way.<br /><br />Part of what makes THE ILLUSIONIST work so well is the period piece costumes and sets.  Even the camera work, with its sepia tones and use of what looks like natural lighting, is beautiful.  The movie made me feel I was back during those times, watching the story unfold.<br /><br />Of course, for a love story like this to work properly, there has to be a villain.  Rufus Sewell play Crown Prince Leopold, the man who desires Sophie's hand in marriage.  Leopold also has a reputation for abusing -- and perhaps murdering -- the women in his life.<br /><br />To tell anything further would be a crime.  THE ILLUSIONIST is an elegant story that has fascinating twists and turns, an elegant sense of pacing, and a story that is timeless.ring those times, watching the story unfold. <br /> <br />Of course, for a love story like this to work properly, there has to be a villain.

B000006Y4E|5.0|For any Def Leppard fan or fan or hard rock this is one of those \\"must have\\" albums. They just should've left \\"Bringin' On the Heartache\\" (Remix) and \\"Me & My Wine\\" on it. Both of those tracks rock. If you can find the 1984 version get it. Both above tracks are on it. It's worth the money! It's also too bad they only made three videos from the album. I would love to have seen a video for \\"Lady Strange\\" That would've been very interesting. Otherwise it rocks!!

B000F8O35U|1.0|Well i had ordered this item for a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. When i bought it it said that i would receive it the Friday before Christmas. I paid extra for shipping to make sure it got here on time. I didn't get it until two days after Christmas, i was pretty pissed. It was sent through DHL and they said they messed it up, so i don't blame amazon. I only gave it a two stars because, yes the item was shipped in the condition it was supposed to be in. But that doesn't change the fact that i didn't get it for Christmas.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie/documentary should change the way people live.  Everyone on this planet needs to take responsibility for the way we live.  The lazy, self-absorbing lifestyle adopted by many is destroying the planet.  If the facts and footage in the film do not make people understand the social significance of global warming-nothing will.
0060776757|5.0|My wife has been a long time U2 Fan - since Junior High School in fact - and for her, finally having a book about the life and ideals of the band from the band itself was such a great gift.  She has come to know them through their lyrics, their performances, news stories and other books, but she says, reading this book is like getting to know them again for the first time.  The book is filled with personal, poignant, exciting experiences, and explains so much about the life of the band and each person, that for a fan of the band its nearly impossible to put down once reading begins.  She spent many late nights reading and learning.  She claims it is one of the most enjoyable books she has ever read about the band - it is certainly the best book about U2 ever written.
0618680004|1.0|Richard Dawkins breaks no new ground in this rehash of his hatred of all things related to God. If you have never read Dawkins then have a go, but beware that he does not write objectively. There are solid reasons why many people believe in a God, but he will two step around them. And then he gets into the multiple universe thing and the endless possible chances for life. Multiple universes...like that has scientific proof backing it up. And he has a problem explaining how the universe, or if you will, universes ever came to exist.How does something come from nothing? At least in Dawkins case nothing, his book, came from something. You can go on line and find all this stuff for free.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|When my science teacher said that we were going to watch this I was slightly hesitant.  I will be honest- before i watched this I didn't particualy care a whole bunch about the enviroment.  It definatly is something that's important to me, but let's just say then it wasn't in my top 10 list of pressing matters.  I actually think that's why this movie is so good.  It's educating one about global warming, treating it as a pressing problem but in terms that everyone can understand.  Al Gore is suprisingly a genuine, and funny lecturer on this pressing manner. This movie also made me aware that global warming isn't just a matter we can push aside- if nothing's done, it will be my generation and my kids generations that's hit the hardest with this. <br />My only critique could be some of the flashbacks- as Gore talked about some of the politicons he came off a little bit bitter.  It seemed as if he was implying that if he was elected to office none of this would have happened.  Take what you will of this opinion, and I won't say more about this subject, as it's neither the place nor the time to argue about politics.  I just felt that the movie probably could have done without flashback's about his electons, though on the other hand some of the other flashbacks, such as the story about his sister really helped bring a sense of humanity to the movie.  While I definatly believe there has been a lot of propoganda concering global warning, I felt that some of the stuff he shared in this movie, were a bit to personal, and unrelated to the overall message. <br />I truly think however that this is a film that every child and adult, especially in America should be required to see.   It shows us that we definatly have the power to change this, because if we don't we will soon reep the desatorous consequences.  As the Native American Proverb says \\"We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.\\"

B00023B1LC|5.0|I'm old enough to remember the cold war and all the good spy movies that went with it. While it was certainly great that this period in history came to an end, it seemed all the well-made suspenseful spy books and movies went with it.  <br /> <br />So I was very excited when I went to see The Bourne Indentity at the theater and I was not disappointed. The action is crisp and the fight scenes very realistic--no superhero stuff. Also, the protaganist, Matt Damon, is not presented as a hero, but a complicated individual, and I found myself wondering what had led him to his life as a spy/killer in the first place. <br /> <br />Matt Damon is very convincing in this and his costar, Franka Potente, is a breath of fresh air. A real European with a European look and a good actress.
0375751513|5.0|This book was given to me as a gift. I didn't really intend on reading it, but after fumbling through the first chapter, I was intrigued and soon thereafter was captivated by it.  This book has mixed themes that are gothic horror at one moment, amoral and corrupt the next, followed by social political statement.  I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read.  This book is full of quotes and one liners that are striking, thought provoking, and even horrifying to the reader. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great book to read and discuss with a friend or a book club.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|The Passion of the Christ is a work of art that does more than just inspire. I am by no means a religious person, but I am a spiritual person. I heard much controversey about this movie before it came out, but it was my heart that brought me to see it not the controversey. I also wanted to support Mel Gibson who raised his own 25 million dollars to make this movie because no one in Hollywood would dare back him up. No need to feel sorry for Mel though, because now this movie has made over 300 million dollars. I knew that with the most famous man in the world (Jesus Christ) that this was going to be a movie that was going to create much dialogue. Never in my life have I been so touched by a movie like I was with this one. The strange thing was that even though this movie was not filmed in english, the story about Jesus was something that crossed language barriers across the world. When you see what Jesus went through in this film it just pulls at your heart and makes you appreciate what Jesus did for us all. This is a graphic movie but what would you expect from a crucifixion. One of the many touching moments of this film is when the drop of water from heaven falls when Jesus died I felt it was God the father crying for giving his son to cleanse us for all our sins. James Caviezel (who playes Jesus in the movie) did a truly amazing job and I truly believe God was shining through this actor. This guy should have won an Oscar for his performance, but he did not even get nominated. I believe no one could have played Jesus like this man did, and this was the role he was born to play. Some people said no ordinary man would be able to continue living through this torture, but James Caviezel pointed out in an interview Jesus Christ is no ordinary human being. The Passion of The Christ will inspire you and touch your heart like few movies can, but most importantly if your a believer it will stay with you the rest of your life!<br /><br />With this new Two-Disc Definitive Edition you get the original theatrical version and a toned down less violent version!<br /><br />DVD Features:<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />Available Subtitles: English, Spanish<br />Available Audio Tracks: English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), (Dolby Digital 5.1)<br />Menus - Drissi<br />Feature Video<br />Passion Re-Cut (seamlessly branched)<br />Filmmaker Commentary with Mel Gibson, Caleb Deschanel, and John Wright (original cut only)<br />Production Commentary withStephen McEveety, Ted Rae and Keith Vanderlaan (original cut only)<br />Theologian Commentary with MelGibson, Father William J.

B000ICLHIE|5.0|.....come over to Tom's for dinner on a regular basis.  That is how I would describe Tom Waits' music to someone unfamiliar with him.  I have enjoyed his music since a friend introduced me to it in High School 20-some years ago.  This is actually my first album of his. Why?  Because I wasn't sure what album should be my entry point.  Now I know I could easily break the bank investing in the rest of his catalogue.  But for someone familiar with his work who likes what they have heard, I think this is a good place to start. The deliniations between discs make it easy to pick one if you are in a certain mood (and shuffle is good as well if yer not picky) And the f&@ked up disc three is my favorite.

It is indeed a dilemma!  <br /> <br />I found particularly interesting the history of corn, the government subsidies instituted in the 1970's and how this has led to industrialized farming. Did you know that high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)wasn't even invented until 1980?  Now it's in everything.  No wonder this country has a problem with obesity!

B000HEYVD6|3.0|After having read most of Baldacci's previous novels, I was expecting a reasonably good political thriller.  What I was not expecting was a political commentary.<br /><br />And therein lies my problem with this book: Baldacci's \\"it's really America's fault\\" apologetics for Middle Eastern terrorism were both unsolicited and tiresome.  It's one thing to develop your antagonists (in this case, Middle Eastern terrorists) sufficiently so that we understand their motivations and thinking rather than treating them as cardboard cutouts...but it's quite another to present their thinking in a way that tells us none-too-subtly that the author is sympathetic to it.  That's what Baldacci does here.  If I want a political commentary or essay, I'll buy one - but I don't think I'm alone in objecting to having them included like Trojan horses in my fictional reading.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - I like Baldacci as an author, and I've found his past books to be enjoyable.  He's not necessarily the best in this genre (I much prefer Grisham), but I could rely on him to be consistent in giving me an entertaining read without his personal politics bleeding through.  That clearly wasn't the case here, and it soured what would have otherwise been a reasonably good - if highly improbable - yarn.<br /><br />In this book we're given a group of four eclectic individuals that look for government conspiracies and call themselves the Camel Club:  A computer geek with Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder.  An eccentric librarian who prefers clothing from the 19th century.  A Vietnam Vet and former DIA employee with issues.  And their leader, a mysterious ex-CIA agent who calls himself Oliver Stone, maintains a tent outside the White House from which to protest, and patterns his grooming habits after the homeless.  The four have little in common other than their paranoia and their distrust of the US government.<br /><br />While conducting one of their clandestine meetings, they accidently witness a killing.  Gradually, they become aware that what they witnessed was the assasination of a guy who \\"knew too much\\" as part of a much larger plot involving Middle Eastern terrorists, the head of Homeland Security, and the President of the United States (or POTUS as the novel likes to refer to him).  It falls to this foursome of improbable protagonists, along with a recently demoted Secret Service agent named Alex Ford and his Justice Department girlfriend, Kate Adams, to foil the plot and save the day.<br /><br />While the book kept me turning the pages, I was distinctly unimpressed with the author's apparently irresistable urge to tell us how he thinks we should solve the problems in the Middle East, and why most of the problems there are ultimately the fault of America.<br /><br />However, I did like the quirkiness of the foursome that comprised the Camel Club, and it sounds like Baldacci is keeping them intact in his next book, \\"The Collectors.\\"  While I plan to read that book in the next few months, I'm hoping it won't be another thinly vieled political commentary.me aware that what they witnessed was the assasination of a guy who \\"knew too much\\" as part of a much larger plot involving Middle Eastern terrorists, the head of Homeland Security, and the President of the United States (or POTUS as the novel likes to refer to him).

0446677450|4.0|I love this book.  Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a story of a boy with two fathers.  His biological father is a well educated government employee and is known as his Poor Dad.  His friend's father is his Rich Dad.  He is an uneducated entrepreneur.  The book teaches us the difference between the rich and poor mindset.  If you've been taught that you need to get good grades, go to college, and get a good job to move ahead in life, you need to read this book.  The information in this book will help you reprogram everything you've learned about making money and building wealth.  Everyone should read this book!  I only wish I would have read it sooner!
B000JMK8R4|3.0|Sorry, but I didn't find any great revelations in this book - it's a book I read in 30 minutes (\\"slice of life\\" anecdotes) and will never pick up again. Maybe because as a creative person I already had some of this stuff ingrained in me by nature. Also there were more penises than I cared to see in this book. I'll still give it 3 stars though because a stiff businessperson may find it enlightening.
0689865384|5.0|Tally Youngblood has been brought up in a world where people are considered ugly after age 12, when they are sent to live in Uglyville. Everyone is given an operation to become pretty at age 16. Tally is almost 16 and can hardly wait to get her operation, but she makes a new friend who feels differently. While it seems a minor problem, it evolves into something much bigger. Suddenly Tally questions everything she has ever believed in. And now the only thing that seems important to her is the horrible truth she has learned about becoming pretty. <br />  <br /> Uglies is a phenomenal example of how distorted society's idea of beauty is, and what happens when normal isn't good enough. It reminds us that beauty comes from within, and it also explores the fact that we must listen to our instincts when it comes to knowing what's right, even if that means not always trusting the authorities. I would recommend Uglies to everyone as it has a very important message and especially to anyone who enjoys exciting, futuristic books. <br />

If you like this musical atmosphere, I highly recommend the Soundtrack \\"Kingdom of Heavens\\" which delivers the same musical atmosphere of similar historical background.

0380715430|3.0|Bryson can be a witty writer . . . sometimes. But he's a journalist, not a linguist -- and certainly not a \\"language scholar\\" as some of the reviews claim. In fact, this book reads like a longer version of the sort of term paper a college freshman might put together all from secondary sources and with no sense of critical construction and no insight whatever. First, he spends several chapters explaining how language in general works, how it originated, what \\"Indo-European\\" means, and so on; he doesn't get down to discussing English in any detail until Chapter 7. He repeats folktales like the Eskimos having thirty words for snow, . . . which was shown several decades ago to have been made up by some other journalist in need of a pithy factoid. As a longtime genealogist, I turned to the chapter on names with interest, but found nothing at all new. In fact, Bryson seems to spend most of his time listing interesting examples instead of extending his discussion of the principles they are intended to illuminate. There are a fair number of readable anecdotes here, but not much else.
B000C20VRS|5.0|I finally got this classic on DVD and part of me is glad I got it while the other part of me is a bit disappointed. Without a doubt, Pacino is excellent as Tony Montana, the Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute; who works his way speedily up the crime career ladder to become one of the most powerful druglords in Miami. As always, he immerses himself in the role and with the scar down his face, the perpetual sneer and the Cuban accent, he literally becomes Tony Montana. It's only towards the end that I saw the mask slip but it was only momentary.<br /><br />From the gutter to obscene amounts of riches in next to no time, Montana doesn't quite know what to do with all the wealth he's amassed. Not only that, he allows himself to start believing his own hype, to overestimate his own significance and to believe that he's literally invincible. I can see why many in the hip-hop fraternity are said to love the movie, or more specifically, why they love Tony Montana and all that he stands for. He lives it large for a good minute, never lets anyone look down on him and goes out in a blaze of glory but in the end, it all seems so pitiful and pointless.<br /><br />Take Pacino out of the equation though and to me, this movie is nothing but a cheap gangster flick. Not even the star turns by Michelle Pfeiffer, Steve Bauer, Robert Loggia and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio would've saved it without him. Pacino makes it a classic five star must see. It's no wonder he's rated not just as an A-list movie star but more relevantly, as one of the greatest actors of our generation.

B00006JU7T|5.0|\\"The Godfather\\" may have alerted us to the great actor Al Pacino but that classic first instalment of the trilogy was really Marlon Brando's movie. It was Sidney Lumet's \\"Serpico\\" released a year later, that confirmed his status as a movie star in his own right. This true story of an NYPD cop standing alone in the midst of corruption on a staggering scale, is both compelling and engaging. Pacino immerses himself in the role and it's not only his appearance that changes as the movie progresses. It seemed as though I could see the exhaustion gradually wearing him down from the sheer stress of trying to do his job with integrity, while enduring the hostility of his colleagues and the futility of fighting a system he couldn't beat. I loved every minute. I love these old-school New York movies anyway (made back when cars still had yellow licence plates) and even the music, by Mikis Theodorakis and arranged & conducted by jazz legend Bob James, was brilliant. Supporting cast give great performances, especially Barbara Edna-Young as Serpico's long-suffering girlfriend Laurie but this is essentially Pacino's movie.<br /><br />The DVD extras include the original theatrical trailer, and a couple of documentaries: \\"Serpico: from Real to Reel\\", a very interesting one that tells the story of how the book by Peter Maas got made into the movie, \\"Inside Serpico\\" is another short with Sidney Lumet telling us about some of his methods making the actual movie, there's \\"Serpico: Favourite Moments\\" with both producer and director telling what some of their favourite scenes in the movie are and finally, there's a Photogallery of stills with commentary from director Sidney Lumet also talking about how the movie was scored.<br /><br />This is a must for any Pacino fan or any lover of classic movies.

B00078807U|3.0|The film itself is a 5 star production. If you don't mind subtitles, this movie is great. The GITS world is amazing and the visual effects are spectacular. I didn't have a problem with the subtitles because of the extra caption-like features but I did have a problem since this is not an English dubbed verson as the Product Features indicate.
0757302661|4.0|I bought this book because I was really curious about hypnobirthing and I was trying to decide if it was for me.  I've been taking Bradley classes to prepare for a natural birth. Yet, I know a few people who claim that Hypnobirthing really helped them.  It was definitely a good intro to the technique.  I learned about the terminology, breathing and visualization techniques involved with hypnobirthing.  It even comes with a CD that I may use during my own labor. I'm not sure that this book is detailed enough to replace taking a Hypnobirthing class though.  I also don't think I would feel confident enough to employ this technique just after reading the book.  I would also suggest that if you are serious about trying hypnobirthing you begin early in your pregnancy.  This might really give you the opportunity to master all of the techniques provided.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|This film adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is certain to become a classic. It is equisitely filmed in the English countryside in an authentic century English home, wonderfully acted by a delightful and scrupulously chosen cast, beautifully produced and directed with resplendent art direction and costumes, and features Dario Marianelli's Oscar-nominated original score that is consistently endearing to the ear, mind and senses.<br /><br />Keira Knightley, one of England's best actors, plays Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, an Englishwoman of dubious breeding that nonetheless is headstrong, opinionated, domineering and silly. She makes good and bad decisions and is smart enough to change her mind about the bad ones. The story revolves around Lizzy and her four sisters, her parents, the royal beau that will become her husband, and members of his family. A splendid supporting cast including Donald Sutherland, Judi Densch and Jean Malone forms the foundation for Knightley's electric performance in the lead role.<br /><br />Jane Austen (1775-1817) was a peer of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) and lived during the crossover from the Classical to Romantic eras in music, art and literature. Her half-dozen novels form the basis for the comedy of manners in England's class society of the 1700s. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is said to be the most romantic book ever written. Even through the script varies from the novel's storyline, this memorable film adaptation mirrors the wit, humor, empathy, love, jealousy and realism of family dynamics portrayed in Austen's novel.<br /><br />A cherry on top is provided by Jean Thibeaudet's rapturuous piano playing in the original score, the best film score I've heard since \\"The Pianist\\". While the influence of early Beethoven is clear in the main theme and much of the score is authentic to the period, some of the music is too romantic and belongs to the mid-1800s. This and other minor blemishes aside, this is a remarkable film treatment of a classic novel that provides romance, humor, wonder and satisfaction.

B000J103PC|4.0|Andrea (Anne Hathaway) moves to New York to get a job as a journalist. She winds up getting a job as an assistant to the editor in chief of a huge fashion magazine (Runway). The assistant job and Andrea's boss (Meryl Streep) become all consuming and start jeopardizing Andrea's relationships. <br /> <br />Similar types of stories have been done in the past but in The Devil Wears Prada - the dialogue, story and acting are enough to keep the viewer entertained.   <br /> <br />Some things I don't understand are when Andrea's boyfriend confronts Andrea and says he doesn't care if she is pole dancing, as long as she does it with integrity. Is he trying to say any type of a job has integrity but not one where your boss is constantly calling you? Another time was also very strange when Andrea adamantly states \\"I'm not your baby\\" to a guy after sleeping with him and barely even knowing him.  So suddenly after doing the deed she is a classy woman? <br /> <br />There were some funny parts in the movie. Meryl Streep was great as the boss from hell. I would recommend this movie. <br />
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai is a true classic, hands down. I was a bit skeptical to be honest about such raving reviews of this movie and when I got it, I was stoked to have gotten such a lovely package of DVD and that it was the Criterion Collection which made it feel more special. I intended to just watch some of it to get a feel for what the film felt like... but I ended up watching the WHOLE movie on both DVD discs it was formatted on and it was several hours well spent. The story is seemingly simple, but the character development, engaging plot and extremely addictive screenplay was too much to let down. Every moment in the movie captivated me, there wasn't the slightest of a dull moment, and when there was a still moment, the cinematography to capture each scene was so well done, they felt like paintings; or extremely well-done photos to just look at and admire... this movie was purely beyond its time and I almost feel like alot of homage should be paid to this movie by all other directors and future filmmakers, or to say the least, should pay tribute to it and watch it more than once as I know I probably will watch it again, and again, and many more times in the future, with friends, with family, and ultimately by myself to admire and enjoy because this movie was purely a thing that touches the soul. <br /> <br />It made me laugh. <br /> <br />It made me cry. <br /> <br />It made me explode with abundancies of emotions I cannot point to just one feeling alone... this movie is hands down AMAZING! THE BEST! PERFECT! Truly a timeless classic. <br /> <br />I am so glad I got this movie and will be cherishing it for so many years to come.

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Enough has been said about the plot and I don't deny that the movie was quite good, definitely worthy of a viewing and of the four out of five stars rating.  Jessica Biel, who has never been more than a pretty face even did a great job.  However, Prestige came out within months of the Illusionist, both set in a similar time period and centered around a magician, but somehow I feel that Prestige was the better movie.  Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Scarlett Johansson had amazing performances to go with an incredible story.  If you enjoyed this movie, I'm sure you'll love the Prestige.

B000I5X81K|3.0|I like the first part of this album, but not the latter part. Pop singers are a dime-a-dozen, Josh has honest vocal talent that shouldn't be wasted on that venue.  I hope his next album does away with the pop and sticks to letting us hear that wonderful voice of his.  I can listen to a catchy beat on any radio station.  I listen to Josh to hear his beautiful voice (even if I don't understand a word of Italian! LOL).
B000G73UEU|5.0|Whether you already know this unique poet and artist or you are just discovering him, you won't want to deprive yourself of the gift of hearing his music through the voices of many other gifted artists, such as Perla Batalla, Bono, and Rufus Wainwright. It's worth it just to hear the Batalla/Christensen version of Anthem. And if you like this and want to hear more recent Cohen work in his own voice, I recommend Dear Heather.
1558908846|5.0|In all honest I had NO idea there was a comic book of this when Judge Dredd came out. I was only 10 years old when the movie came out and I still remember it to the day that this movie was just hands down fantastic. To me, this movie was like The Fifth Element of its time and I feel as though the aesthetics to The Fifth Element should pay a huge amount of homage to Judge Dredd (as well as Bladerunner but that's a given). Had I knew about the comic then even as a kid, I would've given some props up to the tribute it made but because I didn't, I still acclaim this as an idea all its own and to this day, I still haven't read a single page of Judge Dredd, and I kind of don't want to because I love the stellar performance that Sly puts in with Joseph Dredd. <br /> <br />The movie, despite being a hardcore 90's action movie has elements I overlooked as a kid and now that I'm much older, I've noticed things I never noticed or rememberred and it felt like a brand new movie to me with the reminiscence of it being so much familiar. It has every little bit of action movie I remember being cool back in the day and all that movies today can barely mark up to; some people may hate it, alot of people may love it, a majority may be null about it, but to me this movie is a classic and one of Sylvester Stallone's BEST performances on the big screen. <br /> <br />'I AM THE LAW!!!\\"
B0002S947K|3.0|I bought this album after receiving several recommendations from Springsteen and Dylan fans.  Not knowing what to truly expect, I looked him up on this site and read some of the reviews posted by those who have the album.  I found a non-stop list of five star reviews, so I went for it.  I'm not sorry I bought the album, and perhaps it will take time to get used to it, but I am not as excited about it as I had hoped.  After my first few listenings, I find Ray LaMontagne to be not much more than a male Nora Jones, which isn't saying much.  The music is sloooow, and far less dramatic than I expected.  Thus far it sounds more like music for candle light dinners in a cheesy jazz restaurant than something to get all excited about.  I was very disappointed that the sleeve didn't come with lyrics or any kind of pictures.  While I would agree that music is not about superfluous extras, I would argue that it helps to get some assistance in finding the true value in an unknown, which is what Trouble is.  I don't find that the music totally carries the price tag in a very competitive music world.
B0007OCG56|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and could feel the sensibility of the,'As good as it Gets' team from the start. Reviewers on Amazon have their gripes about Sandler, in particular, cast as the unbelievably good dad. I am unfamiliar with him and Leoni, not having had a big infatuation with Hollywood. But this film hit positive buttons for all our family, and the cross cultural difficulties in communications, at its core, were sensitivly and intelligently handled. Sandler is terrific. In fact the whole cast is, especially Sandler's often despicably neurotic wife hwo shows the unabashed affection for the Spanish girl she refuses to lay on her daughter. The Mexican daughter has a marvellous scene interpreting  both languages during a vehement argument at a turning point of the movie. The love chemistry between Sandler and her mum is handled with aplomb and, though both are bitten, they come through admirably. The deletions make good viewing in themselves, though I camn see how Baker felt their inclusion would imbalance the film's tone.

B000JLTRIG|3.0|Season 7 was okay but it wasn't the best..I watched all the seasons and even season 8 is better than this one.Well,there are some really good episodes(especially the finale) but \\"The Avatars\\" are really boring and most of the episodes contains them.If you're Charmed fan buy it, but if you're not a big fan, I recommend season 2&5...
B00005YU1O|5.0|This film, Linklater's \\"The Waking Life,\\" very much falls in the vein of some of the following:  Pink Floyd's The Wall, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Winged Migration, Radiohead, Ray Bradbury, Phillip Dick, Rush and a college philosophy class.  If you are confused...don't be.  Let me explain.<br /><br />There is a quote from the movie that kind of captured what I thought about the film.  The main character, played by Wiley Wiggins from Linklater's \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" some time in the film is talking about this dream that he is experiencing (and we are spectators of) and says something to the effect of, \\"This dream is wholly unprecedented.  It's trying to do something monumental...a fundamental life change.\\"  I realize that quote is severely paraphrased but it kind of sums up my feelings about the movie.  It really came across to me as unprecedented and very original.<br /><br />Let me give you a disclaimer, this film is not going to be for everybody...in fact it's probably not going to be for most.  It's one that appeals to my taste.  I know my wife dismissed it after the first 5 minutes...as being ohhh...another one of those films that only my husband likes.  You may feel the dialogue is slow and overly intellectualized.  The overlay of animation on top of real-life shot film may not be your cup of tea, may not be your bag baby.  But...though the film is very non-traditional with one character that basically walks around encountering all sorts of other characters for brief periods each having a speaking role about the meaning of life, the meaning of dreams, philosophy and exploding burritos, the film is not without a plot, not without characters, not without humor.  You end up very much caring about what is going to happen to the main character as he alternately enjoys being in a dream-trance like state, and is horrified and frustrated at not being able to come out of it, to move on to the waking life.<br /><br />Ultimately, the movie was fascinating and where the ongoing dialogue didn't hold your attention, you have the wonderful artwork of animation to behold and wonder at.  Just like a fascinating college lecture, you don't stay engaged listening for the full 50 minutes, but what does connect, connects in a powerful way.<br /><br />If you like traditional movies and you like more linear plots, I'd say stay away from this one.  But if you, like me, get into \\"deep thoughts\\" and enjoy seeing creativity in a unique and original way, you absolutely will not want to miss waking up to \\"The Waking Life.\\"  The extras are packed on the DVD too so it's truly a value purchase.<br /><br />--MMWnating and where the ongoing dialogue didn't hold your attention, you have the wonderful artwork of animation to behold and wonder at.

0446677450|3.0|I have always found Robert a wonderful translator of other peoples technology. Having known him personally. I was surprised to have never heard of his rich dad before the release of his book. There is much to be gleaned from this book. The meta-message being who is truly rich or who is poor. Surely richness cannot be reduced to the number of properties you accumulate. I am a little disturbed by Robert's indication that he was born into the wrong family. The qualities that I like in this man have come undoubtedly from his poor Dad
B0009UC810|5.0|I must admit I just saw this movie for the first time last week and I had to go out and buy it because I loved this movie.  I'm not rating the new edition specifically, but the movie itself is pure quality.  Never did I see Akroyd and Belushi together and it was something I wish there might have been more of.  If you have a great sound system hooked up to your dvd player then turn the volume up on this one.  Its almost as if it were made to be watched this way.  Anyone can like this movie and I'm glad I flipped to AMC to watch it.  They don't make movies like this anymore.  :(
B00005V9HH|5.0|The Usual Suspects (1995) is a riveting tale with Kevin Spacey, as Verbal Kint, delivering superb acting as the sole survivor of a dope deal gone bad being interrogated by Federal Agent Dave Kujan ( played by Chazz Palminteri). The action, intrigue and suspense with lots of terrific twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat. Just when you think you have figured out what is going on, something else occurs that leaves you asking, \\"What else could possibly happen now?\\" You will have to watch this movie several times to catch all the ins-and-outs.The cast did perfect acting which my favorite besides spacey was Mcmanus played by Stephen baldwin and the halerious Fred Fenster played by Benicio Del Toro.  A modern classic after reservoir dogs ( which i think the idea of the usual suspects came from & pulp fiction which has nothing in commen but is just simply another masterpieace in my book).  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> Reservoir Dogs   <br />
B000096BLG|5.0|I used to own this album on vinyl, and was delighted to find that it has been released on CD. The Crossfire band is a perfect fit for Franks, creating a warm and smooth atmosphere around this collection of his top songs. This is smooth jazz from long before the term came into regular use, and a very recommendable experience for Michael Franks fans and others who like smooth, high quality jazz in a live setting.
B000L45YEW|2.0|After regaining some of the ground he lost in Hollywood with his last couple of Hong Kong films, Jackie Chan takes a big step backwards with the overlong Rob-B-Hood, a downmarket three bad men and a baby romp that offers limp gay jokes, comic relief mental illness, family bonding and child endangerment for all the family. There is one fairly good action sequence at the halfway point as well as a neat stunt that sees him jumping down a building via the air conditioning units, but you definitely get the feeling that Chan's no longer pushing himself but is just doing what he knows he can still do while Yuen Biao is mostly wasted in a nothing bit part. He's made worse, but that's hardly a recommendation. <br /> <br />The 2-disc set includes both the theatrical and extended festival cut of the film, both with audio commentary subtitled in English. There's also a huge variety of deleted scenes, trailers, featurettes and music videos (mostly subtitled in English), but the film is such heavy going you quite possibly won't want to spend any longer on it once you've seen it.
B000JLTRKE|4.0|\\"World Trade Center' avoids being a disaster movie cliche with focus on the spirit to survive and the lessons learned from 9/11.  The film is the true story of police officers trapped in the towers' rubble and the families waiting to hear word of them.     The film captures details of the incident well.  For instance, the  confusion and shock that morning and the inside of the Tower in its collapse.  I have to say,  though,  some of the New York accents didn't ring true..and... I mean, come on.. what's going on here....we New Yawkers don't really all talk like that...do we??  :)    The film shows how the characters', being so near  death,  felt a deeper appreciation of life and their loved ones.  The scenes with the officers trying to survive in the rubble are at times gripping.  The film, however, can't help to fall into some cliches.  For instance, the closing shot of a surving officer holding his two year old in the air with sunlight behind them.         By now most have seen and heard countless images of the towers' collapse and heard survivors' tales.  So, although the movie's narrative drive maintains interest, it is not too revelatory, aside from images within the Tower during the collapse.    Several years now after the disaster, many have fallen back into their old ways.  This film is a reminder of how only grace and good fortune bring us back home every day and so appreciate what we have.  A good message, but it's not the type of movie you would watch over and over again to get that message. It seems as though there is still room for a more definitive movie of the 9/11 tragedy.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The Beatles need no introduction when it comes to the elite of Rock/Pop music. When trying to \\"rank\\" the greatest artists of the Rock/Pop era, there is no doubt that the quartet from England ranks number one on just about every list. Going even further, the Beatles might be the top act in the history of modern music - among any genre.   In recent years, there have been several projects that have been done around the Beatles.  In 1995/1996, the Beatles released the three volume \\"Anthology\\" CD series (and corresponding television documentary). One of the main attractions of this project was that it would bring the three surviving Beatles together for the first time since the famous breakup. Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr would collaborate together on two unfinished John Lennon songs: \\"Free as a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\" - creating a \\"virtual\\" reunion among the four band members. This three volume set would not be an ordinary greatest hits collection - it would provide a historical retrospective to the band through rare and unreleased material.  In 2000 a collection of all of the Beatles U.S. and U.K. number one hits was released - simply titled \\"1\\".   Both of these efforts were huge commercial successes and it proved the Beatles some three decades after their breakup were still very much in the thick of the pop music landscape.   A few years later, Cirque (the group that produces the famed Cirque du Soleil series of circus-based stage performances) began to explore the possibility of using the music of the Beatles for one of their productions.  This would result in the 2006 theatrical production, \\"Love\\".   George Martin, the longtime producer of the Beatles along with his son Giles would spearhead the production.  As a result, for all practical purposes, a corresponding soundtrack album was released.  This album would simply be entitled \\"Love\\".   This is no ordinary soundtrack or ordinary Beatles greatest hits album.   It presents Beatles music remixed and assembled into a continuous medley - as never heard before.    <br /> <br />While this consists of Beatles music, this is the result of the hard work between George and Giles Martin.  The duo must have spent endless hours in the studio.   To understand what was done here, one must make a distinction between a medley and a mix.  A musical medley combines songs or parts of songs into a single piece of music.   For \\"Love\\", the Martins assemble over 30 classic Beatles songs into a medley.  A mix takes separate recordings and combines them into a single recording.   Often an album is \\"mixed\\" by combining vocal tracks and the various instrumental tracks.   A remix will often combine these separate recordings differently than the original mix.  Sometimes a remix will bring in other (external) tracks for an added affect.   For \\"Love\\", the Martins also utilize remixing - this is done by using studio tracks and unreleased demo tracks.   There is also plenty of cases where the Martins utilize external sound effects (such as wildlife sounds on \\"Because\\" and the European Siren at the end of the \\"Eleanor Rigby/Julia\\" track).   This is simply masterful. <br /> <br />What I am most amazed about is how the Martins use the remixing to build the medley.  These remixed pieces provide the basis for many of the transitions in the medley   The Martins find a way to provide near flawless transitions throughout the tracks of the \\"Love\\" compilation.   The only place where I felt the transitions within the medley did not work was when transitioning from \\"Help!\\" to the \\"Blackbird/Yesterday\\" track and from the \\"Blackbird/Yesterday\\" track into the \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".  Another thing worth mentioning is how the Martins build mini \\"sub-medleys\\" within the collection.   These sub-medleys consist of a mini-medley of songs on a single track.   \\"Love\\" showcases these sub-medleys in many places - such as: \\"Eleanor Rigby/Julia\\"; \\"Something/Blue Jay Way\\"; \\"Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite/I Want You (She's So Heavy)/Helter Skelter\\"; \\"Blackbird/Yesterday\\"; \\"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\"; \\"Here Comes the Sun/The Inner Light\\"; \\"Come Together/Dear Prudence/Cry Baby Cry\\". <br /> <br />There are plenty of other examples of Beatles music \\"uncredited\\" on the tracks.  When transitioning in the medley from \\"Because\\" to \\"Get Back\\", you can easily hear the opening guitar of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and the drums from \\"The End\\" (You can also hear drums from \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and elements from \\"A Day in the Life\\".   In the \\"Something/Blue Jay Way\\" sub-medley you can hear vocal elements from \\"Nowhere Man\\". <br /> <br />It is also worth noting the final sequence of \\"A Day in the Life\\", \\"Hey Jude\\", \\"Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise), and \\"All You Need is Love\\" is simply awesome. <br /> <br />What I really like about this collection is how it does a good cross-section of the Beatles material.    It has some very popular tracks and some less common tracks.   One can make an argument that many songs -  such as \\"Michelle\\", \\"Birthday\\", \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\", \\"She Loves You\\", and many, many more are missing.   However who is to say that someday there won't be a \\"Love 2\\".  <br /> <br />It is worth noting that this collection includes a DVD Audio as well as the CD.  For the most part they are identical except for the fact that the DVD Audio includes extended versions of \\"Revolution\\" and \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\".  Perhaps these songs were shortened on the CD so they could also sell this as a single CD.   <br /> <br />There is a terrific booklet that includes write-ups from both George and Gilles Martin.   The packaging is \\"Digipak format\\" - I would have preferred a jewel case, but this shouldn't detract you from getting this collection.   The most important thing is that this collection has the feel of a theatrical collection.  For a soundtrack, you want to capture the essence of the show - and \\"Love\\" clearly does.   The Martins should be applauded for constructing a solid collection and keeping the Beatles legacy alive. Highly recommended. <br />
0790729725|5.0|Murderers often come with smiles -- and problems of their own. Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro chew plenty of scenery, but the real focus of director Martin Scorsese's mob opus is Ray Liotta as real-world Irish-Italian mobster Henry Hill, a gangster who dreamed of making it to the top but landed in the witness protection program instead.<br /><br />Nominated for six Oscars (including Best Picture), the film's only win was Pesci's Best Supporting Actor statue. One of the greatest mobster movies and easily one of the top films of the 1990's, Henry Hill's novel Wiseguy is masterfully crafted by Martin Scorsese who showcases the lifestyle of a modern day gangster.<br /><br />Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci turn in career performances as a mafia crew who live the fast life and fall as each one succumbs to their own greed or vices. Scorsese shows Henry Hill as a kid working his way up in a crew and how he is drawn to a life of crime.<br /><br />Along the way he meets and marries a beautiful woman who knows what he does and accepts her life as a mob wife. The movie is filled with colorful characters and realistic settings; the dialogue is gritty and helps the movie establish the very violent setting and situations.<br /><br />Another reason Goodfellas works is the masterful use of music to showcase the era, it starts off with Tony Bennett singing Rags to Riches and culminates with Eric Clapton's piano instrumental classic Layla. It is the wonderful soundtrack that sets Goodfellas apart from other classic gangster movies such as The Godfather which used more traditional classical music.

Ever hear of the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption in the 90's and how it affected the weather all around the world? And, how about all the underwater volcanic eruptions that happen on a daily basis? Isn't that the reason almost half million people died from a tsunami ..... caused by underwater eruptions? Pinatubo ejected more atmospheric pollution in one day than that produced by all mankind in the history of the earth. In the 70's the shelves of most book stores will filled with the prophecy of \\"global cooling\\" and the fact that \\"we\\" are overdue for the earth's repeated cycle of the new ice age, which is scientifically proven to occur every 10,000 years. Make no mistake, \\"global warming\\" is big business and big Al just dipped into your money roll. Isn't is hard to not believe the guy that admits he invented the internet?!
B00003CXSP|5.0|Anthony Hopkins returns as one of the great villains in screen history, Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter, in this riveting sequel to The Silence of the Lambs. Lecter's only surviving victim, the hideously scarred Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), tries to draw the serial gourmet out of hiding using the one person he cares about: Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). Now, the novel on which this film was based had a slow pace and was nice and lengthy. If the film tried to be exactly like the book, it would have been at least 3 hours long, maybe longer. I would have enjoyed watching it.I thought the acting was excellent. Most of what's essential in the book in kept in the movie, though reading it ahead of time makes everything a little clearer. I was glad to see Ray Liotta here( specialy the brain eating scene lol, turned some peoples head!), and I thought Julianne Moore did a great job as Agent Starling. This film has almost \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" mentality as it appears to celebrate Hannibal's evil. True, Hannibal is always witty and polite, regardless of what terrible thing he is doing. The film is expectedly grotesque, which never bothers me. Hannibal is truly a different type of film than \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"; if you're looking for that, you should probably see \\"Red Dragon\\" instead (also good). My biggest complaint is the change they made to the ending of the story, which in the book was far more disturbing. And I'd like to say that Ridley Scott's direction isn't quite as suited to the material as Jonathan Demme's. Good and effective, but read the novel if you really want to get freaked out. I still recommend every one to watch hannibal if you haven't yet. Its truly a great movie. Also The music selected for this film was all that one would expect for such a thrilling screenplay, exciting, touching, unobtrucive and atmospheric. The highpoint for me was the scene at the Opera which left me spellbound. So delightful was the piece that I hummed it for days afterwards. The thrill was boosted by my finding out that a fellow Irishman, whom I had met often around Dublin over the past few years, Patrick Cassidy, hed written \\"Vide Cor Meum\\" especially for the scene. Woe of woes! I had hoped that it was an Opera which I could buy the next day. The good news is that the piece is featured on this soundtrack and Patrick is rumoured to be incorporating the piece into a forthcoming Operatic work. I can only commend you to his exceptional talent, recordings of which are available from Amazon and hope that you too will await the new work with my baited breath. <br />Hans Zimmer seems to be the composer of the moment in Hollywood, and why not? His score for \\"Hannibal\\" further proves that when he's on, he's really on -- his score for \\"Hannibal\\" is more entertaining than the film it has been written for, not to mention more haunting, scary and beautiful. But along with being a popular film composer comes the wrongheaded ideas that often get forced upon film soundtracks. Why are there dialogue snippets here? Sure, Anthony Hopkins is a wonderful actor and I love to hear his voice, but not when the music he is speaking over is superior to the film! Most dialogue tracks on soundtracks are annoying, and these are no different. Two big releases raped Zimmer's music in this fashion in the same year (remember \\"More Music from Gladiator\\"?). That being said, this is top-notch work from Zimmer and collaborator Patrick Cassady. Especially wonderful is the final track, an original operatic piece with a libretto taken from the writings of Dante Aligheri. Absolutely astonishing music in that last cut. <br /> <br />

B00005JPBD|5.0|\\"Volver\\" me recordo lo exquisito de la experiencia de ir al cine. Al sentarme en el sillon comenzando apenas la pelicula (llegamos justo a tiempo, cuando se paseaba por la pantalla el letrero de \\"El Deseo Producciones\\"), dejando que la musica de Alberto Iglesias durante las primeras escenas se colara lentamente hasta mi subconsciente, se podia uno imaginar que lo que vendria seria grandioso... y lo fue!<br /><br />\\"Volver\\" reune una vez mas lo mejor del talento cinematografico de Espa&ntilde;a (y de lo mejor del mundo). Desde la atractiva y talentosa Pen&eacute;lope Cruz, en su mejor trabajo desde \\"Todo Sobre Mi Madre\\", pasando por las legendarias Carmen Maura y Chus Lampreave e incluyendo talentos como el de Lola Due&ntilde;as quien se adue&ntilde;&oacute; de nuestros corazones en \\"Mar Adentro\\", el elenco no deja una esquina de nuestras almas sin tocar, interpretando otro impresionante guion del maestro Almodovar, quien una vez mas se logra superar a si mismo.<br /><br />Es dificil compartir mucho mas de la pelicula sin soltar \\"spoilers\\", pero no duden en verla, si no lo han hecho. Estoy seguro que la disfrutaran profundamente, como lo que es: otra obra de arte que pasara a la historia de lo mejor del cine, como varios de los trabajos del genio espa&ntilde;ol, Pedro Almodovar.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface is basically The story of a Cuban refugee, Tony Montana (Al Pacino), who comes to Miami in the early 80's as part of a wave of people released by Castro, many straight from prison.  <br /> <br />He is here to find success of the kind that was not possible in Communist Cuba. All he wants is opportunity, which for him means washing dishes or dealing drugs (corporate America's not hiring). He rises through the underworld through guts and determination and achieves what he set out to achieve; money, power and the woman. <br /> <br /> His success is bittersweet as he is keenly aware. He is also aware of the hippocricy of the society of which he is now a part. You can point your finger at Tony and call him the \\"Bad Guy\\". Does that make you good?  <br /> <br /> <br />he sticks to his own integrity as his world unravels around him, never bending his own rules to save his skin. How many of society's moralists and finger pointers can make that claim? Brilliantly acted by Pacino and with a great supporting cast. Written by Oliver Stone who did research in the field in South America and directed by Brian De Palma. This is a must see. <br />
B00005JOCU|5.0|i can never imagine a musical(movie) could be this good. every song, all the dancing scenes, music, sound track...whatever you call it or name it, is  soooooooo gooooooood. i never enjoyed a movie so much and never thought a story mixed and told with songs could be so seamlessly perfect. everybody, all the performers in this musical did a fantastic job. i still remember when we watched 'chicago', after tortured by it about 30 minutes, we looked at each other and stood up at the same time, all tried to grab the dvd player's remote to reject it. but when we decided to watch this 'dream girls', since we got that bad experience of 'chicago', we both hesitated and struggled before stepped into the showing room....oh my god, once the movie started, once the music and songs started, we're totally intoxicated!!!!<br /><br />never thought it could be this great. all the female singers are amazing, the directing, the screenplay, the editing, the performance are all out of the world. if there's indeed a heaven, i wish it could be full of this kind of songs and music. love it!<br /><br />an after thought to amazon.com here:<br /><br />5 stars limit is a lousy and stupid rating system, man. it simply couldn't show how really good or how really bad a book, a movie or whatever a product really is. better change back to 10 star rating or change to a ceiling score of 100 then coming down. 5-star rating really couldn't show or mean anything, man. let's think in this practical way: 5 bucks means nothing if you got to have 10 bucks to buy something good; but if you got 100 bucks, it ain't just mean that you can buy something good, you can buy something really really good, man.
B000002A3T|1.0|Almost amusingly bad, which actually reflects the group's status since 1977 or so. It's sad that the group who made Dark Side of the Moon; Wish You Were Here; Animals and Piper at the Gates of Dawn have now became extinct dinosaurs. Losing your creative leader and best songwriter (Roger Waters) will do that to you, I guess. But when that happens, here's what you do: go on the world tour, make a crapload of money, and disband, rather than torturing us with this. There's literaly NOTHING on this album I'd want to hear again, though I'll admit it is amusing to hear them imitate U2's Joshua Tree-era sound on Take It Back, it's the kind of amusing that hearing Iggy Pop doing a Jim Morrison impression on the Stooges' Ann is: amusing with more than a tinge of annoying. Dave Gilmour's taken over the songwriting, and the group in general, and he takes Roger Water's concieted, pretentious streak to new highs (or lows, if you will). Not even Gilmour's guitar heroics on Poles Apart (the closest thing to entertainment) save this mess, since he practically repeats the solo on A Great Day for Freedom. Hell, I could sit here and take potshots based on the song titles all day: they were indeed Lost for Words (a hybrid of Money and Wish You Were Here), and not exactly Coming Back to Life. A decent album was what we wanted from you; after hearing A Momentary Lapse of Reason, it's not exactly like anyone had High Hopes. Stop talking - it'll be A Great Day for Floyddom when you realize you're over the hill and break up, leaving us with fond memories of the early-'70's albums.

B0007VZ9DK|5.0|Martin Scorsese paints a colorful portrait of Las Vegas in the early 1970s as the oasis of glamour and corruption that it was. Against this backdrop, the story chronicles the rise and fall of three central characters: a play-by-the-rules casino owner with mob connections (Robert De Niro), his childhood friend and Mafia underboss (Joe Pesci) and an ex-prostitute with expensive taste and a driving will to get what she wants (Sharon Stone).   <br /> <br />Casino is the story of how the mafia lost the greatest deal they ever had: Las Vegas. Many critics view Casino as a watered down version of Goodfellas, and this comparison is not unfounded.   <br />  <br />It possesses the same style--mafia brutality shown from the point of view of a matter-of-fact narrator--and features two of Goodfellas' leads, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci. But Casino is still an amazing film. DeNiro carries the movie well, and Pesci has never been more psychopathic.         <br /> <br />Sharon Stone is great as the charming but crazy Ginger, and James Woods is perfect as her sleazy ex-boyfriend. The movie is fast-paced and interesting, and the narration is great, especially from DeNiro.    <br /> <br />You feel like you're sitting across the table from an ex-casino manager as he tells stories and random facts about how things in Vegas really were. Casino may just be \\"more of the same,\\" but it's still a fascinating, interesting, and superbly entertaining movie.  <br /> <br />

Having rented a dvd of the episodes, when this became available on sale online I purchased it.  <br />   Not only did the purchase arrive next day (during Christmas week) with standard shipping, but turned out to be the best TV series purchase ever personally made. The Stars consistently turn out great performances, storyline intrigues, and the special effects and set are detailed and believable.  Each episode is movie quality, and why it isn't still on or brought back is a mystery to me. Highly reccommend this purchase for hours of enjoyment.
0767802470|5.0|This is the most extensive, accurate & well done u-boat movie ever made. Jurgen Prochnow is fantastic as the submarine commander and Wolfgang Peterson has crafted an intimate, gritty & realistic view of the life inside a German submarine towards the end of the second world war. At 3.5 hrs long, it is much shorter than the original television mini-series it started out as but is still likely to be a 2 night movie for most folks. <br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to escape their living room for a few hours and experience the dreams, elation, hopes, fears & terror of a u-boat crew of 60 years ago.

She's just stunning in the role.<br /><br />CASINO ROYALE shoots to the top of the Best of Bond along with FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.
0226264211|4.0|This book well deserves to be a classic, but it does not present any of the problems with Capitalism, so don't expect a balanced view.  Via capitalism, we are like a bacterial colony on a dead squirrel.  Bacteria metabolize all of the useful nutrients, and then there is a mass die-off.  This works for the bacterial genetics because some of the bacteria will be blown or otherwise transported to another dead squirrel or such, and the cycle will continue.  We, on the other hand, only have one \\"dead squirrel\\" (planet Earth), and no alternative ecosystems are within reach.  So capitalism is betting all of our marbles that science will save our collective butts.  For the science of rational selection that is economics, the end-game dependency on hope shows its non-rational weakness. <br />
B000IAXVGW|5.0|This review applies to Season 1, Episode 14, \\"  Balance of Terror\\", ASIN B000IAXVGW [[ASIN:B000HL2ISY Star Trek]]<br /><br />Any fan of The Original (Star Trek) Series (herein referred to as \\"TOS\\") will enjoy this episode, but let me address you youngins out there that may have enjoyed The Next Generation or any of the later series, but who never saw (or did not like what they saw of) TOS.  TOS could certainly be quite uneven from episode to episode, but this is the episode to watch to understand what made TOS great when it did work.<br /><br />This is ostensibly an episode about a space battle, but it really is a character story.  Primarily about the two captains: our man James T. Kirk and the never-named Romulan captain.  It's a gripping cat and mouse play pitting two men against each other;  Men with greatness and ability, but also with flaws and doubts.  Men who are opposite sides of the same coin.... men who might be good friends were the circumstances different.  It's a story both of strategy and of character.<br /><br />This episode introduces for the first time many devices that have become mainstay of the Star Trek Universe.  This is the very first time we meet the Romulans, and are introduced to their martial, duty-driven culture.  This is the first time we hear of the neutral zone, and the Earth-Romulan \\"conflict\\" that necessitated its creation.  And this is the first time that we, and the Federation, find out about the cloaking device than can hide entire star ships.  (Also be sure to check out another great episode: \\"The Enterprise Incident\\" ASIN:B000HKYN7O, where Kirk steals said cloaking device).<br /><br />I may take some criticism for this, but one of the merits of this episode is the acting of Mr. William Shatner.  We are all familiar with his campy, over-the-top style, but in this episode Captain Kirk is a real person and we can see inside his thoughts and feelings.  As an example, right before the first cut-away (preceding the credits) look at Shatner's face as he walks away from the communicator.  This is fore-shadowing... we see only a glimpse, but it is a glimpse of duty and foreboding for the lives of the crew under his care.<br /><br />Sure the special effects will still disappoint if not taken in the context of time in which this was produced, and some of the plot devices are contrived, but in the format and time limitation of this episode it excels in being what it sets out to be: an entertaining and gripping story or conflict between two great men and two great machines of war.way from the communicator.

1400062756|5.0|This was an interesting book that explored many examples of a 'fixed' vs. a 'growth' mindset and some ways to help develop/improve by utilizing the growth mindset. It has always bugged me when someone says they'll never be able to do something because they aren't 'gifted'. It was enlightening to read about many examples of highly skilled performers/athletes/etc. who have had to WORK HARD to continue their progress/accomplishments.<br /><br />The book discussed how certain things can come easier or more naturally to someone, but often if that person just coasts they will never achieve the success others (or themselves) think they should have.  I am working on some hobbies such as learning the guitar, playing golf and learning kung fu. I can't say that any of these activities are a breeze or that it's easy; I know of others who are able to progress faster than me! The thing to keep in mind is that I AM making progress, and when I look back at times I can see the improvement.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes in the book is from Coach John Wooden (p.200): \\"You have to apply yourself each day to becoming a little better. By applying yourself to the task of becoming a little better each and every day over a period of time, you will become a LOT better.\\"<br /><br />So overall I thought it was a good book. Hope my review didn't put you to sleep. :)

B000FA57N0|5.0|What's not to like: intrigue, suspense, excellent casting, outstanding script writing, first-rate acting, and great special effects.  The movie industry puts out way too few really good sci-fi flicks each year.  The shear number of horror movies dwarfs the handful of good sci-fi movies available to rent.  I wish the industry would try to do more with this genre.  I keep my fingers crossed that some brave, brilliant producer/director team will come along one of these years and dazzle us with a new magnificent journey beyond the stars that shakes us to the core, disturbs our sense of reality, and trivializes our silly politics, religion and self-centeredness.  We need a new breed of writers and directors who will raise the bar and present the viewing public with an experience to make us cry, laugh, think and learn something new.  I'm still waiting....

It was about time for him to make a complete mariachi disc and it has been well received all over the world. Some of the highlights(there are no lowlights) include the title track \\"Mexico en la Piel \\" is a heartfelt rendition that will touch you emotionally, \\"Luz de Luna\\" is a bittersweet bolero with huapango elements that tears you apart, \\"El Viajero\\" sets the tone for a magical colloboration between the mariachi and Mexico's top male performer with playful interludes between horns and vocals and the ever popular \\"De Que Manera te Olvido\\" with it's love forlorn lyrics are just a few of the outstanding tracks on a perfect CD. It would be nearly impossible to exclude Jose Alfredo Jimenez songs and so there are several. The beautiful song written for Jose Alfredo's wife \\"Paloma Querida\\" is interpreted here by LuisMi with a robust yet lyrical style where he holds his notes to the bend but don't break point and \\"Un Mundo Raro\\" that is nothing short of sublime are two of the Jose Alfredo  songs featured here. Wouldn't it be nice if he did a tribute album of Jose Alfredo with Mariachi Vargas? It would go immediate platinum. Less I regress, the album is a complete winner that will be played for years to come, across generations and across lands seperated by oceans.

0618680004|5.0|There is so little discussion on this level; it was simply refreshing to hear the truth of what Mr. Dawkins is trying to convey.  Of course what he is saying is very controversial and offensive to many, but that's why it's so important.  Humanity is asleep in a religious fantasy that feeds the ego of some while casting others aside like garbage. We cannot call ourselves an enlightened society until we face the oppressive forces of religion and that is exactly what Mr. Dawkins is doing.   <br /> <br />We live in a world where priests and pundits carry out sexual exploits in secret while condemning others who live life openly and free.  Religion is responsible for enormous strife throughout human history, we all know that.  Yet still the vast majority of people on this planet get down on bended knee and pray to 1 or more of a thousand man made gods.   <br /> <br />What will happen in the next 10 years when a probe lands on the surface of Europa, bores down through the ice and discovers life living at the bottom of an alien sea sustained by chemical energy pouring forth from volcanic vents.  How will we rationalize our religious belief when irrefutable evidence of an evolutionary chain exists that has developed completely independent of life on earth?   <br /> <br />When you consider that our own galaxy made up of billions of stars very likely containing tens of billions of orbiting planets is nothing but a sand grain in a universe containing billions of galaxies, humanities preposterous religious beliefs look absolutely foolish. <br /> <br />I've seen enough in my 60 years to realize that human gods are far too spiteful, arrogant, malicious, narrow-minded and judgmental to be the creator of such an immense and amazing universe. Someday we may realize that this Universe is far more wondrous and mysterious than we could have possibly imagined.  All of our silly notions of right and wrong, heaven and hell, saved and condemned will finally be tossed into the trash heap ofhistory. <br /> <br />We have long way to go before we can call ourselves an enlightened species. <br />

I haven't laughed till I cried in such a long time at a movie until this unbelievable cast in Little Miss Sunshine hit the screen!!  It reels you in slowly at first and then that's it, you're hooked! The emotions sway you back from laughing out of control to serious moods, that you never know what's coming next. This is the best movie we have seen in a long time, my husband agrees.  We had to buy it as soon as we could and now we are going to watch it with our 4 teens. <br />Be prepared to Laugh hard. <br />
0765310015|5.0|Erikson is a genious. The world he creates is so real that you fall into it. It is so believable because, as in real life, the good guys don't always do the right thing, and the bad guys don't always do the wrong thing. Even the way he develops characters is brilliant. He tells part of a story, then lets the minor characters take over until they have their own \\"personalities\\". Then while they are developing the story, we're introduced to more minor characters through them. You never know who's perspective you'll see through next which keeps you so involved. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys empathizing with characters and seeing them as people, rather than just reading a story about characters going places and doing things. Read book one, and the purchase of book two is almost guaranteed.

B000LC3ID8|5.0|Here is my take on not just SAW III but all of them. A man who is faced with the concept that he knows he is going to die, an average guy at that, makes a choice. He makes the choice to teach other people a lesson. A lesson about how valuable the gift of life is. So he sets some rules. He never truly sets out to kill anyone. That is the brilliance of the whole series. He puts you in a situation. One where you have to fight for the life you have \\"wasted away\\".<br /><br />He chooses the drug users, rapists, voyeurs, pretty much the lowlifes of society who basically have chosen an ugly life and are just wasting away because it is what they chose. Jigsaw, in his amazing wisdom, asks you either you fight for a better life because of the one you had chosen, or die the way you will be remembered as, a rapist, drug user, murderer, and so on.<br /><br />The challenge asks you to destroy some of your body but to learn a lesson. The lesson is:<br /><br />\\"Why was I put here in the first place?\\"<br /><br />Answer: Because of what you chose.<br /><br />Now he makes you make the ultimate choice, fight to live, or just chose to die.<br /><br />He wants you to win. He wants you to live. He wants you to realize that you are wasting away, so fix it.<br /><br />A lot of people would view Jigsaw as a villain, probably one of the most intelligent in movies, not just a hacker and slasher, but in the heart of this, he can be considered a hero too. He wants you to change your life for the better, and avoid forever being condemned for the crimes and choices we all make. He knows someday he will die of something he has no control over. So if you don't have that burden, why push towards an early grave.<br /><br />He is a hero.<br /><br />That is what makes these movies amazing. The SAW series isn't your average hacker or slasher, it has deeper meanings.

In 1962, Marlon was a balding, unattractive Indian giver (he took the ring back), certainly not a gentleman.  He was captured in a sandstorm by a group of Amigos.  After he escaped, he went to the Fiesta where he talked with his mouth full (no manners).   <br /> <br />The respected sheriff of the town had been his partner and taken off with two sacks of gold.  Now he is a corrupt politican married to a Mexican woman for respectabilty.  Louisa, the sheriff's step-daughter, is wooed and seduced by Rio and gets pregnant (a repeat of her heritage).  When he says how good that makes me feel, he doesn't look happy or glad.  He tells lies when dealing with women and men.  This time he buys a necklace for $30 and used it as he took advantage of Louisa.  He admits later that everything he told her was lies to get his way with her.  She became a disillusioned damaged goods which the old lecherous deputy tries to taunt and corrupt, but she has already been corrupted by Rio, the man she loves. <br /> <br />When caught, Rio is bull whipped in public by the sheriff in an exhibition as he crippled Rio's gun hand.  At the thrashing incoming tide, he thinks of Louisa as his body heals, but his psyche doesn't.  He is out for revenge.  His \\"best friend\\" had left him to die (his sad tale) and he gives three reasons for why he wants to kill the man: five years of life lost, stolen money, and the beating.  \\"Will killing him make you a man?\\"  Louisa reminds him that there are not many chances in life to be happy.  One has to forget and forgive.  He'd been hurt too much and can't forget. <br /> <br />Love conquers all with Louisa on the white stallion as she goes  home to wait for his return.  He had a reason to do what he did, but it does not seem to matter now.  He was a hunted man and demented with the need for revenge.  Instead of hiding in Mexico, he rides off to Oregon.  One-eyed jack is one who pretends to be what he isn't.  He gets cornered and there is a shootout by the town fountain.  Vengeance is mine as the lovers ride away after the jail break.  A typical Western from the Sixties era.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|\\"Men and Nature must work hand in hand.  The throwing out of balance of the resources of Nature throws out of balance also the lives of men.\\"<br /><br />Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1935<br /><br />An Inconvenient Truth is an enhanced version of a slide show Al Gore has been presenting since the 1980s.  The filmmakers preserve the bulk of Gore's lecture, refusing to dumb it down, but skillfully interweave segments from Gore's personal story.  This serves the dual purpose of keeping the audience emotionally involved, and giving viewers a break from a potential information overload.  Far from the stiff automaton parodied in the media, Gore gives a warm, compelling, and occasionally humorous presentation.<br /><br />There is not a single fact or date or number in Gore's presentation that's disputed by any reputable scientist.  The deniers are largely right wing political operatives, malefactors of carbon producing industries, or internet trolls who spend their time commenting on other people`s reviews.<br /><br />One factor unmentioned by Gore (or perhaps cut for time) is how suburban sprawl is a driving factor - - pun intended - - in the excess consumption of fossil fuels.<br /><br />Paramount has put its money where its mouth is by selling the DVD in relatively eco-friendly packaging.
B000K4WLXA|2.0|...........thats really all i can say about this. it hasn't even been a year since the special edition came out and they are already trying to milk it for all its worth. from reading the item description all your getting is a new cover and a couple of cheap little bonus items, like postcards, amazing. i'm a big ff fan, but i just can't recommend this. just save some money and buy the special edition. you can probably buy it for about $10 and get the exact same experience.
B00005JOCU|2.0|DREAMGIRLS has individual parts and pieces that, when film production was announced, sounded delicious, like a surefire winner. But the parts, as good as they are, do not gel into the knockout whole that this movie could have been. Writer Bill Condon (CHICAGO), who also directed DREAMGIRLS, perhaps was spread too thin to pull this one off.<br /><br />  The legendary Broadway musical of 1981 was directed by the late Michael Bennett (the stage version of A CHORUS LINE) who was lauded for his \\"cinematic\\" staging of the original. He managed, with pivoting onstage towers and with lighting, to achieve before the eyes of a live audience what amounted to the stage version of cinematic wipes, dissolves, cross-cutting, and fades. His vision made for thrilling stage work, as he had done in A CHORUS LINE.<br />  Twenty-five years after the original Broadway show, DREAMGIRLS seemed like a guaranteed screen hit. With CHICAGO, Condon had already shown in his adaptation that Broadway musicals still had legs for the medium of film.<br /><br />  Not only would the movie version of DREAMGIRLS feature mega-star Beyonce Knowles, Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx, veteran film star Eddie Murphy and \\"American Idol\\" reject Jennifer Hudson (\\"everybody loves to root for an underdog\\", etc.); DREAMGIRLS would be shepherded to the screen by DREAMWORKS and David Geffen.<br /><br />  But despite what sounds like a 24-carat pedigree, the movie simply falls short of expectations. The script talks about how white performers in the 50's and 60's repackaged black performers' songs and style. But the execution of this point is weak. (Was Hollywood afraid to alienate the white audience it needed to make the film version a bona fide box office hit?) Montages of archival footage of the Civil Rights era are on screen, but they seem to exist in another world from the action of the main storyline.<br /><br />  Despite her Golden Globe win as Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy or Musical, Jennifer Hudson is a weak substitute for the great Jennifer Holiday, who originated the role of Effie White. We want Hudson to be good. But she simply does not have the voice that Holiday used to burrow Effie's rejection and pain into the very bone marrow of those privileged to see her perform the role onstage. Holiday's live version of Effie's powerful lament, \\"And I am Telling You I'm Not Going,\\" is one of the most powerful performances that will ever close a first act--or any act--on the stage or screen. Whereas Holiday's version contains in every breath soul-ravaging pain, Hudson, on certain notes, goes nasal, thin and strained.<br /><br />  Let's face it: this song was the jewel in the original stage musical--the first-act closing number that threatened to blow the theater apart. (DREAMGIRLS' music was never one of the great Broadway scores. The show's success was largely due to its staging technique.) Without a knock-out rendition of that climactic song here, the movie sags--and suffers. Hudson's version gets something of a boost through the showcasing delivered by cinematography and editing. But Holiday in her live, three dimensions, didn't need any help. She knocked the song out of the theater night after night--just her, the orchestra and that once-in-a-lifetime voice. If for no other reason than to capture Holiday's performance on film, DREAMGIRLS should have been filmed twenty years before it was. If they had to use a \\"loser\\" from \\"American Idol\\", too bad they couldn't wait for Mandisa from the 2006 season. That girl can sing.<br />  All the Eddie Murphys and Beyonces in the world cannot make up for this fact. Because DREAMGIRLS was always really \\"about\\" Effie and what happens to her, Jennifer Hudson in this pivotal role is like a fifth or sixth carbon copy of the original--similar, but weak, pale.<br />  Those unfamiliar with Jennifer Holiday might find Hudson more than adequate. But if anyone wants to see--and to hear--\\"Effie White\\", simply go to youtube, type in \\"Jennifer Holiday\\"and watch the clip of her performance from the 1982 Tony Awards show. If her performance, even on a small computer screen, with less than perfect audio, with video glitches and all, doesn't shake you to your very core and leave you knowing you've seen greatness, then call the undertaker, because you are probably dead.<br /><br />  On balance, the performers in the film do  passably adequate jobs with their roles. The problem is that DREAMGIRLS, while \\"about\\" Effie White, has so many characters and so many \\"stars\\"--each of whom it appears was contractually promised to get their \\"big moment\\"--that the movie comes off choppy, not unlike a mass \\"American Idol\\" audition. Just as we're trying to learn about this character or that plot line, we're whooshed off to the next star's \\"big number.\\" The movie, in essence, lacks cohesive flow.<br /><br />  Condon's DREAMGIRLS is an admirable attempt at turning a legendary stage musical into screen gold. Perhaps the movie could never have been made without the wattage of today's established black stars. But the treatment given to these stars--in the form of new songs written for the screen--dilutes the \\"punch\\", the through-line of the original. This version--while the best you're going to get of this legendary show--is something \\"other\\" than what, in 1981, had audiences swept up in the backstage story of a girl group and the bumpy road they traveled to pop stardom.<br /><br />  The best acting job is turned in by Eddie Murphy, whose James \\"Thunder\\" Early seems an hommage to Wilson Pickett, Little Richard, et al. Murphy shows a level of depth here we haven't seen before. While some might not \\"get\\" the comic mixed with the tragic within his performance, anyone familiar with show business knows that the onstage persona performers project can be diametrically opposed to the character's real self once the concerts end and real life resumes.<br />  Hudson, in her first film, brought marquee power via the fans she garnered before she was booted from \\"American Idol.\\" Her acting is as good as most everyone else in the cast. (Actually, who can really tell? The dialogue scenes are so miniscule.) But--and this is a big \\"but\\"--if she had the vocal chops of a Jennifer Holiday--which is perhaps asking for more than Heaven would ever allow--Hudson could have made as auspicious a debut as Barbra Streisand did in FUNNY GIRL. That, however, did not happen. If David O. Selznick in 1939 could scour the planet before finding British actress Vivien Leigh to play Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND, why couldn't DREAMWORKS have done the same in search of the perfect Effie, instead of taking the easy way out and grabbing an \\"American Idol\\" cast-off? This was nothing more than a cynical move to grab the built-in television audience that follows the hugely popular show. Smart? Yes. But cynical nonetheless. If Broadway could find a Jennifer Holiday in 1981, Hollywood could surely have found an unknown--with acting skills AND vocal strength--a quarter-century later. Shame on the moviemakers for skipping out on a golden opportunity that will never come again. The movie is made. The Oscars will be won.

0307237699|5.0|Its hard to believe that O'Bama is actually a politician.  His thoughts on the value of both sides of an arguement and the importance of working together to achieve a common goal are really refreshing in such a divisive world.  He recognizes that while we have different opinions on many things, Republicans and Democrats are all Americans and we generally have the same values, hopes and dreams.  He cares about things that actually matter.  He believes in the power of hope and really believes people can make a difference in the world.  He inspires us to care and to put forth a little effort.

Young boys (and girls) will enjoy the adventures of the cute monkey, especially if they haven't seen him on video.

0446677450|5.0|I read this book rather quickly. Robert makes his points simply and clearly. I have recommended this book to several people and plan on reading his following books as well.
B00005JPGM|4.0|This is an ambitious project that tries to deal with issues such as child soldiers, diamond smuggling, civil wars, helplessness of foreign aids in Africa. As said by characters in the movie, it's T.I.A.  It's all about survival & generally, people need to be ruthless to get through yet another day. Once again, Edward Zwick, the Director who has brought us Glory, Legends of the Fall, the Last Samurai brings us a very emotive movie that strikes all the right chords without becoming cliche oversentimental.  He's helped a great deal by depths of actors & actress such as DiCaprio, Hounsou, & Connelly. Everyone has their own agendas and as we gradually dig beneath the surface, we find humanity that lurks within.  There is vulnerable time where DiCaprio's character, Archer cracks & he divulges to audience what makes him the person that he is.  And so does Connelly's character of why she risks it all when she can lead an ordinary life.  Hounsou's character is more straight-forward, where he would do anything to get his family back.  Overall, the movie is very powerful & well-done.  Despite different movies that Edward makes, one can't help but seeing similarity in themes that he's exploring.  In Glory, there's Denzel Washington who's all proud & full of honour. In Samurai, there's Tom Cruise's character who can't face himself for catastrophe that he wrecks upon innocent Indians, & in Legends of the Fall, there's Brad Pitt who runs away because he feels he has failed his brother who perishes in the World War.  In this instance, there's DiCaprio who feels the shoes.  In the end, the main characters redeem themselves by doing deeds that put everything right.  James Newton Howard who provides soundtrack for King Kong does a marvellous here too.  Overall, this is a tour-de-force that keeps audience like myself thinking & something to be seen on the big screen.  Highly recommended and a movie that makes you think twice next time before you commit yourself buying a diamond for your dearly beloved.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|This film came out before another magic film which I believe to be one of the best of the year, The Prestige.  That movie seemed to have everything that this movie didn't.  Not to say that this isn't a good movie because it is.  All I'm saying is that I guessed much of the plot for The Illusionist while The Prestige kept me off guard and amazed.  Both movies are good and should be rented or bought(PRESTIGE!) ahem.  Sorry.  I just felt like comparing the two movies, but since this is a review for The Illusionist, I'll start the review.<br /><br />Most of the actors/actresses are great.  Paul Giamatti is one of my favorites and once again gives a great performance.  Edward Norton also gives a fabulous performance along with Rufus Sewell.  But then there is Biel.  Ick.  .  Ugh.  Wince.  I am of course refering to her performance.  She looks great, but she just was in over her head in this one.  I think my local movie critic(Chris Hewitt, St. Paul, Pioneer Press) put it best.  He said, \\"Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton deliver great performances, the only problem is that Jessica Biel occasionaly wanders in.\\"  Thats how it is.  A+ for Paul and Norton.  A failing grade for Biel.<br /><br />The Direction was very good, I really disliked the ending which lacked magic.  It wasn't a huge surprise and they never told us how the final trick was done.  I was left going \\"Oh.  Thats it?\\"  I did like the dark tones and colors and grainyish quality.<br /><br />Overall this was a movie that had some mild disappointment and some mild surprise.  Not a great movie, but not bad by any means.  I suggest you rent this then BUY The Prestige.  Of course you might like this more, but my point is at least see both of this films.  Because both will have you believe in magic......
B000009PNY|4.0|You know, tribute albums are things I rarely ever care for. In fact, one CD that I would sell if I get the oppurtunity is this one of boring U2 covers that I accidentally bought. But this album not only has some artists who already had a name, but some of the less obvious DM influences. This is part of why I appreciate this CD. Some of the covers were kind of surprising, like \\"Monument\\" from \\"A Broken Frame,\\" and also \\"Shame\\" (covered by Self, the only artist I had never heard of prior to this compilation) which I wasn't aware of before I got this. While it's clear how heavily influenced a group like God Lives Underwater is by the group, I wouldn't have known that Monster Magnet and Dishwalla were groups who got influenced by DM. <br /> <br />It's a pretty good tribute, as well. It's really interesting to hear Locust's (not to be confused with the noisecore group) interpretation of \\"Master and Servant.\\" I never have thought of an S&M-themed song being played so mellow and playful. I really liked Failure's take on \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and the one track I had always been familiar with was the Pumpkins' take on \\"Never Let Me Down Again.\\" It's surprising that they play that one clean, especially being a B-side of the distortion-happy \\"Siamese Dream\\" era. Basically, the first five tracks are my favorites. It is more hit than miss. <br /> <br />There are a couple points that don't really do it for me. \\"Monument\\" was never really a favorite of mine to begin with, and I don't care for the remake, either. I wish Monster Magnet would've embraced their style a little bit more on \\"Black Celebration\\" as well. <br /> <br />Overall, if you like '90s electronic and alternative music, I recommend this. You'll respect it even if you don't enjoy it. Totally worth getting.
B000026258|5.0|This is really my favourite minimalist recording. I never warmed up to Philip Glass' stuff but this is really one exceptional piece of work. It completely blew my mind when i bought this twenty years ago and I was in a new wave and punk phase. This is really what this kind of music should be like. This is a completely indispensable CD to any collection.

B00003BDXG|1.0|This movie stunk.<br /><br />While I understand the mocking of the public's fixation on tabloids, the movie nontheless was vulgar and did not achieve it's goal. Satirization is difficult and it is not Oliver Stone's foray.<br /><br />While this may sound crazy, John Waters did the same thing with \\"Serial Mom\\" and that movie was effective on it's premise.<br /><br />This end product was just a mean spirited movie. The \\"satire\\" was not prominent enough while the violence and crudity was featured way too much. As an arty movie, it would have been acceptable. As a major, mainstream release, it was a failure.
B0006399FS|4.0|Firstly U2 are beyond legends and their success is almost undefinable.There has never been a band that have survvived this long and still been innovative. Sadly that innovation and newness that we associated with U2 is dying as they are a band artistically going backwards. Sure the diehards (and there's millions of them) will dispute this but i cant help get the impression thart Bono's politics and long periods away from the band is finally catching up with them as the end product seems rushed, forced, much too like A.T.Y.C.L.B. In other words a bit of a cookie cutter mail it in job. im not sure if there is much left in this band anaway. Maybe 2 albums at best. they have nothing to be ashamed of but maybe their time has come and they should go out on a high. The over-exposure of this band is what is killing it. people are getting tired of Bono's political speeches from the stage and even his voice is cracking at some of the gigs. Still U2 are the most heavily critiqued and criticized band in the world because they are still the best. Not by much any more but just about. Coldplay are right behind them and moving up fast and the british invasion #2 post punk movement is putting trememdous pressure on U2s relevancy.But like i said their crown will still have to be won and it could be a few years yet.
B00005JNJV|2.0|What an overrated flick! Batman, as a movie, has been done to death. I found this version to be pretty boring.<br /><br />The beginning of this movie, when Bruce Wayne is doing some martial arts training, was pretty interesting. He develops a mentor relationship with the guy that ultimately becomes his foe.<br /><br />Once he becomes \\"Batman\\", the movie was pretty boring. While I appreciated the attempt at making the story less campy and more gritty, the concept has been so overdone that I think it is not possible to go any further with the character.<br /><br />Tim Burton's first Batman was also dark and gritty. Omit the over the top Joker bit and he also made a similar dark, moody Batman.<br /><br />A problem is that if the premise of the movie was to get away from fantasy and making it more believable, the movie was nontheless... not believable. Especially the \\"Sandman\\" character. A wormy, wussy, wimpy shrink becomes tough as nails once he has his outfit on? Come on!<br /><br />Katie Holmes is simply not a big screen actress. She has no charisma, no star power, and I felt that she was a non believable distraction to the film. She's merely a secondary TV actress.<br /><br />Lastly, I did  not like the ending. It seemed anti-climactic.<br /><br />This franchise should go in either the direction of making a film purely from the \\"Bruce Wayne\\" point of view and omit any fantasy aspect or emulate Raimi's \\"Spiderman\\" or the first X-Men since those films have very effectively captured the magic of the superhero film.<br /><br />If you compare this to the newest Superman film, while that film was flawed also, at least it employed tremendous special effects, and most importantly, examined Clark Kent's desire for love. It employed a fresh, contemporary attitude.<br /><br />Batman Begins seemed like a rehash of the Burton movie  with the same formula yet different costumes, actors and film crew.<br /><br />This was a gallant attempt but I feel that Batman has been exhausted. In the last 20 years there have been too many batman movies.

B000FGGE68|1.0|The 2006 film \\"Ultraviolet\\", which was written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, portrays the story of a female vampire named Violet (Milla Jovovich, who may be best remembered for her portrayal of the character Leeloo in the 1997 sci-fi film \\"The Fifth Element\\"), who, with other vampires (or as they are called in the film, hemophages), fight government & corporate agents who are determined to destroy them.  The surreal futuristic world of \\"Ultraviolet\\" is one in which many people have been infected by a disease that transforms them into hemophages.  Those that are not infected wear large amounts of protective rubber clothing and gas masks (especially soldiers, whose faces are never seen) to avoid being infected.  The point of this film?  Daxus (Nick Chinlund), a seemingly uninfected human in charge, creates clones of himself with which he hopes to destroy the hemophages.  One of the clones, a boy named Six (Cameron Bright), is captured by violet; but instead of destroying him as the other hemophages want her to do, Violet befriends & protects the boy.  Hence, most of this comic-book-like film involves unrealistic martial-arts fighting, lots of weapons, motorcycles, protective gear, an evil corporate boss, an innocent boy and a woman (Violet) who can't decide what hair color she wants as it periodically changes.<br /><br />If you were looking for good acting, an interesting story, well-written dialog, engaging characters and an entertaining sci-fi film, chances are rather high that you won't find any of that in the film \\"Ultraviolet\\".  So (not surprisingly), the only rating that I can give to this uninspired & uninteresting film is 1 out of 5 stars.  My only recommendation: if you want to watch this film, either watch it on TV or rent it before you decide to purchase a copy.

What can we do as individuals to clean up our little corner of the world? <br /> <br />My thoughts are get fluoresant light bulbs that last 5 years (at Walmart or Lowes) and when possible get a hybrid (Toyota Prius is great), solar panels or other energy saving projects to improve your house.

For the these reasons  I would rcommend this book to an audience of mostly fans of u2, bono, or rock history.  <br />      One wonderful strong point of this book is that it is ABSOLUTLEY BRIMMING with wonderful photographs and the graphic design of the book makes the book itself a piece of art. The material itself is really great if you want to know as much as you can about the band. They give acounts of early gigs and many ineresting info about songs and people involved with U2.  <br />      One thing that I had a problem with in this book is the language. There are quite a few profane/swear words. To some people this may not be a bad thing, after all U2 arae a rock band, it's basically excpected. I however didn't like the colourful language.  <br />       All in all this book was a good purchase. Just be prepared for an overload of U2!!!!, and very large pages of radiant photography and interview directly from the memebrs of the band themselves (and paul McGuinness at times).
B000GPIPVU|5.0|What could ANYONE possibly say to sum up this work of art?  A music review doesn't quite seem appropriate.  Even the best of reviewers out there couldn't touch it.  And that's because it's PURE.  Beautifully original. Quietly hypnotic.   Extraordinarily candid.  Perfectly fluid.  Honestly flawless.  Astoundingly real.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Album of the year!   <br />Back with a vengeance and some new tunes that will become classics.  Its not Reign In Blood but comes close to the intensity.  If you like Slayer, you should have had this a long time ago.   <br />See them live when they come, nobody else will compare after
B0000696I1|3.0|This movie is like most sequils to movies that we fell in love with... that is if you are a fan of the oh so awsome ninja turttles.  The movie is mildly amussing with more ninja fighting and a rap scene with Vanilla Ice... what more could you ask for in a movie???

0316096199|3.0|This was certainly an interesting look at what happens after a rape.  However, the end was conusing and not tied together well.  I enjoyed the book but it's not something I want to read again.  It goes into how her life went down the toilet, but not how she got back out.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|Early science fiction film with the classic requirements for the genre.  This film was the first to use electronic music.  Amusing special effects.  Themes of love, loyalty, jealousy.  Altair IV appears later in Star Trek shows. Dr. Morbius (morbid?) studied languages and the ancient Krell people on the planet along with his daughter, Altaira.  Rescue ship (20 years later) comes to take them back to earth but an \\"alien presence\\" prevents them from leaving.  This is the first appearance of Robbie the Robot which began a robot craze after the film was released.
B000059Z8J|3.0|To me Superman is the quintessential superhero. Buff, wholesome, bright and dull. He fights for good and exists without any inner conflict, no time for any of that when there is a world to save. Those well meaning but shrug inducing qualities carry over to this film which wants to be everything (comic book, romance, disaster flick) to everybody (nerds and non-nerds), and while it has endured all these years it did not win me over. Everything starts off well enough as the first hour is almost entirely Superman back story. And it is pretty rich back story considering that before he could even walk he was involved with political treason, exploding planets, paternal sacrifice, and a trip across multiple galaxies. All this exposition does dull the storytelling a little but I wish that all franchise movies were this disciplined. What sank the movie for me was where it went from there; Superman as an adult fighting all the evil he could. Instead of an actual plot with twists and turns, we get an extended montage. Superman saves the day. Superman catches a thief. Lex Luthor causes some evil doin'. Superman stops him. There is far more energy spent pandering to the crowd than there is on making any of this plausible.<br /><br />A very basic outline has Lex Luthor, in one of the most ambitious plots in history, planning to blow off the western edge of California so as to make his own property value go up (better plan than just trying to keep the undesirables out, yes?). Superman, meanwhile, spends a lot of time hanging around Lois Lane. She is the perfect match for him as she is always on the verge of certain death thanks to her inability to use her head. He saves her, she falls in love, girlfriends in the audience are no longer mad that they came. Lois Lane is so stupid in fact that she doesn't notice that her co-worker Clark Kent is actually Superman only plus glasses and minus that hideous outfit. Eventually Lex Luthor shoots a missile into the San Andreas Fault so as to put his plan in motion. Superman, ever the hero, then drills himself into the fault and fixes it. . .by hand! And at that point the film had lost both its connection to reality and me.<br /><br />I do think our obsession with the Superman myth does expose us to be some pretty funny people. We flock to these films to watch the impossible happen, like being able to save the pretty girl and have her fall in love. And to remind ourselves that if the girl could just look a little deeper, past the glasses, that she would find something truly super. I did find it odd that Superman openly states that he is fighting for the American way (um... Corporate Greed? Imperialism?). You could argue that his skills might be better put to use in Somalia as opposed to constantly rescuing a girl he fancies. . . but I guess Somalia is on its own. So despite the restrained first hour and the great set design for Lex Luthor's lair (an abandoned wing of Grand Central Station) I recommend you stay away from this. It is bloated and may cause severe eye rolling. Then again, from a historical perspective, this is the film that opened up the flood gates for the dozens (and dozens!) of other comic book movies that followed. So if you want to see the cause of \\"Catwoman\\" give this one a little look see. **3/4put his plan in motion. Superman, ever the hero, then drills himself into the fault and fixes it. . .by hand!

B00005JKEZ|5.0|Believe it or not Im 41 years old and I still love this film as much as I did when I first saw it at age 7. This time I started to buy 3 copies for christmas presents for my 3 cousins and their children and I had to buy one for myself.
B00000K3D4|3.0|All set and costume design and no script is how I would describe \\"Labyrinth,\\" a vehicle for Jim Henson's imagination which stars Jennifer Connelly back when she was just a kid. She plays Sarah, a girl left in charge of her brother Toby and his incessant crying. Because she makes the mistake of vocalizing her displeasure with this situation David Bowie shows up, wearing some brutally tight pants, and wisks Toby away to a magical land. Since Sarah is a good girl she must save Toby, and the only way to do that is by braving the labyrinth, along the way she will learn some middle class values. . .yadda yadda yadda. Poor Jennifer Connelly is given the task of navigating this role in which she is constantly forced to act off of puppets or nothing at all. Thankless indeed. Her dark yet ordinary good looks made me a fan a long time ago (although not this long ago), but her line reading has always been suspect and here is a prime example. And while this movie is a minor failure it is not her fault, she does her best and I think most actors would have had similar difficulties.<br /><br />Rather it is the script that is the downfall here. Sarah's journey through the labyrinth is fairly well managed. She is bombarded with contradictory messages and straight up trickeration, just like she would be in the real world. The lessons she learns are lessons that we lovers of film have learned many times before. The power of the mind is greater than the power of the body and often times power only resides in the mind of the oppressed. But their characters are a mess, they have nothing to say and spend a lot of time saying it. I found it impossible not to lose interest about half way through as the crazy speak coming out of these characters mouths was not worth listening to in the least. Maybe it plays better with the younger set, where an oversized Fozie Bear with the personality of Eeyore could actually hold someone's attention, but I parted ways with my imagination many moons ago.<br /><br />The puppets themselves do look great. There was obviously a lot of creativity that went into their creation and I commend them for it. It is just that in the past few years puppets have started to spoil me. I'm used to them singing great show tunes or making crank phone calls, but these guys kind of just stand around looking creepy, acting like riff raff. There are other missteps to be found here as well. I have no idea why Henson depended on an actual baby to provide facial expressions and dance. There is also a trippy musical number that involves the characters taking off their heads and using them as soccer balls. That scene added nothing to the film and only served to make you wonder what exactly you are watching. But I hold no grudge against this film. It is a cousin of sorts to the \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" series, as they both have a teen who must travel through the dark side of the world of make believe. This is a very soft version of said dark side, but dark nonetheless. It is our wildest dreams, but it is also nonsense. Nonsense that sort of kept me entertained, but not enough to recommend it. The person who loaned me this DVD said that it was the greatest children's film of all time, unfortunately I'm not buying what he is selling. Yes, it has a look and fell all it's own, but it is empty (and thus vain), and while I know that empty sells tickets it doesn't earn itself a positive review from me.  **3/4<br /> <br />The puppets themselves do look great.

There are also interesting storylines involving some new patient each week.  Very enjoyable.  This is a highly recommended 5 star series.  Great fun.  I now know what all the fuss has been about.

B00005JPKC|5.0|The second installment of Clint Eastwood's epic Pacific Theatre movies, `Letters from Iwo Jima' is just as grand as `Flags of Our Fathers,' but the understated scenes create a more poignant atmosphere that resonates more powerfully throughout the whole movie.  No where does the movie try to take sides.  I didn't watch this movie telling myself, `I didn't know the Americans were so savage.'  That's not really the point.  Eastwood and screenwriter take the position of individual Japanese participants without any thought of the Axis.  What they do is show how war sweeps up decent, ordinary people in its bloody grips.  There are corresponding battle scenes that work well in both movies.  This time we see it from the Japanese angle.  The graphic battle scenes surely don't hide the brutal affair that war truly becomes.   <br /> <br />The point-of-view is from a sympathetic Japanese soldier, Capt. Kirbashi (Ken Wanabe), who has visited America during a time that both sides couldn't conceive of war between the two countries.  He has pleasant encounters, but a telling scene shows comraderie with an American soldier who honors him in the States.  He indicates that a true soldier puts his country first.  However, later even he will offer a dying American soldier a nearly deplete portion of morphine.  (How much of a measure was that the usual course, I doubt, from either side.)  Another focus is for two young soldiers.  They, like many of their peers, believe their fate is marked on the island.  Their commander, Lt. Ito, is a nasty superior who always browbeats and actually once beats one with a cane for showing, allegedly, a lack of patriotism.   He is the arm of most Japanese sentiment.  Being men of honor, they are willing to commit suicide, rather than face dishonor.  One of them was discharged earlier for not having shot a dog on order.   We see how the Japanese operations work as government officials break up a reluctant young Japanese couple with a newborn.  \\"Congratulations!\\" the woman official exclaims.  It is a nice reminder of how people are often at mercy in the world of their own governments and circumstances beyond their control. <br /> <br />I asked myself, considering myself a patriotic American, why I liked  `Letters from Iwo Jima' better than `Flags of Our Fathers'.  I believe, although excellent, 'Flags of Our Fathers' doesn't try to get bogged down with some trivia pursuit it took with the participants in the photo flag-raising.  'Letters from Iwo Jima' sees all of us as potential victims falling into the vortex of war, even on a bloody, desolate rock island in the middle of the Pacific.     <br />
B000JK8OYU|5.0|A longtime Beatlemaniac, I have been underwhelmed in the past by anthologies, hits collections, and other unabashed milking of the fab four discology, so it is not with open arms that I initially greeted the news of this latest resurrection. Only the imprimatur of George Martin & son calmed my fears enough to check out \\"Love\\" and, dear God, am I glad I did. This work is a revelation for Beatles fans everywhere and worthy of every bit of praise that's been heaped upon it. It is, in many respects, the holy grail that we've all been waiting on for decades -- a NEW BEATLES ALBUM. <br /> <br />The tracks that are newly concocted from juxtapositions of otherwise disconnected songs are a mind-trip -- precisely because they take that which is iconic and familiar and render it fresh. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows/Within You Without You\\" is the most talked-about of these collages, but equally stunning are \\"Octopus' Garden,\\" \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" and several others. <br /> <br />Some of the other tracks are more accurately classified as re-mixes, but even these are ear-opening, as they provide a new, cleaner listen to vocal and instrumental tracks that were heretofore locked in their original mixes (and, in some cases, losing excitement with each passing year, if only from repetitive listening.) I suspect it is these tracks that have prompted some reviewers to say that the Martins \\"didn't go far enough,\\" but to wish for additional studio trickery is to miss the pristene beauty of these new, unadorned mixes and risk gimmickry. <br /> <br />A third category of track is what could only be called an \\"alternate version,\\" and these are the true gems of the collection. Harrison's \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is represented by an acoustic demo backed by a new George Martin string arrangement (the only newly-recorded material on the disc) to create a song that feels wholly new and -- dare I say -- superior to the original. Likewise, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is constructed from one of the many, legendary outtakes of that classic, and is allowed to build from an unplugged, intimate ballad into the fuller pastiche that history knows, thereby imbuing it with greater force than the original is today capable of conveying. Even \\"Tomorrow/Within You\\" takes two tracks that are not among The Beatles' most listenable and blends them into something that feels greater than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br />Some of the thrills for Beatles wonks comes in recognizing tiny snippets of uncredited tracks deep in the mix (i.e., the piccolo trumpet from \\"Penny Lane\\" or the maritime SFX from \\"Yellow Submarine\\"). But the real treat comes in hearing even the least-tampered-with tracks in a purer, less-produced state than ever before. (\\"Something,\\" \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" \\"A Day In The Life.\\") <br /> <br />If you're a Beatles fan, BUY THIS DISC. And then buy a copy for every Beatles fan you know. A million thanks to the Martins and Cirque for giving us this (or, at least, selling it to us.) <br /> <br />Now, how about a sequel? Some nominations: \\"In My Life,\\" \\"Penny Lane,\\" \\"Fool On The Hill,\\" \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away,\\" \\"Getting Better,\\" \\"The Long And Winding Road,\\" -- or just about anything else!

B000005RT8|1.0|You do not want to purchase this CD unless you have every other McCartney CD and wish to have a complete collection.  This record is tied with Pipes of Peace as the worst McCartney recording - even with the Bonus Goodnight Tonight thrown in.  From a musician's perspective it is perhaps admirable that he plays all the instruments and recorded the whole album at home, but from a listener's point of view it is mostly painful.  The CD opens with Coming Up, a song with potential as evidenced by the live version on Back in the U.S. CD. Temporary Secretary is somewhat amusing and musically clever. It could close Side I of an album. It isn't good enough for a #2 song.  Waterfalls is frankly schmaltzy and would need a great deal of work to make it as a full fledged song.  The only song I like is Summer Day Song,which somehow has a deeply mystical/religious aspect that makes me want to kneel and bow my head. It's a distant cousing of Warm and Beautiful from Wings at the Speed of Sound. This song will come back one day in the form of religious music.   Is is worth getting the whole CD for this song?  Only if you are desperate for a McCartney song you haven't heard yet.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|I didn't really watch the show during it's first season, but I got the DVDs for Christmas and decided to give it a go. <br />Now I preface my review by saying that I'm a huge fan of Buffy and Smallville, as well as Ghost Hunters. I say this because If you are fan of any of the above, then I think you'll enjoy this show as well. It has more edge that Smallville, lot more scare than Buffy, and ties in nicely with somethings you learn on Ghost Hunters. But at the heart of the show is the brothers and their relationship.  <br /> <br />Dean, the elder, has had to shoulder responsibility since he was 4 and basically raise his younger brother, Sam. They live in a world just under the radar of normal life. They hunt demons, ghosts, the stuff of ledends for us. Sam has been free of the \\"family business\\" for 4 years while in college. But he's pulled back in when their father goes missing while on a \\"hunting trip.\\"  <br />The development of the brothers realtionship to each other and the world they live in is the backbone of the show, however the scares get you too. This is a prime example of why it's great to live in the FX age. The special effects are awesome, and I promise even the most die hard horror buff will jump at least once!  <br /> <br />So I would say get the DVD's and then watch Thursday Nights at 9pm on the CW
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I unwrapped my gift on the counter of Post Office and listened to it in the car as I drove home with such happiness. <br /> <br />Enya's music is like a memory of all that is good and right and honorable in this world.  <br /> <br />Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
B000IU3XTM|3.0|Let me get this out of the way:  I loved \\"O\\", I loved \\"Live at Union Chapel.\\"  Both were beautifully crafted albums that could evoke joy on one track and tears on the next. <br /> <br />\\"9\\" is, well, no where near that level.  I think it is an 'okay' album.  It is sad, angry, and generally kind of morose.  There are a couple of beautiful tracks/melodies, but by in large it has an angrier tone than \\"O.\\"  Why you might ask - from the lyrics it seems like Damien got dumped by a girl and is ticked off about it and wants everyone to know.  Not really what I wanted to hear when I bought the album, but everyone needs to express their anger (I guess).  A couple of songs are good to really good, but overall the album suffers from mediocre songs that aren't really bad, per se, but aren't what I was hoping for after \\"O.\\" <br /> <br />Of course, it is hard to follow up an album as wonderful as \\"O\\" was. <br /> <br />I also wanted to note an issue I have with DR albums in general - they are mixed very quietly.  If every other album I listen to in my car is a 5, I have to turn the volume up to 7 or 8 to hear DR.  Why is this an issue?  I feel like having it so loud loses some of the nuances of the song - I have to blare it, so when the song crescendo's I either have to turn it down or plug my ears.  He should take a lesson from Ray LaMontagne who keeps the mix at an appropriate level and doesn't lose any of the dynamics.

B000JIHP88|5.0|This mobile sends him off to sleep every time.  I love that the music lasts so long--with the wind up ones, he would just start to settle down when it would shut off.  There are two volume levels; usually the quieter one is enough for bedtime.  My only (minor) complaint is that the remote control for it makes a loud clicking sound when you press it (enough to make him stir, but not wake up).
B000002ADT|5.0|It took me a few hearings to finally appreciate the beauty of this CD, but it was worth waiting for it to sink in.  This is not the kind of music that takes you by the throat and forces you to listen.  It has a majesty of expression that just kind of takes over bit by bit.  The players create a parallel universe in which you can luxuriate all the way through, and then you'll want to repeat the experience.  Some have said this is the first psychedelic album, and while Miles Davis' cannabis intake *may* have had an influence on the content of this music, it stands on it's own as one of the greatest *mood* pieces ever performed.  It simply takes you away.

0060934913|5.0|I happened to catch an episode of \\"No Reservations\\" and became mesmerized by this \\"swashbuckling\\" (one of the recurring adjectives applied to Bourdain) and sexy...CHEF???  Those people in funny hats & funnier pants?  So when a friend loaned me \\"Kitchen Confidential,\\" I...well...ate it up faster than a creme brulee at les Halles. Bourdain is a piece of work...drug fiend, Nine Inch Nails headbanger, filthy-mouthed guttersnipe, genius and really, really good writer!  His love of food is poetic, his advice on necessary kitchen utensils and pantry supplies quite useful, and his strolls down memory lane both hilarious and cringingly icky. I'm planning a trip to NYC with the express object of eating at Les Halles...on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  Heaven forbid I should go on the weekend!!

B0002IQNAG|5.0|For a while I had been confused by just how many versions of this classic exist. I've seen the original but have heard of a Europian version as well. I am pleased to say that before you here is the ultimate Dawn of the Dead (hence the name). You have the good old original theatrical vesion that you know and love to death, But also here you are given some real special treats. <br /> <br />Dawn of the Dead Europian version: Here we have a shorter and slightly more darker version of the U.S. version. While basicaly it's the same movie, a lot of the hurmor in the original version is edited out. Originaly called Zombi in Europe. <br /> <br />Dawn of the Dead: Exteneded version: Here we have a 12 minute longer version of the original which was actualy the version which premered at the Cannes Film Festival. Intersting what was edided out here including a cameo by Joe Pilato who would later return in Day of the Dead as the revolver toting army Captain with the bad attitude. <br /> <br />Documentaries: A great collection of cast and crew interviews, original making of documentary, home movies, and what I liked the best a Monroeville Mall tour with none other than Ken Foree as your guide which was done right before the mall was unfortunatly demolished. <br /> <br />You are also given trailers, stills, Commecials for the mall, and a mini comic book containing over 20 pages from the Dawn of the Dead paperback comic. To say it simpily, if you love this movie you will love this set. 3 differn't versions along with tons of extras make this a must for any horror fan.
B00004T9AF|5.0|Much has been written about Mike Oldfield's debut album and with Oldfield's autobiography \\"Changeling\\" set for release this coming May, we will have yet more stories and tales, this has given the album an almost mythical cultural status. But rather than make the act of reviewing the album redundant, its ability to produce many responses is important and lies in its capability to transport the listener to a realm in which the full gamut of emotions are expressed and experienced through the shifting tones and instrumentation Oldfield employs. It affords the listener little time for introspective self reflection like a good many albums do as it leaps playfully from one theme to another. Often this leap is harsh and jagged due to the technology of the day which Oldfield pushed to its furthest limit, but this just adds to the improvised quality of the album. The constant battle between violent and aggressive guitar playing and the calm, pastoral and serene lament of a Glockenspiel or a multitude of so many different pieces of light percussion, including the eponymous tubular bell shows the differing moods and mental states of a young and troubled mind coping with a precocious talent. \\"Tubular Bells\\" is a complex epic production, which completely fulfils its progressive rock credentials. Oldfield switches effortlessly between various forms including avant-garde experimentation, classical, rock and the commercialism of mainstream pop in a way even Pink Floyd failed to do. A true landmark in popular music which Oldfield has since struggled to improve upon or even match.
0140284087|5.0|This volume of ten stories originally hails from 1925. I read them in the 1999- 2000 Penguin paperback edition. While many readers like the covers by Ionicus on earlier Penguin paperbacks, these recent editions with covers by David Hitch are my favorites. They are very well done, reasonably priced and just the right size, which is to say, perfect for the novice or seasoned Wodehouse reader. The stories are also among the absolute tops in the Wooster/ Jeeves canon, and give the back stories that Bertie meditatively refers to in so many of the later books.<br /><br />As Richard Usborne notes in his invaluable guide, Plum Sauce, five of these stories appeared earlier in My Man Jeeves (1919). Two of the stories there told by Reggie Pepper are here transformed into Bertie's ruminations. Carry On Jeeves was the next collection following the ten stories in The Inimitable Jeeves (1923), and Wodehouse was on a roll. Here's Bertie's first engagement to Florence Craye, and his first encounter with her younger brother, Edwin, the Boy Scout, who rapidly renders unsafe house and home. Enter Biffy and Bingo Little, later fixtures in the Wooster ouvre. Here also Bertie pens his oft- mentioned \\"piece\\" for his \\"good aunt\\" Dahlia Travers, and her struggling paper, Milady's Boudoir. The last story in this collection is somewhat questionably narrated by Jeeves, but Wodehouse fortunately reverted to telling tales in first person Bertie in the later shorts. Some of these tales also found their way into the Jeeves and Wooster TV shows with even more riotous results. All in all, a capital collection.

It is such a great and motivating force for, both beginning your trek toward financial freedom, and toward developing yourself to be the best person you can be.  T. Harv Eker knows that it's not all about the money, it's about life, and happiness, and not complaining, and developing yourself to be a top-notch human being.  This needs to reach more people who prefer to complain and not take their lives and their futures into your own hands!  I even recommend it for teenagers!

B000A78Z82|1.0|Don't get it.  Not only do none of these songs do anything for me, but I resent the Gil and Veloso comparisons.  This dude, first of all, takes his Jesus look very seriously.  Secondly, his voice is horrible.  Every time there is a chance to be soulful, important in American Roots music, Banhart wimps out and instead sings from some drugged-out self indulgent caldron.  Thirdly, there are to many \\"womb\\" references for my comfort and they are all weird.  He has nothing to say, no real ideas in the music.  The \\"sound\\" doesn't explore any new territory and just comes off cramped and trite.
B000E0W24S|4.0|I think this is the best and most exciting interpretation and performance of Tchaik 4 that I've ever heard (from the start of mvt 1 - to the crashing finale).  This CD is worth it alone for the playing that Mravinsky and the Leningrad Phil do on Tchaik 4. <br /> <br />The other symphonies are quite good, but i feel there are better recordings out there (Gergiev Tchaik 6 is unbeatable).   <br /> <br />What makes the 4th here so wonderful?  Well, it's quite simply the ferver, commitment, and drive that these players muster up to push this wonderful symphony throughout. <br /> <br />It is extreme - the musicians are pushing themselves to the limits - which I feel is what Tchaikovsky is about.  The playing on this disc is full of passion, which I would take over anything else in music.  Passion. <br /> <br />A wonderful performance all around, you won't be dissapointed by symphonies 5 and 6 in the slightest, but I don't feel they are the best versions.   <br /> <br />This CD is a MUST HAVE for all Tchaik fans.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie made a big impact on me as it made me aware that our earth will no longer remain the way it was for us by the time our children grow up. It was a scary feeling...especially because we're seeing it happen before our eyes - the warmer weather around the world, the natural disasters and yet we do nothing about it. On the DVD, Al Gore gave an update after the movie, which should cause even more concern on our part. I went to the suggested website right after the movie and realized that my impact was \\"Average\\" on the global warming. But after having seen this movie I wanted to change the way I live and help bring down my negative impact on the environment. Having grown up in country like India, I am automatically programmed to save water and electricity but I wanted to make more changes. Here is what I would say we do if we want to make an impact on our environment. If all of us do something, the total impact will surely be great.<br />- Walk when you can, change your car to an energy efficient car if you can afford it<br />- Carpool as often as you can, or use mass transit<br />- Change all the light bulbs in your house to energy efficient compact fluorescent bulbs<br />-Turn down the thermostat by a few degrees, I have taken to wearing warm socks and a light sweater so I can turn down the thermostat<br />-Switch off all lights and appliances not in use - like computers plugged in, other appliances, lights in a room when you walk out, bathroom lights, outdoor lights you don't need for \\"security\\"<br />- Switch all outdoor lights to solar, consider putting up solar panels if you live in a house to use that energy<br />- Turn off the water when you're just brushing your teeth, or shaving and don't need the faucet to run<br />- Refuse grocery bags when you can at the store, take your own bag or carton and bring stuff out in a cart and load that bag/carton. If you have to use grocery bags, reuse them as much as you can like for throwing out trash, so that you use some less plastic in a day<br />- If you own a business, please switch off all lights at night inside the store/office - it always amazes me that in America we do not turn off the lights at night<br />- Let's recycle all our trash as much as we can<br />- Plant a tree, I think we should encourage everyone in our communities to have a tree planting day when we go and plant trees in areas around our cities<br />-Support environmental initiatives, by donating time and money<br />Simple steps, but if all of us follow these steps it will create a snowball effect to start reducing our negative impact on the environment.<br />Let's begin today!<br /><br />Edit - I got some negative comments on this review which say that the film is political propaganda. My point is that even if the film is political propaganda it did jolt me into realizing it was time I took some responsibility to protect our resources as they're not going to last forever.<br /><br />Film or no film, the fact remains that we need to think about our environment. We are part of a society and culture that loves to consume. Conserving water, electricity, fuel is something that you do in many countries out of necessity. In America, luckily we don't need to be so cautious as there is no such scarcity. Still, it is just good to be more frugal and try to conserve resources when we can. And even if there is a 10% chance that some of our actions will help conserve our environment for future generations then it is worth taking that step.f you own a business, please switch off all lights at night inside the store/office - it always amazes me that in America we do not turn off the lights at night  - Let's recycle all our trash as much as we can  - Plant a tree, I think we should encourage everyone in our communities to have a tree planting day when we go and plant trees in areas around our cities  -Support environmental initiatives, by donating time and money  Simple steps, but if all of us follow these steps it will create a snowball effect to start reducing our negative impact on the environment.

0375831002|5.0|The first page captured me; the rest of the book enchanted me.  A compelling story of Germany during World War II from the perspective of the most universal of all narrators:  death.  Not death the feared grim reaper, but death overworked by the ravages of World War II while experiencing all the human emotions of the souls he takes.  Omnipresent death watching over and commenting on the lives of those who are soon to be his responsibility.  Entertwined with the exploits of death is the story of a young girl, abruptly taken from her mother and raised by foster parents who represent opposite ends of the parental spectrum.  She struggles to understand the chaos of war and the irrationality of the fanatical Nazis who want to kill the Jew hiding in her house. Her sanity is maintained only through her covert acquisition of books that offer her the only hope she can grasp for normalcy.<br /><br />Historically enlightening for its perspective on the Germans who secretly defied the Nazi regime; psychologically engaging for its examination of the effects of those who are unwillingly drawn into the vortex of war.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|My opinion about this DVD. <br /> <br />This is next to no documentary, yes it is a dramatic and funny dvd.  I saw the inflicted insecurities on Louie Ferrigno by big Arnie.  I could not believe the acting Arnie put on the DVD.  \\"Franco is a child, he comes to me for advices ..\\" &lt;---  hahahahahaha   The camaraderie that took place is awesome.  After all, this docudrama dvd really shows another world.  Worth watching it as an inspirational bibliography for all of us.

0765315246|3.0|What are you looking for in a science fiction book?  Do you want character development, or an insight into our society, or into what society may look like in the future?  Or is a clever McGuffin enough to carry you.  (A McGuffin is what the late film director, Alfred Hitchcock, called the artistic device that appeared to be what the story was about, and which provided the hook for looking at character or society.)<br /><br />\\"Old Man's War\\" is a McGuffin-only book.  It's difficult to write a review about a McGuffin-only book without revealing the McGuffin.  It's even harder when the McGuffin is telegraphed by the book's title and is revealed early in the tale.  Moreover, this McGuffin isn't even particularly clever, being similar to a number of others that have been making the science fiction rounds in the last few years.  Once we get the McGuffin, we get a semi-high tech version of the movies \\"Top Gun\\" and \\"Officer and a Gentleman\\".  We even get the typical war movie with a cast of soldiers that represent society.  One character's main role seems to be to explain the science of what's going on for us simple-minded readers.  This science is almost irrelevant, except that it gives the author a chance to say that he didn't mislead us about what is coming in the story.<br /><br />The story is written plainly, pitched to the reader who is happy with short sentences without a lot of figures of speech.  Much of the exposition is in \\"He said, I said\\" conversations.  In some literature, this type of conversation provides insight into the characters, but not here.<br /><br />As a side note, I had a hard time figuring out whether the author was generally in favor of war or against it.  There is a set piece where someone who believes in negotiating before fighting disagrees with the use of force early in societal contact so that you think this theme might be behind the book, but the theme isn't fully developed.  Similarly the author suggests that military people are at their best when they fight out of their devotion to the military organization but that idea goes no where and certainly isn't quite supported by the story's development.<br /><br />If you want a quick science fiction read, without too many insights, this might do.  If you want more, look elsewhere.of their devotion to the military organization but that idea goes no where and certainly isn't quite supported by the story's development.

Kate is by far my fave. and The Dreaming...my fave record. i can't believe it disappointed so many upon its release. anyhoo, the lyrics, the stories she tells, the instruments and sounds, combined with the raw emotion just kill, really get you at your core. whether its her giddy excitement at rescuing/freeing her lover or her violent inner struggle with survival vs. guilt, you can feel it. the background vocals are fantastic as well, emphasizing her point but not overwhelmingly. i especially love the chant in the title song. dreeeeeaaaaammmmmtttttaaaaammmmm (get it, dreamtime?). great stuff, if you like adventurous, imaginative music (that is so fun to sing along with), check this one out. you won't be disappointed.

B0002YLC24|5.0|If you are considering watching Before SUNSET prior to watching Before SUNRISE - don't. Stop right there and first watch Before SUNRISE. Then wait a few months, and then watch Before SUNSET. Doing this will irrevocably cement the bond between the two and legitimize the effect.    Before SUNRISE is perfect, with great acting. Before SUNSET, however, when bootstrapping onto Before SUNRISE, gains remarkable momentum and sparkles with reverent genius at every given angle, making this complimentary pair of productions greater than the sum of their whole. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy in both films render award winning performances, however Ms. Delphy takes off for the stars in Before SUNSET and perfects the portrayal of her character.

0393061434|4.0|This was a thoroughly enjoyable book for \\"geeks\\", historians of recent events, and those who just want to know how computers went from huge air conditioned shrines, to winding up on everyone's desktop. iWoz gives you a feel for just how surprising it was to invent a revolutionary product. Whether you're an Mac, Windows or Linux holy warrior, you have to be impressed by how the personnel computer started and changed almost every aspect of our lives. I found his engineer's perspective enlightening, and at times had a deeply familiar quality. <br />If you have read Bill Gates, Tim Berners-Lee, or Robert Metcalfe's Biographies, Woz will give you the last piece of the technology puzzle of how things came to be, and frankly, it is a much better read.
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris book is to be applauded for the odasity of clear and straight forward vision he puts fourth. His idea of \\"No Special treatment for religious beliefs\\" when it comes to criticism of religious faith should be preached high and loud. In todays world, we can no longer afford to appease those ludicrous clregys or Imams who claim to have the answer for life greatest riddle. We must confront ignorance head-on with all the might of science, knowledge and reason that we can muster and never waiver a second. Yet, judging from my own personal experience, eliminationg religious faith can be a daunting task on a personal level, so applying it on a mass population is far a greater challenge for humanity.
0679422714|4.0|A long-overdue debunking of the worst tyrant in human history.  But it is important to keep in mind that he was not alone in his ruination of China.  Communism was a living faith in China in the 1930s.  Female cadres who hiked over mountains during the Long March, their partially-born infants emerging between their legs, to abandon them at the next stop, were surely fired with an unshakeable sense of purpose.  Mao played these and other idealists, there and in the West, like a pawn-shop fiddle, but they loved him none the less.  In public, at least.<br /><br />This book met with considerable skepticism from liberal and leftist reviewers.  One could easily tell that they were mostly pining for their vanished youth, wearing Mao caps and Che shirts, rather than taking honest stock of what godalmighty useful fools they had been.  This book probably won't nail Mao's coffin shut--but it certainly should, in a fair world.<br /><br />Some fair-use excerpts:<br /><br />When Chou first arrived in Ruijin at the end of 1931, he had adjudged Mao's purge methods as not altogether correct.  Mao had \\"relied entirely on confessions and torture,\\" and \\"caused terror in the masses.\\"  Chou rehabilitated some victims. [...] But within a matter of months Chou had brought this respite to an end.  Even so short a period of rehabilitation and easing up had released a groundswell of dissidence.  \\"Relaxing about purges caused counter-revolutionaries...to raise their heads again,\\" Chou's security men noted aghast.  And as people thought, wishfully, that there would be \\"no more killings,\\" \\"no more arrests,\\" they started to band together to defy Communist orders.  It rapidly became clear that the regime could not survive without constant killings, and killing soon restarted.<br /><br />******<br /><br />In January 1952, [...] Mao ordered [a] campaign [...] called \\"the Five-Antis.\\"  The offences were bribery, tax evasion, pilfering state property, cheating and stealing economic information.  It was aimed at private businessmen, whose property had not been confiscated, to force them to disgorge money, as well as to frighten them out of acts like bribery and tax evasion.  One person involved at a high level put the number of suicides [...] as at least 200,000-300,000. In Shanghai so many people jumped from skyscrapers that they acquired the nickname \\"parachutes.\\"  One eyewitness wondered why people jumped into the street rather than into the river.  The reason, he discovered, was that they wanted to safeguard their families: \\"If you jumped into the Huangpu River and were swept away so the Communists didn't have a corpse, they would accuse you of having escaped to Hong Kong, and your family would suffer.  So the best way was to leap down to the street.\\"<br /><br />*******<br /><br />Now he was master of China.  His coming [to Hangzhou, near Shanghai] had been suitably prepared.  A famous turn-of-the-century estate called Water and Bamboo had been picked for him.  It was adorned with ponds and bamboo groves, and vines and palm trees, and enjoyed a panoramic view over the Western Lake.  Villas next to it, and the hills behind it, were all incorporated into a single enormous estate, covering 36 hectares.  The hill behind was hollowed out to provide a nuclear shelter.  Mao stayed in an exquisite building, combining classical Chinese and exotic foreign styles, with pillars, doors and decorations which had been lovingly shipped in piece by piece by the original owner.  But shortly afterwards, Mao had it torn down and replaced with his usual nondescript identikit structure.  The creaking of the old timber had rattled his nerves with thoughts about assassins.  He only felt safe in a reinforced concrete bunker.<br /><br />******<br /><br />Russia's ambassador to Peking at the time [the early 1960s], Chevonenko, told us that Moscow instructed him to try to refuse Chinese food exports, and that Russia had sometimes declined to accept shipments of grain.  The Russians knewonly too well about the famine. \\"You didn't have to do any investigation,\\" Chervonenko said. \\"It was enough just to drive in from the airport.  You could see there were no leaves on the trees.\\"  On one occasion, when the Chinese said they were going to increase meat shipments, the Russians asked how.  The answer was: \\"None of your business!\\"of grain.  The Russians knew only too well about the famine. \\"You didn't have to do any investigation,\\" Chervonenko said. \\"It was enough just to drive in from the airport.  You could see there were no leaves on the trees.\\"  On one occasion, when the Chinese said they were going to increase meat shipments, the Russians asked how.  The answer was: \\"None of your business!\\"
B0002RQ2T4|2.0|When I was a child, I'd brood for hours about the fact that the \\"world\\" to me was only what came into the sphere of my senses - so that it was as if I was The Center of the Universe.  And yet all the other billions of people in the world, each of them was also the center of the universe, and only perceived of it what THEIR senses showed THEM.  We were all trapped in our own heads, as though we were all in Separate Universes.  Wow!  Eventually, somebody put it into my head to wonder how I could PROVE that anything but myself really existed at all.  I would touch things and think \\"Am I really touching this, or do I just THINK I'm touching this.\\"  And then - but oh, wait!  I am so sorry. Am I BORING you?      If NOT, then you might like this movie, which is about a woman who stares at the floor a lot and ponders in monotone the fact that she is an android.  Her body and much of her brain have been replaced by cooler android updates which make her smarter and more kick than the average human.  But IS she still human?  Does she have a soul?  Why is she asking that question when a soul is something which shows up on a scanner in this movie anyway?      \\"What is me\\" she wonders, \\"Am I my hand, my arm, my big soulful eyes (closeup please), my soft brown hair which keeps waving in every breeze?  Is it this really sturdy android body that I strip naked at every opportunity so that the viewer can stare at it, and stare at it, and stare at it some more, and chastely ponder the fact that it is not a real body, while my partner chivalrously avoids staring at it just as though it was a real body, even though it is not.  And when you are not staring at me or watching him NOT stare at me, let's have long dreamy shots of the city, which pause at store windows to stare at the mannequins within, so you can further ponder what the difference is between those artificial bodies and MY artificial body.  Because that is a very important difference to ponder, and we must make really really sure that everyone in the audience ponders it whether they give a rat's rear end or not.\\"    The animation is seriously excellent, so much so it is probably enough for those who already know and love the story and characters from other sources.  But judged on it's own, this film hardly thinks much of the viewer's intelligence.  Other films this has been compared to, MATRIX and BLADE RUNNER, might not have been perfect, but they took their main Idea and made it a story.  GITS takes an idea and has people stare out the window thinking about it.  You can get more Deep Concepts in a single paragraph of HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY.  Either GITS doesn't really have anything to say, or the manga had TOO much to say, and the movie chose not to even tackle it.  The plot is a convoluted mystery in which we must put a good deal of effort into following, despite that we have zero emotional investment in anyone involved, with an ending reminiscent of bad Star Trek.  I personally found it wearisome and even overlong, but what is boring to some might have a meditative quality to others.     This film leaves me with zero desire to read the manga or see the series, a reluctance to attempt any more \\"classic anime\\", and some horrible STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION flashbacks.  For some reason it also gave me the urge to look up Wordsworth, whom I have not read since freshman English, so I got something out of it.

B000J4QWMC|2.0|I like Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx a lot. I think they're good actors. But they both seemed to have phoned their performances in on this one. Pretty much everybody involved did. Nothing original. Nothing to care about. The movie didn't really pick up until the scene in the trailer. Which was the end. The rest was pretty boring.
B000GCG59W|5.0|HER BEST PRODUCTION TO DATE. HOPE TO HEAR MORE FROM THIS TALENTED SINGER.
1400097029|3.0|I am usually a fan of novels that win the Man Booker Prize, but the 2005 victor has left me surprisingly nonplussed. It is certainly a trim volume that, at 195 pages, moves along quickly and is very well written by John Banville, who has quite a lyrical, beautiful way of phrasing his prose (each word seems carefully chosen for maximum effect). It got on very well in the start, when narrator Max Morden and his wife, Anna, are given the terrible news that Anna has developed a terminal cancer. The scene that Banville paints as they receive the news and return home together, too shocked to know what to say, is heartbreaking and genuine, and it is quite a shame that the rest of the novel fails to follow suit. That is the one moment of raw emotion Max allows in his narration, and the novel suffers as a result. It is hard to feel for Max, a man who seems desperate for our empathy and understanding but equally determined that we should not pity him. So he builds a roadblock of sorts between him and the reader he is telling his story to, just as he builds roadblocks against the people in his everyday life. The end product is a stubbornly impersonal novel that could have done with a more human touch. There are brief, shocking moments when Max's repressed anguish surfaces, as on page 145 when he suddenly, inexplicably rages at his dead wife, calling her despicable expletives and asking \\"...how could you go and leave me like this, floundering in my own foulness, with no one to save me from myself. How could you.\\" Then, just as quickly as it arrives, the moment passes, and we are left with the sternly unlikable Max that he is so determined to present to us. And unlikable he is, despite my attempts to rationalize his thoughts and actions. He treats his daughter with cold contempt and his derision of her fiance may, finally, have scared him off. He is vain and selfish and scornful. There are attempts by Banville to explain the origin of these traits; Max was born in poverty and grew up desperate to break through the class barrier, and after marrying the wealthy Anna, distancing himself from his mother and changing his name, he is eager to gloat about his successful machinations up the social ladder. There is also the back story of Max's time with the Grace family over one fateful summer as a child. That summer Max first felt the sting of lust and obsession, first on Mrs. Grace and then on her cruel-hearted daughter, Chloe. But the juxtaposition doesn't work because the tragedy of his entwining with the Graces isn't as realistic as the tragedy of his wife's illness and death. Chloe and her twin brother Myles (a mute boy with webbed toes) are inexplicably wicked, and it is difficult to understand the relationship that develops between them and Max. Even a social climber like Max would be hard pressed to put up with their cruelties. Banville also has a curious description of scents; the supposedly alluring odors of vinegar and milk (from Mrs. Grace) and a cheesy tang (Chloe) fall quite flat (do those aromas really pass for sensual?). The build-up to the climax of the Grace arc manages to produce a mild degree of tension, but when tragedy strikes it is disappointingly dull and predictable. It is also off-putting that the tragedy is not accidental but willful. There is, typically of Max, a disconnect with the emotion that he should have been feeling at such a loss and the actions that he takes as it unfolds. That disconnect, as intentional as it may be, is the novel's great flaw, and it makes \\"The Sea\\" peter out with a lame whimper instead of the roar Banville was clearly trying for. There is also a \\"twist\\" when Max reveals a connection between his past affair with the Graces and his present living situation renting a room in their old summer house -- a twist that is neither dramatic nor surprising. It is also wholly unnecessary because it fails to effect the rest of the story in any way.<br /><br />As Max looks back at his life he at times seemsto be channeling Peggy Lee, asking himself \\"Is That All There Is?\\" What is most unfortunate is that the reader ends up asking themself the same question about Banville's novel.<br /><br />I would recommend another, vastly superior Booker winner instead of this one: Arundhati Roy's spellbinding \\"The God of Small Things\\".hanneling Peggy Lee, asking himself \\"Is That All There Is?\\" What is most unfortunate is that the reader ends up asking themself the same question about Banville's novel.

B000GFLE1S|4.0|So what's the story?<br /><br />Well, down in Northampton there was once a man running a shoe factory who died. His son, upon taking over the reigns, soon realises that the business is facing imminent bankruptcy. His search for new ideas for the business leads him to London and to Lola, a sassy drag queen who thinks that maybe the stuffy old business needs to embrace a new market. Thus, the kinky boots of the title which is just one of the new lines of footwear for drag queens, transvestites and such types, who after all, are a niche market not too many footwear makers are tapping into. It's all a true story, apparently.<br /><br />So is it any good?<br /><br />Well, Chiwetel Ejiofor just nabbed a Golden Globe nomination for his role as Lola. To be honest I only got the DVD for the chance to see my man Chewy in drag. He wears it well, considering his very manly build - imagine a unflattering caricature of Mica Paris (and I'm not sure if that's a compliment to Ejiofor or an insult to Paris, but whatever) - and though he doesn't get top billing, his performance essentially drives the movie. I've said it once and I'll say it again, I have nothing but absolute admiration for any man, especially a black man, who is not afraid to take this kind of real risk in the pursuit of his art. Many wouldn't touch this kind of role with a bargepole.<br /><br />Yes, yes, yes. Enough about Chewy. Is the MOVIE any good?<br /><br />Well, \\"The Observer\\" called it \\"Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert Meets The Full Monty\\" but I think they were being generous. It lacks the humour of the former and the heart of the latter but all the same, it is definitely a heart-warming feel-good movie. It's really interesting to see how Lola faces down the usual prejudices and stereotypes, how he relationship between her and Charlie Price (the young owner of the shoe business, played by Joel Edgerton) develops and no, the relationship does not go the way you're thinking. It's basically one of those 'against all odds' stories about ordinary, working class, down-to-earth English folk. It's from the creators of \\"Calendar Girls\\", so that should tell you something. I won't spoil it for you by giving details but it does have a happy ending.<br /><br />What about DVD extras?<br /><br />Umm, the usual stuff: Audio commentary by the director and cast; a short video called \\"Journey Of A Brogue\\" (the title speaks for itself); \\"The Real Kinky Boots Factory\\", a short documentary which tells the story of the real-life shoe factory in Northampton that inspired the movie and then there are some deleted scenes.<br /><br />I'll definitely be watching it again and, as a mad Chiwetel Ejiofor fan, I just had to have this in my collection. I heartily recommend it.'against all odds' stories about ordinary, working class, down-to-earth English folk. It's from the creators of \\"Calendar Girls\\", so that should tell you something.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|To tell you the truth, I was depressed when I first heard that Pierce Brosnan was replaced by Daniel Craig. But to my surprise, Daniel Craig is a really good James Bond who fits closely with the Ian Fleming description of Bond. Gone is the gentleman assassin associated with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan's depiction; here we have the early Sean Connery Bond, the ruthless, detached assassin-spy. Daniel Craig brings back the danger in 007; you believe that Craig could at any moment strangle you to death, put a knife into your belly, or shoot you without blinking an eye. (Timothy Dalton captures the danger in Bond really well in his 2 films \\"Living Daylights\\" and \\"Licence to Kill\\") Craig reminds me a lot of Steve McQueen and his Bond is more like Jason Bourne -- the action is fast and furious.     We also see Craig as a human Bond; he makes mistakes, he is driven by his male ego, he gets bruised, he bleeds, he gets tortured, and he gets heartbroken. All this was reflected in the Bond described in the novel Casino Royale. Craig is a really good actor who helps the viewer see inside the character of the man, just as George Lazenby did in \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\". It's nice to see Bond brought back down from being a comic book hero to being a real man with real emotions and issues. Great job, Daniel Craig!     Eva Green does a commendable job as Vesper Lynd, Bond's love interest. Vesper is an intelligent and capable Treasury agent every bit as equal to Bond. It's always great to have a strong woman character in a Bond movie.     There were some shortcomings in this movie: The chase sequence goes on too long where Bond chases the bombmaker. The title song and sequence weren't that great. The poker game drags on a bit too long, even though they put in bits of action in between. In fact, the whole movie could have been trimmed 25 minutes. Secondly, it is weird to hear M talk about 9-11 when this is the \\"Bond Begins\\" film; we have to forget 40 years of Bond films asthough they didn't exist. Third, even though Judi Dench is a great actress, someone much younger should have been \\"M\\" for the chronology to make sense. Here Judi Dench looks older than \\"Die Another Day\\" when this is supposed to happen way before.     Fourth, we know that Q doesn't show up until Dr. No, but it would have been great to have Bond have some gadgets either in his car or in his briefcase, not just the defibrillator. Also, it would have been great to have some good car chases, and have the Aston Martin do something.     However, Martin Campbell does a great job of directing and introducing the 21st century Bond, just as he did in 1995 with Pierce Brosnan.     I look forward to the next segment of Craig's Bond. I'm wondering if they could remake \\"Man with the Golden Gun\\", \\"A View to a Kill,\\" and \\"Moonraker\\", 3 of the most forgettable in the film series.     The special features in the 2 disc version are great:  There are 3 featurettes:  one which features how Daniel Craig got the role, another which details the incredible stunts, and the third, an updated version of \\"Bondgirls are Forever\\" hosted by Maryam D' Abo, the bondwoman in \\"The Living Daylights.\\"  I enjoyed the \\"Bondgirls are Forever\\" featurette the most -- it featured insightful interviews with all the famous bondwomen- Ursula Andress (Dr. No), Luciana Paluzzi (villainess in Thunderball), Honor Blackman (Goldfinger), Cary Lowell (License to Kill), Halle Berry (Die Another Day), Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies), Judi Dench and Samantha Bond (all the Pierce Brosnan films), Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day), Jill St. John (Diamonds are Forever), and Maud Adams (Man with the Golden Gun, Octopussy).  It was very interesting to hear these actresses talk about how it feels to be a \\"bondgirl\\" and how it changed their lives.
B0002V7OI8|2.0|I'm giving this two stars because it's just marginally better than the totally absurd \\"Day After Tomorrow\\".  It starts off pretty well and ends moderately well, but the entire middle is BORING.  It's very hard to care about any of the characters, most of whom seem to be doing everything they can to be shallow idiots, if not totally brain dead.  Their scripted actions are, in many cases, directly opposite to the real actions of people in disasters, such as we have seen in the World Trade Center or in the 2006 tsunami.  Perhaps that is an observation from hind sight, since this movie was made long before we had such disasters to judge it by.<br /><br />The one real person in the entire cast is Morgan Freeman as the President of the US. The worst is Tea Leoni, who sleepwalks through the picture.<br /><br />As for the destruction of NYC, that is pretty good, much better than in some of the other disaster movies I have seen (\\"Fourth of July\\", \\"Day After Tomorrow\\", etc.).  There is one ironic and sad moment, as the World Trade Center is inundated, but not totally destroyed.  But, of course, this movie was made before....
6304711905|5.0|If you do, don't skip Tombstone.  Every actor played their character to the tee, even Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp. There are too many words to describe here the magnificent performance by Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday.  Whomever decides who gets Oscars really blew this one, Kilmer should of got one hands down.  The action scenes are great and the movie will keep your interest through out.  I think now I have watched it about 10 times, almost know the dialog my heart.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Before I knew anything about \\"Firefly\\", I watched this movie.  I found it to be a fantastic journey with a more realistic outlook on our possible future through the lives of the crew of \\"Serenity\\".  The story line is excellent, the cast is outstanding, the special effects are perfectly \\"simple\\", and the plot wasn't predictable.  The obvious mixing of \\"old west\\" and \\"sci-fi\\" is definitely different. <br /> <br />Now, with that said... I purchased and watched all of the episodes (released and non-released) of the series \\"Firefly\\".  I then watched the movie \\"Serenity\\" again and found the movie to be rushed to educate the masses to the \\"Firefly\\" universe.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Like Fall Out Boy, Panic! At the disco became popular with \\"I Write sins\\" in 2006. I first heard this band through a friend's myspace and instantly fell in love with the music. Their sound is origional and fun. Their lyrics are a bit immature and some of them have sexual refrences. I hope that they come out with another album like this in 2007 and are true to their sound.

B0001CNRB6|5.0|At times this movie can be a little racie for people over the age of 70 or people who like movies less rated than G. But for the rest of us it's more tamed then most movies now. It's a good Doris Day film. It's funny, and has a happy ending. The story line is pretty much the same as pillow talk. Mistaken identity, Hudson's character taken advantage of the sistuation, boy meets girl, girl hates boy, girl loves boy, then hates him again, then loves each other in the end. A wonderful game, this is worth the cash.
0060578793|5.0|I bought this book because I felt like it would contain information that everyone should know, and I was right! I was completely clueless about survival techniques, but not anymore! Mr. Wiseman goes through every possible scenario and how to deal with any kind of problem that could arrise in a survival situation. There are detailed pictures of plants, how to make snares, etc. This book is a must for EVERYONE.
B00005JPKC|4.0|Why did I expect more from an Eastwood movie?  The reviews were so profound, we had to go!  Quite frankly, I expected something thought provoking and reflective - but gentle in retrospect.  But this is a WAR film and is bloody and gory and does quite effectively spotlight that these people were real and the war is so unimaginably awful (though Eastwood seems to imagine the disease, the chaos pretty well).  Know that it is almost entirely in Japanese, in case you are sub-title phobic.  It is one of those films everyone should probably see, but not a popcorn stuffing bit of entertainment and so sepia tinted it is almost black and white.  The audience was definitely an older crowd, likely a lot of veterans.  And the film was just a little too long (mad dash for The Ladies!).  And I LOVED the letter from Oklahoma Mom, \\"always do what is right, because it is right.\\"  Amen.
0618680004|5.0|atheists/agnostics have tried to compromise by participating in this thing called democracy(i.e church and state coexisting though respectively divided) but religions just dont seem to want to meet in the middle.  just because Christians live sure that god is a fact just like george washington is a fact does NOT mean that atheists live sure that god is a fictional literary metaphor for adults like santa clause is for children.  we just choose not to participate in the supernatural because, while exciting to think about and wonder, we don't believe it's an established enough medium to be worth living under unconditionally when there's still so much unknown.  Americans will unite in saying that George Washington is a factual reality but we are not capable of uniting in saying that god is a factual reality.  unless that time occurs, i suggest we all compromise by uniting and saying \\"we're searching for more answers.\\"  when a grade school child asks in a science class, \\"well what's OUTSIDE the universe?\\" in our democratic America the teacher answers, \\"well that's what we're trying to figure out.  what do you think is outside the universe?\\"  Don't take away the wonder.  Don't send our children into school thinking they already understand what's outside the universe when they don't even understand basic math, reading, writing and let alone what's INSIDE the universe.  My message to the people of God is \\"make sure you're giving YOURSELF the credit you deserve.  religeon is not synonymous with morality.  are you a strong enough person to be good and moral without the assistance of an organized institution?\\"  church is to state what believing is to knowing.  the thought of burning infinitely is not pleasant nor is the thought of not exitsting whatsoever in 100 years.  but those feelings are not a good enough reason to dismiss the possibility that that's the way it is.  my point is, it's my BELIEF that atheists/agnostics are more open-minded and peaceful citizens of the worldthan most people of the stricktly religious lifestyle.  i think the exploitation of faith and the practice of spreading faith has done more harm than good.  i try my hardest to be a fair person and meet halfway.  i have attended church and exposed myself to as much as possible in my research but my only consistant conclusion is that most religious participants are defensively resistant to the exploration of ambiguity in human existance or any possible explaination other than that of god.
B00011RPB0|5.0|Bill Harris (Bill Murray) is a middle aged American actor, well past his prime.  He was once known for highly charged car chase sequences, and now he is best known in Japan for his ads for laid back, \\"Rat Pack\\" inspired whiskey commercials.  He has flown to Tokyo to shoot a commercial, and is having a challenging time adjusting to the culture, language and nuances of the country.  Bill has a chance encounter with Charlotte (Scarlett Johannsen), a young, recent college grad who has made the trip to Tokyo with her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi), and totally feels like a fish out of water.<br /><br />Bill and Charlotte become traveling companions and friends, exchanging their opinions and anxieties about life and love.  Charlotte doesn't know what to do with her life, after graduating from Yale, with a degree in philosophy and doesn't know who she married.  Bill is in a pretty loveless marriage to his wife, who is devoting the main focus of her life to raising their children, and who only calls him to nag.  Their chance encounter changes the way they view their lives and their companionship ads brightness to an otherwise dismal week in a foreign country.<br /><br />This movie was beautifully shot, and there is a real meditative and almost dream-like quality to the photograpy.  Also, it runs the line between quiet humor and introspective melancholy.  Definitely not an upbeat movie, but definitely worth seeing for its beauty and poetry, as well quiet insight.
B000EGF0NW|4.0|After reading The Lovely Bones, I was dying to get my hands on a copy of Lucky. Sebold's horrifying story frightened me more than any novel I had ever read before. But it was worth it. Through the retelling of her experience with rape and the emotional aftermath, I gained a new perspective on the entire situation. Overall, it was a gripping memoir and a must read if you were a fan of the Lovely Bones, although the books are very different.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is back to basic Bond without the outrageoud gadgets. This Bond comes in where Sean Connery left off. It has the guts and the glory without the \\"Hollywood\\" stylist adding for unrealistic moves. It has realistic moves and technology that makes this easier to watch. Daniel Craig was one of the best Bond's since Sean, sorry Pierce, you were good, but I can't wait to see Daniel again! <br />

B000JK8OYU|2.0|Most of this is on the Beatles Anthology albums. My brother gave me \\"Love\\" for Christmas, but most of it is just a moneyspinner.  <br />Very few tracks stand out:  <br />(3) Glass Onion into Eleanor Rigby, (10) Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite (into I Want You, and Helter Skelter). I like George Harrison's While my Guitar Gently Weeps (track 22) - George (Martin, that is) did a good strings accompaniment.  <br /> <br />Otherwise, I recommend buying the original albums and the Beatles Anthology sets instead. If only The Beatles and Apple Corps could resolve their issues with Apple computer and iTunes, then we could download individual tracks as desired. Till that happens, we have to pay over the odds for every one or two new diamonds in the rough of every recycled Beatles package. <br /> <br />Finally (and this is dodgy territory), DJ Dangermouse did a much more innovative job with Beatles songs, mixing tracks from the Beatles White album with Jay-Z's Black album (predictably called the Grey album). It was excellent, but was soon nixed by EMI lawyers.
0393035158|5.0|Whatever your religious beliefs or lack thereof, if you value open discourse and reason, this book is a must read.  For too long our culture has kept ANY honest inquiry into religion out of the public discourse.  Atheists and doubters are vilified well beyond any rational reason for doing so, and intolerant zealots are given free reign because one's religious beliefs are off limits for critical discussion. <br />\\"The End of Faith\\" pulls no punches, nor should it.  Sam Harris' thesis, and I find it a compelling one, is the future of civilized society on this planet is being threatened by religion.  Most Americans would agree that Islam in its most radical form has become such a threat and that it is growing.  Harris explores certain disturbing aspects of Islam at length.  He goes on to argue that Christianity and Judaism also hold the seeds of social destruction.  Indeed, he explains how these seeds bore horrific fruit throughout history, up until very recent times.  The efforts of fundamentalist Christians in the U.S. to turn the country into a theocratic \\"Christian Nation\\" is the most recent threat posed by Christianity to a civilized, free society. <br />If all this sounds like Satanic Liberal nonsense, then you still owe it to yourself to read this book, if only to challenge your beliefs with some excellent counter-arguments.  A warning however: this is not a dumbed-down book, and those of you with a standard high-school level vocabulary may find yourself reaching for a dictionary on occasion.  It's definitely worth the bit of extra effort, and it's not a dry read for all of that.  It will definitely get you thinking, and could very well change the way you see the world.  I wish it had been available twenty years ago, when I was looking for validation for my own doubts.  Bertrand Russell is great, but Sam Harris has given us a gift of reason and enlightenment that is truly of the 21st Century.  May it help us to reach the 22nd Century a civilized and more rational species.

B0002V7OI8|2.0|Tea Leoni gets the Ben Affleck award for acting malpractice. The woman cannot act, and why anyone would give her the starring role in any film is a complete mystery. This woman not only cannot act, at least in this film she appears to be stoned on some powerful drug. And I am being kind. (Very kind.) Granted that she is an ectomorphic blonde, but come on. There are others out there with true acting ability. Leoni has none.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall save this film from being an utter turkey, but only by a slight margin. Freeman as the President of the United States is very, very good, and he is really the savior of this otherwise awful film. This one is a stinker, but the special effects just barely make it watchable to the end. I never tire of watching New York City get destroyed. This saves the film, just as the destruction of New York has saved several other otherwise horrible films. Only barely though.
B00004ZBVG|4.0|As an Air Force retiree, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I first viewed it back in 1992 and have seen it once since then.  The story line is cool, brings in the viewer quickly, doesn't clutter it up with all those introductions and is well packed with suspense, action, and comaradarie.  My only negative for this flick is it's too short.  I would've preferred more scenes where Gene Hackman was performing ground-controller duties against the VC or NVA, and more aerial footage of the environment in which he and his crew members got shot down. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a great flick that helps promote the Air Force and the circumstances our flight crews can go thru during combat, especially when they are shot down.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|An excellently written and acted movie.  Natalie Portman does a very good job as Evey. Hugo Weaving is even better as V.  If you take a close look at the movie you will be able to see a lot of parallels between the society there and the current administration in the US. However since the graphic novel the movie was based upon was written in the 1980's it would more likely compare to the Reagan administration instead of Bush's.
B00021R7CG|4.0|I love this movie.  It's storyline was plausible for the era except for the part about how not ready our military forces were for this event.  During the Reagan era, our forces were on extraordinarily high alert because the Soviets were a credible threat to our way of life.  As a member of the US Air Force during that era, I recall all the exercises we played in just in case of that fateful event.  Thankfully, it never happened.  Our forces, intelligence resources, and early warning systems would have given us much more time to react to the threat depicted in this movie than the movie leads us to believe.  That said, here are the positives. <br /> <br />Powers Boothe's crew were realistic in the lines they \\"read\\".  I think in the event of a nuclear war, if air forces are airborne, air crews would be saying nearly the same things as the movie shows us.  The tactic of releasing a nuke before some mountains and using the same mountains to shield your aircraft from the blast/shockwave is questionable but makes the movie more exciting.  And, I think showing a weak president remaining at the White House is a possible scenario, since he could take cover  underneath the same; but a sane president would've evacuated to his safe haven to unleash American nukes on the enemy. <br /> <br />Still, it's a good movie, worth the money, makes one think about one possible way a nuclear war COULD happen, and didn't waste time with character introductions.

B0001WTVUW|5.0|I love this movie.  When I first viewed it in 1983, it scared the heck out of me, my family, and my girlfriend, along with about 25million plus Americans that night.  The momentum building up to the fateful moment is difficult to decipher becuase the radio and TV newsbroadcasters are overshadowed by the characters talking to each other.  If one really listens to those broadcasts, the storyline and dramatics really will scare you - if they don't, then you don't recall the Cold War (thankfully!). <br /> <br />Good acting by all, a nice glimpse of how unprepared FEMA was in this movie that we can relate to given Hurrican Katrina; emotionally stirring if you really watch and become engrossed in the drama, because back in 1983, we did fear a nuclear war on a different scale than the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. <br /> <br />A good movie for simple historical purposes, well worth it for entertainment value, and it's a cool glimpse into what could have happened to us back then.
B000E1155E|5.0|For year's this 50+ year old been searching for the new British wave, a group that an carry on the tradition of the Sex Pistols and the Clash-a record that has passion and songs after song that sticks in your head and makes you think and jump up and down at the same time. Too many times groups like the Libertines came with all the hype but couldn't carry a candle to their honored predecessors. The Arctic Monkeys, at least on this record, are for real. Each song paints a 3D picture in words and music. It's like a book of short stories brought to life in a gutsy rock format. Even if they never match this record the Arctic Monkeys have made a place in history with this amazing CD.

I really enjoyed the interplay of Elizabeth and Darcy. The public dance scene made me smile as everyone was so energetic and seemed to be having so much fun. The piano music was superb, and set the scenes.The director Joe Wright used the actors, scenery, and period era to a great advantage in presenting this movie. He should make more Austin films and use Macfadyen as he is so good in period films.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|I have waited for this since the movie came out in America. I had bought the Japanese boxset (370$ mind you) and have refused to buy the American release until a boxset came out here as well. <br /> <br />Though you don't get nearly as much as the Japanese boxset this is something a TRUE Final Fantasy VII fan should have. Granted last year they came out with a \\"Special Edition\\" and most fans have this, but if you're a true FF7 collector this boxset should be added to your collection. <br /> <br />After this comes out now I just wait for FF7:AC-COMPLETE-, The Japanese Special edition that has more scenes, more battle sequences and better graphics.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|Bought for my son the space jam 2 disc special edition. He loves it. It was also good enough for adults too. With Bill Murray in it how can you go wrong. Very funny movie, also good to see the looney tunes gang on the big screen.
0307276902|1.0|Since recovery is based on truth, please don't pick up this piece of crap and reccommend Frey's narcissistic rambling to someone with a drug problem. If someone wants to write seriously that takes honesty too, not to mention discipline, attention to detail, and a little humililty.  It's a craft, not a freak show. If you buy that he did 10% of what he says he did, or that he is an \\"author,\\" well, I guess that's probably how we ended up in Iraq, and is a plausible reason that good portion of the country believed (and still do) that Saddam Hussein bombed the Twin Towers. Some of our citizenry are just as lazy as Frey is. We all love a good story.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I don't think I'm familiar with the work of director Neil Burger, but with \\"The Illusionist\\", I have been treated to one of the finest period pieces I've ever seen, rife with style, elegance, and a terrific love story, with more than a passing reference to \\"Romeo & Juliet\\". I've read the other reviews, and, yes, Philip Glass' score certainly adds to the tension or romance, as applicable (even though he can't get away from the arpeggiated mannerisms and repetition, as in \\"Koyaanisquatsi\\"). Both the photography and production design ring true. \\"The Illusionist\\" is definitely NOT an action film, though its deliberate pace will not fail to hold you spellbound. The acting is letter-perfect from Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti & Jessica Biel, and Rufus Sewell's bad-guy Prince is one of the very best I've seen in many years. The screenplay is well thought-out, layering the many elements involved in the most precise fashion. I really admire this film very much.  UPDATE: The cinematography was just Oscar-nominated  today...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Despite the critics and the low rates in the US, I believe this to be one of the finest sci-fi serieses ever to touch the small screen. <br /> <br />The humour is subtle and the characters are complex and deep. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this series! <br /> <br />Miki
B000K4WPCC|3.0|I read some previous reviews that blabbed away the plot, so I almost didn't watch. \\"The Covenant had some good action right from the start, and there were a few creepy moments.

B00005JKN9|5.0|This was an excellent movie about immigrants and how they were treated when they settled in America. It was just about one place in the US which was New York. Ironically, the statue of Liberty is there which reads:<br /><br />\\"Give me your tired, your poor,<br />Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br />The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,<br />Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,<br />I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\\"<br /><br />What the movie was trying to say is that if the immigrants didn't benefit or agree with the \\"political party in power\\" they were not really welcome. With this distrust of others and the greed of money, gangs were formed within each group. The plot then thickened because of one leader was killed by another with the survivor being the dead leader's son seeking revenge against his killers. The plot was excellent with excellent cast roles in the story. I highly recommend this movie that wants to see what it was/is really like for \\"immigrants\\" coming to the US.

It would have been interesting, were it possible, to have him play these great works in the presence of Chopin to get his reaction.

B000002ILG|4.0|I first saw White Lion on MTV in 1987 when their video for \\"Wait\\" came out.  The moment I saw Vito Bratta play his solo I knew right then and there that I wanted an electric guitar, and I've been playing ever since.  In the almost 20 years since, I've played all sorts of styles and listened to all kinds of music, but when I sat down recently to tune up my playing I found myself rummaging through old CDs and began listening to WL with fresh ears.<br /><br />The results were pleasing if not life-changing, and now that I've put in almost twenty years of my own on guitar, I can safely say that Vito merits being an inspiration.  While the rhythm section of James Lomenzo and Greg D'Angelo was often under-utilized (considering what they've done with Zakk Wylde, DLR, and other post-WL projects) the biggest weakness has always been Mike Tramp's voice.  This is not to denigrate his prowess so much as his tone.  Live videos of his singing have consistently revealed him to have weak projection and limited range-HOWEVER, let us consider that many of WL's songs vary in key and none of them are in A on this album, the easiest key in which to sing.<br /><br />Tramp had a voice that, like Springsteen, Rod Stewart, or Tom Petty, has a certain nasality and raspiness that you either like or dislike, with no middle-ground.  That said, any glance at the concert videos for the original line-up or his reformed version of WL on YouTube should remove any doubts that he is an energetic and engaging frontman.<br /><br />What really matters, though, is the music, and contrary to what anyone thinks, the lyrics to a song really are not more important than the melody.  Want proof?-sing Nena's hit \\"99 Balloons\\" in German.  Can't do it? I thought so.  Now hum the melody, or the synthesizer riff.  That's what counts, and that is what raises White Lion above hair metal sewage like Faster Pussycat, Bang Tango, or Britny Fox.  Tramp's vocal lines and Bratta's leads both obey the first rule of music making, which is create a memorable melody.  In fact, it is what separates the great songs on this album (of which there are many) from the mediocre(of which there are few.)  Let's examine each track:<br /><br />1.\\"Hungry\\"-A perfect intro features Vito introducing the main riff interspersed with tasty fills that leads into Tramp's seductive lyrics.  The interplay between their call and response sells the song, and Lomenzo and D'Angelo pound out a solid base for Bratta to layer his combined lead and rhythm work.  The undermining factor here is Tramp's voice-his stylistic quavers make the seductive nature of the lyrics short out.  Watch his new band on YouTube and his voice is deeper, stronger, and sells this song much more effectively.  8/10<br /><br />2.\\"Lonely Nights\\"-A moody, midtempo lament of lost love supported by a nicely fingerpicked acoustic intro.  Most of WL's songs are always compositionally sound and this one is no exception.  The lyrics paint a dark picture of teenage runaways on the streets of NYC (no surprise since 3/4 of the band are native New Yorkers) and Tramp's voice most of the time fits the overall ouevre of the tune, particularly on the chorus' harmonized vocals.  That's right, I said ouevre in a review of a hair metal band. Deal with it.  The problem is that the song never gets into a higher gear, and musically resembles a movie with great background shots that never develops its plot.  6/10<br /><br />3. \\"Don't Give Up\\"-In all honesty, this song is a guilty pleasure.  Tramp sings earnestly but the hokiness of the lyrics in the chorus detract from what may be Bratta's most intricate yet most soaring leadwork, as well as a definite feeling of desperation in the verse that demands the over-the-top anthemic quality of the refrain.  7/10<br /><br />4.\\"Sweet Little Loving\\"-Catchy as the common cold, the refrain on this tune might actually make you want to dance.  Lomenzo's bassline is notably swinging for a pop metal act and Bratta displays a restrained and tasty solo that segues nicely into a foot-stomping bridge.  I've played this for headbangers and my grandmother at the same party and they both liked it!  8/10<br /><br />5.\\"Lady of the Valley\\"-One of the songs that places WL ahead of other hair bands, this is an overly ambitious attempt at creating an epic composition along the lines of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" or \\"Free Bird.\\"  Most of it works-Tramp's vocals suit the theme of loss and sorrow, the terraced dynamics constrasted between fingerpicked acoustic guitars with thunderous Sturm und Drang on the irresistible refrain, a few brilliantly crafted leads, and a rumbling, propulsive rhythm throughout sell the song.  The one weakness here are the lyrics-I think Tramp uses the word \\"cry\\" more than any lyricist this side of Hank Williams. This is excused, however, by the fact that Tramp is from Denmark and gets points for writing anything in his second language.  9/10<br /><br />6.\\"Wait\\"-Well, how to review this one?  If there's anything that hasn't been said about it since it was on the charts 20 years ago, it probably isn't worth mentioning.  EXCEPT-whether you love or hate the song, listen to Tramp's alternate arrangement on YouTube where he extends the coda and drops the song to a lower key. At first I didn't like it, but found myself going back to listen and it eventually won me over.  What does this prove?  That an interesting arrangement of a song requires that it be a good song in the first place, and \\"Wait\\" qualifies.  Tramp's voice is perfectly suited to this tune, the arrangement of the acoustic and electric guitars has real synergy, the dynamics created by Lomenzo and D'Angelo lift your heart, and if you can't sing along with the chorus, then you just don't like any kind of rock or pop music.  9/10<br /><br />7.\\"All You Need is Rock-n-Roll\\"-Apparently, lucky number seven doesn't count here.  The lyrics are pedestrian even for this genre, there's no force or conviction behind the amped up chorus, and with a title like this, shouldn't everything be over-the-top?  Sadly, it's not.  Its one saving grace is Bratta's fadeout solo where he flashes some of his blues chops and reminds you what he can do when he cuts loose.  4/10<br /><br />8.\\"Tell Me\\"-It was the lowest charting of the three singles released off this album, which is a crime.  On the other hand, I take some pleasure in knowing that it still belongs to a true fan and won't be used in a Cingular commercial in ten years.  From the opening kickdrum, the anthemic power chords, and the harmonized vocals in the first ten seconds, the pulse of this song charges up and never lets go.  This is a pop song in the best sense of the term, and there isn't a wrong note anywhere in it.  Tramp's delivery perfectly suits the song's theme of forbidden teenage love, Vito's fills are artfully subtle, and when the chorus kicks in, the song keeps every promise rock-n-roll ever made (to paraphrase Greil Marcus.)  10/10<br /><br />9.\\"All Join Our Hands\\"-A bit of a letdown after \\"Tell Me\\"'s exuberance but still a solid tune.  Tramp has always distinguished himself from most glam metal singers by writing lyrics about what was going on in the world rather than how many groupies he boinked last night, and here the focus is on his despair over how we all can't live in peace.  The raise-your-fist-and yell bridge puts the rest of the song over.  7/10<br /><br />10.\\"When the Children Cry\\"-OK-their biggest hit.  Yes, Mike Tramp's voice is cloying. Yes, the lyrics are right out of a high school girl's notebook for a poetry workshop.  Yes, Vito's tone is a tad brittle on the solo.  Minor quibbles.  Bratta's fingerpicked acoustic guitar (recorded without bass or drums, mind you) demonstrates why he was a cut above his contemporaries like Lynch, Beach, DeMartini, and Timmons-no one played better acoustically amongst any of the hair bands of the day.  The message is heartfelt, the guitar playing is elegant, and if you honestly hate this song, you're just a sad, sad human being.  10/10<br /><br />Overall Rating: 8/10<br /><br />If you're in a bad mood after listening to this album, please talk to your doctor about Zoloft.

The various plots are extremely difficult to follow, though some became clearer after watching the 'deleted scenes' section of the DVD. This movie is ultimately pointless. I was hoping to gain some insight into the world of mideast oil and politics, but learned nothing. The scenes and thin story lines depicted only what is already common knowledge. Poorly made and worse-edited, it represents a missed opportunity because it could have been educational and fascinating.
0679879269|2.0|After reading The Subtle Knife, I was anticipating an equally intriguing finale to Pullman's trilogy.  Instead, I got a smorgasbord of disjointed cliches--not to mention more plot lines than pages.  (And there are a great number of pages.)<br /><br />The book begins with Lyra, drugged into perpetual sleep by Mrs. Coulter, somewhere in the Himalayas. It is never made clear why Mrs. Coulter goes to these lengths to \\"protect\\" Lyra, or why she suddenly undergoes a radical personality shift in order to do so.  Meanwhile, in some other world, Asriel is planning to kill God.  (Now THAT'S an ambitious task.) But here Pullman really pulls his punches, because, apparently, God isn't actually GOD, so that's OK.  In the meantime, there are some strange cops looking for Will in yet another world, who are very keen on investigating Dark Matter, which is Dust. So, Will and Lyra can't go back.  But Mary Malone, the scientist investigating Dark Matter, escapes the cops who aren't really looking for her, to go to another world in which giant swan-like things are killing elephant-like things on wheels, who are doomed to destruction anyway because their Dust (now called something else) is flowing in the wrong direction.  Mary makes the Amber Spyglass... for some reason. In the meantime, there is a crazed assassin priest named Gomez, or something like that, who also can go between worlds (apparently everybody can).  Unlike everybody else in the book, he's not after Lyra, but Mary because, oh dear, I can't remember why. But is has something to do with Adam and Eve. And, oh yes, I almost forgot, Lyra has to go to the land of the dead to apologize to Roger, and make the Harpies into nice, umm, harpy-like things. Because, it seems, the dead have to escape from the land of the dead in order to actually die.(But why didn't they just die the first time they died?) Ummmm....I know there must be a point to all this. With so many plots, there just has to be.<br /><br />Like Dust, the premise(s) holding this book together are invisible to the naked eye.  Is this book about a struggle between religions? If so, what is the competing religion or belief system which is struggling against Christianity?  Who are the Magisterium? What is their function (besides just being awful)? Why is everybody on both sides? Why? Why? Why?<br /><br />In fantasy one can ignore a flimsy premise (or two) for the sake of action, snappy dialogue, and character development.  But even here, Pullman falls short. The action sequences are impossible to follow, the dialogue stiff and unlikely (12-year-old Lyra sounds like an adult imitating a 6-year-old, while 12-year-old Will sounds like a full-grown man.) And as for character development, everyone in this book is bipolar.  One minute they are grief-stricken, the next joyous. They have bounteous emotions which are not justified, let alone explained. (Why does everybody fall in love with Lyra? And/or want to kill her? Is it because of her adorable bad grammar? Her appealing lack of personal hygiene?)<br /><br />Pullman has a fantastic imagination.  I look forward to the day when he can harness it and turn it into something we can read.s) holding this book together are invisible to the naked eye.  Is this book about a struggle between religions?

B00004ZAV3|5.0|A lot of people groaned when this cd first came out. After all, why do we need it? We have the Red Album (1962-1966) and the Blue Album (1967-1970). Why do we need another hits collection?    It's simple. The music really deserves to be remastered so that it can sound as rich and as full as possible. Secondly, when the bulky red and blue albums came out, you could only put about 45-50 minutes of music on a record.    Now, you can put up to 80 minutes of music on a cd. Not only that, there is a rush that comes from hearing 27 classic number one Beatles songs in a row! The inevitable problem with only having one cd is that some will complain that their favorite Beatles song is missing (Strawberry Fields Forever, Birthday, Don't Let Me Down, Here Comes the Sun, Please, Please Me, Back in the USSR, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps are all missing in action, I guess these brilliant songs never hit number one).    What the Beatles really deserve is a three cd Essential Beatles Collection where all the songs from the Red and Blue Albums are represented.     But what we have here is excellent. The songs have never sounded better, and it makes me excited for The Beatles 2.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|John Frankenheimer's \\"Grand Prix\\" stands the test of time and remains possibly the best racing movie of all time. A great international cast tells the story  of the battle to be the World Champion driver in locations that encompass all the classic Grand Prix circuits. \\"Grand Prix\\" was filmed in the 1966, before Formula 1 cars became high speed billboards, drivers could be seen in the car's cockpits (no full-face helmets yet) and track safety consisted of a few hay bales. In addition to having some of the greatest racing sequences ever filmed (only eclipsed by Steve McQueen's \\"Le Mans\\") the fil is a treat for the vintage car buff who will have great fun seeing rare exotics like James Garner's Shelby Mustang turn up in the film.
B000HEWEE4|3.0|Alex Wyler is living in the year 2004, and he finally finds the woman of his dreams. But it's a long distance relationship. He's living in a NE Illinois lake house, and she's a doctor living in Chicago. <br /> <br />There's more. He's in 2004. She's in 2006. This truly is a love story that transcends time. The screenwriters never get around to explaining how this can be possible, so it's a bit confusing. It will remind you a little of the 1980 Christopher Reeve/Jane Seymour flick \\"Somewhere in Time\\" (though the Reeve/Seymour movie was much better IMHO, maybe because I love Mackinac Island). <br /> <br />The film begins when Wyler moves into the lake house and discovers a note from the previous tenant, Dr. Kate Forster. They begin a correspondence and realize over the course of time that they are living two years apart. Can they ever meet? Will they ever meet? Can something like this ever work? <br /> <br />The concept is fascinating enough to keep you hooked to the end, but the second half of the movie drifts into predictable, mushy, love story chick flick territory. (How can the two timebound lovebirds know that they are in love so early in the correspondence? How can macho guy Keanu Reeves be saddled with such gooey lines?  <br /> <br />Furthermore, I started to figure things out too soon for my own enjoyment, and I'm not normally known for being able to do that.  <br /> <br />Having voiced my criticisms, I still recommend the movie because it is creative and you get to see Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves together again for the first time since Speed. <br /> <br />Rev. Marc Axelrod
B000F0UV0E|5.0|On the surface, the pairing of Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris seemed a bit peculiar.  But to those familiar with the artists and their work, \\"All The Roadrunning\\" had some intriguing possibilities.  Fortunately, this project exceeded expectations. <br /> <br />In my mind, Mark Knopfler is tremendously underrated, both as a guitarist and as a songwriter.  Outside of his days in Dire Straits (which included the seminal \\"Brothers In Arms\\" album), not many people know him.  His body of work in his post-Dire Straits career has been quite interesting and enjoyable.  His sound is unmistakable, and he can play everything from blues to rock to bluegrass, with a few other genres mixed in.  As for Emmylou Harris, I think she has also been overlooked and maybe a little underrated in the most recent stages of her career.  She possesses a remarkable voice that can be both haunting and angelic (even at the same time), and can effortlessly sing any type of music with just about anybody.  She has also crafted an interesting body of work in the past decade or so that.   <br /> <br />Throughout \\"All The Roadrunning\\", this combination of songwriting, vocals, and musicianship all blend together to create an impeccable collection of songs.  Mr. Knopfler and Ms. Harris seem to have a tremendous respect for each other's talents, which comes across in the music.  There isn't a sense that they are trying to upstage the other, nor is there the odd song that seems \\"out of the wheelhouse\\" of one of the musicians.  Rather, the songs play to their strong suits; nothing seems jarring or forced. <br /> <br />Vocally, the pairing is nearly perfect.  Mr. Knopfler prowls the deep end of the vocal range, which complements Ms. Harris' higher vocal range and vice versa.  On other songs, it is Mr. Knopfler's guitar work that complements Ms. Harris' vocals.  They seamlessly work through a collection of songs that range from rock to bluegrass to a sort of alternative, with a little bit of blues thrown infor good measure. <br /> <br />More often than not, the tracks on a disc seem to be laid out in such a way where the stronger songs are early, with the marginal or weak tracks bringing up the end.  On \\"All The Roadrunning\\", the track list seems far more balanced; in fact, it almost builds to a very strong, emotional conclusion that leaves the listener wanting more.   <br /> <br />The disc starts off with solid, if perhaps a bit unremarkably, with \\"Beachcomber\\" and \\"I Dug Up A Diamond\\".  But soon enough, the rocker \\"This Is Us\\" - a favorite of mine - really gets the disc in high gear.  Another favorite, \\"Right Now\\", follows a few tracks later.  It continues along with several more solid songs before a terrific 1-2 punch of the title track and \\"If This Is Goodbye\\" that close out the disc.  These last two songs are the ones I like the most of all.  \\"All The Roadrunning\\" speaks - at least in part - to a concert tour, but depending on how you interpret the lyrics, you can take about 3 or 4 other stories from the song.  \\"If This Is Goodbye\\" is a beautifully poignant track which Mr. Knopfler has said was inspired by the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks.  The attacks aren't directly referred to in the song, so there is no sense that it is a cheap attempt to \\"capitalize\\" on that terrible day.  Instead, you have a song that can speak to any romance in any phase of life, and Mr. Knopfler's haunting guitar work in the song (eerily reminiscent of the great title track of \\"Brothers In Arms\\") create an added emotional punch to the song. <br /> <br />You don't need to be a fan of any particular genre to truly enjoy \\"All The Roadrunning\\".  You should simply be a fan of - or otherwise appreciate - good music, period.  Mr. Knopfler and Ms. Harris have put together a great disc, and one that hopefully enjoys a wide audience beyond that which has already picked up on it since its release last year.  I hope that perhaps these two great musicians will collaborate again on another disc; if not right away, then before their respective careers are over.     <br /> <br />

B00005JP9V|5.0|Here are the main reasons why I think 'Children Of Men' is destined to be regarded as a classic science-fiction film:-<br /><br />The cast: pitch-perfect casting across the board on this move - Clive Owen has never been better as the reluctant hero, his awkward physicality matched by the surprising emotional depth of his performance.  But it is the supporting roles that really 'raise the bar'.  Julianne Moore conveys a sense of real loss and personal history in her few scenes that sets the tone for the early scenes .  Michael Caine adds wicked humour to a film that could easily have been too dark and oppressive.  Chiwetel Ejiofor -  wonderful in a complex role akin to his part in 'Serenity' .  Peter Mullan - typically great and manages to steal the scene altogether in an electryfying and brutal action cue.  Pam Ferris - great to see her in a big budget movie in a lovely part.  Charlie Hunnam - terrific with the 'death wish' sensibility.  A scary sense of panic and societal breakdown is sensationally conveyed in this movie.  Every cast member embellishes their roles with gusto!<br /><br />The production design.  In my view, the best example for a science fiction movie since 'Blade Runner'.  Yes, it's that good!  Superb attention to detail and the London scenes in particular are immaculately conceived.  Great use of animals throughout, which strangely humanises the horror and desperation.<br /><br />The cinematography.  Hats off to Emmanuel Lubezki for his stunning work on this film.  It captures gritty realism without recourse to the 'grainy look' overused in recent science fiction films, such as 'Minority Report'.  The action cues are really shocking and the steady cam shots at the film's climax are incredibly well done.  Real craft is in evidence here.<br /><br />The direction. A flawless job by Alfonso Cuaron.  No young American director would have come close to his work on this film.<br /><br />The music.  Great combination of influences from Roots Manuva to John Lennon, but it is John Tavener's score that comes from the leftfield to adds real class and depth to an already classy production.  Incredibly moving.<br /><br />The story is captured with great efficiency in the screenplay.

0805080120|5.0|Some reviewers complain that The Unfolding of Language does not read easily, but I have a hard time imagining a more readable approach to this material. <br /> <br />While some of the material in this book requires concentration, I would not have wanted it 'dumbed down' to make it more readable. <br /> <br />I have no education in linguistic and was able to understand all of the material, although as I mentioned, it takes a little work in places. <br /> <br />Along with books like Guns, Germs, and Steel, The Unfolding of Language is an excellent example of a readable presentation of academic material. <br /> <br />The Unfolding of Language tackles many topic, include questions like Was Latin the ultimate language, with modern European languages being low-brow street versions of it?  If Latin and other such seemingly sophisticated languages were so complex, who invented them?  How are languages evolving?  Why are they evolving as they are?  How did languages progress from Noun-Verb, two-word sentences to something like ancient Greek and Latin?  Why do languages have reflexive pronouns? and many other topics and questions. <br /> <br />The scope of this book is impressive.
0060005688|5.0|The Paradox of Choice...<br /><br />Although there are not exactly ground shaking revelations contained in this book, there are some very eye opening moments to make you go \\"Hmmmm\\".<br /><br />While we in America are living in the wealthiest, most physically comfortable time in history, anxiety, and depression are on the rise. In this study Barry Swartz, suggest that the myriad of choices that we have to make today may be a big part of the reason. Like the old \\"Devo\\" song said, \\"What you have is freedom of choice, what you need is freedom from choice\\".<br /><br />Every day we are bombarded with consumer, moral, ethical, religious, health, family etc. choices and necessary decisions that a generation and a half ago, were simply not necessary.<br /><br />Swartz puts forward the idea, that we can take back control of the choices that we must make, gives some strategies on minimizing the time spent making choices, as well as insight into why we choose the way we do and why it makes us unhappy.<br /><br />On the whole I highly recommend this book (especially to HR managers, and Marketing managers, and those in Sales,  or Service) for all those who would like to take back some of their time.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|The first time I saw the Matrix, it blew my mind....and it still does. There were things in that movie that had never been done before and, when they've been done in other movies, they came nowhere close to the real deal. This set is amazing. Very intensive documentaries and special features. And the absolute most fun commentaries on any dvd ever. Well, second only to the commentary on A Knight's Tale. The discs are a butt to get out of the trays, so be really careful when taking them out. Don't want to crack such a valuable set of amazing movies. If you don't have the dvds yet, get 'em now. Get 'em even if you already have the regular editions of the movies !!
0385336691|5.0|I've read all the Jack Reacher novels now and this one is a perfect example of everything I love about the character and the series. This one hits on all levels. Though the twist at the end was a little more visible to the reader than the characters, I never felt the author was arbitrarily moving characters around on a gameboard oblivious to common sense, which is a trap many of these types of books fall into. <br /> <br />Anyone who hasn't read a Jack Reacher book can start with this one and get hooked. <br />
B000002TQV|5.0|Not one bad song on this album in my opinion. This was the 2nd Radiohead album I bought (1st was Amnesiac). Compared to the albums after this, this one is more guitar driven (with the exception of Planet Telex being keyboard driven?). Anyway, The Bends I think is equally as masterful as the four that come after it, blah blah blah, give it a listen if you haven't already :) <br />Planet Telex - 8/10 <br />The Bends - 8/10 <br />High And Dry - 8/10 <br />Fake Plastic Trees - 9/10 <br />Bones - 7/10 <br />(Nice Dream) - 9/10 <br />Just - 8/10 <br />My Iron Lung - 8/10 <br />Bullet Proof ..I Wish I Was - 9/10 <br />Black Star - 8/10 <br />Sulk - 8/10 <br />Street Spirit (Fade Out) - 9/10
0618680004|5.0|My objection with Dawking's approach is a fundamental one. Yes, I agree wholeheartedly with his views on Christianity and Islam representing the worst excesses and contradictions that flourish in the name of God, but to me religion does not disprove the theory of whether God actually exists. In my opinion, religion and God are mutually exclusive, as the former indoctrinates from birth that God is without (i.e. you have to go to churches and mosques to pay due respect) whereas millions of people hold an innate belief, or feeling - spritual as opposed to religious - that God resides within, and can be accessed in transcendental states like meditation and yoga. Much of religion through the ages has been about division, brainwashing, hatred and repenting for your so-called sins, which is fine if you want to live life in perpetual fear. Follow the guidance of God, or the wise voice (your intuition) within, however, and life will be eternally blissful and happy. Perhaps 'The Religion Delusion' would have been a more appropriate focus point for Dawking to construct his argument; he might have won over many more \\"believers\\" in the process...
B000GYI32M|4.0|Received product on time. Was just as discribed with no problems.
0553260111|5.0|Made me want to watch the movies even more! Very interesting, great read for action enthusiasts!
1932907009|5.0|Blake Snyder has written a book that is literally \\"hands on\\" for screenwriters.  With detail, humor and wise counsel Save The Cat instructs you on the creation of an effective logline, dynamic beat sheet - and, to my utter amazement, a board containing 40 3X5 scene cards.  This combination of structural elements leads to an easy transition at the keyboard and a well conceived script.   <br /> <br />Snyder's approach is tried and true, based on his over twenty years of writing and SELLING his owns spec scripts.  I have read many screenwriting books over the years - Save The Cat \\"is\\" The Last Screenwriting Book You'll Ever need.
B00000K3CM|5.0|I cant really decide which one I like better this or Home Alone 1. They are both awesome. My 6 year old and 3 year old absolutely love this one and watch it everyday! Sometimes we even spot \\"Harry and Marv in thier van\\" when we are out and about. A really fun movie, I highly recommend getting it.
B000H1QYXY|5.0|Although under coercion by Sony, George re-releases another quintessential set of classic chart-toppers from his amazing library, along with a few new gems featuring team-ups with Mary J Blige (adequate)and  Paul McCartney (so-so). For anyone that enjoys George Michael, this is an up-to-date must-have that spans his generous and renowned range of his addictively fun and touching music. <br /> <br />I was especially impressed that Amazon had this album available before any brick-and-mortar store in my area, and that still applies a month later.
B0000399WI|5.0|Shawshank redemption is a great movie I've seen several times. Many people don't realize the screen play is  written by Stephen King. I've talked with people who said Stephen King is \\"too scarey\\" and never read his books. There is nothing scarey about this movie. Just a great story about life in prison. Acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is excellent.
B000H30B2C|4.0|King Kong is a great movie, the extras on this edition are very interesting to watch but the only let down is the packaging, this is not a deluxe edition it's \\"cheaper edition\\", I was waiting something more like the extended editions of the lord of the rings but Universal didn't want to spend money on this set. Try harder next time, King Kong deserves something better
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie is worth watching and buying- the soundtrack is amazing... Paul Dano is very good looking and has such a growing talent. The the cast A+! There is no words to explain this movie; beyond wonderful.
B0000CDL93|3.0|Oliver Stone really bought Garrison's story hook, line and sinker.  It seems that Stone is the only person in the country who did.  I admit, the film inspired me to do some research on the Kennedy assassination, but all I found was that the film was one lie after another after another.  It really spooked me until I found out that it was almost completely created out of whole-cloth.  If you really want to watch it, just take it as a piece of fiction, that way it won't be such a let-down when you find out more about the topic later.  However, if it inspires you to study the history that it addresses, then it has done a great service.
B00005JPDS|4.0|Life isn't easy.  Life is incredibly difficult.  It's full of challenges and obstacles.  On each one of our individual journeys there are thousands of things that can happen to knock us off our feet and set us back hundreds of paces.  It can be really frustrating and confusing.  Yet, the trials of life shouldn't be an excuse for giving up.  We can move forward towards \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\"  That's what Chris Gardner did.<br /><br />THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is an inspiring movie about some of the events in Gardner's life and how he was able to overcome them.  Gardner (played by Will Smith) was a struggling salesman of portable bone density scanners.  He used his life savings to pay for the venture and it was a costly mistake, but Gardner didn't give up.  He was determined to work the pavement, going from one medical office to another until he sold every last unit and could move on to better things.  His wife is unhappy in their marriage, his car has been possessed by the City of San Francisco, and they are almost three months behind due on their rent.  In this desperate time Gardner becomes inspired to apply for an internship at a major stock brokerage firm.  He impresses the employers and is offered the competitive internship, only to discover that it's a six month unpaid internship.  Determined to change things around, Gardner takes the position.  His wife leaves and Gardner is left to raise their son alone.  Together the father and son struggle as they are evicted from one place and another, homelessness, an auto accident, tax seizure, and mediocre child care all in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />Will Smith is one of America's great actors.  He can do drama, action, comedy, romance, and just about any other genre and not just do it, but do it well.  In this film he is joined by his own son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, portraying Gardner's son, Christopher.  Will Smith and Jaden must have a strong relationship and it comes across in the movie.  The real-life relationship between the film's stars helps ground the movie even more.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS.  The movie seemed real and true. Unlike many inspirational stories and biopics I've seen, it wasn't an over-sentimental, mushy, feel-good fluffy film.  Instead, to me, I felt like I was watching a few chapters from the biography of someone's life; a person who had overcome some incredible odds.  I also enjoyed the strong relationship displayed between Gardner and Christopher.  So often in movies, even ones based on real people, children neglect their parents and parents neglect their children.  That wasn't the case in this film.  It's nice for a change to watch a movie that shows a deep and strong relationship between a father and his son.  Now, that's inspirational.and it comes across in the movie.

B00004TJKI|5.0|Great Black and White movie.  A very provacative movie for that time. <br />Filmed my the town where I grew up.  It was a home town visit seeing all of the landmarks and familiar sites.
1400097029|3.0|'The Sea' by John Banville is a essentially the fictional memoir of a man recounting his life as he revisits a seaside Irish town he stayed in during his youth.  His life was not cheerful, and it seems everyone he meets is unhappy too.  By the end we discover a few secrets but, in general, the story has little to keep the reader engaged.   <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: wonderfully stitched together words does not save this book.  Not recommended.
B00000JR29|5.0|Although it came out in the mid 80's this album still sounds fresh, not that music from the 80's is bad, but not all of it stands the test of time. I recently got a copy of this remastered /bonus tracks version of Big Chair. It was worth every penny, to get a few more songs from them. I have played this album sooooo much over the years and I still never tire of it. I don't hear much of a difference from the previous CD in the sound quality, but it sounds great. This is really great music from the lyrics to the production to the performance. I saw them years ago and they sounded as good as the album. Tears For Fears made some great music both before and after this album, but it was with this one that all the ideas really came together. I really don't believe it is possible for someone to NOT like something on this album. Check out the first album \\"The Hurting\\" a bit different, but really good also.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|If you are a fan of Progressive Metal you likely already know how fantastic this CD is, and if you don't there are already many great reviews of this CD from others you can read. So I have decided not to submit a formal review for this CD. I instead would like to share a personal observation about Dream Theater and progressive metal in general, and who will enjoy this genre of music. Speaking in very broad terms, I'll tell you who enjoys, can grasp, and is passionate about this genre of music, and that is smart people. Think that is an absurd statement? Please indulge me for a moment while I make my case. But first I want to make it clear that I am not saying if you are an intelligent person you must like this music, what I am saying is it's obvious that the average person does not appreciate, understand or possess the needed attention span to enjoy this music. It is categorically clear that the AVERAGE person, who would naturally have average intelligence, likes their hip three minute brainless songs fed to them by FM radio stations and music television channels. Now, I think a quick but accurate estimation of the overall intelligence of fans of any genre of music can easily be measured by simply reading the reviews people have left. I observed that the overwhelming majority of reviews for Dream Theater are thoughtful, well written reviews by people who can actually put a cognitive sentence together. Now, take a moment and go read a few reviews from top selling artists in the most popular music genres; Pop, Rap/Hip Hop and Country. A large percentage of these reviews are written in incoherent incomplete sentences, with misspelled single syllable words, it is absolutely astonishing. I certainly think that this is a telling observation. OK, so there you have it, if you are a fan of Dream Theater you can reasonably assume you are somewhat brainy. If you are a fan of Justin Timberlake or The Black Eyed Peas what are you doing reading this review, or should I say trying to read this review.to read this review.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I have now had my swivel sweeper(s) for over a year (got it for Christmas in 2005).  I immediately bought another one to have at the cabin.  I have not had a problem with the battery.  I use it pretty much daily.  If mine ever dies, I will definitely replace it with a new one.  I paid about $35 for it, and as far as I'm concerned, I have gotten my money's worth. <br /> <br />Keep in mind it's a sweeper, not a vacuum.  Yes, you will still need to vacuum and wash your floors.  We have a very large kitchen and I use it all the time to go around the edges and under the stools at the island to sweep up crumbs, dust bunnies, etc.  It works like a charm and I no longer have to get down on my hands and knees to wipe up with a rag.  LOVE IT!  RECOMMEND IT!
B000FVBLEI|5.0|It's okay to not be a fan of All That Remains, but if you're going to write a review that makes no sense at all, why even bother?<br /><br />Now, onto the album. Just like on their two previous albums, All That Remains have been able to make a sound that doesn't tire the listener and stand out in an oversaturated genre. Phil Labonte's vocal style has improved greatly, whether it's the clean singing on \\"This Calling\\" or \\"We Stand\\", or the death metal style vox on \\"The Weak Willed\\". And the guitarists definitely show that they have undeniable talent, especially on \\"It Dwells On Me\\". This is one of the most diverse and memorable albums to be released in 2006.
B000J103YI|5.0|I've seen Dreamgirls twice now, and each time Jennifer sang \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going,\\" I was reduced to a blubbering mess. Her performance, for me, was that moving. I've always admired Jennifer Holiday's(the original Effie) version, but Jennifer Hudson's version is much more subtlely nuanced, relying on her acting to carry the song where it needed to go, compared to Jennifer Holiday's in-your-face-I'm going-to-slap-you- if-you-don't-listen- to-me-version. I was so happy to see that she won the Golden Globe, as she, hands down, deserved it. If you've enjoyed listening to her sing and haven't seen her performance, please go and see why people have stood up in the theater, cheering for this unbelievable and gifted talent.
0760316414|5.0|I ordered this book on 12/15/06 (Friday) as a Xmas gift, got it in the mail 12/18/06 (Monday)! Was really surprised it got here so fast. What else could be said here? What a speed!

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|If you like Black Sabbath & the 1st. Rush album you will love Wolfmother.  Also, The classic Orange amplifier sound on this album is Awesome!!!!   Highly recommended.   Get it.
B00065JTBA|2.0|For fans, I suppose this would be a rather big delight; for non-fans, it's nothing that will turn you on to the band from Jersey. They had some okay, cheesy hits in the '80s - but listening to some of their modern songs from this collection proves how completely out of touch they are nowadays.
B000067JHW|5.0|I fell in love with this movie after watching it on a local cable tv station.  Audrey bought an air of romance that wafted throughout the movie touching lives. <br /> <br />To be in Paris with such ambience is romantic itself.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|This movie works on two levels. You can enjoy it as standard family friendly adventure fair or you can ponder some of the subtler themes and exactly what the humanoid pig thing is actually all about. As with every Ghibli movie I can think of, there are some great flying scenes -- only more so this time, as airplanes play a central role in the film. Unlike some of Disney's other Ghibli dubs, I really like the voice acting on this one. So, even if you generally only watch subs, you might want to give the English audio track a try.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When my 14 yr. old asked for the DVD \\"Serenity\\" for Christmas, I looked it up online. I discovered that the film he was requesting was a follow-up to Firefly, which was a sci-fi series I had never heard of. My first thought was that it must have been terrible, but as I scanned the reviews online I realized it had a cult following. Given that the price was so unbelievably low, I opted to buy it for him.  <br /> <br />Our entire family ended up watching this series and loving it. It turns out the writer's view of outer space is a \\"final frontier\\" that is more than a little like the old west. It made for some humorous storylines. There aren't that many shows any more that we can get two teens and two parents to agree on, but we watched Firefly and loved it. It is witty and captivating. In fact, every time one of us couldn't be there to watch the next episode, whoever was home would \\"cheat\\" and watch ahead...only to watch it happily again when we all got back together. It would have been worth it at twice the price.
0393327655|1.0|While discussing the dangers of Christian/Islamic practice, Harris also  demonstrates quite clearly that he is a religous thinker himself, accepting  concepts such as \\"spirituality,\\" \\"mysticism,\\" and even the possibility of psychic powers. (How responsible is it to suggest precious resources be spent on studying concepts than have no sound theoretical basis?) An atheist would have simply discussed the emotional needs and eschewed terms acknowledging the existence of a soul.  I find it particularly disturbing that Dawkins provided Harris with an endorsement.  Atheists need spokesmen who are less muddled-headed.
B000LEZUEG|5.0|This book is a great read - especially considering the young age of the author!  It has all the great elements - action, adventure, mystery, and humor - yes, humor.  Bartimaeus' character has a wonderfuly caustic sense of humor that had me laughing out loud on several occasions!   I simply couldn't put the book down!!!  Luckily for me, its easy to read and keeps your interest.  I highly recommend it for all ages!!!
B00005RHGL|5.0|I love this epic western. The acting from all the cast is enormous and I would invite any western lover to purchase and enjoy.
B000EPFPVU|1.0|Tool are alleged to be one of the favorite band of Robert Fripp, founder of King Crimson, and I am a HUGE admirer of his. Unfortunately, after listening to this, all I can say is \\"Huh?\\" Some complicated time signatures, some odd chord progressions (and odd chords!) but BORING BEYOND BELIEF! <br />I though I had to be missing something, ao I went back and listened to some of the rest of the catalog. ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS BORING. If the only thing about these guys that keeps you awake is the sound level, pick up a remaindered copy of Lou Reed's \\"Metal Machine Music\\".  <br />Not one of these songs could come close to Crimso, even at their most paisley.
B000I5X80G|4.0|I just got the deluxe DVD + CD version of this album and it is wonderful so I don't really understand what all the disappointment and moaning is about on these reviews here.   <br /> <br />If you haven't learned yet that Neil is an audiophile of the highest order, well then YOU have not been paying attention. This guy has been all about delivering his music in the highest fidelity for many, many, many years.  So the point of this set is obvious: there is a CD of the recording which sounds OK but is compressed. On the DVD he has given us a VASTLY superior sounding version of the same concert (plus pix from the show) that plays on most ANY DVD player. Do an A/B comparison and you can hear the difference ... and I do NOT have uber expensive ultra high end gear folk.  You just need pay attention and listen with your ears.  It is a great show.  And sure it is just the electric set, but I assume it is all that is available or is simply the portion of the show Neil wanted to give us.... maybe we'll get a full Acoustic/electric set in the future. <br /> <br />If you have not heard Neil's other audiophile releases, I whole heartedly encourage you to get them.  I have Harvest in 5.1 Surround Sound DVD Audio and it is an amazing recording -- which also has an even higher resolution stereo track on it.  THe 5.1 mix puts you in \\"the barn\\" with the band.  What more can I say? It is a breathtaking experience.   I also recently picked up the high resolution STEREO DVD Audio releases of American Stars and Bars and that is just wonderful... big, round, and full and as close to the master tape as any of us are likely ever to get to hear.  The movie Rust Never Sleeps on DVD sounds fabulous in surround (use the DTS track).   <br /> <br />So, all I can offer is that Neil is challenging you as listeners to hear what he is hearing.  If you want a low fidelity MP3 for your portable listening, fine. But if you want to hear what he artist wants you to hear, you owe it to yourself to listen up. <br /> <br />Mark
B000MNP2KI|5.0|NOTE: This review can also be found on the Casino Royale movie release page. I edited it to talk about the DVD.    Before I start, I won't get all technical here with the film and unfold all of its nuances because many people have already done so, and I won't ruin the movie for anyone either. All of this is my own opinion of the film. This movie teaches you who James Bond is as a spy and as a person, and after you have seen it, you'll understand exactly why the world's coolest fictional spy is who he is.    Casino Royale is definitely the best Bond film in at least 10 years (if not my favourite one of all time). Yes, I too was upset when Pierce Brosnan was kicked off the series and I was a bit shocked when I found out that some blonde British guy was taking Brosnan's place, but honestly, it never really bothered me at all. Actually, I think I forgot about the whole thing. But now that I have seen Casino Royale, I do believe that Daniel Craig did an amazing job portraying Bond. I don't care about the way he looks (even though I think he's quite beautiful). Looks are not the most important thing. He's a great actor with the passion and the attitude that has been missing for so long. He defeated the stereotype for how James Bond should look and act, and for that he gets my approval and admiration. He was made to play this role. Go see his last two films if you don't believe me.    I went into the movie with an open mind and was completely hooked when the opening riff to \\"You Know My Name\\" started, and I wasn't disappointed for a moment after. James Bond wasn't a sophisticated and seasoned spy yet in this story, which is how he should be considering the context of the movie, when he first receives his license to kill and 00 status and starts his tenure as a spy. You would expect him to go on some sort of an ego trip and to not have all of these fancy gadgets floating around everywhere. If those were inserted into the movie, the movie would be too gaudy and parody-like.I think they captured the essence of who he was at the beginning and I loved every minute of Bond being a reckless, chauvinistic, egotistical s.o.b. The one-liners were great and I also really loved the romance between James and Vesper. We actually saw the emotional lovey-dovey side of James Bond in this film. He loved Vesper and Vesper loved him back...but Vesper Lynd really is James Bond's one and only true love and that's never changed in the last 21 films.    The movie was carried out perfectly, from the opening scenes and credits, to the theme song (which I love), and to the very end, which will keep you wondering. They definitely needed to save the Bond franchise after \\"Die Another Day\\" and they nailed it. I hope that Daniel Craig keeps playing Bond for a while because I will be sad to see him go. His work here has made a fan out of me and I cannot wait to see him in other films, Bond or not. The acting was superb by every cast member as well. If this movie doesn't get some award by the American or international motion picture community, then I'll be disappointed.    My only gripes with the film are that it was one big advertisement for Sony. Now, I love Sony products, but even though they own the rights to this movie, they did not need to pull the desperate plug and put all of their electronic devices in the film. They make enough money as it is. My next gripe is with Eva Green's makeup. She's a beautiful girl, but she doesn't need all that black eye makeup around her eyes. She looked just fine without all that black stuff. My last gripe comes with everybody comparing this movie to the Bourne series. This is not the Bourne Identity or the Bourne Supremacy, and even though there are a few similarities, these two movies are different and should be kept that way. It would have been really awesome also if this movie was set in the 1950's. It would have been true to the book and when this was originally written. That would have been an interesting experience. I'dalso like to know more about what is on this DVD. I know that there's a documentary about becoming Bond, but there has got to be more if there's going to be a second disc.    I completely suggest that you buy this movie (or pre-order it if you are so inclined). If you're not a Bond addict yet, this is the perfect intro to what happens in the beginning and how things came to be. Then start watching all the movies and read the books if you're inclined to do so (they're great and help you understand what happens in the movies.) If you're looking for a movie with crazy gadgets, bad jokes/sexual innuendo, unrealistic plots/villians, and a spy who acts like a pretty boy and eats caviar, this may not be the movie you are looking for. If you're looking for a modern and fresh James Bond with attitude and using his brains to get the mission completed, then by all means go buy the movie...now.
B000IFQLBE|5.0|as usual,all Fogerty stuff is top notch to me. I've been a fan since I first heard Proud Mary back in '69 I think it was, and I still can't get enough  of him. Hope he tours New Zealand again soon. There wouldn't be anything of his I haven't got. Cheers, Phil, New Zealand
B00082IJ08|5.0|I can't say enough about this album. It's simply a piece of art. Every track on here is special. No, really! It's hard to find albums these days where every song is really good. I can tell that the group took their time in creating every gem on this album. The first time around, I'll admit I was not taken aback by all the songs. I really purchased it for two of the more popular songs. Well, the more I played it, the more it grew on me. Instead of skipping tracks, I started to pay attention to each one and then fell in love with the whole album. You can listen to this over and over again and discover something new each time. A must have for any serious music collector.
B00001U0DP|5.0|the package arrived in perfect condition and the gift was awesome so thanks so much
B000JJRIN4|1.0|wow.. i didn't know she raps? or yodel. did she sniff too much cocaine?  <br />i'm glad she loves japan..but putting the word HARAJYUKU all over the purse and call it your own brand? no originality what so ever. they look like a rip-off superlovers.
6305537321|3.0|I understand this movie is an iconic film for a lot of women.  And you can clearly see that there are a number of fictional characters inspired from this movie-Carrie bradshaw leaps to mind, but honestly I've never found anything cute or charming about ditzy or flighty women. Even Capote (the man wrote the novella this movie is based from) didn't like this movie.  Now I don't hate it but it doesn't speak to me or tug my heart strings.  Hwever, I do like the symbolism with the cat at the end.  Though I agree with 'people don't belong to people' but you can be a part of each other's lives.  Over all, it's cute, but not my favorite Audrey Hepburn movie.
0767830555|4.0|Lighting is simply magnificent, camera movement is amazing and yet again Martin Scorsese collaborates with Robert De Niro to make an amazing film.
B000FOQ1EA|2.0|It is a hopeful sight to see a new release of any major symphonic cycle.  Given Sibelius' cyclical popularity in full swing, this release makes sense.  It is unfortunate that Decca chose Blomstedt's this time around.  It is as if, at every step, Blomstedt restrains rather than empowers, through almost every movement.  Never letting go of the leash, the listener cries out for the players to be enabled to take Sibelius' music where it is fully capable of going.  Don't take my word for it, listen for yourself.  Compare the measured tact & grace of Davis, the unbridled electricity of Ashkenazy, or (my recommendation) the young swagger & hipness of Maazel & the Vienna Philharmonic.  Then try not to fall asleep as a reluctant Blomstedt proceeds to suck the very life out of each & every symphony.  Sad, really.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|We cover both political parties in our house...but that does not matter in the least.  We both remained glued to the screen.  The graphics are really good and Mr. Gore is a remarkable speaker.  It was neat to see the changing maps and graphs.  It is a well done documentary of history/geography for the books!  Very family friendly! <br />LWalls
B000MNP2KI|1.0|Casino Royale is quite possibly the best Bond movie of all time and, with all due respect to Sean Connery's handling of the role, Daniel Craig deserves the same such praise for his portrayal of 007.  I would be all over pre-ordering this item if it were not for my noticing of the Regional Coding Enhancement (RCE) disclaimer in the Product Details.<br /><br />  It may not seem like such a big deal in preventing discs from working on Region 0 or Multi-region players, I resent Sony's continued efforts in adding these extra levels of protection to its products.  This is the same company that not too long ago--in the name of digital rights managment--added malware onto its music CD's that actually damaged consumers' electronics equipment: most notably computers.<br /><br />  While I will try to refrain from purchasing this particular product for as long as I can, this practice seems to have gone on for some time now with previous Sony DVD's and to little fanfare, so I suspect that I will eventually cave and get the Casino Royale DVD--it is that good of a movie--but I will certainly go out of my way to avoid Sony products with the rarest of exceptions.<br /><br />  I really appreciate Amazon's efforts in informing its customers of some of their partners' practices.  If and when I decide to purchase this item, I will definitely do so through Amazon, unless I can find a bare bones version with just the single disc and sans the RCE from somewhere else.
032147404X|5.0|What's there not to like...... as a beginner in digital photography and brand new dslr camera owner, this is a bring-along book. No fancy terms, just a lot of good info. So he put a bit too much of his personality  in it, so what! If you want all tech terms, get a very technichal book. For people like me it's a goldmine. And now it's 2006's book of the year at Amazon... well deserved!
B00062IVKS|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  great acting, great directing, and great story.  The true story of La Motta who is played by Robert De Niro who is possibly the best actor of his generation.  Co-starring Joe Pesci as De Niro's brother; he has a great performance.  Great film.  Highly recommended!!!!
B000BT97AO|3.0|I bought this movie because it had Jim Hensons name on it. I imagined a world  of puppetry and charming furry creatures entertwined with a journey of discovery. Needless to say, thats not really what this movie is, but I am certainly not disappointed. <br /> <br />I have to agree with other reviewers, I dont know who is movie is for. Visually stunning for adults, confusing and scary for kids. <br /> <br />Think of this film as going to the Aquarium. Its visually mezmerizing, but dont expect to understand why the fish swim the way they do.
B000HIVO64|4.0|I'm a big fan of \\"Sea Change\\", so to see producer Nigel Godrich's return was encouraging.  Beck fans will certainly not be disappointed with this eclectic set of tracks.  The songs are, as has become customary of Beck, well written but sometimes a bit incomplete, maybe superficial.  Still, the soundscapes alone are worth at least 3 stars.  While lacking in the sentiment of \\"Sea Change\\", the disc moves Beck foward in noise.  I see this as a transitional disc between \\"Sea Change\\" and \\"Guero\\" so I expect his next disc to be tremendous.  Lord knows it'll be interesting.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|To its credit this film features a lively group of eccentric characters, in their own defiant ways doing to the TV sort of \\"family values\\" what satire requires should be done to them. When the film is most honest satirically, each of these characters is revealed to be largely just his or her own carver, following dreams of bliss more often inappropriately or dully individualist than familial. On their partly forced, \\"communal\\" way to a beauty contest for little girls held in Redondo Beach, California, we see them mostly bickering while they're entangled in largely humorous actions, though heartbreak and loss intrude as well. This trip, I'd argue, with its ups and downs is the best part of the film - the journey itself infinitely superior to what ends it.   Having created memorable eccentrics, the scriptwriters apparently didn't know in the long run what to do with them. The four alternate endings on the DVD suggest the writers' stronger talent for characterization than for an originally conceived and successful dramatic action. What they do come up with, an over the top beauty contest official and an anarchic family stunt highlighting \\"togetherness,\\" suggests scriptwriting desperation time. Whereas the hospital lady who earlier would have thwarted the family's plans was drawn as unfeelingly bureaucratic, rightly low key and thoroughly convincing, the beauty contest head is straight out of the world of TV sitcom and fits a different level of reality than the film posits throughout. Similarly, the final family stunt at her expense, along with the driving away through a traffic gate to her further discomfort, is now just outdated 60's stuff, a stale resolution of the sort that plays convincingly these days only on prole TV.   For all its merit, this film shows us, I suspect unintentionally, that the road is far, far  better than the inn.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|The Departed was a classic Scorsese film.  It conatains undercover, violence, language, excellent lighting, and fantastic cinematography.  Scorsese proves once again that he is  director who deserves an oscar.  He has never won and this could be the one.  Best movie of all time!!!!!

B000641ZA4|4.0|Since I live in Venezuela and being so young the genesis years were long pass when i discovered we can`t dance got interested in their music and started buyin the albums, of course reedited Cds, as i bought the album the more i liked de group so it became my favorite band... no matter as hard as i tried i could never find a video compilation (its too hard in my country) so when this video compilation was released i just had to buy it. <br /> <br />The compilation itself only shows you the videos with some little information before each song, its not inteactive so you just get a limited review of the technical especification on the videos and songs, another thing is that only has the videos of the collins years, not that i complain, but it would have been nice to see the early footage of the band with peter gabriel, maybe some of the lamb gig. <br /> <br />The sound its great.. if you have a 5.1 sorround sound equipment even better, i've discovered new sounds in the songs and its easy to navigate through the menus and songs...if you like genesis its a must have.
B000J103OI|5.0|Merryl Streep holds true to her form.  Great Movie.  Kind of slow paced but a good comedy.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|An excellent, short movie for small children and up.  Wordless, but story captivatingly and clearly told through the animation and music.
032147404X|3.0|I must be the stick-in-the-mud professor, but I found the book filled with so much useless gab as to be really debilitating. The humor might work on the lecture circuit, but not in print. Each page has its lovely color photograph, but the other half -- the text -- is half fluff. So there is perhaps a sentence or two at most on each page that is useful. There must be better books out there.
B00005JPAM|5.0|Oh,  I loved this movie!   It was so interesting,  with such wonderful acting.   I felt like I was sitting in the room with some of the characters,   spying on them as they went about their business.   The amazing Helen Mirren,  while a tad too tall and slim to be 100% convincing,   nevertheless pulled it off so well that you sometimes think it's Her Majesty playing herself.    Likewise the Tony and Cherie Blair characters.     It was an interesting experience watching the actor who played Charles,  because I felt he looked nothing like Charles,  lacking the prominent ears and nose,   but he looked eerily like the photos one sees of his great uncle the Duke of Windsor,   so it gave a strange feeling of \\"wrong character,  right family.\\"   A little prosthesis to the nose and ears of this actor would have placed him in the \\"right on the money\\" category as well.   <br />     I haven't read any of the reviews yet,   but I have a feeling that at least some of them will involve intensive discussion of the obvious emotional retardation of the British Royal family.    The hordes of slavish Diana worshippers will no doubt be out in droves to see how their icon is portrayed.   I was pleased to see that this movie was a well-balanced and fair representation of the interests of all parties concerned.    It showed all facets of the participants: the antiquated,   repressive atmosphere of an ancient lineage that has no clue as to how outmoded it is,  how out of touch with modern life it is,  and how much damage they've done to the lives of all who come in contact with them,  is neatly juxtaposed with its portrayal of a woman who knows no other way but how she has been raised,  and is a basically decent person who has devoted her life to the people she feels she was born to reign over.   It also portrays Diana fairly,  the young and lovely woman thrown into a situation she was not ready for,  the gracious princess who served the world with compassion and humour,  the wonderfulmother who gave her sons a decent foundation was fairly balanced with Diana as a neurotic,  needy,  somewhat histrionic jetsetter who used the press for her own gains and then ended up dying almost at their hands.   The movie shows the people involved as they really are,   the best and the worst of them,  real,  three-dimensional,  multi-faceted human beings.      It's a wonderful experience and worth every one of the awards that it is sure to garner.
B000H7JD4K|1.0|I have been a maiden fan for 15 years and I must say this album is complete garbage.  How in the world anyone can compare this trash to Seventh Son is beyond me.  Steve \\"hang up your bass and call it a day\\".  Bruce's solo albums over the past 8 years blow away anything maiden has done since Fear of the Dark.  This will be my last maiden purchase.
0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel takes you along to a completely believable world.  This novel has everything, despair, joy, friendship, philosophy and adventure.  It is without a doubt one of the best stories I have ever read.  You find yourself disappointed that its so short.  Piscine is so real and well developed you feel you know him, and are a close friend. I guarantee you will have difficulty putting this book down.
B000HEWEE4|3.0|This had the potential to be a very good movie.  Both Bullock and Reeves do a good job.  If you can suspend disbelief enough to accept the whole communication between time thing, then the plot is interesting (although a touch slow in development).  The problem is: they completely bombed on the ending.  I can't say too much because people will whine that I'm a spoiler but . . .  The movie had set up a great (but tragic) ending but, instead, they opted for the contrived happy-ever-after ending.  In one moment it went from a compelling story to sentimentalist fluff.  They did such a good job building up the conflict and they resolve it like this?  How disappointing. <br /> <br />I would have given this 4 stars but for the ending. <br />
0446310786|5.0|I read this in school as a kid and now I bought a great old used copy to give to my daughter. I only hope she will take away from it the same lesson I did and just a side note it says the \\"N\\" word over 30 times. I had a hard time dealing with that even the first time I read it but it wouldn't be the same without it. I hope one day we can reach an understanding that this word isn't needed and infact should be outlawed from use. I hope that there will come a time when the only time a word like this is used is in old books and about different times.
0517543052|4.0|One of the more idiosyncratic publications of Hippiedom,'Be Here Now' has retained its now quaint format, with the lrge text revelations on recycled brown paper bulking its core. It's this part of the book that carries the whiff of nostalgia. The biographical data on Alpert's move from successful psychology therapist and LSD experimenter, to guru status is of interest. It's general frame is nothing out of the ordinary, in fact expresses, the middleclass disenchantment of the 60s. The last third of the book,'Cookbook for a Sacred Life' is a compendium of quotable quotes that will never go astray from anyone's daily diary page. Thirty-five years on, one of the strangest things about the book is how much more mainstream the thinking is. And this volume contributed to that paradigm shift.

B000GG4XJM|5.0|Love hearing Springsteen sing and play these folk songs.  He has the perfect voice for this type of music.  The dvd is great.  Fun to see him interact with his band in an informal format.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|We love this movie, but the tape we had was one that was so old that it was in very bad shape. My husband had been told the movie was no longer available for sale since NBC bought the rights. So when I found this 60th Anniversary Edition, I was thrilled. To see the joy on my husband's face was a blessing to me.
B00005OWEG|4.0|Apocalypse Now is number 28 among the best American movies ever, and this Redux version is among the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers. The Redux version adds 49 minutes to the original movie, among them, the dinner scene with the French. The only \\"extra\\" in this Redux DVD is a theatrical trailer, which is very poor.<br /><br />This movie is Coppola's version of the book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. The movie also leads us to \\"The Hollow Men\\" by T.S. Eliot, a great poem Wurtzs (Brando) is reading at the end of the movie. In the middle of the movie, in one of the best scenes in movie history -the helicopters' attack on a village-, we can listen to Wagner's \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\". A lot of references between the movie, literature, and music (good Rock tracks by The Doors, etc.) that make this movie a great asset of the American culture.<br /><br />I first watched this movie in the 80's when it was broadcasted on TV. While watching it yesterday, I could remember parts of it. It is really difficult to me to rate this movie fairly. I am torn between a good or excellent rating and a modest one. Is it a masterpice? Is this redux version better than the original one? Today, I am giving this movie 4 stars, or 7 over 10. I found this redux version to be too long. Besides the \\"egg\\" scene, and the sex afterwards, the scene dinner with the French is pointless and too long. One of the best assets of this movie is Martin Sheen, who is absolutely great and carries his character in a mesmerizing way. I know nobody is going to like this, but I don't like Marlon Brando. The narrator is, at some points, tiring (is it the same narrator of the video game Max Payne?), and one of the final scenes where they sacrifice a water buffalo is some place between nasty, and ubearable. A disturbing and tough one!<br /><br />I recommend this movie to the adult public (it is rated R for disturbing images, language, sexual content and some drug use). I honestly think I need to watch this movie several more times, to completely understand it.  But as for today, I can't give it more than 4 stars.<br /><br />P.S. If you like my review vote YES. You can read all my other reviews if you wish to. I modestly write them to help people form an opinion about movies, music and books, but if nobody reads them (if you don't vote I do not know if you did) there is no point in writing themmore times, to completely understand it.

0142000663|5.0|I have to admit that I probably never would have read this book if it hadn't been a reading assignment from one of my first American Literature classes. But since taking that class I have always been very grateful that I was assigned this reading assignment as it has been life altering. Steinbeck is probably my favorite of all of the classical american literature writers.  He speaks the voice of the common man and ultimately shows that humanity and dignity are not limited by social class.
0446608955|5.0|Landon and Jamie live two completely different lives. Landon is a rebel; he soaps up car windows with his friends and eats boiled peanuts in the graveyard. But Jamie on the other hand, takes care of her windowed father, volunteers at the local orphanage and carries a bible with her wherever she goes. They live just a few streets away from each other, but hardly know each other. But things change when Landon finds him self without a date to the homecoming dance, and he has no other choice than to ask Jamie. She agrees to go with him, although her father, the towns Baptist Minister, doesn't like him at all. After the dance Jamie asks Landon to play one of the main roles in the Christmas play her father has written. Landon doesn't really want to, but finally he agrees. <br /> <br />When the rehearsals start for the play, Jamie and Landon begin to spend a lot of time together, and the more Landon gets to know her, the more he understands and likes her. On the night of the play, he can't help but fall in love with her. Jamie seems to feel the same way, but there is one thing that she keeps from him. Jamie has Leukemia and doesn't have much time to live. When Landon has to face this fact, he knows that there is only one thing that he can do- ask for her hand in marriage.  <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes love stories. In the prologue of the book, Nicholas Sparks writes, \\"at first it will make you smile, then you will laugh, and then you will cry\\". He is so right. The miracle in the end makes you so happy, but at the same time makes you cry because Landon was Jamie's miracle. She changed him into this amazing young man, and then he finds out that she has leukemia. This is another great work of Nicholas Sparks, but may not end as happy as you would like it to.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|After watching this movie both on my flights and on the DVD many times, I browsed the discussion related to the movie on the Web.  Even though what Gore said might not be perfectly correct, I am in the belief that reducing the consumption of energy is a correct direction for all human, and this movie can serve as a very good starting point for ordinary audience.

B00008DDHZ|4.0|This film does a great job of capturing the spirit and atmosphere of this historical event. The movie was made in 2002 and the film is so well-made that you may have to remind yourself that it is a re-enactment and not actual footage. The acting is superb and based on what others have reported the movie has kept to a genuine protrayal of the actual story.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This performance by Christian Bale would be hard to match. His acting is superb as he plays the role of Trevor, a machinist who has not been able to sleep for year and is only beginning to put the pieces together to understand why he is mentally falling apart. I found this performance superior to his great work in American Psycho. In the Machinist he msut play a mentally ill man, unable to remember much of his past, unable to remember some trama that has resulted in his inability to sleep for over a year. His ability to transform his body to play this part was incredible.<br /><br />The plot is excellent in that as Trevor begins to sort out hallucination from reality and to sort out memories from living nightmares, so too is the audience trying to make sense of the film and the trama that may have stimulated Trevor's inability to sleep. Gradually we learn what is one of Trevor's waking dreams and what is reality starting to break through. However, even a series of waking dreams give clues to Trevor's true state of mind and the possible underlying reasons as to why he is paranoid and can't sleep for over a year. In other words, every hallucination, though it may be frighful, leads Trevor and the viewer toward some deeper truth about his condition.<br /><br />In the end, the viewer is not left hanging, the pieces do come together. It is a super psychological thriller.<br /><br />Before ending this review, I must comment on the superb cinematography and art direction in the film. When filming a psychological drama, camera angle, the interplay of dark and light, the framing of scenes to create anxiety or disqust are all part of the cinematographer's art. In this film the camera work could not be better. It significantly adds to the story line and acting and makes this product get 5 stars. Also, the art direction was fantastic, keeping the film within a dark grey range of color with only pale flesh adding any warmth to the screen.
B000HEWEEY|3.0|I have to agree with others on here who've taken Warners to task for the packaging of some of the items in this collector's set.  My DVDs were not damaged. But the send-away replica poster arrived after a six-week wait and was in a tube so bent and broken that the only thing to be done with the poster was to throw it out.  That's essentially what has happened with the other posters from other WB campaigns like \\"The Searchers.\\"
1569242739|5.0|A book completely dedicated to vegan cupcakes? Who would have thought the book would be such a hit. In the past, I've never had much success with making my own frosting, let alone the vegan kind. However, the recipes in this book make the most fluffy, delicious frosting I have tasted(especially the vegan buttercream). Cupcake recipes are fabulous as well. No one can tell these cupcakes are completely vegan. It is definitely worth having in your library. I had no problem adjusting the cooking time to make perfect cupcakes at high altitude.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I always confuse Mansfield Park, and Northanger Abbey with Persuasion. I did not know the movie is out and this is the first time I've seen it and it was brilliant.  I always loved Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility but I think I have a new favorite now and I do not think I will be confusing this story with anything else again. Amanda Root portrays everything with just her facial features, and body language - no words are spoken and there is no need for any. Ciarán Hinds also does very well as the previously thwarted lover. The two of them manage to create tension out of almost nothing.  Then there is Sophia Thompson, brilliant. Anne's father is also played very well.  Its nice to see an alternative to the usual physically blemish free Jane Austen.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|An honest, believable tale of the Dark Knight. <br /> <br />The director's dogmatic insistence, \\"Make it real...make it real,\\" paid off. This telling makes the story of Batman real and believable. Of all the \\"hero\\" genre films I've ever seen this one is my favorite because of the aforementioned statement. The acting is top notch -- and I'm no fan of Katie Homes and think someone else could have done it better, but alas... -- Michael Caine is a great \\"Alfred\\" and Lucias Fox's (Morgan Freeman) lines are great. The casting was well done and I am glad they included Rutger Hauer (a personal favorite because of his work in Blade Runner). <br /> <br />But above all, this is the best telling of the Batman story -- even better than in the comics -- and better than other genre films (even the original Chris Reeve \\"Superman\\" which is a close 2nd).
0446528056|4.0|I was a devoted reader of Sparks's books.  Soon however, I found his books to be totally manufactured and mainstream.  All the same stories different names.  I gave up on his books after stopping mid way through one of his previous books; I was convinced he could not put out anything new.  However, after much persuasion from a friend, I reluctantly borrowed this book from her and fell in love with it.  This is by far Spark's best book! Great story lines, great characters wonderful books about the realties of life's un-understandable twists and turns.  I recommend as a reformed believer in Sparks's abilities buy this book! It will take you for a wonderful ride.
B000JCETDS|5.0|Those guys are so awesome.  <br />The Soundtrack was for some reason here in Germany only for a few days available and will be ready to buy again as the movie starts here in Feb. 2007.

B00004TLN3|3.0|I have read the book and while it is not in the same vein as other Austen novels, it is not bad. I find the heroine exasperating, a little annoying, naive, but I still like her, and I love the hero.  I liked both even more in the movie, especially the hero and I think that the father of the hero was especially well played.  However I find the choice of music in very bad taste. I literally turned the volume on my player off every time it came on and even missed a few bits of the movie.  I think the music was intrusive and in rather bad taste.  I think there is another version of this movie available and I would like to watch it just to see if it would be better with different music and if the other movie has better music.  I am in two minds about the inclusion of the person of color in the movie.  It is somewhat historically accurate except for the fact that I think (not sure) possession of slaves was made illegal in Britain by the time the book was written.  I think the inclusion of this person of color and the illusion to slavery is done a bit awkwardly, doesn't really serve much of a function according to story structure.  I think the person also detract from the actual story.  On the other hand the inclusion of the person of color adds a touch of reality to the story.  However would the heroine realistically have been dancing with this person in the actual period in which Austen was writing? doubt it.  I think that this person is out of place, could have been done better.
B000J103PC|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time!! Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actress's and plays the part of Miranda Priestly so very well. The movie tells of a young lady who graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in journalism and moves to the Big Apple in hopes of finding the right editorial job, preferably The New Yorker. After searching with no luck, she finally lands a job as second assistant to the notorious editor in chief of Runway Magazine, Miranda Priestly. She's told almost hourly, \\"A million girls would kill for this job,\\" but after a few days at Miranda's malicious beck and call, Andy is ready to kill herself. Or Miranda.  <br /> <br />If Andrea can hang on for a year in her postion as Miranda's \\"dog on a chain\\", it will guarantee her a job at just about any publication she chooses, including the New Yorker. <br /> <br />Andrea makes her deal with the devil, suffering through snide suggestions that a size 6 (5-foot-10 Andy's size) is the new 14. Or suffering Miranda's \\"it's my fault\\" out-loud confession about her new hire, \\"I told myself, go ahead. Take a chance on the smart fat girl.\\" <br /> <br />Miranda's curt \\"That's all,\\" to signal she's no longer interested in having you anywhere within five feet of her. The office-wide becomes a war-zone when it's reported Miranda is on the premises, as flats are tossed for stiletto heels, uneaten breakfast is tossed in the trash, and panicked cries, \\"She's coming!\\" are shouted out. <br /> <br />The movie reminds me about the movie \\"Queen of Mean: The Leona Helmsley Story\\"  <br /> <br />This is a must see movie!!
6305907145|5.0|Jane Austen has not included much about slavery in her novel.  However the inclusion of slavery through Sir Thomas Betram's business interests I think is done very well in this movie version.  I also think that the oldest son's drunken behaviour, the adultary, and Fanny Price's morally upright character are played very well. The book of drawings of the slaves is a brilliant touch. I was little surprised to see nudity and actual sex in the movie though.  We get to see so little of the \\"other side\\" of Jane Austen society (the poor) in the novels that it is brilliant to see the Price family in this novel.  I think that the scenes depicting \\"lovers vow\\" are also good.  I did however miss seeing Fanny's eldest brother as a seaperson. I do not actually like this story all that much possibly because the slavery is so disturbing and I did not read the book all the way through until after watching the movie.

B00000G3AZ|5.0|I have watched two longer versions of the movie and this stands up very well next to them. Well done.  Other short versions of Jane Austen novels have done not done so well.  I have not seen Emma as played by Kate Beckinsale.  Looks like I may need to make that my next Austen movie as she is said to play the part as it was \\"meant\\" to be played and as Austen has portrayed it.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|I'm sure the idea of having George Martin and his son Giles re-mix the Beatles's songs must have sounded very appealing to the remaining Beatles, their wives and the record company.  However, this idea never lives up to its promise.  The transition mixes are a jumble of sounds that scramble one style period to the next.  The \\"Benefit of Mr. Kite/I Want You/Helter Skelter\\" stands out as especially bad.  The acoustic version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" starts as a potential highlight of the album, only to be ruined by the weepy string arrangement of George Martin, who said he was apprehensive about doing it.  The Beatles songs are great, but there is no flow in this album and the transitions and selections from one song to the next are jarring.  I liked the music but did not LOVE this album.
0140557741|5.0|I was first introduced to this book at a challenge course where I had taken a group of students.  It was used as a team building activity which I have adopted in my junior high art class. I took the book apart and laminated the pages.  I use the number of pages that I need in sequence depending on the size of my class.  I mix up the pages and then pass one out to each student.  I ask them, without talking, to place themselves in proper sequence with the other pages.  It is a good ice breaker activity at the beginning of a new class or new semester.
0743289412|2.0|I have every Stephen King book available to the public and have loved almost every one.  This one though was extremely disappointing.  The story took forever to get moving and was so confusing at times that I had to put it down and think about was I was reading.  In some cases, I had to read it again just to \\"get\\" what he was trying to say.  I will buy his next book but have to say this was a huge let-down.  I hope he gets it together with his next book because I would be sad to have to mark another big author off my list of must-haves.

0743298020|4.0|A fascinating and absorbing book! This has vivid imagery and a labyrinth-like lyricism that made me feel a part of the unraveling layers of stories, mystery, and secrets. This work tells the power of storytelling, of books, and the sometimes quiet redemption of letting go. It's a work that lingers and can keep you wondering even after the last page has been turned, which gives this book its haunting effect.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This is exactly what I expected from the man who brought us Goodfellas. Scorsese has created a masterpiece and its name is The Departed. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much walking into the theaters to see it, mostly due to the actors who star (DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Wahlberg), but because of all the good things I had been hearing I decided to see it. \\"Wow.\\" Was all I could say as I left the theater (same reaction from my two buds who tagged along) and called damn near everyone I knew who enjoyed a good movie. After this film I see all of the before mentioned actors in a whole new light. This film is definitely at the top of my favorites list!

0307237699|5.0|I find Obama's book to be just as engaging as he is in person.  He speaks from the heart, seems very honest and does give me hope for the future.  I find a little humility, something that is very much missing from most politicians.   <br />He may be just what we need after so many years of lies and deception from our current government.  I think it is about time we had a NEW face in the white house, one who is as open as he seems, someone who will listen.  Thanks.   Jan
B00031TXBI|1.0|I'm a big fan of JF, but obviously not obsessed. I really didn't get much from this album. If you have listened to other Frusciante albums and are worried about the singing in this one too, well you should be. I can't get used to bad singing, maybe it's just me. Unfortunately, JF needs  studio polishing when it comes to singing.     If you're searching for some Frusciante to get started on, try Shadows Collide with People, one of the best albums I've listened to period. It's night and day with his other works (that I've listened to) including this one. Shadows' 5 stars are justified, not so sure about Inside of Emptiness.
B000J103N4|4.0|I shoplifted a cassette tape of IICORMN somehere around 1973. In my defense, it was sitting forlorn, forgotten and \\"cut-out\\" in a  bin at the local WT Grants store.   I was then a sixteen year old under the influence of CSNY in their collective and individual aspects.  I felt then that this album was a gem , and have always felt that it had sailed under the great albums of the early 70's radar(whereas an album like \\"Deja Vu\\" had smashed square on in to the screen).  I later purchased the LP and a CD reissue too. <br /> <br /> Ben Ratliff review in last week's Sunday NY Times alerted me to Rhino's enhanced reissue.  Add my name to the list of people congratulating the folks at RHINO for making the effort to reissue(and draw deserved attention to) this  album. <br /> <br />I am fearful of the rising tide of my generation's self, and collectively, absorbed review and reissue.(see Robert Stone's recently released memoirs of the Sixties).  Yikes, here it comes!  However, as a soundtrack for \\"The Best of The Hippy Generation\\" this album, a true timepiece,might be the best choice, and I am happy to see it reissued .  <br /> <br />
B00018TI5E|5.0|I have read many, many reviews on amazon, and it seems that most people like Shadows Collide. What I don't understand is how other Frusciante albums get 5 stars...please, if you've listened to all of his albums and you read this review send me an email with suggested Frusciante albums based on these criteria: <br /> <br />1. Good singing (voice mainly) <br />2. Somewhat polished production (at least) <br />3. Most songs being really good <br />4. Good singing (emphatically) <br /> <br />I absolutely love Shadows, John's voice actually sounds really good and the music is unbelievable, unlike the other albums I have painfully listened to. Inside of Emptiness received really good reviews so I bought it. It's really not that great, especially when compared to Shadows. My gut feeling is that most of his albums might contain one, two, or maybe three good songs, such as the Past Recedes on Curtains. I hope I'm wrong. <br /> <br />So, if your privy to Frusicante's catalog could you please hit me with an email with suggestions so that I'll stop wasting time/money/hope. <br />
B000M9BPEY|5.0|This is, indeed, a magical, mystical movie about fathers and sons, which is based upon the book \\"Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions\\" by Daniel Wallace. The book is a perfect vehicle for Director Tim Burton's signature melange of reality and fantasy. The story is that of a father and his son, their estrangement, and their eventual reconciliation. It is a beautifully realized film that will bring tears to one's eyes.<br /><br />The father in question is Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) who loves to tell, at least it seems so to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), tall tales about his past. The son becomes estranged from his father on his wedding day, when his father tells one tall tale too many for Will's tastes. For the next several years, Will communicates only with his mother, Sandra (Jessica Lange).<br /><br />When his father becomes seriously ill, however, Will and his wife rush to his side. Father and son take final stock of each other, and the seemingly tall tales continue. As his father gets progressively worse, Will, feeling that he really does not know his father, embarks on a journey to discover for himself, once and for all, the man his father really is. What he discovers is that his father was not so off the mark with his stories, and he finally begins to appreciate who his father really is and the impact that he has had on others. It allows Will to be able to say goodbye to his father in a way that his father understands and to be at peace with the man whom he discovered his father to be.<br /><br />The film takes the viewer on a ride through some of Ed Bloom's tall tales, in a series of vignettes, where the viewer sees a young Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor) living an almost fantastical life. We see him meet the love of his life, Sandra, as a young girl (Alison Lohman). We see him as a circus worker, a soldier, a traveling salesman, and even a bank robber. We see some of the people that cross section his life: a giant, a diminutive ringmaster, a witch, and singing Siamese twins. Ed even comes across a perfectly heavenly town full of wonderful, happy people.<br /><br />This is simply a marvelous film with fantastical elements reminiscent of \\"Forrest Gump\\" and \\"The Princess Bride\\". Wonderful performances are given by veteran actors Albert Finney and Jessica Lange. Look for the very touching bath tub scene, where, fully clothed, the love between Ed and Sandra is palpable. Albert Finney, in the role of the senior Ed Bloom, is exceptional as a raconteur of the first order. Ewan McGregor is remarkable as the charismatic, younger Ed Bloom, infusing the role with a joie de vivre that is as infectious as it is engaging.<br /><br />Jessica Lange is terrific as the senior Sandra Bloom, grounding her relationship with her husband with a steadfastedness born of years of mutual love and respect. Alison Lohman is simply lovely as the younger Sandra, imbuing her character with a beautiful sense of innocence and longing. It is interesting that both Alison Lohman and Ewan McGregor strongly resemble their more senior co-stars.<br /><br />Billy Crudup is excellent as the angry Will Bloom, the son who needs to reconcile his image of his father with the man his father actually is. Robert Guillaume is masterful in the small role of the senior Dr. Bennett. The rest of the stellar cast is superlative, though Danny DeVito's southern accent needed a bit more work. The direction, however, is deft, and the cinematography is brilliant. This is an absolutely exceptional film. I really enjoyed it immensely, even though I initially viewed this film most reluctantly, and only after much persuasion by my son. I am certainly glad that I did. This film has made me a fan of Tim Burton. It is filmmaking at its best. Bravo!ese twins.

B000KEG94C|5.0|This is a fantastic musical. From the beautifully designed sets, to the period costumes, to the show-stopping song and dance numbers, it will simply razzle-dazzle the viewer. The director and his singing and dancing troupe of stars simply pull out all the stops in this brilliantly executed musical.<br /><br />The film, which provides a cynical and satirical look at fame and fortune, centers in nineteen twenties Chicago around two murderesses, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger). Velma, who together with her sister, was a dance hall success, killed her husband and her sister when she caught them together en flagrante delicto. True to the maxim, however, that the show must go on, she goes on stage immediately after dispatching the two lovers, where she is promptly arrested.<br /><br />Roxie Hart, an admirer of Velma Kelly, is married to Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), a good-hearted, regular Joe, but she longs for tabloid fame and fortune. She begins to have an affair with a man who promises that he could get her a stage gig only to find that he lied just to get her in bed. So, she ends up killing him. Her long suffering husband stands by his little woman as she is trundled off to jail to await trial. There, she meets her idol, Velma Kelly, who finds her hero-worship annoying.<br /><br />In the jail, Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton (Queen Latifah) reigns supreme over the inmates, accepting bribes for favors. Velma Kelly, represented by star defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), is in tabloid heaven. Roxie Hart, longing to be in tabloid heaven as well, gets her husband to retain Billy Flynn on her behalf. Before she knows it, she, too, is in tabloid heaven, playing the media like a violin.<br /><br />The legal profession also gets a cynical slap in the guise of the slimy, fast talking Billy Flynn, who looks for the best selling point rather than for the truth. He understands the thirst of the media for the perfect sound-bite and he gives it to them. Guilty or not guilty, it doesn't matter. What matters to him, as a hired mouthpiece, is the media mileage he can get for his client, as well as for himself. To that end, he is the ventriloquist, and his client is no more than his dummy.<br /><br />The razzle-dazzle musical numbers move the story along. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrific, looking impossibly beautiful and showing off her musical theatre background to great advantage with \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"Cell Block Tango\\". Queen Latifah is outstanding as the sly and voracious Mama Morton, who goes whichever way the wind is blowing. She also has a show-stopping musical number, \\"When You're Good To Mama\\" that is simply memorable. Renee Zellweger, though not a professional singer or dancer, shows that she can sing and dance with the best of them.<br /><br />The men also shine in this musical. John C. Reilly, as Roxie's long-suffering husband, also has a terrific number, \\"Mister Cellophane\\", that is truly heart rending and poignant, as well as metaphoric. Richard Gere gamely rises to the occasion in his first musical, making the slick Billy Flynn character an integral part of the film with his \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" number and his tap dancing.<br /><br />I love this top notch, clever film, finding it hugely entertaining. It deserves every one of its six Academy Awards, including that for \\"Best Picture\\". Director Rob Marshall deserves kudos for this brilliantly directed, seamlessly edited, musical masterpiece. While it is a fairly faithful screen adaptation of Bob Fosse's Broadway musical, it has Rob Marshall's contemporary imprimatur on it. It is a film of which he can be justly proud. Bravo!hem.

B0007P0LPC|5.0|I first saw Fonteyn in a live performance in 1968.  Of course I had seen her on television but was not prepared for the impact of a theatre experience.I was stunned. She was dancing in Giselle with Nureyev. Their performance was sublime.  <br /> <br />Nureyev had transformed the role of the male dancer, but it was Fonteyn in my opinion who held the essence of ballet. So of course I bought this video as a record of her art.  <br /> <br />At first viewing I found the close up Nureyev a little narcisstic but this did not detract from the quality of the first act.  <br /> <br />I was overwhelemed with the dancing in act two and the rapport between Odette and Siegfried has never been matched.  Fonteyn's dancing is simple, precise, and without affectation. There is no over extension which one sees today and which  I find rather more suitable to the gymnasium then the stage. Her placement is extraordinary, the poise of her head and lovely port de bras that has even tho this day no equal. As an example see her in Les Sylphides in the Prelude solo (An Evening with the Royal Ballet) when just running her arms move as though there are no bones!   <br /> <br />Her first entrance captures the whole essence of the ballet. A swan queen who has been tranformed into a graceful young maiden. One is not aware of technique so wll absorbed is it into the whole performance; wonderful arabesques and balances culminating in the great pas de deux which should be mandatory viewing for any aspiring Odette. Not to be copied but as an inspiration for elegiac dancing. <br /> <br />In the third act Fonteyn subtley portrays the role of Odile-with flashing eyes and  and a different poise of her head.  After all Siegfried has to be able to recognise that this must be Odette, the woman to whom he has sworn undying love in act two. So Odile cannot be the complete opposite in character.  This Fontyen shows as no other.  Her solo dancing has just the right amount of speed and attack coupled with wonderful turns and balances. <br /> <br />In the final act we see the renunion of Odette and Siegfried and the glorious dancing and emotion builds to the tragic ending of Siegfired drowning in the lake and the hopelessness of Odette as she realises that all is lost.  <br /> <br />This version of the ballet is a complete blending of dance and dramatic interpretation of a timeless story and not to be missed by anyone who loves the magic of dance. <br /> <br />Francis J. Farrar

B00005JPCA|4.0|I can't wait to get the DVD. I love the Bond movies for their great escapism. I was skeptical of Daniel Craig as well. Wow! I was struck by how much talent is in this version. I think this is the first time I really felt James Bond - he wasn't just some figure going through action sequences, then gadgets, then women. Much praise for Daniel Craig! And the producers / writers/ director who took a chance and reinvented and reinvigorated this series! I really love that although they explore what Bond must \\"give up\\" in order to kill, it is not black and white. He may lose part of his soul, but not all - he still laughs, loves even after he accepts his \\"job\\". I hope the next film might explore the pleasure or good his job brings him. Why doesn't he walk away? Is it that he is good at it? He believes in \\"doing the right thing?\\" He doesn't think he can \\"go back\\"? I hope they continue to explore how messy the world has become - not just good vs evil or west vs east. I heard they are basing the next one on For Your Eyes Only. I think it was one of the strongest Roger Moore movies. Also, I love Judi Dench!
0743457900|5.0|A very complicated story with a protagonist that is unmatched in spy fiction.  First and perhaps the strongest in a trilogy of Smiley vs. Karla books.  A great read by a great author.
B00008RH3L|5.0|I adore films and I have to say that this is easily in my top five and quite possible my top three. Every single time I view it I appreciate it more and more. The casting is supurb. There is not a dry part in the film and all the actors truly flesh out their roles with meaty substance. The storyline is brilliantly written in that it has you guessing left and right who is loyal to who. That's the real subject of this mobster film...just who are your friends and where are they when you need them?  <br /> <br />It's not all dark and moody although there are moments like that throughout the film but there is a fair amount of amusing comedic scenes that keep the film's meter peppy. Along with the film's mood is the real star of the film...the dialogue. It may take several viewings to understand exactly what is being conveyed throughout the film (highly recommended!) but it is worth the effort to figure out the slang. Incredibly satisfying once you get it. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this film enough. If I taught a film class you could bet that this would be included based upon all the items I described. Excellent movie all around! I wish I could give it 6 stars. <br /> <br />
0684853523|4.0|More of a conversation, and less of a how to nuts and bolts text book. Think extended interview. Think Charlie Rose. How did you start?  What is the process like for you ? Its very entertaining and informative. If your looking for a quick fix on how to write, its not here. It never is. Talent and creativity comes on the back of hard work and persistence. You've heard it before, and you'll hear it again in the next book you read on writing.
B0000CDL93|4.0|Throughout its run of time,history,as we all know,has served both its very high points and its very low points. And,out of all of the very low points of history,one of those very low points continues to prove itself to be,by far,the assasination of John F. Kennedy. An assasination that left America in shame and grief with a lot of unanswered questions,people continue to ask unanswered questions about the JFK assasination--something that is resolved well throughout this film. <br /> <br />This film is focused around not only around the assasination of John F. Kennedy and the controversy that aroused from the assasination and tore America apart,but also the investigation that New Orleans,LA lawyer/judge Jim Garrison (portrayed brilliantly by Kevin Costner in this film)launched for the assasination. In this film,not only does director Oliver Stone do a brilliant job at showing the obcession that Jim Garrison had with the assasination and solving the assasination,as well as how Garrison's investigation of the assasination kept Garrison apart from his family and the effect that it had on Garrison's marriage to his wife,Liz Garrison (Sissy Spacek). This film portrays both sides of the investigation--the lawyers and politicians who helped Jim Garrison investigate the assasination and how they helped Garrison through his investigation of the assasination,as well as their theories/opinions on the investigation,and the criminals who were happy that the assasination had happened and showed their hatred of President Kennedy,while they were willing to do and say anything to make sure that the investigation was not solved and remained a cover-up. These scenes are as fascinating as they are(mostly)informative,with good information and good chemistry between the actors. For example,in scenes that feauture the character of Jim Garrison with a character like David Ferrie (Joe Pesci)or a character like Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon),good information on the assasination is brought into the conversations in the scene,while ideas about what could have caused the assasination are presented,as well. These scenes make this film as interesting as it is as a good film,with great chemistry in these scenes and great performances. These scenes are good additions in this movie alongside the other theories/facts from the assasination (what lead to Lee Harvey Oswald commiting the assasination,the problems that Jack Ruby's assasination of Oswald caused for the case and the things that happened to Ruby's life out of it,among others)which are fit into this film quite well and do a good job at carrying this film on until its very end,when you are given a depiction of the trial that Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones)faced and not only what got Shaw on trial,but also how Jim Garrison was able to answer some of the unanswered questions about the JFK assasination,and,of course,who murdered Kennedy and why Kennedy was murdered (with all of this being said,it is worth noting that President Lyndon B. Johnson's Warren Commision stated that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman and that the assasination was not part of a conspiracy,but that several people question the accuracy and honesty of that statement to this very day). <br /> <br />Overall,an interesting and good film that does a great job at answering the unanswered questions of the John F. Kennedy assasination,and provides a possible theory with the issues and questions of who was involved with the assasination and why the assasination was committed. This film is VERY long (three hours--just a word of warning to those of you who do NOT like sitting through long movies),but is well lead and followed by Oliver Stone to make itself worth its running time. Kevin Costner is brilliant as Jim Garrison and allows viewers to take a walk through the mind of Mr. Garrison himself with Costner's portayal as Garrison,which shows who Garrison was as a person and how his personality was a large part of the assasination,with a good cast ofsupporting actors (Gary Oldman,John Candy,Brian-Doyle Murray,among several others) who bring richly executed performances to the screen and help the film come to life,with a good understanding of their character brought into their performance,at the same time. If you are a fan of history and have always wanted to learn more about the John F. Kenendy assasination,\\"JFK\\" is the place to be,while this DVD has loads of great bonus feautures on it,as well.
6301955293|5.0|It's many years ago that I read McMurtry's \\"The Last Picture Show\\" and it was one of the reasons that he became ,and still remains, one of my favorite authors. When I came across this video,I thought it might be a quick review of the book for me. Well,was I ever pleasantly surprised.I can't remember too many of the details of the book and I had not seen the movie.Let me tell you right here ; the video is a classic and is able to do so much more than the book.I often find that I prefer \\"the movie to the book\\" and for these reasons: First, the sound track,then the sets and scenery,and then, the actors;particularly when they are your favorites. On top of that,you can sit back,soak it all up;and all in a couple of hours.<br />  I graduated from High School in 1954. I lived in a small town in Nova Scotia of about 5,000,and it was just 9 years after the end of WWII.That is important since it was an Army base town,and nearby Air Force bases as well as Navy bases in Halifax.Although the town had never suffered as much as many during the Depression,it was going through great changes.We had 2 Movie Theatres,each showing a Matinee and 2 Evening shows.You could see 6 movies a week and then there was the Drive In;or more commonly called the \\"Passion Pit\\".They've all been closed. You also gotta remember there was no TV then, and certainly no way you could watch  home movies. Movies were very cheap in those days,around 35 cents,hence very popular.Then there was the Pool Hall,better known as the \\"Academy\\". This was the focal point of the teenage boys and even some of the other guys about town .However,once grown into manhood and settled down;pool halls became a thing that got replaced by family,Golf club,or more \\"respectable\\" endeavors. You would never find a businessman,Doctor,or any other \\"upstanding member of the community\\" in the Pool Hall,but they had all frequented them in their youth.The Pool Hall , the Arena or the Diner was the first place you headed for when you wanted to find out \\"What's going on\\". Little wonder I relate so to this story. Like,I said; our town hadn't fallen on such hard times as Thalia,we were more akin to Peyton Place.<br />  Music was much more to us in those days and unbelievably,much of it is still being played.I was a big fan of Country and Popular.Here is where the video really shines.It is loaded with our favorite music in the background.

Like,I said; our town hadn't fallen on such hard times as Thalia,we were more akin to Peyton Place.     Music was much more to us in those days and unbelievably,much of it is still being played.I was a big fan of Country and Popular.Here is where the video really shines.It is loaded with our favorite music in the background.

B00001MXWX|5.0|I like this movie very much, I think it is so cool. It has not only space scenes, but also beautiful mountain and lake scenes.<br /><br />Initially, the android Data goes crazy and uncontrollable for a while, but then he is captured by Worf and his memory circuits are fixed.<br /><br />Picard briefly dances to the sound of latin american mamba. He meets an alien woman (from the \\"baku\\" people) who is 300 years old.<br /><br />So she considers Picard (who is about 60 years old) to be a very young man. Picard actually falls in love with her.<br /><br />Various jokes are told throughout the movie.<br /><br />For example, Will Riker shaves himself and his face becomes smooth as an \\"android's butt\\" :)<br /><br />Then Worf's hair start growing very long, because he is undergoing... puberty :)<br /><br />It is a real surprise to see F. Murray Abraham, whom I have remembered as playing a role in a movie about the past<br /><br />(the composer Salieri in AMADEUS), but I didn't expect to see him in a movie about the future.<br /><br />His face is covered with so much make-up, that he is almost unrecognizable.<br /><br />There is a conflict with the \\"sona\\" people, who want to exterminate the peaceful \\"baku\\" people.<br /><br />This is really ungrateful on the part of the \\"sona\\", becuase genetically, \\"sona\\" people are identical with the \\"baku\\".<br /><br />Of course, the Enterprise intervenes and prevents the \\"sona\\" from destroying the \\"baku\\", so there is a happy end.<br /><br />In short, I will watch this film many times again, because it is so much fun...
076781326X|5.0|I was thrilled to find this on dvd!  Growing up in children's institutions in upstate NY, we were taken to see this when it first came out.  It had an enormous impact on us.  I remember we used to act out as much of the movie as we could remember in the playground.  Just like Oliver, we took stong offense to anyone talking about our parents, who many of us did not know.  We all fought over who would get to play the artful Dodger.  I must have hummed many of these songs to myself hundreds of times over the past 30 years.  And now it all comes back  : - )  I was one big goose bump re-living all this! <br /> <br />Fagin is the kind of person children cherish and really need in their lives.  Ron Moody's Fagin perfectly epitomizes what is most missing in today's culture - empathy!  He is someone who takes the time to see the world through the eyes of children.  Ron Moody is truly a master of his craft.  It is just pure pleasure to watch him play Fagin and listen to him sing so beautifully. Dodger was who we as kids all wanted to be like.  An enormously confident and charming kid who holds his own with grown-ups. <br /> <br />Oliver! is a kid friendly movie that happily distances itself from today's endless materialism (agreeing with a previously made point).  Oliver is vulnerable but steadfastly defiant, standing up for what is rightly his.  It was so easy to see ourselves in his tattered shoes. <br /> <br />Finally, the soundtrack.  If you haven't done this, buy it.  Take it with you where ever you drive and bath yourself in these happy tunes.  I love nothing more than speeding off to work in the morning to Fagin's  \\"In this life, one thing counts, in the bank large amounts...\\"  : - ))) The cd is full of these memorable and uplifting songs. <br /> <br />Without a doubt my favorite movie!
B000A6T262|5.0|I actually purchased two sets of the Star Trek Motion Picture collection. Both were Christmas presents and were very well received by both. They were very surprised and very pleased.  <br /> <br />The two best features of the set were the added bonus features which both people enjoy very much, and the price. I saved 50% purchasing them from Amazon.com. This made it possible for me to afford both sets.  <br /> <br />Thank you
B000HEWEDK|5.0|It's nice to see a classic film like this in such a fantastic presentation.  Not only do you get 1 film and a wide array of informative special features, but you get a second feature film in the form of THE INVISIBLE BOY.
0375505091|4.0|A great book full of a wonderful collection of Leibowitz's photos. I highly recommend this book.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I was a big fan of this series when it was on the air, so it was an absolute no brainer to buy this set upon release.  Not only is the content great, but the packaging is amazing as well!  Looks great on the shelf, and the cost makes it easy to own all 7 seasons in one purchase rather than having to get each season separately.
B000J103YI|5.0|All I can said is WOW. The cast of \\"DreamGirls\\" really did an awesome job on this CD. Jamie singing \\"When I 1st Saw You\\" to me is one of the most beautifulest song i have ever heard. It makes wanting more. Beyounce what can you said about Ms. Beyounce. \\"Listen\\" proves the this girl can sing. Eddie can really sing he really can sing and sounds so good by then \\"I want to party all the time\\"(for you young poeple this was song Eddie did in the 80's). The song \\"Family\\" and \\"Patience\\" song we all need in this day and time. Jennifer with her powerful voice singing \\"And I am Telling You\\", \\"I Am Changing\\", \\"I Love I Do\\" and \\"One Night Only\\" makes you want to say AMEN! PRAISE HIM! But what makes the CD do so great for me is. I brought it before watching the movie and dont get me wrong i liked it but when I saw the movie and then listen to the soundtrack at work it made me feel like i was watching the movie in my mind all over again. MUST HAVE MUST HAVE MUST HAVE in your collection tust me. Thank You for reading my review and God Bles

B0000844I8|5.0|The movie that started it all - Anyone who loves SG1 needs to have this movie.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|Another great contribution for spiritual aspirants from James Redfield, adding visual reinforcement to his best selling Celestine Prophecy book. <br />Some deviation from the original story was a little off-putting at first, but on second review, I enjoyed the movie and was able to follow things better and gain much inspiration. I think that anticipating things in advance (I've read the book three times)was the problem for me, so if you have read the book, please approach the movie with an open mind. <br />I do believe, however that the film was very worthwhile and hopefully will attract people to the spiritual path, as did the book. <br />I look forward to any sequels, such as \\"The Tenth Insight\\" and \\"The Secret of Shambhala, which followed the book. <br />Very Inspirational.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen this year. Natalie Portman is fantastic in the part of Evie, caught in the web of government and anti-government plots and intrigues in a fascist future Britain. The movie is a subversive exploration of just how far governments might go to protect themselves. Not that the revolutionary V stops at much either. This one is a must-see.
B0007RT9LM|4.0|Just a warning that the unrated version includes nudity and a sex scene not shown on the rated release.  So don't buy it for a kid who loves the music and dancing.  The adults, on the other hand, will be happy.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Cars is an enjoyable movie even if you're not \\"into\\" racing.  You can almost see the actors in each car - there is so much personality.  The movie starts with a \\"If you're not a winner, you're a loser\\" (as Ricky Bobby would have said in Talladega Nights) theme that gradually changes to show children and adults that caring and friendship is much more powerful than being Number 1.  The cars and trucks will delight all children and the subtle, and not always so subtle, connections to real-life will have adults laughing on the floor.  For those who are \\"into\\" racing, you'll notice lots of similarities to real-life racing and commentator personalities.
B00065GX64|4.0|Filmed in 1931 this is the first serial killer movie...<br /><br />M is the story of a serial killer who terrorizes a German town. As you follow the story you get to see the city going mad, the hunt for the killer, the killer at work and then eventually Lorre fleeing for his life.. Before the killer strikes hes always whistling this haunting tune, very eerie. A blind man who sells balloons ends up using his keen observances and hearing of the whistling and putting 2 and 2 together...eventually aiding in his capture and bringing the killer to justice.<br /><br /> The imagery is haunting,the whistling is creepy and really grates on your nerves, the scariness is more of a what you dont see kind of deal  ... Ive also have heard this film somewhat models the story of German serial killer Peter Kurten aka the Vampire of Dusseldorf who in 1929 was commiting assaults and murders of children. Fritz denied the movie having anything to do with Kurten yet there is a similiarity between the film and the murders that occurred... though this could have been a coincidence.<br /><br />This is definitely an acquired taste.. Not for everyone<br /><br />But I have to say this...If you have a short attention span, dont buy this film.
B000H5U832|5.0|Received the DVD in perfect condition - and even before the scheduled delivery time. Great!
B000002UWE|4.0|I never heard of this band until recently and im a huge 80s fan but i was also born in the 80's. I must have missed these guys. As a reviewer said, they were a more 'obscure' band. I came across this CD as a recomendation and heard a bit of talk talk and bought it. The first thing I thought when I put this album in and started listening to it was this would be the CD you would want to play in the future if someone ever wanted to know what 80s music was like and the whole era itself. Its not just that but if you listen to the music and lyrics its more than just an 80s band. They actually have good songs and lyrics. My favorite tracks are Its my Life and Talk Talk. I recommend this CD to any fan of 80s music. They have a distinctive sound.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I've been a devoted fan of Enigma since the beginning and I believe this to be their best work yet. It actually moves me and transports me metaphorically speaking to ethereal and surreal distant places.  It inspires and captivates.  I was really surprised as I bought the album recently on a whim.  I also bought Jens Gad presents Le Spa Sonique which is also fantastic.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys great music.
B000002L5P|4.0|Ive heard of this band but never heard their music until about 6 months ago. I love 80's music, synth, light rock etc so I figured I would give this band a chance, get a couple of CD's and see what they were all about.<br /><br />When I first heard it I didnt know what to think. I knew they sounded different than any other band ive ever heard. As I listened to it I began to like it more and more. It grew on me.<br /><br />The lyrics are some of the smartest ive ever heard..I also purchased a Morrisey CD and was looking up some of the lyrics while listening to the songs and thought wow, this guy can write. I also see the reviewer said this was a Joy Division inspired band- that might have something to do with why the sound grew on me considering I love Joy Division. I definitely recommend this CD but as far as who would like this music I cant say. Its more of a mellow sound with contemplative lyrics.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Has there ever been a better metaphor for the challenges of uniting a family than this rag-tag band of emotionally bent gypsies pushing their ailing VW bus in order to get it going?  Times is tough for the Hoover clan, but somehow, miraculously, they make it.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear is faultless as the obsessively positive self-help guru wananabe, a homeless man's Tony Robbins.  Toni Collette is equally on point, here's a mom who serves dinner out of a box and empathy out of a scowl.  Secondary characters lift the level higher; Alan Arkin is hilarious as the smack-snorting gramps that coaches Olive in dancing and Dwayne in dating, his political incorrectness is simply inspiring.<br /><br />Writer Michael Arndt must be given high marks for this motley crew of characters.  Brother Frank, realized to perfection by Steve Carell of \\"The Office\\" fame, is a suicidal homosexual in danger of losing his title of world's leading Proust expert.  Dwayne, by contrast, is a teenage devotee of Nietzsche, consumed by hatred, strictly practicing a vow of silence. Watching their relationship evolve is particularly touching.<br /><br />As the bizarre events unfold, one knows that the payday will come at the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.  That said, when it does, you're still not ready for it.  Gramps, by now long gone, is so very alive in every bit of it.  It is uproariously funny, and very defiant too, mirroring Dwayne's rage.  Watching this family, and I use the word carefully, finding themselves on stage, for all the \\"perfect\\" world to see and ridicule, despise, and condemn - is joyful celebration.  A true \\"must see.\\"
B0006J28BO|4.0|Ongaeshi, or returning of the favor has often been the theme of Japanese folk tales such as The Return of Crane, Urashma Tarou (turtle returns Tarou a favor). Then what a cat saved from being hit by a car returns for the favor? To be a bride of the Cat Prince??<br /><br />The cat figurine called BARON of the WHISPER OF THE HEART was given another opportunity to save the fate and soul of unstable and troubled young schoolgirl.<br /><br />Studio Ghibli now tries to explore the new talent heir to giants like Miyazaki, Tahahata and late Kondo. At first I was surprised at the different character designs to which Ghibli fans get accustomed. Previous major Ghibli works were marked by character designs by late Yoshifumi Kondo an excellent animation maker loved both by Takahata and Miyazaki. So whichever director took the lead the character settings remain the same. Morita's designs is softer than that of Kondo and may suit the taste of current young adults.<br /><br />Morita got a nice and smooth start and I am glad to see there will be a bright future after aging Miyazaki and Takahata. I hope that I could see another film by Morita which set his own direction different from realistic Takahata, action-heavy Miyazaki.<br /><br />Verdict: Ghibli will be sure to have a new life after Great Elders.<br />Rating: 80 out of 100. Not yet on his own<br />Recommended for: Younger generation of anime fans.
B000HIVOFU|5.0|This CD is a must have for é different reasons: first, a very very interesting compilation of excellent artists, second for the exceptionnal recording quality, and this has become one of my favorite test CD. <br />A must have like I said.
B000006TSC|4.0|Good Album, easy to listen to but not inconsequential, I have also the original LP...
0446528056|4.0|Ok, Dear John was written by Nicholas Sparks, so I definitely enjoyed it. With that said, this wasn't my favorite novel of his. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there was something less than satisfying about the book, especially the ending (which I won't give away). However, I did particularly enjoy a few of the characters, and Mr. Sparks' books are always very readable. It's a good book, but if you're looking for something even better from Nicholas, go for \\"The Wedding\\" or \\"A Walk To Remember\\".
B000A59PMO|5.0|If you don't buy this, you are missing out.  It is a diamond in the rough.  Everything about this show is wonderful.  The characters have meat on their character bones.  The plot twists and turns and you never know what is around every bend.  Two thumbs way up.
B000LC55F2|4.0|I really enjoyed The Prestige.  I enjoy period movies and books especially those around the turn of the (last) century, so I was drawn to this movie.  I was interested to read the reviews to find out how others related to the film.  The plot was fascinating and the acting was excellent.  The storyline was well done as well.  Not really one feel good moment in the film, so if you are interested in that, look elswhere.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to those with a bent towards period pieces and the accompanying accents and outifts.  For me, this was a very enjoyable 4 star film.
0440241588|3.0|I got this book as a gift and thank goodness for that; it's just not worth buying! The story is simply bogus and it kinda goes backwards: you expect an outcome and the story just tries to build up to that outcome. There's very little in this book that could be considered interesting and the ending provides no closure whatsoever. This is my first John Grisham book and I have to say that I'm somewhat disappointed. I was expecting a full-fledged lawyer story with some tension and courtroom drama but there was none to be found. I recommend you pass on this one and get something else. I'll be keeping my hands off Grisham's book for a while...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a devout Browncoat.  Three cheers for those who understand what that means; if you don't it directly translates into, \\"Watch Firefly until your eyes melt\\".

0767802659|4.0|Like the earlier Young Guns, I first wrote this off as cute-teens-with-guns fluff - entertaining, but not up to Verhoeven's earlier stuff. But on repeated viewings (courtesy of TNT, which goes on ST marathons, it seems) this has a lot going for it. Verhoeven's satire is just as funny as Robocop, maybe not quite so macabre, but still biting. There's plenty of gore and thousands of people (and many more thousands of bugs) die horribly and graphically, but there's none of the really gross-out eyes-in-a-jar or spike-in-the-neck scenes of Robocop, or the face-melting, eye-popping of Total Recall. (Call me squeamish.) The uncomfortable truths of war - it's a good thing it's so horrible, lest we love it too much - are quite vivid and jarring, even if the gorgeous teens are always in the foreground - Ms Richards looking more fetching than I think I've ever seen her, even though she shows absolutely nothing in the final cut (and a fine lesson that is, too, at how less is more, though yes, I also fondly remember the shower scene). The battle scenes with the bugs are nasty and gross, while the space ships glide and explode in an eerie and graceful ballet. And the score - oh my. I can't get the music that's playing as they drop on Klendathu out of my head, ever. I'm probably the most horrible little coward and pacifist ever, but if that music was playing, I'd jump into the thick of it any day of the week. Ok, enough - it's a great movie on many levels.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Anyone who views comic book movies as merely an excuse to see some lame excuse for a hero traipse around tights and a cape for two hours with an array over the top gadgets while fighting ridiculously conceived villains has obviously never seen \\"V For Vendetta\\".<br /><br />Based on the popular graphic novel by Allan Moore, \\"V For Vendetta\\" offers a bone chilling view of futuristic London set in the year 2084, created by The Wachowski Brothers, the creative wizards behind \\"The Matrix\\".<br /><br />In the year 2084, the world is at great odds. War, disease, discrimination and violence are at an all time high, especially in the U.K., which is under the control of the sadistic Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) and his secret police. Citizens of London have no basic freedoms. They are oppressed by their totalitarian government, almost brainwashed to a degree. Little do they know, one man is out to change all that.<br /><br />That man is a masked agent going by the name of V (played magnificently by Hugo Weaving). Inspired by the legendary Guy Fawkes, V is thought of a terrorist by many, as his tactics often involve endangering lives and going to great extremes to achieve liberation. When V saves the life of working class girl Evey Hammond (the always captivating Miss Natalie Portman), V offers her a chance to join him on his crusade for complete freedom. Evey, despite her odd attraction to this masked avenger with a great taste in the arts, is reluctant. She is not sure whether to view him as a hero or to share the viewpoint of those who view him as the villain. But when Evey realizes just how much the government has brought suffering to her fellow citizens (not to mention the memories of the loss of her family), Evey realizes V is the only symbol of freedom left in the world. She joins V, even after he manipulates, tricks and tortures her, because she knows no matter what, his methods are the last chance the world has got.<br /><br />Backed by an excellent supporting cast, \\"V For Vendetta\\" is not only one of the finest comic book movies ever made, but also scores actual merits as a movie in general. The storyline, the acting, the direction, and special effects are all top notch, and make \\"V For Vendetta\\" one of the first great cinematic triumphs of 21st century cinema.<br /><br />This two disc special edition is loaded with a stunning array of drool-worthy extras, including several documentaries as well as secret access to Natalie's uproarious gangsta-rap from \\"Saturday Night Live\\". All these as well as the masterpiece that is the film itself make \\"V For Vendetta\\" a must have for anybody's dvd collection.porting cast, \\"V For Vendetta\\" is not only one of the finest comic book movies ever made, but also scores actual merits as a movie in general.

B00005JNS0|3.0|We end up owning the Pixar films on DVD, but still have seen every one in the theatre, and \\"Cars\\" was no exception.  My lack of interest in NASCAR didn't help my enjoyment, but the animation effects were amazing and eventually they got around to telling a story about life in the both the fast and slow lanes. Comparison to other Pixar films (\\"Finding Nemo\\", \\"The Incredibles\\" and the Toy Story films in particular), left \\"Cars\\" lacking something, storywise, in my view.

0385338694|4.0|I got this book based on the reviews alone and was'nt disappointed.  <br />I really enjoyed the story of the high stress lawyer who flees and becomes a domestic. It is a nice picture of how people in your life can make you more human and bring out a new side. Her romance with Nathaniel was sweet and I loved the revenge she gets on her old business partner who framed her.  <br />A fun fluffy book that is a quick read. You'll enjoy it

B00000IREA|5.0|With a script by Terry Southern, author of Candy, this is the ultimate floss on the icing, and a totally memorable movie masterpiece. A brilliant plot, unforgettable dialogue (\\"de-crucify the angel, or I'll melt your face\\"), incredible special effects, stunning performances by all concerned. Subtle, deep and multi-layered. Maverick mad scientist invents a WMD and plans to rule the galaxy! Defeated by innocence, incompetence, sweetness and excessive sex! Not forgetting a flashy fashion quick-change every few minutes. What outfits! Very influential, and one of the milestone highlights of movie history, the full recognition of its unique merits lies in the distant future; but some of us, with remarkable prescience, can actually see that far ahead. All those sad, dull dumbos, who think it is just silly and camp, bad and boring, will be positronically erased and forgotten as the years, the centuries, the millennia and the stars roll by. Who needs to wait for the 41st millenium with this dvd in their collection?
B000J103PC|2.0|I watched it but didn't care for it. <br />not one of Meryl's best.
B00003CXA2|2.0|This was mildly entertaining.  It just seemed like an excuse to play a lot of songs from the 1960's, and for baby boomers to reminisce about historical events in their lives (of which Gump was at all of them).  Why this won so many awards is highly questionable.  The only reason I can think of is that it's easy and not too controversial; it's the safe choice.  The Academy has been known to do that (remember the Crash and Brokeback Mountain controversy?).  Tom Hanks really didn't deserve an Academy Award here, not that he isn't a fine actor (he is), but because the performance is not particularly challenging.  It's a rather simple performance where he's just playing an \\"aw, shucks\\" kind of guy.  The special FX were really no big deal (even though the press told us they were), and look quite ordinary today.  Reportedly, the original novel was much more satritic and darker.  I should read it.  It's probably better than the film.
6305364613|3.0|It's a movie that has its crowd. I see how it may appear totally \\"rad\\", but the dialogue sounds absolutely ridiculous. The update of the context was well done, though, and would've worked very well. But the dialogue spoils it- it sounds like a very old-fashioned thing to say, even though I normally go for non-conventional movies- but it doesn't work. The BEST adaptation is without a doubt Franco Zeffirelli's, with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussy- utterly sublime, and intense enough even for its original context.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|This is a great album. It's very similar to Love and Theft, especially in its musicial diversity. The ballads, Spirit on the Water, Beyond the Horizon, and When the Deal Goes Down, are absolutely lovley. Deal is especially haunting and deeply moving, one of Dylan's greatest songs. It sounds like they could be sung by Hoagy Carmichael in the 1920's. Rollin' and Tumblin' and Thunder on the Mountain are great rockers. Rollin' and Tumblin' is a pseudo-remake of Muddy Waters's song. The chorus is the same, but Dylan wrote completely new lyrics for it. The final ballads on the album, Ain't Talkin' and Nettie Moore, are incredible as well. Dylan's band never ceases to amaze in their intensity and abilities. They rock harder than most bands half their age. This album has such a loose, real feeling to it. It's not slick, like most modern albums have a tendency to be. It sounds like it was recorded \\"live in the studio\\". Dylan actually gave an interview recently where he complained about the sound of modern CD's, and he has a point. A lot of it sounds too clean, which rock and roll was never supposed to sound clean. The man is 65, and he's still makin' great records. Is this one of Dylan's greatest? It's definitely up there. Who would have believed that Dylan would have a number #1 album at the age of 65? If anyone had said in 1986 that 20 years from now Dylan would have a #1 album (coming right after the release of the awful Knocked Out Loaded too), they would have been committed.

B00005JP9V|5.0|I went into Children of Men not knowing what to expect. To put it briefly, I loved it. At the same time, it's clear that it's not a movie for everyone.<br /><br />You will probably like it if you:<br /><br />-Like movies that make you think about big, uncomfortable ideas about politics and society<br /><br />-Are okay with watching violence and human suffering<br /><br />-Dig complex sets - there's a lot to look at here, and some information is conveyed only through what's going on in the background<br /><br />-Seek movies that leave you feeling pensive/melancholy at the end (it's been a while since I've been at a film where the audience sat in stunned silence at the end, and that mood stuck with me for a few hours, which I much prefer to seeing something and then forgetting it an hour later)<br /><br />You will probably not like it if you:<br /><br />-Go to movies to relax/escape<br /><br />-Want a certain level of predictability - this film is great at keeping you off balance<br /><br />-Don't like Clive Owen - I don't know who would fall in this category (I think he's fabulous) but if you can't stand him, stay away!<br /><br />-Like sci-fi for the lore/creation of a complete alternative universe - this film plunks you down in the middle off a crumbling world with little explanation and leaves you with not much more explanation at the end, which I was fine with (I'm not usually a sci-fi/fantasy person) but may bother those who are drawn more to the 'world of the future' aspect and less to a small set characters and their experiences in that world<br /><br />Frankly, I'm sad that this film seems to have been overlooked by the year-end awards - the acting and directing are both amazing, and it's rare to watch something that evokes such a complex blend of thoughts and emotions.
0380713802|5.0|While Bryson does offer some historical context for the places he travels (especially in relation to WW II), whether you like this book or not depends far more on your sense of humor.  There's very little dialogue and almost no social interaction outside of Bryson dealing with travel logistics- getting bus tickets, checking into hotels, ordering dinner.  Personally, though, his dry/goofball/neurotic sense of humor made me laugh out loud time after time, and I found myself more surprised during short passages where he was relatively serious than the relentless humor.  Only if you're obsessed with political correctness, he may offend you, but he is democratic in his targets, and even pokes fun at himself (for example, describing his temper tantrum in Sweden after having to pay for a failed phone call).<br /><br />Some specific examples include him describing the cow as the perfect pet, a slapstick scene involving the meatballs rolling out of his sandwich (\\"like sailors abandoning a burning ship\\"), a woman on the train who \\"looked as if she hadn't smiled since 1937 and who spent the entire journey watching me as if she had seen my face on a wanted poster\\", and another train ride when he was \\"spreading out the map on my knees in its full crinkly glory, to the undisguised irritation of the old lady next to me, who hoomphed her bosom and made exasperated noises every time a corner of paper waggled in her direction.\\"
B000HCO83Q|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />In the first two \\"X-Men\\" films, perceptive viewers could easily detect the \\"pro-gay rights\\" subtext that ran through the storyline about a race of superpower \\"mutants\\" let loose on the world and the debate over their place in society.  The latest installment, \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" takes the issue a step further by proposing a complex moral dilemma: should the \\"mutants\\" be encouraged to partake of a supposed \\"cure\\" for their condition or should they be proud of who they are and not change merely to placate a society made uncomfortable by their presence?<br /><br />Unfortunately, even though \\"The Last Stand\\" raises this intriguing ethical issue, it really doesn't do anything all that interesting with it.  The main problem is that the screenplay simply fails to come up with a character commensurate with the movie's theme.  In fact, there are so many mutants running around that none of them is ever able to grab the center of the movie's attention or the focus of the audience.  Storm, Wolverine, Phoenix, Iceman, Rogue etc. all have their individual moments but they are soon crushed under the weight of overblown actions scenes and over-the-top special effects.  Only Ian Holm's evil Magneto has a chance to break through all the pyrotechnics and create some impact as a character.<br /><br />I loved the original \\"X-Men\\" when it came out in 2003 precisely because it felt so bold and daring in its willingness to explore social issues along with all the CGI effects, stunt work and explosions that are par for the action film genre.  But the two follow-up editions have not lived up to those expectations.  I'm sorry to say that, despite all the technical fireworks of the grand finale, the \\"X-Men\\" series ends not with a bang but with a whimper.
B000LPS3B2|4.0|\\"Shutter\\" at first appears to be highly derivative of certain popular Japanese horror films (and to some extent it is), but it brings enough to the table to stand on its own merits and provide a thoroughly enjoyable horror experience.  While the formula of \\"protagonist is terrorized by the insatible ghost of a creepy looking, long-haired asian woman\\" seems to have been repeated ad nauseum in the last couple of years, \\"Shutter\\" provides a more coherent plot than some other recent supernatural movies and delievers an ending that is neither painfully obvious halfway through the film nor so obtuse that you'll have to check a FAQ to figure out what exactly it's getting at.   <br /> <br />\\"Shutter\\" provides a creepy atmosphere throughout and pulls of its big scares quite effectively.  Furthermore, the scares are legitimately scary, presenting the viewer with genuinely unnerving moments rather than wallowing in gore.  At one point the director has opted to show a collage of real (such as they are) ghost photos as the protagonist searches for an explanation for the mysterious apparitions that have begun appearing in his own pictures.  This is a very minor detail, but somehow a quite satisfying one.  <br /> <br />I'll admit that it's difficult for me to render a verdict on the acting because it's in Thai, but the characters are interesting and there aren't any performances that detract from the story.  Indeed I have very few gripes with the film. Of the Thai horror films that I've seen, \\"Shutter\\" is easily at the top of the (somewhat small) heap.  All things being equal, I would say this movie is at least on par with the current benchmark of imported asian horror, \\"Ringu\\". <br />  <br />The only thing that really hurts the movie at all is that some parts will seem like stuff you've seen before if you've seen very many asian horror movies.  (Or if you've seen \\"The Grudge 2\\", in which case you'll have seen a scene pretty much taken straight out of \\"Shutter\\".)  This feeling ofwalking down a familiar path is why \\"Shutter\\" doesn't get 5 stars, but the surprising quality of the journey is why it gets 4.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|In the mold of other gangster films, like 'Scarface' and 'Goodfellas,' Scorsese delivers more than a feather in his ample directing cap with his brilliant new movie, 'The Departed'. Featuring an all-star cast, 'The Departed' hits the ground and never stops running. Jack Nicholson is at his ruthless best as the Irish mafia figurehead, Costello. Menacingly funny, he delivers one of his most unforgettable performances with the steely subtlety that has made him a legend. Everyone else puts in their brawling best, especially Di Caprio as the tough, but nervous Billy Costigan, an undercover cop pretending to be Costello's prodigy hitman, and Mark Wahlberg as the tough as nails police administrator, Dignam. And they deliver this masterpiece without needing any help from Joe Pesci or Robert DiNero. Amazing!  <br /> <br />The movie starts us off with the ruthless Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the Italian head of Boston's Irish mafia. Extorting money anywhere from local greasy spoons to government operations with sensitive weapons' information, Costello makes Don Carleone seem like Mr. Rogers. We first witness a harrowing extortion scene at a neighborhood Boston restaurant during the sixties. By sharing the extorted loot with a destitute young neighbor boy, Collin Sullivan, he takes upon him a future prodigy (Matt Damon). In his pocket at the time of Sullivan's police academy graduation, Costello finds the perfect rat to work undercover in the Boston Police Department. Sullivan proves to be a savvy informant, brilliantly juggling his responsibilities as a quick, ascending officer, while bailing out the Irish mafia via cell phone. In the meantime, the police have their own well-disguised rat in Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) who convincingly wins Costello over as another promising hitman. Costigan finds it hard to stomach all the carnage this organized crime unit masters, and it is to everyone's credit that edgy seems to be a trite description for what Costigan witnesses. (One particularly unnerving scene is when Costello shows Costigan a severed hand from a victim's body bag.) How both rats tip-toe through their harrowing treason is one of the masterstrokes of playful suspense throughout this clever flick! Ironically, police chief Oliver Queenan (Martin Mall) is characteristically clueless like most of the leaders when he says, \\"We deal in deception. We don't deal in self-deception.\\" There's a lot for both sides to figure out in the film's cat and mouse (rat!) equation. The resolution of this twisty movie should all but satisfy even the hardest core Mafioso movie fans.  <br /> <br />Nicholson is unrelentingly as the silver-tongued devil, Costello. And DiCaprio gives an inspired performance as the nerve-wracked, beleaguered Costigan. Damon and Wahlberg have seldom been better as the tough-as-nails cops. It is brilliant how DiCaprio's and Damon's characters intersect so long without crossing each other's paths. Their dating interest is for a woman psychiatrist (Kristen Dalton) who brings both men together. Not only effective as a plot device, it creates a fascinating tension to the movie. Ironically, the plot is both complicated, yet easy to follow. Unlike many similar interlocking plot stories, this one is intricate enough to be fascinating, while seldom taxing its audience. The editing, which nowadays is taken for granted for slick professionalism, is just perfection. How Scorsese cuts and focuses, then backs up makes frenetic a lame description. The dialogue is intelligent: menacing, yet quick and witty. Without spoiling the movie, the film seems to comment on the excess of rats everywhere, and what seems to be implied by the departed is the body of secrets they take with them to their graves. For all its suspense and hijinx, 'The Departed' is probably the most thoroughly entertaining gangster venue since 'Pulp Fiction'.  <br />

B00006ADD5|1.0|Amazon's rating engine is stupid, stupid, stupid.  I've added this rating for the single-disc edition of Lawrence of Arabia, but the review appears for all versions of the movie.  So let me clarify: my single star has nothing to do with the quality of Lawrence of Arabia; it's one of my favorite movies.  I purchased the single disc edition and found that my DVD player couldn't decode the content from chapter 52 on.  This is because the content had to be so heavily compressed to fit on a single DVD that ... it just didn't work.  I know it's an additional $20 for the dual-disc version of this film, but, since the single-disc edition doesn't work in the first place, if you're going to buy Lawrence of Arabia, you'll find the additional money worthwhile.

B000HVHM5S|5.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" is a highly intelligent, fascinating and ambitious movie. The filmmakers present a story that dares to be thought provoking, unsettleing, and inspiring all at once. A cautionary tale which shows a disturbing future where it may not only be possible but all too easy for a liberal democratic society to willingly give up its freedoms and embrace a fascist ideology.    <br />  To make such a film was courageous. Presenting a movie about a terrorist/revolutionary in this day and age of extremist violence entailed risk. It's a compelling, character-driven story that functions on many levels. A suspense thriller, a mystery, a political film and an action movie. The plot causes the viewer throughout to question whether violence is justified, whether the end justifies the means, and the definitions of terrorism, revolution and heroism. <br />  Captivating moviemaking and splendid performances by all members of the cast, especially Hugo Weaving as \\"V\\" who was nothing short of brilliant (his inspiring speech at the TV station alone is worth the purchase of the DVD), Natalie Portman, Stephen Rea as well as the cinematic irony of having John Hurt in the role of a power-mad maniacal dictator considering the fact that he played the part of a character who questioned the actions of an opressive government in the film 1984. <br />   The plot changes and twists as the story unfolds are unique to this film. This movie presents things NEVER attempted in any other movie. A truly remarkable motion picture.
0679731725|5.0|Kazuo Ishiguro's novel THE REMAINS OF THE DAY is the story of Stevens, the butler at a large English house in Oxfordshire from the early 1920s to 1956, the time that the book opens. When his new employer, a newly rich American who now owns the estate, returns to his home country for a few days, he tells Stevens he should travel a bit within England. Stevens sets off on a journey to the West Country, intending to visit one Miss Kenton, his colleague on the house staff for many years before the war. While he travels Stevens, who narrates the novel in first person, recalls the whole breadth of his career.<br /><br />The dialogue that Ishiguro writes for Stevens, the formal and business-like responses of the servant, is remarkably convincing. It is strict and unemotional and yet never becomes tiring to read. And the overt issues of the novel, such as the difficulty of reconciling work and personal life, and the great changes England went through during these decades are very engaging for the reader. While early reviews praised THE REMAINS OF THE DAY but questioned how much readers outside of England would get from the novel, I think that anyone with a basic knowledge of the country's history will appreciate the dramatic scope of years in Ishiguro's book.<br /><br />But what is special about THE REMAINS OF THE DAY is its unreliable narrator. Stevens, so wrapped up in ideas of duty and dedication, speaks much about his career but little of the actual events that he has gone through. His love for Miss Kenton is deduced only through the actions and words of characters around him. Nor does Stevens give any judgement on the men he serves, for the shady dealings of his former employer are revealed only in passing as Steven recalls a young man who often visited the house. The novel is beautiful and entertaining on the first read, but it rewards rereading, for one can find instances where Stevens is not being honest about some crucial matter.<br /><br />I was impressed by THE REMAINS OF THE DAY.

B00005OBR8|4.0|This disc of two Luciano Berio works in performance by the Orchestre National de France and Pierre Boulez was originally released on Erato in 1986. Thankfully, Warner Classics reissued it at budget price in 2001 in their \\"Apex\\" line, a bargain which the contemporary music afficionado should seek out. As you shall see, I do not think this disc has the best performance of a key Berio work, but nonetheless it has much to recommend itself.<br /><br />\\"Sinfonia\\" for eight voices and orchestra (1968-69) is one of Luciano Berio's greatest works, vast in its proportions and in the musical traditions it incorporates. The eight voices are meant to be jazz singers, and Berio wrote the piece for the Swingle Singers, who appear here in a later lineup. The first two movements are quiet and mysterious. In the first, the singers gently intone selections from Levi-Strauss' retellings of Brazilian myths, made so vague that only the phonetic properties matter. In the second movement \\"O King\\", an orchestration of an earlier independent work, the singers slowly build up to the name \\"Martin Luther King\\", who had been murdered the year before.<br /><br />The third movement of \\"Sinfonia\\", the extroverted \\"In ruhig fliessender Bewegung\\", is the most famous. The skeleton of the work is the second movement from Mahler's \\"Resurrection\\" symphony, a little cut-up and reordered. Over this, Berio has a tenor reciting text taken mainly from Samuel Beckett's \\"The Unnamable\\" and Berio's own journalistic writings, and the orchestra responds with quotations from fifteen composers. For example, when the narrator uses the term \\"the lowing cattle, the rush of the stream\\", we hear part of Beethoven's \\"Pastorale\\" symphony, while a singer's cry \\"This is nothing but an academic exercise\\" is ironically accompanied by music by Hindemith. Every listener has his own favourite part of this movement, mine is when the narrator says \\"I have a present for you\\" and the orchestra responds with that big tutti chord that opens Boulez' \\"Don\\" (which is to say \\"Gift\\").<br /><br />The fourth and fifth movements return to a subdued tone. The fourth brings back Levi-Strauss references and is rather brief. But for all my initial passion about the third movement, I find it is the fifth which is the most intriguing and satisfying. Originally \\"Sinfonia\\" was written in four movements, but after the first performance, Berio was unhappy that these four movements were not reconciled to each other. In the fifth movement he subsequently wrote, therefore, we hear references in the form of quotation and harmonic development to the original four movements, a savage mix of voices, confused percussion, and threatening trombones a la Per Norgard's fifth symphony. A splendid end to a massive work.<br /><br />For a long time, this was *the* recording of the \\"Sinfonia\\" to have. However, I must say I find it superseded by that on Deutsche Grammophon in the \\"20/21\\" series, where Peter Eotvos leads the Goteborgs Symfoniker. In the third movement, Eotvos keeps it going at a very nice clip, creating a dizzying parade of images. Boulez, on the other hand, keeps things quite slow; if one has already heard the Eotvos recording, terms like \\"molasses\\" come to mind. Also, Ward Swingle's narration, while it might have worked for Berio in forty years ago, now makes this sound like a dated '60s happening, and the Eotvos performance Nonetheless, Boulez's handling of the other four movements is quite fine, and I certainly invite Berio fans to get this.<br /><br />The liner notes for \\"Sinfonia\\" consist only of Luciano Berio's own programme note, which covers all the basics.

B00005JPAD|5.0|The plot of The Departed basically a question of \\"find the mole.\\" Jack Nicholson plays Frank, the head of an Irish organized crime unit in Boston. His protege Colin, played by Matt Damon, has joined the police force and works as a detective. Not to save the world, mind you, but to fish out information for the mob and prevent Frank from being arrested. On the other side of the law is Billy Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Billy comes from a family who has a history of ties to the mob, but Billy wants to put that behind him and join the police force. His shady past, however, makes him a better candidate for being an undercover informant. So there you have it. Two moles on two different sides of the law. Who will catch who first?<br /><br />The Departed is visually stunning, as any Scorsese fan will tell you is to be expected, but besides that it's enthralling. The characters are richly drawn and the emotions run high in this crime drama/thriller. It's also a story with so many twists and turns it was hard to keep up. At several times I thought the movie was about to end and then, nope, here comes another twist and the story goes on. It was great and multi-faceted. I think anyone who likes well-planned crime capers, and films about organized crime will love The Departed. With its all star cast and big name director, I wouldn't have expected anything less than perfection. It's nice that I wasn't disappointed.

All are collected, along with a bunch of bonus tracks and promos, in this 19-disc, 66-song set.  <br /> <br />Nineteen discs? Yep, that's the way they've put it together, in replica sleeves with the artwork from the original releases. It's an interesting gimmick, but for me, the question is always what's in the grooves. I remember picking up the band's first American release, Give `Em Enough Rope, in January, 1979, and being blown away by the fiery guitar-driven power and righteous lyrical anger of songs like \\"Safe European Home,\\" \\"English Civil War,\\" and \\"Tommy Gun.\\" It was a ferocious antidote to the faceless stadium rock and mindless disco of the time. For the next couple of years, they reclaimed rock and roll by bringing in large dollops of reggae, a touch or two of cocktail jazz, rude boy funk, Bo Diddley simplicity and a heaping helping of blazing three-chord electricity.  <br /> <br />Many of the group's best songs are included here: \\"London's Calling,\\" \\"(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais,\\" \\"Clampdown,\\" \\"Lost in the Supermarket,\\" \\"This is Radio Clash,\\" the semi-hit \\"Train in Vain\\" and the actual hits, \\"Rock the Casbah\\" and \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go.\\" Joe Strummer's mushmouthed singing is still going to be a hard-to-acquire taste for many, but the range these guys covered in a very short time remains impressive. ­ <br /> <br />copyright © 2007 Port Folio Weekly/Jim Newsom.

B000AARKOO|4.0|Stacked up against \\"Troy\\" and \\"Alexander,\\" Ridley Scott's look at the Crusades holds up the best of the trio. First off, he seems to be taking the least liberties with the history of events here. (Even if you want to refer to legends as history.) Orlando Bloom, who seemed to do little more in \\"Troy\\" than look like a chick magnet for Helen, has a lot more to do here and carries himself well as the unwilling action hero. The battle scenes are terrific (as you would expect from Scott's exceptional \\"Gladiator\\").<br /><br />What really carries \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\" is the supporting cast. Liam Neeson gives his role as Balian's father gravitas, Kings Baldwin (Edward Norton, who does receive recognition in the DVD's credits) and Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) offer the moral center with Tibereus (Jeremy Irons) as the pivot between the good of these men versus the blood-hungry Knights Templar as well as the more eager generals among Saladin's forces.<br /><br />Detriments? Well - there are a couple. The sole two female characters here serve no real purpose other than to give the men something to move the plot along with. Saladin has a sister who appears long enough to get captured and (since you never see anymore of her other than Reynaldo {Brendan Gleeson} tearing away her veil) have something awful done to her. Eva Green seems to exist as the Queen of Jerusalem merely to add a love triangle. \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\" is a guy movie, and the fight scenes outweigh the need for female character development. But Scott is too good a director for that, so all the warriors, good and bad, operate at a level other than spouting lines before battle.<br /><br />The moral compass of this movie is also solid. While some reviews here are argumentative about Saladin being \\"such a good guy for a Muslim,\\" a movie like this (or \\"Troy\\" and \\"Alexander\\") can't work without the leaders being noble, even as the underlings plot around them. If we weren't at war, would the movie still look the same? My guess would be yes. The idiots that are too full of themselves to look at reality would still march off and get slaughtered, Jerusalem would have still fallen (even if historically the surrender was bloodier and more costly - Saladin reputedly took the wealthier of Jerusalem's citizens for ransom before allowing them 'safe passage' out), and the good guy would still get the girl. If the movie's end proves anything, we are still gullible to our own fanaticism; Richard The Lionhearted rides off to attempt to reclaim Jerusalem for the crown and the cross.<br /><br />One of 2005's best, and I have a feeling \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\" will gain in stature as the years pass.s that are too full of themselves to look at reality would still march off and get slaughtered, Jerusalem would have still fallen (even if historically the surrender was bloodier and more costly - Saladin reputedly took the wealthier of Jerusalem's citizens for ransom before allowing them 'safe passage' out), and the good guy would still get the girl.

B00005A8MA|5.0|I first listened to this record as an undergraduate and I was hooked the moment I heard the lush blues vocal stylings of John Mayall and his loose but engaging blues rock band. There are superb performances by Eric Claption and Sugarcane Harris and even Mick Taylor, another alumnus of John Mayall's blues bands of the mid sixties. The songs are great, mellow and hip sounding, with lyrics that are filled with interesting messages. I really enjoy this record, and if you enjoy British Blues music, this one must be a part of your collection. John  Mayall also includes bonus tracks, which are are overdubbed versions of a few of the original recordings. He re records some vocals and drums on the original multitrack recordings, to polish them up abit, modernize them. They are fun to compare and listen to. Great record!!

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I love when the Bond movies break the traditional format and remain true to the Fleming novels. The Screen Writers did a great job of updating and adapting the Cold War based novel \\"Casino Royale\\" to the 21 century.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is a great Bond. Yes, he does not look like what would be considered a normal Bond but his acting makes up for that. He is much more intense than the previous actors who played the character. Some people thought he was not suave enough in this movie. However, these people must understand that EON has restarted the series. Craig is signed on for 3 movies and during these films he will develop more and more into the classic agent we all know. Already by the end of this film he was more Bond-like. Also, the Craig movies will all connect to each other and continue the storyline, unlike the previous Bond movies. EON says they will continue to develop Bond's complex personality.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was superb as well. Mads Mikkelsen played the villain, Le Chiffre. What I liked best about this villain is that he was not over-the-top evil. He was a more realistic \\"bad guy\\". Eva Green played the Bond girl Vesper Lynd. She is my favorite Bond girl of the 21 films. Her character was much more intriguing and complex than any previous Bond Girls. Craig and her had good chemistry. Judi Dench is M. This is her fifth appearance as M but this time she is not quite the same as in the Bronson films. In Goldeneye, she was the new one on the scene who felt that Bond was a relic of the Cold War. In this film, Bond is the new one on the scene and she is the relic of the Cold War. I liked Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter and I hope he is in the next movie.<br /><br />Casino Royale is the longest Bond film to date (Approx. 2 and a half hours) but it keeps a fast pace. The action scenes are some of the grittiest and intense of the 21 films. The stunt work is amazing. EON decided to back away from CGI and the crazy gadgets in favor of a more believable adventure. The director Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) did a great job and I hope he directs the next movie too.<br /><br />I am excited about the 2 disc set. The biggest reason is because the cast really did not promote the movie on the talk show circuit, so I am looking forward to hear what they have to say about the film.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I highly recommend Casino Royale. If you thought Die Another Day was a major disappointment or if you have stopped watching Bond movies, you should give this one a chance.re believable adventure.

0307237699|5.0|They say you can't judge a book by it's cover.  How about by its title?  Audacity of Hope.  That's exactly what this refreshing book is.  It is the complete thought process of someone who dares to hope for something better.  Mr. Obama shares his experiences and his hopes in a way that not only makes you understand how he has arrived at them, but in a way that makes you say YES!  I found myself saying YES over and over, and rather you agree with his ideas I think you owe it to yourself to learn more about this charasmatic leader.  He has done something very few politicians have ever done.  He is candid and thought provoking. He lays out a very clear picture of who he is.  It was informative, enjoyable, and thought provoking.

B00005JPKC|5.0|\\"Letters From Iwo Jima,\\" Clint Eastwood's companion piece to \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" released earlier in the year, is easily the best movie of the year ('06). I think \\"Letters\\" edges \\"Flags\\" as the better movie, simply because, unlike \\"Flags\\" this film, from the Japanese prospective, does not focus on the aftermath of the soldiers who fought in the war, but rather the war itself. Not that \\"Flags\\" is flawed for its approach, far from it - it is interesting, powerful, and mostly original in that it explores its subject on a political level - but \\"Letters\\" proves that a war movie is most effective and powerful when if focuses on the war - and those involved in it - itself.     \\"Flags,\\" if you recall, was more about the three soldiers who raised the American flag on the Japan's island of Iwo Jima during WWII after our country's victory there, and their return home touted as heroes only to become pawns in our government's agenda to sell war bonds in order to finance further action in the war. I found that film very interesting from the standpoint that I never knew there was such a push to sell these bonds because our country was running out of money to finance the war; and I loved Eastwood's expert direction of the battle sequences (the best in maybe any war movie I have ever seen - and that's a big list). But the film felt like it could have been shorter by 20 minutes and you also kind of saw where it was going early on.     \\"Letters,\\" by contrast, is a far more effective study of the war and the human beings involved in it. The story, constructed around letters unearthered from destroyed Japanese bunkers on Iwo Jima (which were also the basis for novel upon which this film is based), is a far-more in-your-face allegory for the traumas of war. The film makes the point that it makes no difference if you are Japanese or American, we are all the same and all have mothers and families that do not want to see us die just because our country deems the cause worthy.     The movie takes a half hour or so to get going - introducing us to the few soldiers we will follow through the battle - but after that the film takes off in the way \\"Flags\\" seemed like it might, but only ultimately did in brief flashbacks. In \\"Letters\\" the battle is the story and the character studies and background are the flashbacks. In \\"Letters\\" we see why the American soldiers in \\"Flags\\" entered Japanese bunkers only to find soldiers who had exploded themselves with hand grenades, and why, even though the Japanese had the advantage of cover and surprise, the Americans were still able to overcome them. Out-gunned, under-manned and lacking in supplies, troops, and ammo, the Japanese fought a war they knew they could not win, but did so because they were taught it was the honorable thing to do. There is no mention of Pearl Harbor or what got Japan, and us for that matter, involved in WWII, but you can't help but think that none of this would have been necessary had they not made the mistake of attacking that navel base in Hawaii. The Japanese troops don't necessarily agree with what their empire did, but they know they have no choice but to defend it. To die doing so is considered honorable. Eastwood presents the parallels between those troops and those ideals and our own as a heartbreaking and unfortunate product of cultural beliefs and perspectives.     Some have said this film (and \\"Flags\\") is slow and doesn't tell us anything we don't already know about this war - or war itself.  These viewers are missing these film's two major most points and assets - precisely what makes them so great and original.  First, neither film was ever intended or promised to be a big, bloody war action flick.  They are not really about the war.  They are about men and the effects of war, both during and after, both on them and their loved-ones (although, how many of us did know about the political games played with soldiers in the name of selling war bonds?).  Both films have those grandiose war sequences to be sure (and they are some of the best captured on celluloid - especially in \\"Flags\\"), but these movies are about the soldiers themselves.  Second, Eastwood is not a \\"slow\\" director.  He is a minimalist and simplistic director who understands that to create mood and atmosphere is far more important to a film's impact that than bombastic action sequences.  In all of his movies from \\"Unforgiven,\\" to \\"Mystic River,\\" and \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" to these epics, Eastwood crafts a stark mood from stark settings and stark characters.  The sense that something devastating is going to happen gradually tightens around the viewer like a noose.  When violence does occur it is shocking, disheartening, and meaningful, and its impact is felt ten times more than watching soldier after soldier get shot on a battlefield. Want proof?  Just look at this film's last shot. It is of simply a beach and the sound of the waves gently rolling over the sand.  This one, simple image puts a lump in the viewer's throat because they have just seen all the chaos and devastation that occurred there.  And for what?  All is silent now.  All the individual names and deeds are forgotten.  Clint says all that with one simple, quiet image.      Eastwood's films are not about the violence itself, but the effects of it.  And as such, all the films mentioned, have been fascinating and emotionally charged character studies.  In that respect, \\"Letters\\" may be his finest masterpiece. Clint has emerged as the best director of this current generation.  That says something considering the guy's career has spanned several generations.      But it is true, \\"Letters\\" won't play well to most of today's ADD-afflicted movie-goers, and that's a shame considering with its length and subtitles the film will already be a tough sell even to it's intended audience.  However, it is a far better movie than say, \\"Dreamgirls\\" and other fine, but overrated films this year that seem destined to eclipse this moviecome Oscar time. But if there is any justice, \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" will be Eastwood's next Oscar winner. At the very least, it deserves to be seen. I saw it with three other people and it sparked an hour long conversation about life, war, and filmmaking.     If that isn't a sign of a great movie, I don't know what is.
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins and crew have spent many years doing research into what makes companies \\"Good to Great\\" and how to be \\"Built To Last\\".  They collated data on hundreds of companies and claim to have \\"discovered\\" the characteristics that made the companies great.  I admire their work ethic and the challenge they overcame in collecting this data!    The data alone is worth the price of the book.      What bothers me, is that, what they spent years trying to discover was more thoroughly and succinctly documented in books written BEFORE they began their research!  OUT OF THE CRISIS by Edward W. Deming hits all the points the Collins books found AND more.  The price of the Deming book in 1982 = $50.      What Collins did was a good thing.  We now have data to support our theories.  But, to claim he found all the answers and that the answers were found in analysis of the data is ridiculous!    Jim has created a consulting business out of his research and is making a fine living for himself.      Jim's books are definitely worth reading, but copying Good To Great methods will not work unless we understand and adopt the philosophical underpinnings behind the success in the unique way that fits our own companies culture.    One point that particularly annoys me is the role of \\"blind luck\\" with respect to business success.  Is it possible that the good to great companies are not just the tail of a normal distribution?  If this is so, then we are studying the characteristics of \\"normal\\" companies and aspiring extra normal significance to their performance.

B00005JPDY|4.0|The Good Shepherd has a quiet intelligence about it, making subtle and interesting points about the human condition -- about trust, sexuality, intimacy, and rationalization. To be sure, it has it's flaws. It's a bit on the long side -- it could lose half an hour and be a better film for it. Although Matt Damon's performance is unusually understated and his character only marginally sympathetic, it's a riveting turn nonetheless. He's one of those smart, quiet \\"clerks\\" whose emotions lie buried and whose ruthless intelligence makes him capable of just about everything except meaningful human relationships.
B00005JPKC|5.0|I think that this film is a great triumph for Mr. Eastwood. It is a beautiful and moving film which shows the brutality of war on many levels. It is possibly one of the best war movies ever made, and also incredibly different from any other war movie. You can not help but be moved by the plight of the men - they are facing inevitable defeat. Whether or not this defeat is warranted is never addressed here. The movie does not touch into Japanese atrocities that started the war, but it does give a clear glimpse of the military imperialism that sent these men to inevitable death or imprisonment.  <br /> <br />Ken Watanabe is superb in his role as Lieutenant General Kuribayashi. One of the most disturbing and moving scenes was to hear their last radio transmission from Tokyo headquarters broadcasting a song sung by children from Kuribayashi's home town. The words of the song are disturbing as the young children's voices plead with the men to die bravely for their country. It is in moments like this that you see the psychological brainwashing that the Japanese military elite had subjected their military to.  <br /> <br />I think it is important to remember that Letters from Iwo Jima is a companion piece to Flags of our Fathers. One should not watch Letters without seeing Flags. Any complaints about revisionism lack any merit when these two films are seen more as a whole. No one is trying to rewrite history and state that what the Japanese government did wasn't wrong. But that is not the main thrust of these films. It is about the greater meaning about the morality of war and of soldiers sent out to fight for an idealogy they may or may not believe in. THat at least is what we see in Letters from Iwo Jima, through the eyes of a baker who never wanted to go to war and seeks only to get back to his wife and newborn daughter and the fears of a young dishonored military policemen who with a change of heart realizes there is no honor in death and does not want to die. These moments humanize the Japanese soldiers as Flags did for the American GIs. And that, I believe, is Mr. Eastwood's greatest directorial achievement since Unforgiven. <br />

B000ICLHIE|2.0|Whenever I decide to blast a critical favorite on this site I get a rating from the people that read my review of something like 1 of 47 that say they got anything out of it. And that is especially true if I stray from the material at hand and tell an anecdote. So let me begin with an anecdote. I remember open mike Monday nights around thirty years ago at the Troubadour where for about a year the buzz was that if you showed up you were likely to have the privilege of hearing this weird fellow with a gravelly voice walk in off of Santa Monica Boulevard around midnight, sit down at the piano and blow you away all for no cover and a 2 drink minimum. I spent a lot of summer Mondays getting drunk at the Troub hoping to catch Tom Waits and I managed to on more than one occasion. Here is what he did not do though. He did not read form the World Book Encyclopedia about Army Ants. I probably would have thrown my drink at him. I was a bit rowdy in those days.<br /><br />OK, the point I am trying to make is that there are 54 songs here. I paid for 54 songs. I will never listen to one cut on disc #3 again. And in fact I challenge those of you that give this collection 5 stars to listen to that disc. In fact throw it on when you have some guests over. They will think that you have lost your mind.<br /><br />I waited a long time before I wrote this review. Right now 19 of the cuts remain on my Ipod none of them are from disc 3. I hope Tom Waits writes music for another thirty years, but sometimes he puts out some real crap. The good news this time out is that he really separated it from the other material. The bad news is I paid the same for that that I paid for the good stuff. He should have released the collection as 3 separate CD's. Wonder how many copies of the third one he would have sold. Here is how I would rate them as separate discs. Disc one 3 stars, Disc 2 4 stars, disc 3 1 star. What a sorry year in music 2006 was when this is the top rated disc of the year by the critics. And in case you think this is the ramblings of an old guy that is out of touch with music today, I will say that I thought 2005 was a great year, and I still have high hopes for 2007, but in 2006 there was a true dearth of brilliant releases.  I could not possibly come up with a top ten list.critics.

B000002513|5.0|This is my favorite Springsteen album and one of my top 10 faves of all time. The songs that rock are unmatched and the slow tunes evoke incredible emotion. Rosalita has closed a majority of Springsteen's concerts over the years for good reason. Kitty's Back and Rosalita were written for the purpose of leaving the audience and the band totally exausted. The title track sways and bops. Others move you and sink you deep into the lives of characters that existed in Springsteen's imagination. I understand how many view Born to Run as one of the best albums of all time. These two should be viewed as discs one and two of a double album that celebrates the Jersey shore and stand apart as unique rock n roll. On this album, Springsteen is not doing his best to be successful, but pouring his heart out to rock the world. Buy this album and you will come back to it over and over for many years.
B0006J28KU|5.0|I love this movie.  It portays a world of undergound, professional, well-organize and well-armed thieves.  On the one hand, you wish that the police would just let this sort of overwhelming firepower walk away from the scene of the crime, catching up with them later in an appropriate place and time.  In the movie, the police catch up with the criminals in the act of committing the crime, and an unbelievable shootout ensues.  Al Pacino v. Robert De Niro.  What other movie could place pit these great actors against one another?  I love both of these actors, but I personally feel the better performance was turned in by De Niro in this particular film (by a slight margin), but that's just me.  If you love firearms, especially any sort of black rifles, this is a great film to own.  There are some interesting arms to see in action (considering they are in a fictional situation).
B00021R7CG|5.0|This low budget thriller makes you think about the protocol that goes behind calling the shots of a war. I was held in suspense all throughout the movie and liked the pretty much all star cast of military personnel.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If you've heard about climate change and global warming and are wondering what all the fuss is about or don't think that it's such a big deal, take 96 minutes to judge for yourself.  This movie is a great way to understand global warming and the impact that greenhouse gases are now having on our planet.  In describing a problem that is far beyond partisan politics, Al Gore's passionate presentation of the conclusions of reputable climate scientists, supported by awe-inspiring photos and video of the changes now occurring all over the Earth, provides a valuable resource that will enlighten and perhaps challenge your thinking, if not your behavior while on this little blue ball.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Our environment is definitely changing.  Whereas I appreciate warm weather to cold, the commentary in An Inconvenient Truth addresses how too much warmth from too much Carbon Dioide getting through to earth is not good at all.  The pictures of how the deteoriating glaciers from around the world will lead to a massive water shortage.  With world population increasing rapidly especially in areas such as India and China, the not so distant future does look a bit bleak.  What happens if the sea level shrinks?  More importantly what can we do about all of this?  The suggestions at the end of the movie are a start.  However politicans both democratic and republican need to pay closer attention.  All those charts seem to show an obvious trend.<br /><br />I am usually not much for a long political lecture.  However, Al Gore is very organized in his speech with many charts and examples that illustrate his point.  This movie certainly can serve as a long term reference guide for all of us as we should be aware of our chanigng climate.

B000957O82|4.0|My feelings are good not great on this one.  Will Smith tries to play the dating doctor but it turns out that he needs some thereapy when he falls for a reporter.  Its all a matter of practicing what you preach.  Some good scenes where Smith's, knowledgeable but shy accountant speaks out especially when confronted with aristocratic snobs.  The speedating scene is amusing as well.  Howver, the movie is sluggish in spots.  Nonetheless the good outweighs the bad.
B000J103YI|5.0|Really good film, some really good performances (Eddie Murphy was awesome), and some klunkers (Beyonce & Foxx - yawn). Then there's all the hoopla about Jennifer Hudson. It's a dream come true for her but ya gotta admit - Jennifer Holliday's performance on Broadway was soooooooooooo much better, much more polished, much more top and bottom, just much more oomph! Listen to the original cast album and you'll see (she won two Grammy's)!!! Unfortunately Holliday never got the right vehicle or exposure to show what an enourmous talent she is (still). While I loved Hudson's performance (albeit lots of forced vibrato, flat or sharp notes, and awkward dialogue) and believe this is just the beginning of a wonderful career, she has a long way to go and is far from deserving an Oscar IMHO. Sorry for the Holliday lovefest, but I really think Hudson's performance should be put in perspective. Too bad Jennifer Holliday wasn't a few years younger and didn't recreate her original role - now THAT would have been worthy of an Oscar!
B000LC3ID8|4.0|While the first film is still by far the best one, fans of the \\"Saw\\" films won't be disappointed with this latest (and last?) installment in this gore-filled series. \\"Saw III\\" more than lives up to the reputation of it's thrilling predecessors...and yes, there is of course a big twist at the end!<br /><br />The movie picks up almost exactly where \\"Saw II\\" left off, and takes the story down a new path. At the end of the second movie we (the audience) discovered that Amanda, the girl from the first movie who managed to escape the giant bear-trap attached to her jaw, was being groomed by Jigsaw to carry on his legacy of teaching carefully selected people the importance of life by placing them in horrifying torture devices and forcing them to extremes in order to escape, or die. In \\"Saw III\\" Jigsaw is dying from a brain tumor, and engages in one final game with Amanda...<br /><br />While I'm not usually a fan of films with mindless gore, I actually don't mind the \\"Saw\\" movies because they offer a nice heaping helping of thrills and twists to go along with it's usual blood bath. While I found myself shutting my eyes during most of the overly disgusting torture scenes (note to self...shutting your eyes does not shut out the sound effects...learn to shut ears as well) I was still able to enjoy this movie without having nightmares afterwards.<br /><br />What would you do if you knew that in a matter of minutes you were going to die in a terrifyingly painful and grotesque way? Would you be willing to cut off your own foot with a saw? Would you be willing to stick your arm in a vat of acid that will immediately eat the flesh away from your bone? Would you be willing to cut the only key that can set you free out of the body of a live human being? These are the dilemmas Jigsaw's victims face. They face the very human fear of death, and are forced to contemplate their mortality in the two minutes they have left to live. Jigsaw attempts to instill in these people a greater appreciation for life, and he gives each of them the opportunity to save themselves...or perish. Our instinct to survive is one of the most primal components in human nature, and the \\"Saw\\" films ask the question, \\"What would you be willing to do to survive\\"?<br /><br /> While the lengths he goes to are psychopathic at best...is Jigsaw wrong in his ideology that people in the depths of despair in humanity need a helping hand to see the light? Generally this help comes from healthier practices, such as counseling, group therapy, or even simply having good support from a loved one. Torture probably isn't the best way to enlighten such individuals.<br /><br />This 3rd installment is definitely the grossest out of all of them, so be warned that it might make even the toughest person squirm. Admittedly, I sort of guessed the twist at the end before it happened, but it turns out I was only partially right. Even if you think you know what the twist is...I promise you'll find out there's more to it than you think.<br /><br />Bottom line, a great gross-out movie!

B0009UC7H0|4.0|\\"Sahara\\" had less than a stellar turn out at the box office upon its initial release and I happened to let it slip by my radar at the time.  I had read the novel upon which the film was based and thought it stupid but fun and I expected the film to be about the same but with more emphasis on the former than the latter.  Well I was a bit wrong on that score.  Sure, \\"Sahara\\" isn't going to win awards for smarts but hey this is an action adventure film and it doesen't pretend to be anything but that.  Fortunately thats what makes this film stand out from a lot of others of its kind.  Its concerned only with providing good old fashioned actioneer fun; nothing more and nothing less and it succeeds quite well with those simple ambitions.<br /><br />Now if your a hardcore Cussler/Dirk Pitt fan you may be disappointed with the fact that the films characterizations are not the same as the ones in the book but I will argue that the movie does a good job of at least staying true to the spirit of those characters.  Frankly I'm not overly impressed with Cussler's writing.  His characrers are flat and his dialog is laughable.  For example, his villains are right out of some old pulp or movie serial and will actually say things like: \\"The American devils have foiled our plans and now they must die!!\\"  I kid you not, that is not an exaggeration of typical Cussler dialog.  You can see how that may not translate well to film and fortunately the film makers are able to make the dialog and story a bit smarter than the original material upon which it is based.  Anyway, the actors are fine and are having a great time and the direction and cinematography are above average.  My only real complaint is an over reliance on classic rock as a soundtrack; I like classic rock but it should have a more limited role as a music soundtrack for an action film.<br /><br />All in all \\"Sahara\\" is great old fashioned escapist entertainment and is not meant to be taken too seriously.  So, my recommendation is to pop some popcorn and put this disc in for an evening of solid action entertainment.tion is to pop some popcorn and put this disc in for an evening of solid action entertainment.

Can watch for many times and still you wanna watch more and more of it.<br /><br />Anjelica Huston and Paul Julia are pale example of perfect eternal unusual, amazing, inimitable love. Christina Ricci is a perfect daughter - cold-livered deadly beauty. All actors match perfect and create \\"one big happy family\\"<br /><br />Everything that have to be dead - will be alive in this movie, everything that have to be alive will be dead with a smile on it's face.

Slow speech, slow actions (if they are at all) and to end of movie you just fall asleep.<br /><br />Not the best work of Steven Soderbergh.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|The only group of leaders that question the scientific evidence regarding global warming reside right here in the good ol' USA. I have never felt that the current leadership were the sharpest tools in the shed and so I haven't been a real good follower. This information is alarming. It is not presented in a \\"Hollywood\\" glamour manner. The message of this movie is incredibly important to our future. I am concerned that the majority of our scientific community rate global warming as the number one issue facing our world! This means more serious than Nuclear? That is pretty serious folks. We need to act now and if we don't then go ahead and spend your retirement money. You won't be needing it.

I'm a point and shoot camera person, and wanted some tips to get the most our of our new digital SLR.  It's a fun read, with lots of great tips and easy to understand direction to take great photos.  I think it's a must have in your library for all digital camera users.
1400064287|5.0|Although aimed at a business audience, I found the authors' suggestions for effective communication equally applicable in classrooms and writing projects. Success in helping students learn or persuading readers follows from applying the \\"SUCCESs\\" formula: keep your message Simple but profound; spark interest by opening with the Unexpected; use Concrete examples rather than abstract formulations; make your message Credible by reporting from direct experience; draw people in with Emotional impact; and use Stories to make your message memorable and of human interest. The authors base their arguments on well-validated social-psychological principles but never let the science get in the way of their well-written recommendations. I highly recommend this book for teachers at every level of instruction and for authors who want to increase the impact of their written words.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Loved this movie.  I had just had an argument with my daughter and this movie came in the next day. I sat down and watched it by myself. It hit the nail right on the head as far as our reaction with each other.  It actually made me cry.  It is a very creative movie maybe to odd for some but I loved it.  A few days later my daughter watched it and she too loved it and an apology was given from both sides as we realized how stubborn we both were being about things in general. They say movies don't influence but this one did. It was wonderful.

0140067477|1.0|I actually thought this was going to be a good book, but came away feeling depressed at how pitiful an attempt this was to describe an eastern philosophy.  No doubt, the book has sold purely on its hook of having the famous little bear, Pooh, on it's cover.  Nevertheless, the only handful of passages that made the whole endeavor worthwhile in this little waste of time came from other passages taken out of REAL books such as Tae Te Ching.  Otherwise, the author here is one of those hippie types who, by his own admission, likes to lay about on the floor.  Must be nice while the rest of us go to work to earn money to buy cute little books with Winnie the Pooh on the cover. <br /> <br />Whatever.
0670033375|5.0|This book presents very clear concise arguments for the proper management of oour land's resources. He startes off with a comparison of two farms in Montana and describes why one failed and one suceeded. This was a strong opening because the example is modern day and we can see the tangible differences 'real-time'.' <br />The author then presents older sociesties that failed and most likely reaons why they did. This is a comprable book to Al Gore's An Inconvienant Truth in its message. This is highly recommended.
B000C20VRS|5.0|Scarface is a great movie. If you like action, then you will love this movie. It is one of Al Pacino`s best performances. His character is believable. The other actors are great, too. This movie digs deep into the cocaine syndicate. It shows how a small time hood makes his way to the top. Then slowly loses it all. This movie is my all time favorite.

During Christmas I searched many book stores and movie stores to find they were sold out on this DVD, which is no surpise. I recommend this Classic to all who have a spirited heart and an itch for class.
1932907009|5.0|I found SAVE THE CAT to be a straight ahead read. Blakes chatty, but concise style is easy to read and full of specific information. <br />For anyone seriously interested in writing commercially viable screenplays -- this book cuts to the chase. The book does not dis- <br />cuss mechanics of page layout and spacing of dialog or such. Instead, Blake focuses on the \\"moments\\" that MUST occur for a screenplay <br />to be successful.

0762188669|5.0|The Day of the Jackal, by Frederic Forsyth<br /><br />This fast-paced 1971 novel is based in part on the actual events that occurred in 1960s France. The revolt in 1954 Algeria created troubles that brought Charles De Gaulle to power in 1958. The French army put an end to the revolt in Algeria, but the expenses resulted in a peace settlement and an independent Algeria. France lost one of its oldest and closest colonies. Elements in France and Algeria blamed De Gaulle for this political decision. They formed the Secret Army Organization (OAS), and decided to remove De Gaulle from power. Chapter One tells about the 1962 assassination attempt. The French Secret Services soon put an end to the OAS. This book imagines another plot by the OAS to assassinate De Gaulle, and story develops this idea to its logical conclusion.<br /><br />Since all the supporters of the OAS were known to the French Secret Services they decided to find a foreigner who was unknown and could travel freely in France to do the job. The only way to keep this plan secret is to let only a few know of the plans. This hired assassin will not be cheap. The Englishman explains why a professional is superior to an amateur. June and July 1963 saw a huge amount of armed robberies in France. Any Belgian can buy a pistol or rifle at any sports or gun shop. Brussels had a long tradition of forging official documents. The Jackal sought a sniper's location on the sixth floor near the plaza where De Gaulle would visit on August 25, the anniversary of the Liberation of Paris in 1944. A fire escape would allow an escape. Preparations for his disguises continued. We learn that industrialists and bankers would put up the cash to pay for the assassination. The book tells what a mercury-filled bullet would do: explode on contact.<br /><br />The French Secret Service captured and questioned a guard for the OAS; Victor talked. Colonel Rolland figured out the plot and warned his superiors. De Gaulle orders no publicity; the search for the Jackal would be kept secret. They will use the best detective in Paris, Charles Lebel. Lebel knows that slow, precise, methodical investigation solves crimes. The OAS has planted a spy close to a high-level Minister who learns about the plans and sends a warning to her contact. But the OAS high-command cannot recall the operation. The Jackal receives this warning but decided to continue the operation. The police continues the search but the Jackal seems to be forewarned and escapes their traps. The French police appear to be closing in on their target. The Jackal knows all the tricks to disappear in a Paris where the police searched high and low. Organized crime was also looking for this individual, but neither had success. Lebel figures out that August 25 is a major holiday. President De Gaulle will appear in public places during the day. That is when the Jackal will strike and then make his getaway. Detective Lebel goes around questioning the gendarmes on crowd control. One tells of letting an old one-legged man pass. Level know this is his man, and they race to the top floor. Lebel gets to personally say goodbye to the Jackal. [Would this detective be on the job unarmed?]<br /><br />This is an interesting story in itself. It has eerie parallels to the events of November 22, 1963 in Dallas. A hired assassin will always use a rifle to he can escape while the police are trying to figure out where the shot came from. This story glides over the implausibilities. What if the gendarme on crowd control refused to let the old one-legged veteran pass?ity; the search for the Jackal would be kept secret.

B000J10ER4|5.0|The pro reviewers missed the sensitivity of this one!  Superman returns to earth and his beloved Lois Lane after 5 years.  Lois is obviously still loves him, but it's been 5 years with no explanation and a baby is born in the meantime.  Even the most modern woman isn't going to fall all over a superhero who has been gone for 5 years!  The actors protray well their devotion with boundaries of respect.  Bravo! The story continues 5 years later, but simutaneously, it easily catapults us as viewers into the 21st century.  Not only do we see the love Lois has for the two men in her life, but we are gifted with great visual effects, as well.  An old fashioned love story with tenderness mixed with 21st century, computer-filled newsroom and modern movie-making fun.  The charisma of Reeves-Kidder was a hard act to follow, but these actors have done it with grace!  I loved Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor.  Routh looks like Clark Kent, not just Christopher Reeves.  I hope that a sequel follows....and better ones than Reeves starred in.
B000J103PC|5.0|One of the top five movies of the year in my book and I loved every minute of it.  I would have nominated Stanley Tucci for Best Supporting Actor but the whole cast is impeccable.  Meryl Streep never ceases to amaze me with her ability to become the character she portrays--She is without a doubt the greatest actress of our time.  For me, the director, the producers, the screenwriters and each and every one of the actors made all the right choices.  I could watch it again and again. <br />Know what?  I probably will.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Just finished watching the DVD, my first time seeing RENT in any form. The line \\"525,600 minutes\\" is dancing through my head and won't go away. I'm kind of at a loss as to where to start saying what I want to say. I guess the highest praise I can give it is, this is the best contemporary musical I've seen in YEARS.<br /><br />My first introduction to RENT was by way of--of all things--Late Night with David Letterman, when he had the original cast on the show to perform (I think) \\"La Vie Boheme.\\" I remember the energetic singing, the vivacious dancing on the table, the THUNDEROUS applause they received at song's end...and thinking, \\"Man, this is one musical I have to see.\\" I'm just sorry it took me this long to finally see it, considering it's been to Kansas City with touring companies a few times. Now that I've seen the movie and loved it, I can only hope it comes here again, and soon.<br /><br />All this being said, I can only agree with the multitudes who've already reviewed RENT. The cast is outstanding. The songs--of which I loved every one--just knocked me out. (The rock songs almost sound like Springsteen could have written them, they're THAT good.) There are moments in the movie when you'll want to stand up and cheer, and moments that will bring tears to your eyes. I can't recommend this highly enough...IMHO, it runs rings around musicals like Chorus Line, Cats, or Chicago. If you haven't seen it yet, treat yourself and do so ASAP. In fact, why wait?--no day like today.

This is a must for any Beatles fan. Even if you're not a fan, you might change your mind after hearing this!
B000092Q4U|4.0|I'm giving this album a 4 out of 5 because the sound quality is pretty bad. Their recording engineer should have been fired and replaced. There is a fine line between a raw-sounding album, and a poorly recorded one. Unfortunately, this one leans more toward the poorly recorded side. But with that being said... <br /> <br />This is one of the best metal albums I have heard in recent years. If there is a hope for the future of American metal, it truly lies in these guys. <br /> <br />Unlike most of today's newer metal bands, these guys actually have very well written, intelligent, and poignant lyrics. The lyrical themes tend to be socio-political to religious in nature: the album's two closing tracks are still some of my favorites. <br /> <br />Vocally, their frontman is a screamer/growler (usually, I'm not a big fan of that), but he is one of the few metal frontmen who can do it well: it is easy to understand what he is saying, and his vocals don't sound cheesy or weak, as tends to be the case with other screamers of any genre. <br /> <br />Musically, these guys are great. Chris Adler is one of the most creative up & coming metal drummers out there. While they tend to play heavy, almost pummeling riffs, these guys cover everything from creepy down-tempo songs to thrashy up-tempo pieces, and many points in between. They're definitely much more creative than most of the new acts out ther (this review can't really do them justice). <br /> <br />In summation, this is a great metal album, but the recording quality is pretty poor. Thankfully it (along with the band) has improved in their next album.
B000ION23K|5.0|When we first sat down to view this movie I wasn't sure about it.  How good could a movie be about a kid bullying ants; I was in for a wonderful surprise.  We meet Lucas who is picked on by a bully himself and seems to take out his revenge on an ant community..why?  Because he is bigger.<br /><br />When the Wizard of the ant community comes up with a portion to shrink Lucas and it is decided he must learn how to live like an ant the fun begins.  Lucas soon learns that working together can help you overcome no matter what size you are.  It was just a really fun movie and one that my entire family enjoyed.  I highly recommend it.
0143036238|5.0|Jane is prejudiced and Mr. Darcy is prideful, or is it Jane is prideful and Mr. Darcy prejudiced, or do they both have a bit of pride and prejudice, which lends itself to a delightful novel filled with social boundaries, romance, disappointment, and comedy.<br /><br />The movie inspired me to read this novel for the first time.  However, do as I did and read the novel before seeing the movie.  You will not be disappointed.  The first section of the novel introduces you to the character, setting, and social rules, as well as acclimates you to Austen's style.  Once you have moved into the remaining sections, the book takes so many twists and turns that you cannot put it down.  Even after my third reading, I still love the suspense of what will become of each Bennet sister.

Besides the fact that the series is very interesting, the longer you follow, the more addicted you get to see more. Many great actors and a realy good staff at Josiah Bartlets White House. Sometimes the quick and unpronounced american language is not easy to follow, but you get used to it. <br />I strongly recommend to buy and see West Wing, I enjoyed every minute of it
B00005UT84|5.0|Caravan was likely the most creative band to come out of the Canterbury UK music scene in the 1960s and 70's. I've been a fan of them for more years than I want to think about. I recently found out about this live performance and grabbed it when I had the chance. I was not disappointed, in fact I was amazed by this high energy performance. Recorded in 1974 (not too long after Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night was released), right before a North America tour, this concert captures Caravan at their best. From the opening notes of Memory Lain, Hugh/Headloss through Hoedown this CD is a work of joy. And the interaction between the band and the audience is also quite fun, especially on the encore song, Hoedown.<br /><br />I'd forgotten for example what a great great song Virgin On the Ridiculous was (played it a handful of times when I was a college radio DJ long ago). And I discovered The Love In Your Eye (an awesome 15 minute long piece). The eight or nine minute A Hunting We Shall go (featuring 3 or 4 minutes of Dave Sinclair's haunting organ) is exquisite. And of course Caravan's opus on this live CD is For Richard. Another beautiful long song, of course Caravan was known for quite a few long songs in their heyday (Nine Feet Underground comes to mind among others).<br /><br />This concert was originally recorded with the intent of providing US radio stations with live Caravan in conjunction with their 1974 US tour. However, only some of it saw the light of day until this 2002 release.<br /><br />If you're a Caravan fan (or even if you're not and want to know what \\"all the fuss is about,\\"), buy this CD if you haven't already. It captures Caravan at their peak.
0783226845|4.0|Little is said about the tango scene, thus far. That allows me the pleasure of being the first to talk about the interesting things that are going on there.  <br /> <br />Frank, an ardent admirer of the beauty of women, and an afficionado of the Tango, finds himself with an opportunity for a special moment, a situation, in which he proceeds to charm a sweet flower of a young woman, so well embodied in Donna, with his manner and  his words.  Tango music is swaying in the background, compellingly played by The Tango Project.  <br /> <br />Frank asks Donna if she can Tango; she had wanted to learn, but her Michael didn't. Frank offers her a lesson, then and there. She hesitates, blushes, smiles, and finally submits to his \\" seduction.\\"  They escort each other to the dance floor. Aware of Frank's  blindness, Donna instinctively holds him closer.  <br /> <br />\\"Por un Cabeza\\" begins. Frank leads her, gently and masterfully, through the beautiful ritual of the Tango. She seems to move as one with him. Effective camera work reveals Frank's dramatic and romantic execution of the Tango, and Donna's pleasure and surprise at her ability to follow him, effortlessly, through this colorful dance that she has long wished to do. <br /> <br />They leave the dance floor. One gets the sense that what transpired was more than simply a dance lesson. They were both deeply fulfilled by the experience; Frank, by being with a beautiful woman, doing his beloved Tango, and Donna, by finally doing a Tango with a charming man. <br /> <br /> I would add that Donna was not mildly smitten by Frank, as betrayed by her glances toward him during the brief conversation that followed, and as she was being led away by Michael, who had joined them. She was obviously not very willing to say goodbye. A small tragedy is perceived in the fact that Frank could not see and reap the reward of the attraction of a beautiful woman; there is no doubt that he sensed it, but he would have been very pleased to see it.<br /> <br />
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I am a big fan of the original Superman The Movie. When I saw Superman II (the theatrical release) I was disappointed. It was nothing like the first movie. Years later I found out that this was not the original vision for Superman II. In fact, the original Superman II, shot by Richard Donner, still existed in a variety of forms and has now been reassembled for our viewing pleasure. After viewing Donner's version of Superman II, I was struck by how how closely it resembles Superman I in tone and overall feel. Donner himself states that he filmed most of I and II together.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the original Superman movie!
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE SOUNDTRACK I'M SORRY TO SAY & SAD TO REPORT. <br /> <br />You will be disappointed if you buy this thinking the song arrangements are the same as they are presented in the movie.  WHICH IS GREAT BY THE WAY.   <br /> <br />Jump & All you need is Love & Christmas is all around (although close is not the same). <br /> <br />By far the best song on the CD is sung by Olivia Olson, and is better than mariah carey, and nearly as good as the DVD version.
B000063V8U|5.0|The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order although Season Three was aired fairly much according to the chronological produced order except for episode one and two which are switched around. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.<br /><br />Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG) had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.' Star Trek: Season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the Season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that Star Trek, Deep Space Nine: Season 1 whipped up while Season 6 was running. 1993 was TV Sci-Fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of ST for the year. This means for the folks who have been watching TOS and TNG, now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between TNG Season 6 and DS9 Season 1. You can find the order if you search the new for it. TNG has really good stories while DS9 gets the effects. We are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story. Season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises (Picard acting like a Russian is hysterical. Would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time? Maybe yes!). The conclusion of Season five's \\"Time's Arrow\\" is not the best cliff-hanger but sufficient. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien but will be transferred to DS9 (his absence is not mentioned). Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan is back along with Alexander Rozhenko. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) will also leave for DS9. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is back after being absent from Season 5. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about transporter psychosis, empaths, Scotty!, alien abductions, Q, age regression, android dreams, artificial life, Cardassians, Prof. Moriarty, love, Romulan defection, destiny, Klingon birthrights, thieves, command ethics, origins of life, insanity, murder, faith, doubles, time travel and the Borg. Like Season 5 most the episodes in Season 6 have above average sci-fi stories, combing planetary exploration and the life of the crew. Memorable episodes include, A Fistful of Datas, The Quality of Life, Ship in a Bottle, Face of the Enemy, Birthright and lessons. There are three very good episodes which really make the season worth. Tapestry sees Picard given the opportunity to relive his youth without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through the heart. Suspicion is a great whodunit episode (of which there are a few) with one of the coolest Star Trek aliens ever (should have made him a main character). Descent Part I is a very nice slight of hand trick. You will keep thinking Hugh right up until the last second. In TNG: Season 6 the crew make contact with Deep Space Nine. So if you get Deep Space Nice: Season One you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order. If you are in for 6 you may also be in for Season One of DS9! So see you in Season Seven which will be watched with DS9 Season Two.r William T.

B000GIXEIG|4.0|I think that this is the better of the two renderings of the Beowulf movies that lately have been viewable.  The seem to have done their homework.  The costuming and the set seem to be accurate to my knowledge.  Beowulf is a difficult work to turn into a movie to begin with and this is the most heroic effort I've seen.  Gerard Butler was great as the heroe, although the the Scotish accent didn't seem quite right.  The original was in Anglo-saxon and therefore they should have been more Germanic sounding.  Likewise the setting was too rocky for Denmark, at least I don't think that the Jutland Peninsula is quite that rugged.  Overall I enjoyed it, and recommend it to others to see.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Probably the most famous Studio Ghibli anime, \\"Spirited Away\\" is one of Ghibli's best, a magical, moving and just plain awesome tale that no movie fan should be without.  It features some of the most incredible animation ever put forward, some of the most fantastic animation ever brought to life, and some of the most memorable characters in movie history. <br /> <br />   Chihiro, an obstinate but lovable little girl, is moving across the country (not to any great enthusiasm on her part) with her rather clueless parents when the family stops at what appear to be the ruins of an old shrine, for some sightseeing.  As they're entering this imposing place, only minutes into the film, \\"Spirited Away\\" will probably have already captivated you with its gorgeous visuals and its contrasting tones of whimsical/humorous and subtly foreboding darkness.  Inside the ruins, things are less...ruined....and there's a sumptuous feast laid out, which Chihiro's parents dig into with reckless abandon while Chiro herself wanders about nervously.  It turns out that there's reason to be nervous, for when dusk falls in this place, those inside it witness the coming of strange forms and then find themselves spirited away, out of this world and into a mysterious other.  Chihiro's parents transform into pigs and are corralled into pens, and Chihiro herself is pressed into labor by a sinister witch who rules a vast hostel for travelling entities in this new world, and is renamed Sen. <br /> <br />   Sen's prospects of escaping and freeing her parents appear bleak, but strange things can happen hear.  Befriended by a strange and knowledgable older boy named Haku, Sen finds unlikely allies whose virtues are merely buried under intimidating crusts.  All manner of bizarre beings pass in and out of the great bath house where Sen now labors, some of whom the ruling witch is as frightened of as are Sen and the other 'underlings'.  Odysseies and discoveries ensue that I don't want to even hint at, and the coming together of the oddest combinations of beings uncovers both goodness and sadness in the strangest places. <br /> <br />   A phenomenal movie.  Also recommended are \\"Castle In The Sky\\", \\"Pom Poko\\", \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\"...all of Ghibli's movies actually, although some, like the epic \\"Princess Mononoke\\" and the heart-wrenching wartime orphan drama \\"Grave Of The Fireflies\\", might not be the best picks for young children.  Studio Ghibli is the strongest single force in the diverse and astonishing world of anime, and for those who've yet to discover the wonders of anime, \\"Spirited Away\\" is a perfect place to start.
B00005NC66|5.0|I haven't read them all, but it seems to me that most of the reviews here are about film technique. In addition to being ground-breaking from a director's standpoint, it's a great story. I've seen the Richard Gere version, and frankly, all I remember about it is the MTV music video for the theme song. The original gave me a completely different perception of the story, and the ending surprised me. I thought Jean-Paul Belmondo did a fantastic job with a complex character. There's a press conference scene that I thought was important to the story, as well. I wish I spoke French, because I think there are nuances in the dialogue not captured in the subtitles, but nevertheless, I think this is an enjoyable film in addition to all the cinematic masterpiece accolades. <br />  <br /> <br />
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I seldom purchase entire cds because even if an artist has a few great songs in the cd, the others are not as good and I end up pressing skip all the time.  I only bought this CD for \\"Girl, Put Your Records On\\" but found that all the other songs are just as good or even better.  This has to be one of the best CDs I have ever purchased.  All the songs are lyrical and beautiful, and Bailey Rae's voice is soothing and unique at the same time.  I highly recommend this CD.

B00005JPGM|4.0|Plot: The movie is set in the late 1990's in war torn Sierra Leone.  Danny Archer (Leo Dicaprio) is a diamond smuggler and mercenary looking to make it big.  That chance arrives when he meets Solomon Varday (Djimon Hounsou).  Solomon is a fisherman looking to make a better life for his family especially his son who he wants to go to school and become a doctor.  Danny learns that Solomon has found and hidden a large rare diamond. With the help of Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), an American journalist they go searching through the worn torn country run by rebels to find the hidden diamond.<br /><br />What is good about it:<br />Africa is a magical place and this film shows it beautifully with sweeps of the green lush country, with elephants and other animals roaming, green hills and dense forest.  This backdrop is marred by the brutal violence that characters inflict upon another in the movie.  Blood diamond is very intense and the scenes of brutal violence amidst the backdrop of a gorgeous beautiful country are shocking and emotional. The movie isn't just about how a people are being exploited but how a country, a continent is falling apart.  It isn't just the world who demands precious resources, like diamonds, that is destroying this country but its very own people are killing each and fighting each other.<br /><br />This movie doesn't flinch from horrors of war, including child soldiers and slavery.  By having Archer and Solomon, two very different African men, come together you are shown all sides of Africa.  That is impressive to do in one film and I believe that the film does accomplish its goal of showing all the facets of Africa.<br /><br />What is bad about it:<br />There are just some scenes that went on too long.  Archer is a mercenary he only cares about himself.  Yet the makers of this movie are determined to allow him his redemptive moment.  I don't think that it adds anything to the plot.  The same with the \\"romance\\" between Archer and Maddy, it was extraneous and I think it takes away from the movie.  There could have been better editing which would have made the movie have a greater impact and get its point across without having these unnecessary scenes.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This movie isn't just about Sierra Leone and the diamond trade this movie is about Africa and its twisted history, its terrible beauty and the nature of man.  This is a great film.  Yes it does drag in parts and has some formulaic scenes (thus the 4 and not 5 stars) but it is also well done.  The film sets out to elicit a certain response - horror at the nature of man, awe for the beauty of Africa and shame for knowing that these conflicts are happening and maybe we are contributing to them by our lack action.  This is Africa beautiful and violent.kes away from the movie.

B000K7UBTI|4.0|I liked it.  My wife and I watched it last night (advance copies are sometimes available before the \\"official\\" release, a point for the gentleman who doubted anyone had actually seen it to consider) and we both enjoyed it quite a bit.  Neither of us are fans of the comic.  She's hardly read any (she is a serious comics fan but her reading of Marvel titles centers mostly on the X-Men).  I was a fan back when the character first appeared but quit reading in the mid '70s.  So we are not burdened with a deep knowledge of all that has happened to Iron Man in his decades-long existence.  We took the story as presented and thought it was well written, well acted and well animated.  Sure, it's not up to Pixar standards but the animation was as good as the best TV supehero animation (I'm a big fan of the animated Batman, Superman and Justice League series) and better than most.  If you don't compare it word-for-word and scene-for-scene with the comic, I think there's a good chance you will enjoy it, too.
B00009W0U4|3.0|With it's wild, hand-held camera angles, director Gaspar Noe takes the viewer on a tragic journey.  From the moment we see the end credits at the beginning of this film, we realize this is not a conventional movie. This is a film that shows the consequences of actions and it's tragic events.  Monica Bellucci should be commended for giving such a gutsy performance, one that most people would not subject themselves to.  This is a raw, brutal and quite shocking film that shakes us from our sense of easiness.  This film is not rated, but if it was, it would be NC-17.  View this film with extreme caution!

B00005JLT5|5.0|Neither a documentary nor a story of fictional characters set in a historical setting, The Pianist is the dramatization of the true survival story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist from Warsaw who died in 2000 and who can be seen and heard in the DVD Special Features.  There are some things that come off more powerfully in this true drama format than in documentary testimonials, and particularly notable with The Pianist is the educative value of observing through time the stages of dehumanization against the Jews in Poland.<br /><br />In the early part of the movie, an ominous feel develops as there is a move from \\"No Jews Allowed\\" signs to the requirement of wearing identifying Star of David armbands, to daily abuse on the street by \\"ordinary\\" people, the complicity of a Polish police force, the announcement that Jews would be expelled from neighborhoods, the confiscation of property, being forced into an overcrowded apartment and worse later, the walls of the ghetto going up, selection for forced labor, family survival by divvying up a tiny candy, gunshots to the head on whim, failed attempts of children to smuggle food...and yet still there was not utter despair, and still family members had each other...there were lineups where some were selected to step forward to be shot on the spot, bodies to be stepped over, starvation, and then Szpilman watching as his family was herded into railroad cars for deportation as he was pulled back and saved by a Jewish policeman.<br /><br />From that point, Szpilman goes in and out of the ghetto to labor, and in so doing aids in smuggling in handguns for a planned Jewish resistance...but then he decides to escape the ghetto and not return.  Adrian Brody is thoroughly convincing in his role as Szpilman, and the degree of suffering is increasingly apparent in Brody's face and gait.  Continuing on with Szpilman's story we watch from Szpilman's hiding place as some Warsaw Jews  resist, their molotav cocktails and guns no match for the tanks and flamethrowers.  Szpilman escapes death on more than one occasion, and even the helpful non-Jews aren't so helpful.  The burnt and gutted city panoramas, the bodies in pools of blood, the emaciation and disease, all these images...they hit, perhaps enduringly, in a place that a black and white photo montage with accompanying testimonials, valuable in its own way, just doesn't.and flamethrowers.

B00006F2TV|5.0|I've always been a Spider-Man fan, and this movie is well done.  Excellent retelling of Spider-Man's origin.  Brilliant casting Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst makes a very appealing Mary Jane Watson.<br /><br />One technicality that probably had been mentioned:  the original Spiderman created his own webbing by making web shooters.  This led to suspense in the comic books when he runs out of web-fluid.  Here, the webs are part of his spider abilities, with no explanation why the \\"I love you\\" hand signal releases it.  The special effects of the webs were excellent, light years ahead of the late '70's TV series.<br /><br />Many mentioned that the Green Goblin could have been better.  Make-up could probably worked to make the Goblin's face more mobile as in the comics, as opposed to the expressionless metal mask in the movie.  But DaFoe made a chilling villain.<br /><br />One drawback:  the final battle between Spidey and the Goblin is faithful to Spiderman #122 (\\"The Green Goblin's Last Stand\\"), and also had been done by one of the animated Spiderman series (though the animated had more adapting than the movie did).<br /><br />I enjoyed the Batman and X-Men movies more, but this still was a very good movie.  I liked seeing the sequence of Spidey in action, which made me think of the 1979 Superman movie.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|The film is gorgeous to look at. Paul Giamatti does his usual fine work. Jessica Biel looks like someone inflated her. She doesn't appear to be aging gracefully. Though she's Austrian her accent doesn't sound German. It doesn't sound like it's anything at all. It's the typical American acting approach to doing a foreign accent -- make it vaguely exotic and use soft R's. Still, our expectations of her as an actress aren't high to begin with.<br /><br />Which leads us to Norton. His wandering accent is so distracting that it detracts from the movie. It's right up there with Kevin Costner's in \\"Robin Hood,\\" and that's not a comparison you want as an actor. He projects a compelling intensity when he's performing, but when he speaks he's just another American in a pretty costume. With this, Down in the Valley, Red Dragon, and so on, he's tarnishing his reputation as one of the best actors of his generation. His best work in recent memory was his uncredited performance as the leper king in Kingdom of Heaven, in which he performed in a metal mask!<br /><br />The actor we should be talking about is Rufus Sewell, who steals every scene he's in. He's a brittle shell of walking malice and ambition, who cracks easily, exploding in fits of anger in jealousy. Biels' character walks on eggshells around him, and the audience waits to see when his inevitable next meltdown will come. And he gets the accent right.
B0000UJL96|5.0|This movie is the last of the movies with the original Star Trek cast (unless you count \\"Generations\\"), and can arguably be the best (though a case can be made for \\"Wrath Of Kahn\\" and \\"The Voyage Home\\" as well).  It sets things up for the time of the Next Generation, with the preludes of peace between the Klingons and the Federation.  It is interesting that there is a conspiracy to keep it from happening with Klingons, humans, and Vulcans involved.<br /><br />I won't say anything more; you know I hate spoiling surprises, and I might say that I've spoiled some already.

B00000ILDE|5.0|I only saw \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" in the series; I would be surprised if either of the later two could surpass \\"Aliens\\".  In some ways, this is a formula sequel, bringing out memorable parts of the original, like the chest buster scene, the egg, and the destruction of an android.  But it did not strictly stay with the formula, and came across as much as an adventure as a horror movie.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the relationship between Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and Newt (Carrie Henn).  Paul Reiser and Michael Biehn also shone in this picture.
0380789019|4.0|The Alice in Wonderland comparison another reviewer made is a pretty good one. This is one strange trip into the London Tube. The plot gets a bit ridiculous at times, but everything else is so different that you can easily suspend your belief. The characters, the description of the Underground and the dark atmosphere are novel and highly engaging. <br /> <br />Think of Neil Gaiman as a Tim Burton of the written novel and you'll have an idea of where this goes. Don't try to understand it like a Sci-Fi or wonder at the plot like a fantasy, just sit back and enjoy the ride.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|An ex car theif makes a \\"come-back tour\\" to save his little brother who got himself in over his head.<br /><br />Besides the fact that it features Nicholas Cage, and Robert Duvall among other big names, I liked the story a lot. The actors work together beautifully in this movie and the result, I think is like MAGIC. If I had to name a part that I didn't like, well, that would hard. The part where Memphis is driving \\"Eleanor\\" was a little drawn out (in my opinion) but it was very relevant to the story, and action loving people who have a thing for cars, I'm sure will love it.<br /><br /> I loved the role that Nicholas Cage played in this, he comes across as very masculine and fearless, and brave but very loving of his family, as he does what needs to be done -while being well aware of the dangers involved. In a situation (business) that requires quick reflexes and action, he knows when to be slow and calculating and I loved the scene where he stops and it seems listens to his 'intuition' (by remembering a small detail) and backs away from a trap. The writer's/producers of this really did a superb job with this!<br /><br />This movie is on my top 10 of ones I love and could watch over and again.
B000GY729M|4.0|Purists will probably dismiss this album as a cobbled together pastiche of pop-rock references that tend to hover inexplicably around the year 1985. Gen-Y New Wave enthusiasts will most likely be oblivious to that and dismiss \\"Sam's Town\\" for not sounding enough like \\"Hot Fuss\\". Thirtysomething music fans like me, however, might enjoy the resonant echoes of Bowie, Queen, U2, Echo & the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, New Order, Depeche Mode, The Cure, The Smiths and most obviously (and occasionally hilariously) Bruce Springsteen, while not taking the whole thing as seriously as the band perhaps would like us to. I like Springsteen, but tracks like \\"My List\\" and the obvious \\"Born to Run\\"-homage, \\"This River Is Wild\\", take it a litle too far. On these tracks, rather than sounding like Springsteen, frontman Brandon Flowers sounds more like Robert Smith's devoted young American son fronting a senior prom band. Still, I really do enjoy this album, much as I enjoyed their last, not least for its enthusiasm. It's the kind of retro-fusion fun you can imagine a free-wheeling R.E.M. indulging for an album (and a little more insightfully), though it's unlikely to be the basis for an entire career - even for a band from Vegas. Flowers does himself no favours with his press persona, but his lyrics have an angsty ambiguity that makes The Killers slightly more interesting than many of their contemporaries. And no band that simultaneously counts Springsteen, The Cars and Morrissey amongst their key influences, and has the sheer audacity to hire Alan Moulder AND Flood for their sophomore effort, can be dismissed without some consideration, even if the result isn't always good. Looking very much forward to hearing what happens next.
B000J10ERO|1.0|For the first few minutes I sat mesmerized as I heard Marlon Brando's voice and the original theme song.  I settled in for what was supposed to be a killer movie but after about five minutes had passed I was thinking about sneaking a nap while everyone was watching the movie, but I decided to finish the movie.  I was like a mountain climber.  Superman Returns was my Everest.  I would climb to the top.  I would finish this movie.  To say it had been done so no others would have to suffer after me.  I told myself I would spread the word to every man, woman, and child that crossed my path:  Whatever you do don't see this movie.  Now I get that some people love superman so much that they don't care how crappy it is.  You people go ahead and see it you were going to anyways and you're probably used to crap by now, but for everybody else I can't say this enough:  Do not ever under any circumstances watch Superman Returns. If you want to see superheroes watch X-Men: Last Stand.

B000K7VHQ4|2.0|Am i the only person here to have found the ending to this film a massive disappointment?  I enjoyed the story and the acting was fine although not oscar worthy and Jessica Biel's lips have clearly been enhanced since i saw her last.  Whilst intruiging and well shot this film tries for a big reveal at the end to surprise its audience and surprise it does.  I won't reveal what exactly happens however i walked away quite angry. The reason for this is anyone whom has watched the events of the film closely will know that the ending is impossible and completely inane.  I also find any film that reveals it's secrets in a short, rapidly cut flashback style montage very lazy filmmaking. Silent Hill also suffered this same problem.  How so many people can rave about this being a true masterpiece astounds me. Can't anyone else notice the absurdity of it's twist?  The real illusion here people is that so many can't.

0307237699|5.0|Please bear with me: I'll try to make this as profound as it is worthy.     The way I understand it, humans have always battled to preserve their own boundaries and culture.  The times have never been any different in that there have always been greedy and power-hungry humans, and there have always been powerless, desperate humans with nothing to lose.  Both positions have long imagined God endorses and supports their cause.      But the world is smaller now, and our population burgeoning its boundaries.  Science tells us that when a population exceeds its available resources, the population dies off.  It is a law of nature.  However, religion is cultural; and humanity needs to accept that, above all, we are undoubtedly created from the same hand. Allegiance to God must first manifest itself through brotherhood with mankind and the rest of creation, not the killing of life in God's name.     Most of the modern and developing world is currently opposed to our country, our policies, our leader.  It is not intelligent or responsible to simply say that the rest of the world is wrong and that we are righteous.   When so many people think so poorly of us it deserves our most sincere introspection.  We need to take a close look and realize that our lifestyles in this country are, by and large, unsustainable.  Period.      Even something as simple as a shrimp habit has repercussions when thousands of villages have been destroyed by corporate shrimp farms that encompass the periphery of poor island nations; and with their villages gone, men, women and children have to work in factories for pennies a day to survive.  This economic reality is equivalent, I would venture to say, to at least half of the world's population; due in no small part to cheap manufacturing of our gluttenous wants.  America, in modern times, has becomes the fat king who sits by while citizens of the world, and increasingly citizens of our own country, suffer the repercussions of our dominant, materialistic society. Our 'God-given', 'fortunate' culture was built and rides on the backs of the world's poor, but somehow most of us do not see it as our problem.       It is a gross fact--the United States constitutes 3 percent of the world's population, consumes 25 percent of the world's resources and creates 30 percent of its pollution.  That is NOT acceptable.  Our dependence on oil from a part of the world we are hell-bent on destroying could be our demise.  We currently employ a leader who deliberately bullies and draws battle lines across the world and and within our own country; for a religious, political, and economic agenda that only a minority of our country supports--with likely disastrous consequences.  This is where the times are NOT the same: Never in the history of the world has Division been such a gamble for the future of the world itself.     We are in a real mess, and we need a rare leader.  A unifying, positive, brilliant, honest, visionary leader.   In the decades since I have paid attention and been able to participate in politics, such a rare individual has not entered our political scheme.  Every election year we lament, \\"Is this the best we can do?  These two?\\"      And that is because we have the ability as humans to look in the face of another person and perceive things about them--certainly greatness (or the lack thereof).  Countless studies have been done to this effect, and have shown that with remarkable consistency, we perceive people accurately or at least the same in the first five minutes as after knowing them years later.  One can look at certain characters throughout history, and in our own lives, and see how a person's presence reflects who they are at the core.      In the case of Barack Obama, my perception (especially after reading The Audacity of Hope which was my introduction to him), is that we finally have a man worthy of President of the United States.  A man who exhibits the rarest blend of vision, passion, humility,intelligence, diplomacy, sincerity, fairmindedness and goodwill that perhaps this country has ever seen the likes of. It remains to be seen whether or not we will embrace this golden opportunity, or let fear continue to govern our great nation.        Maggie

B00002SWEM|5.0|An outstanding documentary that takes the viewer into the 'rediscovery' of a group of Cuban musicians and their eventual show in New York City.  Wonderful music and great bios of each of the Cubans.
B000F39M9W|4.0|Moussorgsky's 1867 orchestral version of Night on Bare Mountain (presumably the one presented on this disk) is, to say the least, fascinating in contrast to the familiar Rimsky rendition. The latter work - they really are two distinct compositions, as even a casual listen discloses - is a solid, fluent, refined and polished concert piece (as one would expect from the master composer and orchestrator), while Moussorgsky's is elemental - rough edged and earthy, really \\"foreign\\" sounding to a listener accustomed to Western European norms and conventions. The composer's version fascinated me and also bewildered. I loved the intense, have-at-it passion and swagger, then thrown by too-many-times repeated sections, fascinated, puzzled, and so on, nearly worn out by the end, but wanting to hear it again right away? Definitely have a listen, it's well worth it at least once. <br /> <br />If you haven't heard The Miraculous Mandarin suite, boy oh boy are you in for a ride. It's wild, weird, passionately erotic, and not a little spooky. It's one of those pieces, very like Stravinsky's Rite, that in a good performance (Salonen's is stunning and really stunningly recorded) my hair stands on end and I've got goose bumps every time. Thankfully by now there are several very good, well-recorded performances on disk, among them Charles Dutoit's with the Montreal Symphony, and that conducted by Jean Martinon with the Chicago Symphony on RCA (if it's still available). In addition to the almost frighteningly intense playing of the Chicago Symphony for the Martinon, RCA's recording engineers conjured an equally frightening, in your face sound  that is hot, humid, and lurid; maybe it was intentional, but it works fabulously. It's not your average recording, whether it appeals to you or not. <br /> <br />Many thanks to __ for your very valuable, informative, in depth review of the LAPhil/Salonen Rite of Spring. You clarify so much of what makes the several versions different, in a way it is possible for me to hear and imagine. That says a lot about a music critic in my book! I'm sorry you are disappointed with it for the reasons you give, but certainly understand. I have a couple of \\"issues\\" of my own that shouldn't deter anyone from buying this disk, since it is spectacularly fine. Another reviewer suggests this release is warrants becoming a milestone in recording history, and I'm inclined to agree, for the reasons given elsewhere. It's remarkable that the same  ballet which set  the 20th century (Western European) music world on fire, may do so again in the 21st century, by crashing through old, wearied assumptions regarding the classical music \\"canon,\\" as well as the role of composers, performers, listeners, venues, and media. Extraordinary! <br /> <br />All that said, I have considerations about the performance of this Rite that may just reflect some conservative attitudes I'm holding to. Salonen's interpretation is very good, but it's not the be all end all I see several reviewer's here think it is. It may be, for practical purposes, a standard to compare other readings to, but it has its limits, too.  <br /> <br />A fine composer himself, Salonen feels and knows the guts of another composer's work, so he can't be faulted for missing a host of nuances of rhythm and phrasing because he doesn't get them. Yet he sands down the details of Stravinsky's Rite to obtain a sleek, aerodynamic flow; and those details are an integral part of Stravinsky's composition, not Salonen's. So I suppose what we have here is a composer's reading of another composer's music  resulting in a third composition, the Salonen/Stravinsky Rite of Spring. It's a striking work in its own right (no pun intended) but it doesn't represent Stravinsky's ideas near accurately.  <br />It isn't a simple matter of a different interpretation (though Salonen takes a strong, forceful point of view and presents it straightforwardly), rather a distinct one, a major review, and recreation ofthe Rite. Therefore, it must be judged on its own terms as much or more than Stravinsky's. <br /> <br />My reaction to this recording is very positive, and may over time become more and more so (or less so, of course, but I think the positive trend likelier). But, if you want to hear more of Stravinsky's work than the hybrid, there are quite a number of excellent to outstanding recordings to choose from.* If you are satisfied with this disk and don't want to try another for now, that's more than good enough to stick with this one. The sound is spectacular, but here too there are many other concert halls waiting for your audition if you choose. Disney is unusually fine and is also a new direction in concert hall concept and design, full of potential, much of which hasn't yet to be conceived, tried, and realized.  <br /> <br />This CD aims forward to find new ground and mark new parameters for musical creation and re-creation. I hope that this release might also shed some light backward, where curiosity about great recorded performances in the past will lead to unexpected discoveries and pleasures there. <br /> <br />* Two personal favorite Rites of mine are Pierre Boulez conducting the Cleveland Symphony (once on Sony Classics) and my favorite of favorites, with Pierre Monteux conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The latter is mono sound, not the best but plenty good enough to reveal an almost shockingly primal interpretation-it all hangs out here, let me tell you, with fierce intensity and abandon one moment, fecund sensuality next, all caught up in a fevered unconscious drama of play and dance.
B000E6ESL2|3.0|Since a lot has been written here on this film already, I'll keep this pretty short.  This is a mindgame puzzle film, in that what is \\"real\\" may or may not be \\"real,\\" and your tolerance for this genre is key to whether you will enjoy the experience.  Stay is not a supernatural horror film or a suspense thriller as the marketing department was trying to sell it, really, though various moments or scenes throughout share elements with those genres.  One real reason to see it (and maybe more than once) is that it is a fascinating compendium of visual trickery and gimmicky edits, many utilizing CG.  It is sort of the running filmic equivalent of an M.C. Escher creation and probably whether you think Escher visual paradoxes are particuarly meaningful about reality will predict whether you think this is really truly deep or just formally clever and fun (count me in the latter).  Some people have claimed to find the film moving but frankly I just didn't.  To me, all the narrative playing around was way too slickly done and polished for me to invest in this or any of the characters emotionally and things felt too manipulated and contrived for the ending to really get to me.  And many of the narrative decisions seemed ultimately rather arbitrary and not entirely earned when the ending \\"truth\\" revelation finally rolled around.  I wouldn't really compare this to David Lynch as others have done; when Lynch is playing narrative games with you, it is meant to access the schizophrenic nature of the darker side of the human soul and the filmic structure creates a feeling of paranoia and unease.  Stay is not really going there; as mindgame movies go, this is more akin to Vanilla Sky in feel and aim: trying hard to be \\"art\\" but weirdly undermining itself through its oversized budget and overdeployed special effects, trying hard to say something serious about life but getting sort of lost in a bit of a new agey spiritual fog. So, a nice effort and pretty interesting to watch but not really resulting in a great film. Still, all that said, you could do much worse in your choice of how to spend an evening, and there is always the fabulous Naomi Watts to watch, though she is sadly underutilized in this vehicle.   <br /> <br />(One final P.S. to any filmmakers out there: please don't ever film a scene in a public library and claim it is taking place in a bookstore.)
B0000BWVCM|4.0|X-Men 2 starts out a little bit unorganized in my opinion, but gets a lot better as it goes on. Lots of action.. GREAT scenery and camera views during the entire movie. This is not your every day superhero movie, it has Patrick Stewart (Picard on Star Trek Next Generation) as the main character and as always with him, there is a feeling of realism to it that especially comes out when he is with children. Overall, the movie makes one wonder that if there were real X-Men in the world, how would the general public feel toward them? I would give this movie 5 stars, but like I said, it's a little unorganized in the beginning, in my opinion.

However, within minutes I was put at ease, and I will thoroughly enjoy this dvd every time I watch it, whether the season is Christmas or a hot day in July.  Great story, great message both in a secular vein and in a Christian vien, and a delight for children of all ages.  Truly, I recommend this for one's Christmas list of movies to watch over and over and over and ... you get the idea.

0385512104|4.0|The Curious Incident of the dog in the Night-time was a wonderful book that I highly recommend.  <br />This book was original and very moving. <br />I loved being able to be involved with and drawn into the mind of a young autistic boy.  <br />It was interesting to observe the way that Christopher, the autistic boy, thought and how innocent and emotionally disconnected he was from himself.  <br />For example, when Christopher found out that his mother was alive he was so confused and didn't know how to feel or if he should feel something so he formulated a plan.  <br />Christopher did this because it \\"made him feel better because there was something in his head that had an order and a pattern and all he had to do was follow the instructions.\\"  <br />He was unable to connect his feelings and was often found be scared and arranging patterns as a way to control some aspect of his life.  <br />The book was sad yet funny and touching at the same time.  <br />Someone would love this book not only because of the topic but also as a result of Marc Haddon's talented and enjoyable writing style.  <br />He was able to translate Christopher's thoughts without confusing the reader while adding humor and memorable scenes.  <br />I found that this book was very engaging and detailed; I was always urged to read on and not to put the book down.  <br />Another reason why I advise someone to read this book is because everything in it was very believable which makes the reader become emotionally attached.  <br />I recommend this book for children aged 8 and up.  <br />It is very clear and would be found attractive to the vast majority of people and ages.  <br />It is not only a book, but also a good experience, which allows someone to take a moment to be thankful and appreciate how lucky he/she is be healthy, and happy and to have a close warm family.  <br />-Olivia Gell

B00004XMV6|3.0|The physical dvd itself is encased in a rather flimsy cardboard and plastic folder.  The opening scenes looked like the transfer to dvd was made not from a master but rather from some well-worn film salvaged from a cellar.  Beyond these superficial but distracting esthetics (I guess you get what you pay for) the movie starts out with reasonable characters and circumstances.  The mental and emotional submission is gradual, calculated, and believable.  Unfortunately, the movie seems to go downhill very quickly after Basinger's first violently achieved submission to Rourke -- or perhaps Basinger's plight just became too unmistakably sad and relevant for the movie's message to be well-received.  Any possible maturation in Rourke's character as hinted by the end of the movie is weakly developed at best.

0440180295|5.0|My favorite Vonnegut novel is \\"Cat's Cradle\\", but \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is a close second.  He is unquestionably of one of the greatest creative literary geniuses of all time and is the \\"canary in the coal mine\\" for our generation.     <br /> <br />\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is written so expertly that it gives me the feeling that Vonnegut is in the room talking to me.  There are moments in the book when it seems as if Vonnegut is paused, waiting for me to comment.  <br /> <br />\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is a novel of raw and refined cynicism, optimism, philosophy, and hypothetical realism.  The book is filled with phrases that free fall through my mind long after the book is closed.  It is a book worthy of reading and rereading; it is as if Vonnegut planned the novel to expose new gifts to the reader as s/he changes.   <br /> <br />I recommend the reading of any and all of Vonnegut's books, including commentaries and speeches.       <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0791071685|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut is the purest voice of creativity of the modern era, perhaps all time.  I have read and reread everything that he's written that is available in print.  Each rereading brings into focus some nuance or framing heretofore overlooked or unappreciated.  He never insults his readers, even shares the often painful creative process with them.  \\"Player Piano\\" is my personal favorite, although \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is popularly considered his masterpiece.  When asked to name the guests for my perfect imaginary dinner party, my list always begins with the iron pairing of Jesus Christ and Kurt Vonnegut.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I saw this in the movie theatre but want to be reminded. I walked out of the theatre speechless, trying to think of things I could do. Within a week or so I was fully back in my normal life, not thinking consciously about the results of my actions. This is a really important movie everyone should see. In the extras on the DVD he gives updated info to show again highest temps on record, etc. I highly highly recommend this movie, can you tell? We bought 1 to lend out and 3 for our library (which are always checked out when we go in). Don't feel guilty when you watch it, feel motivated and find SOMEthing that you can reasonably do, to change. <br /> <br />Our kids/ grandkids are going to ask us \\"how come you didn't do anything if you knew this was going to happen?\\" because we wanted to be comfortable, we were just trying to get by, we NEEDED an SUV, I don't LIKE flourescent bulbs. These are all examples of course, but people have lots of reasons for not doing what they know is the right thing to do. It's too bad, really. BUT YES, BUY THIS MOVIE.

B00005JKGZ|5.0|Some movies can be a little whimsical and bizarre at the same time.  One of MGM's classic, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS is just that.  As a respite and escape from all the chaos that occurred during World War II, Director Vincente Minelli wanted to provide a relief. Based on Sally Benson's New Yorker essays that centered on her own life.  Minelli takes moviegoers back to 1903, a historical time in American history where preparations were being made for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904.  With the help from Benson's accounts and a Sears catalog from the era, he meticulously recreates the Victorian Age right down to the tee from the homes to the dress of the actors as well as the music.<br /><br />The film revolves around the somewhat middle-class, Smith family, who live in a quaint neighborhood in their comfortable looking Victorian home.  Indeed, the film shows major themes that typified the Victorian Age -- patriarchal family and marriage or being courted as the pinnacle to a woman's life.  The main dilemma in the storyline involves the patriarch, Mr. Smith (Leon Ames), having to take a new position in New York and moving the entire family away from their humble abode in Missouri.  This does not fair well with the family, and each member voices their doubts about New York City by blaring every negative aspect about the city from living in a tenement to not being able to make new friends, but as with most Hollywood films, reality is altered towards happy endings.  However, amidst the gayness, Minelli adds the antithesis to all the pleasantry a la Mark Twain with the youngest daughter, Tootie (Margaret O'Brien), who coincidently characterized how Sally Benson was like as a child - she took a liking towards the morbid and always talked about her dolls buried in the cemetery.  But underneath Tootie's bleakness, she represents truth.<br /><br />MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS is a sight to see.  The cinematography and the musical numbers are quite exceptional, and one can see that the film paved the way for other extravagant MGM movie musicals to follow.  The costumes, choreography, music, and the film's vibrant Technicolor are top-notch.  One of the interesting aspects about the film that is worth noting is the nighttime Halloween scene, which was shot in the evening at the MGM back lot; this had never been done before, but through the technological advancement of photographic color film it became possible. The highlight of the film are the songs, such as Judy Garland singing two Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane classics, \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and \\"The Trolley Song.\\"<br /><br />This two-DVD special edition is excellent.  The extras provide informative behind the scenes information about the film and the music compositions as well as a few surprises, such as one of Judy Garland's first appearances on film entitled \\"Bubbles\\" and the `60s TV pilot of \\"Meet Me In St. Louis\\" with Shelley Fabares playing the role of Esther, which was made famous by Judy Garland.  In addition, there is a half hour documentary of the history of MGM studios.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for an entertaining film, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS is the one.

B000K7VHQE|2.0|I can't figure out why this movie won so many awards... I can't figure out why it won any awards for that matter.  It had some cute parts in it, I guess, and I'm not mad that I watched it, but I certainly wouldn't have bought the movie if I had rented it first.  At one point in the movie, when the horn is honking over and over I turned the movie off completly... I ended up watching the rest the next day.
0316776963|1.0|This is the first review that I've ever written. However, I am so distrubed about the content of this book, I am compelled to respond. There is nothing humorous about this book. I find it rather distrubing and disgusting. Sick might be a better discription. It is a biographical story, fictious or other, of a very disfunctional individual. If you desire to go into the bowels of the . . . . go ahead. I ain't gonna go there ever again.  <br /> <br /> <br />

B000I5YCCO|4.0|On a 2 hour trip recently, I heard an interview with Taylor Swift on XM radio.  I had never heard of her, or her music but liked the songs they chose for the short show and enjoyed hearing about her (short!) life in music.  She writes, sings and plays on her first CD release, and to me, she is more talented and has a better voice than many single female artists out there right now.   <br />  So I bought the CD and was pleasantly surprised at her writing and singing talents.  I believe it is a safe bet that she will be around for quite a while.  Great 1st record!
B000HWZ61Y|4.0|just a gripe about the collectible aspect of this item. the bifolding case with plastic slip cover is such a pain to handle. you have to slip off the plastic cover to get to the bifolding case of the cd. not a one handed operation like you can with a regular cd jewel case. makes it hard to get the cd when youre driving. so dont ever lose the slip cover or you will end up with flying double cds.
0880796863|1.0|I was originally attracted to this version by the look of the packaging and the idea of the Tudor Rose back design, which I thought would be a welcome change from the unattractive blue and black plaid of the the standard Rider Waite Tarot.  I thought it would make a nice gift set.  I was never so disappointed with a set of cards!  The coloring here is atrocious: washed out yellows, mucky dull tans, blues that appear as faded green, and grainy orange dots for skin color.  The companion booklet is not much help either.  Drawn from the work of A.E. Waite, while possibly a paradigm of its time, the prose is early twentieth century and not easily read today.<br /><br />If what you are seeking is a softer alternative to the bold colors and heavy black outlines of the Rider Waite, and it is Pamela Colman Smith's images that you love, a better choice would be the [[ASIN:1572815612 Universal Waite Tarot Deck]], which has the gentler coloring but is of a far richer color quality than this dull, washed out version.<br /><br />Look further than the Original Rider Waite Tarot Pack before making your decision . . . . there are so many other options available.
0316236551|5.0|My 6 year old and I have a lot of fun with this book.  I am no artist, so I really enjoy learning and these are fairly simple.  We were on a family vacation and drew for several hours making monsters and adding backgrounds and bodies or Princess/Kings and castles.  It was very entertaining.  We even tried using the simple shapes to come up with our own faces.  We also got the train/truck book for my sign, BUT it's a lot more complicated.
0618680004|1.0|I started reading this thinking that I might read a logical, skeptical, nay scientific critique of religion. Instead, I found something right out of a Boston Globe editorial on a bad day: strings of perjorative adjectives pretending to be argument, bald assertion pretending to be evidence, an incredibly arrogant attitude, and a stance of moral equivalence incapable of distingushing between the possible strengths and weaknesses of different religions, including the militant athiesm Dawakins advocates. This is not academic analysis; it is bad journalism. As Thomas Jefferson once more or less said, sir, have some respect for the opinions of mankind...other than your own egotistical self and your amen corner. As Dorothy Parker once said, this is not a book to be tossed asde lightly, it should be thrown with great force.
B0000UI2QY|5.0|'Love Actually' is a breath of fresh air in the romantic comedy genre, a genre that is so often laden down with cliches and Richard Gere's latest claptrap. With an all star cast, 'Love Actually' takes us on a charming light-hearted jaunt through the festive season in the lives of a widely diverse selection of characters. <br /> <br />The all star cast delivers a pitch perfect performance of a humourous tale of secret love and, for the most part, happy endings. Some of the more cold-hearted reviewers accuse it of being overly sappy, however these criticisms are misguided and irrelevant. 'Love Actually' makes no pretensions at being a 'hard hitting' or 'gritty' film. Instead it succeeds at being a heartwarming, festive tale admirably. <br /> <br />Although 'Love Actually' was released as a christmas film, it is suitable to be watched at any time of year alongside your better half.

0812589041|5.0|Learning to read was a difficult task for me (as well as several members of my family). I suffer from several learning disorders, and it made the process difficult and frustrating. Even after I was able to read, I never read a book cover to cover to cover. Instead, I skipped through the boring parts as much as possible. Part of the problem was the books I was being given to read. Like most of the subjects in school, they offered nothing to challenge my imagination or intellect. That is, until I discovered Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card.<br /><br />Ender's Game was the first book I read cover to cover. Granted I was a just a little kid, but the challenge of reading and understanding this story about a boy genius who was as bored with his studies as I was yet bound for greatness thrilled and inspired me. It was the first time reading was fun. From that point on, I would be interested in reading for the pleasure of it, instead of viewing it as a boring chore.<br /><br />As an adult, I have give Ender's Game to all the young adults in my family. Many of them suffered from similar learning disorders and I was hopeful it would help them learn to enjoy reading the way it had helped me. Not only did they enjoy this book, but their parents read it and enjoyed it as well. After discovering my own mother was reading the Harry Potter Books, I recommended it to her. She loved it so much she read the entire series. She's become a huge Orson Scott Card fan is now reading his other books.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card has become an honorary member of my family. Not only has he entertained several generations of us, he has helped many of us to learn to read. We are eternally grateful.
B00005JP9V|1.0|This isn't Sci-Fi, it's garbage. Do not see it... <br /> <br />\\"Blade Runner for the 21st century\\"?  Right...  All the ecstatic positive reviews lured me to the theater for Children of Men. Sci-Fi is likely my favorite genre and the rare sci-fi movie is always appreciated. <br /> <br />But, Children of Men is NOT sci-fi. Just because it's set in England circa 2027 (LOL; indistinguishable from present day London except for a bunch of rickshaws) does not make it science fiction. <br /> <br />There is only 1 idea in the entire movie; humans are infertile. This is not explained or elaborated upon at all, and ceases being interesting about 10 minutes into the film. <br /> <br />The most reoccurring theme in the entire movie is that the government is rounding up and deporting all immigrants.  Hm...   So imagine population pressure ceases to exist across the globe; what would England do?  It's so obvious!  Concentrate all your resources on rounding up and deporting your youngest citizens.  Makes sense to me.  This is some kind of preachy, reverse xenophobia; every bit as illogical and stupid as xenophobia.  This is the worst kind of sci-fi, that which is totally implausible. <br /> <br />The only concepts which could have made this movie interesting aren't explored in the slightest.  For example, the cause of, and attempted solutions to the infertility are never discussed, the \\"Human Project\\" isn't elaborated on at all.  I guess these are less important than weed jokes and Beetles references, which are copious... <br /> <br />All the acting not provided by Owen and Caine is abysmal.  Seriously, the acting [and dialogue] was like nails on a chalkboard, some of the worst in recent memory (think Matrix 3).   Add that to the trite and predictable situations [poorly] acted out by disinteresting and annoying characters.  PLOT: meet a contact -> hide out -> chase -> contact -> hide out -> chase...   <br /> <br />Children of Men ends with a pathetic and predictable surge of over the top, Private Ryan style war violence.   This incoherent addition is insulting for a variety of reasons.  Most obviously because it is completely unrealistic; no semblance of military practice or strategy at all, except for loud noises and explosions.  And most importantly because the creators seemed to think this violence would placate and please those of us watching it.   <br /> <br />Children of Men is an insult to sci-fi, the source material and anyone who has the displeasure of viewing it.

B000J4QWMC|2.0|The original TV series of the same name was a glamorous exploration of Miami, both the legal and illegal side.  This included scenes of the various neighborhoods, interactions with locals of various ethnicities such as Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Haitians, whites, etc..., and run-ins with criminals of various flavors.  Along the way, the show had side stories dealing with local politics, local communities, and local cultures.  This movie ignores all that and focuses solely on the drug world of Miami and Latin America.  In this, it strays much from the original TV show.  The violence here is also quite brutal and ruthless, unlike the stylized violence seen on the TV show.  But there is one thing that stays true to the TV serial; gorgeous women, though for a movie based in a predominantly Hispanic area of the US, the two women leads are Chinese and black.  This director's cut shows both actresses in the nude, something that is a first for both starlets.  The storyline is unoriginal; cops going undercover to bust a drug smuggling ring.  The action is also unoriginal; shootout scenes where the good guys are dead shots and bad guys are blind shots.  Overall, I would not go out of the way to watch this movie as there are probably better choices at any video store.

B00001U0DP|5.0|I have been a high school teacher for 8 years, I love to show my students this film.  Often they have never seen it, and they are studying WWII in history. I enjoy giving them a theme essay with it, so many great themes.
B00005JPE7|5.0|This was the best of the Rocky Sequels, with meaning an emotional strength that compared to the original movie.  The story follows Rocky Balboa as he copes with the loss of his wife, and emerging estrangement with his son.  And of course he is goaded into one more fight...  Somehow they make the premise and the actual fight realistic.  And in the end you're left thinking, \\"I'm glad they ended it this way, I hope they don't do another\\"<br /><br />If you want the most fights, see Rocky 3.  The best training sequence?  Rocky 4.  The most disappointing?  Rocky 5.  An appropriate ending to the series?  See this one.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|Chinese film maker Wong Kar Wai weaves a stylish web of romance and fantasy in this somewhat disjointed story about a writer whose fiction begins where his life leaves off--or vice versa.  Starring Tony Leung, who played Broken Sword in Yimou Zhang's Hero (2002), as Chow Mo Wan, the writer, and Ziyi Zhang as Bai Ling, the vulnerable and gorgeous prostitute, \\"Two Oh Four Six\\" mystifies as it beguiles.  Worth watching just as eye candy and to hear the music in the background, 2046 appropriately enough moves between Hong Kong and Singapore, two great Asian economic tigers, and then into the future which will be (let's face it folks) Chinese, very Chinese.<br /><br />This is the first of Wong Kar Wai's films that I have seen.  He reminds me a little of Yimou Zhang in that he strives for beauty in his production, in the sets, the scenes and the costumes.  His interiors are darker than Zhang's and his scenes are more cosmopolitan, and unlike Zhang he does not aim to make any kind of social statement.  There's a touch of American film noir in his story that focuses on Chow, the existential man who makes his living by writing newspaper articles and mass market fiction while meeting and pleasing the ladies, especially the ladies of the evening.  Tony Leung's easy charm and confident manner make him a natural for the part, an deeply introspective man who likes the night life.  I thought it was interesting--and maybe this is just me--that he looked a bit like Clark Gable with that thin moustache and surefooted way with women.<br /><br />Ziyi Zhang is fascinating to watch, but so are the other actresses, including Li Gong who has a modest part as Su Li Zhen, prostitute turned professional gambler, and Jie Dong and Faye Wong who play different aspects of Wang Jie Wen.  The sense I get from Chow's point of view is a succession of beautiful women moving before his eyes and in his memory, women he had loved but somehow never possessed.  As he says, \\"Love is all a matter of timing.  It's no good meeting the right person too late or too soon.\\"<br /><br />One of the ideas touched upon here is that of the android lover.  I have little doubt that once humans are able to create life-like androids or robots, one of the first enterprises will be to make them experts at pleasing people sexually.  Another idea is that of impermanence, of time as our master, of time as fickle and malevolent with change as our enemy.  Everybody wants to go to 2046 and never return because nothing ever changes in 2046.  Or so it is said because nobody really knows since nobody ever returned from 2046--except Chow.  We can guess he returned to find somebody in the past, to recapture something he missed.<br /><br />In this way, Wong Kar Wai plays with time and human emotions.  The result is a gorgeous movie that transcends cultures and leaves the viewer wondering what is real and what is make believe.  Here's a question, where is that country from which no one returns?  Is such a place a metaphor?  And for what?  Here it is from Shakespeare's Hamlet: \\"The undiscover'd country from whose bourn/No traveler returns...\\"  This is from the \\"To be or not to be\\" speech, and that country is death.ng.

B000HEWEE4|5.0|If you are expecting explosions, speedy pacing, instant thrills, you won't find it here. But if you're looking for subtlety, pacing and a reflective style, this is your man. <br /> <br />Something of its intensity is lost in the translation from big screen to small, (there are a lot of long shots, which don't work so well on the small screen), but it still poses a viable alternative to the smart, slick, bombastic offerings generally served up to the i-pod generation (don't get me wrong, I like big, splashy commercial stuff, too). <br /> <br />The word `delicacy' comes to mind when watching this.  It's a small, small, intimate, lovingly crafted movie with sincere, unhurried, very natural performances from the cast. <br /> <br />As to how the magic happens at all, listen carefully to Cate's (Cate with a 'C' - see what Alex scrawls on the wall!) speech towards the end - when you hear it, you'll know the one I mean.  There's a scene much like it in Somewhere in Time made by `Elise McKenna', and it sort of explains everything.  But I had to watch it more than once to figure it out.  <br /> <br />Those who don't get it - i.e. thinks it's a waste of time - won't get it, and never will. <br /> <br />Maybe its gentle, reflective themes strike them as old fashioned.  Don't let that put you off.  Contrary to what others say, movies don't always have to be downbeat to have credence. Anyway, this is one movie where you can't second-guess.  It really could go one way or the other. <br /> <br />It's a simply wonderful film; One that will stay with you forever. <br />
0060723513|3.0|An very enjoyable read. Please not that the author states in the first pages of the book that this story is fiction, so I don't understand how other people are so upset that 'she has written a pack of lies...' <br />So she has created a beautiful story that reminds us to look within and to take care of our planet. She presents the message very colourful which motivates to be more concious of who we are and what we do.
B000228MYC|5.0|I bought this watch for my boyfriend, who had previously destroyed two other watches that I've bought him.  This watch is very durable.  The black on the mesh band does not peel or scratch, even if your rough with it.  The construction is tight and exact(no loose or shaky parts). The band doesn't pull out hair either which is a plus.  The overall watch is very light as well (because it is titanium and not steel).  But the best thing about the watch is the slim design. It looks even better than the picture because the watch has a very slim profile.  It is actually so thin that it looks much like a bracelet or a watch with no battery (very high tech looking).  When your wearing it, it only looks about 3 mm thick.  My boyfriend loves the watch and was very impressed with it.  It is a good buy for the price as well.  I highly recommend it and I'm a product designer.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Having screened Brokeback Mountain, I exited impacted by the ace acting, hee-haw humor, blue sky cinematography, the Western acoustical score, and the pursuit of certain societal truths, by those translating Annie Proulx's opus into a searing cinematic experience..I was most struck by Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ennis Del Mar, who captured the confusion that haunted him, post his deliberate choice to commence a double life..One need not sanction the choices of two \\"fey cowboys,\\" blindsided by an overpowering physical attraction, to applaud a well crafted film, because that's what this is, an epic, that will alienate a squeamish majority of the viewing public..The material is emboldened and controversial -- so what? -- as a film buff -- I'd rather invest time challenged by provocative material, than placated by yet another adolescent rehash of Rocky 5..The easy option is to denounce Jack and Ennis as \\"hillbilly queers\\", a pair of bleak and bent deuces, that toss their families into the cold creek, for backwater lust -- without reasoning why they are what they become?..The point is, you least expect two cowboys to shack-up?..Still, the film honestly renders its protagonists as densely short-sighted, high-spirited, and charmingly charismatic in ways you never anticipate..In the end you pay for your choices, and Ennis and Jack Twist pay overtime for their pecadilloes, their indiscretions..The bigger point is, see the movie with some sense of fair play, because life is never so symmetrically scripted that ponies stay corralled, though the barn door is left unlatched!

B0001MDP3G|5.0|I avoided this movie because try as I might I couldn't get through the audio book.  Every time I popped the tape in, the author's dull monotone would have me fighting not to drop off to sleep.  I just chalked its best seller status up to undeserved hype.  When the movie hit theatres you couldn't pay me to go see it-because of the audio book experience.  But then my best friend rented the movie and I had absolutely nothing to do so I grudgingly watched it.  Boy, was I thrown for a loop.  This is an absolutely beautiful film with wonderful actors...and at its conclusion I had big ole crocodile tears flowing from my eyes.  Even Jude Law, a man I also think is over hyped-managed to tug my heart strings.  This movie should definitely go down as a new romance classic.  Highly recommended.

B000DWMN2S|3.0|Though `Everything Is Illuminated' stars Elijah Wood as Jonathan Safran Foer, his role is not as impressive as you might think. He is more like a window through which we see a long history of some people he is going to meet, and those people should be called the real protagonists of the story.  <br /> <br />A young Jewish American man Jonathan (Wood) travels to Ukraine to find out the truths behind his grandfather's escape from the Nazi holocaust. He hires two local Ukrainians Alex (musician-turned-actor Eugene Hutz, who is very good) and Alex's grandfather (Boris Leskin) and dog called Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (yes, double Jrs). The first part of the film follows their long journey by an old Trabant car, and often very funny with the quirky (and amusing) dialogues between Alex as translator and slightly nerdy Jonathan. <br /> <br />First-time director Liev Schreiber, it seems, always insists on giving some quirky touch to the film's beautifully shot scenes and it works to some extent when the film changes its tone in the second part where the truths about Jonathan's grandfather are revealed. Look how he managed to show an old lady's house surrounded by sunflowers and you will realize Liev Schreiber gets the story's fable-like quality right. <br /> <br />But two things I didn't like about the film and one of them is the jumbled and confusing flashbacks that play a significant role in the history of these people. The story about their past is too short and looks emotionally detached. Quirky humor certainly helps make the film less sentimental in the modern part of the story, but to present the past the film needs another kind of narrative skills to draw us into its world. <br /> <br />The other complaint is that something is missing which might have been lost during the translating process from the book to the screen. You will notice many quirky traits in characters such as Jonathan's habit of collecting family artifacts, Alex's grandfather's denial of his seeing things,etc. What do they mean? You will think, and even reflect after watching the film, but they look almost pointless compared with the brief but touching moments involving the character played by Laryssa Lauret, who recounts her story with pain and grief. I know some films need to be interpreted by us (or I must read the book in the first place), but at the same time films can be confident with the director's own interpretation or vision as to the book's contents. I frankly didn't know how I should watch this film. Comedy? Drama? Road Movie? Or Everything?    <br /> <br />Perhaps I didn't find the film as impressive as other reviewers because, for all its strangely funny and engaging moments, what happens (and happened) is absolutely different. The film has many wonderful moments, but to me it lacks director's perspective or a context that connects them throughout.  <br />
B000H305U0|3.0|Justin Timberlake should give 50% of any award that he wins for this album to producer Timbaland. Their collaboration has made a surprisingly enjoyable album that makes you forget Justin was ever in that boy band. My favorite tracks are \\"My Love\\" and the last 4 tracks. The middle of the CD is forgettable in my opinion. Some of the tracks remind me of the Prince/Detroit sound from back in the day.

Bluebirds chirp, a gentle wind caresses my long grey hair, and I have time to think and formulate my next plan for shocking humanity into sensibility. Do not think for a moment that I didn't listen to music- I always do. Whether it be by some modern a go-go electronic contraption, or relying on the auto mode in my brain- it is forever there. But, enough about me (for now). Let's discuss this ground-breaking album.<br /><br />This double album on a remastered c.d. is a treasure and a joy for all time. I believe a pop-rock classic - and so finely produced. It was at a time when Elton was moving away from his earlier, soulful and funky piano compositions and exploring a new sound and new direction. It is with this album that he entered the arena of superstars, and at the time, certainly was on equal par with other notable artists on the soundstage of popular music.<br /><br />There is more gloss here. More precision than his earlier work. There is a diversity of music styles represented here. And, more than that, Taupin's lyrical topics move into areas that, heretofore, had a certain taboo about them. Many of the tunes convey an unpleasantness of society and, thus, the underlying motif, of abandoning the Yellow Brick Road to the city and residing in an uncomplicated, serene environment outside of it. The song order is also interesting. Mournful dirges to rockers- ballads to carribean excursions-tougher atmospherics to gritty rocker raves. It's all here with a talent that only rock royalty can execute with with such ease. Is it any wonder Elton is still around today? That foundation was made to last- and this gem is yet another testimony to that fact.<br /><br />It begins with a disturbing intro (akin to Halloween music) into a rocker about lost love (\\"Funereal for a Friend-Love Lies Bleeding\\"). Ironic that the beginning should be a good-bye. But it is. Then, of course, the Marilyn Monroe tribute \\"Candle in the Wind\\". If anyone out there hasn't heard this I will order running water and electricity for your cave immediately! \\"Bennie and the Jets\\"- a rave rocker about a glam group so popular at the time. Don't you think a mohair suit would itch? Just wondering. Then the semi-serious but bleak \\"This Song Has No Title\\". Interesting how it lifts up with the lyric \\"And each day I learn just a little bit more\\" - which is the hope amidst the darkness. \\"Grey Seal\\" is a grooving, jaunty tune that, I feel at least. is the wisdom of experience. It is about the seeing of reality ( a running motif in a few songs). The sun on the screen is never as bright as the real one. And I especially like the line \\"All my life is drawings from the eye\\". Isn't our own reality based on what we see anyway? (Outwardly and inwardly).<br /><br />Then it's \\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\\" with a carribean excursion about wasting away the day.<br /><br />We then get to \\"I've Seen that Movie Too\\" which alludes strongly to the movie \\"Gone With the Wind\\". Interestingly. the music is written like a backdrop to a 1940's black and white film noir. Again- Elton's genius is evident in his musical composition. This ones about seeing through illusion and seeing reality. It is disturbing dealing with finding the truth. It is a task many are unwilling to take.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" is a smooth little tune about exhorting the value of hookers in society. See what I mean about Taupin's topics? Someone had to do it. Might as well be him.<br /><br />\\"The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-1934) pays homage to a 1930's hoodlum killer that was a hero to the people. A jumpy little tune that includes some of Elton's honkeytonk talent- it, again, is creatively thought out. Listen to that drum \\"shot\\" after the line \\"some punk with a shotgun, killed young Danny Bailey\\". Things like this add so much to the enjoyment. And even better yet when you realize it.<br /><br />After the uncomplimentary observations about a \\"Dirty Little Girl\\", Taupin and Elton then turn their sights to, yet, another aspect of womenhood. A sprightly rocker, \\"All The Girls Love Alice\\" is about a daring lifestyle that a young girl pursues and, consequently, becomes fodder for older lesbians. Alice is found in a subway dead. Shocking subject matter for the early 70's. And yet- there it is. Another example of life in the Emerald City.<br /><br />Then 2 straight on (get the pun?) rockers. \\"Your Sister Can't Dance\\" and then the age-old party anthem \\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\\". Great gritty rock riffs on \\"Saturday Night\\" lift into the rock elite. Could have been done by the Stones. But, no, surprisingly enough it's Elton.<br /><br />We then tone down to the hopeless of life with \\"Roy Rogers\\". Done in waltz time the message is clear. It is time for visions and dreams. It is about escape. It is about a hero who always wins. Lifting our lives from the mundane.<br /><br />\\"Social Disease\\" is about the eternal bad example. Molded in a honky-tonk, country flavored arrangment it is one of the rarities of the album. An example of a man who is totally happy doing what he wants without the need to impress. Still, a derelict is, considered by many, not exactly something to aspire to.<br /><br />Finally, we conclude with \\"Harmony\\". Is this the girl returning from \\"Funereal for a Friend\\"? Who knows? But it is a lovely ending to this album. Smooth and glistening after such a bumpy road.<br /><br />Metamorpho is so taken with the production here and the chances they took to bring these amazing songs to life. There are many high points in Elton's career. All of them for various reasons. But this one is noted for it's risk as well as the variety of musicianship. Miss this one at your peril.<br /><br />I am going to stay in the cover just a bit longer and then come back to the \\"real\\" world. My feet are starting to hurt from the shoes Elton gave me. Yes. Seers can suffer from physical ills as well. (Although they have trained their minds to ignore it and reflect instead).<br /><br />Another review finished. Hope you all enjoyed it.

0060955775|1.0|Paulo Coelho was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1947, has been awarded France's Legion d'Honneur, Italy's Grinzane Cavour and was inducted into the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 2002. \\"Veronika Decides to Die\\" is his twelfth book and was first published in 1998.  <br />  <br />The story begins in late 1997 and follows the story of Veronika - a twenty four year old woman living in Slovenia. The book begins with her attempted suicide : however, having overdosed on tranquilisers, she is discovered in time and taken to hospital before she dies. The hospital in question is Vilette - a well known asylum in Ljubljana. Although she has survived, she is told - due to the damage the tranquilisers have done to her heart - she only has about a week to live. Having always kept herself firmly under control, Veronika finds herself broadening her range of experiences and feelings, and gradually comes to see her life as something worth living. Her arrival in Vilette also has an impact on some of the asylum's other patients - specifically, Eduard (a schizophrenic), Zedka (who suffers from depression) and Mari (who suffers from panic attacks).  <br /> <br />This is an absolutely awful book : rather than \\"beautiful\\", \\"poetic\\" or \\"inspiring\\", I've never found writing so bland. Despite her situation, Coelho finds himself incapable of establishing any empathy with or sympathy for Veronika. In fact, I even think he wrote about the wrong character - Zedka's story, in the hands of an author up to the task, is a story I'd rather have heard. Coelho's decision to include himself in the story stank of ego, and the way that he wrote that section (\\"Paulo Coelho wanted to know all the details of what had happened\\" rather than \\"I wanted to know all the details of what had happened\\") was really irritating. The only apparent hobby the patients had - a solitary pastime known to some as 'merchant banking' - was given too high a profile : Veronika's activities on this front were irrelevant and did nothing to help the story. Then again, Coelho has spent some time in an asylum as a patient - perhaps he knows something I don't. Unfortunately, he just doesn't seem capable of putting what he knows into words : avoid this book at all costs.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|If you are reading this review for an idea as to whether or not to buy the film, all I can say is that it is a masterpiece. If you enjoy intense crime thrillers, sharp dialogue, suspense, superb acting, or infinite replayibility... look no farther than this film.  <br /> <br /> The Departed follows two undrcover men who are extremely devoted to the same mission. Billy Costigan(Leonardo DiCaprio) is an undercover cop who means to spy on Boston crime boss Frank Costello(Jack Nicholson). Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon) is undercover for Frank Costello, attempting to spy on the Boston police. The two both face challenges reaching a level where they are considered trustworthy in their opposing organizations, but the real trouble starts when they discover there are moles in BOTH sides. The men must now find out each other's identities before the truth finds its way to their \\"employers\\". Costigan and Sullivan ALSO happen to be falling in love with the same woman...Who will be able to silence the other first? <br /> <br /> The acting is truly marvelous in this movie. DiCaprio as the in-too-deep cop, Damon as a loyal mobster, Nicholson as a wise-cracking crime lord, Martin Sheen as a fatherly police chief, and the list goes on. Great music, great sets, great shootouts, good script,...This movie has it all. One of my favorite movies to come out in a long time. The only movie (in 2006) I could see over and over again, and still be on the edge of my seat. You owe it to yourself to give this one a shot.
B000HIVO64|5.0|I haven't stopped playing this album since I bought it a month ago. It totally rocks! One of my favorite tracks is Dark Star. This is by far the best Beck album yet.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|The product was 1978 comedy movie that I absolutely loved. A must see for old movie lovers.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|Perfect condition. Came sooner than expected. Just in time for X-mas. Thank you.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This movie was not his first,but anyone who admires his talent needs this in their collection.  This film shows the begiinings of what would become an award winning actor. I only wish the other actors in this film would have done as well in later years Aidan Quinn is a treasure.
0739326740|5.0|Dan Brown takes you on aa trip that gives you insight into history and background of the formation of much of our modern beliefs,,,, we need this to explore the truth and take away  so much of the false doctorines we were taught in sunday school.
0060594896|5.0|This is a great book! It has something in it for everyone. It has made me think more about what is going on in my life. We all get caught up in working and existing. This book has helped me step back and reflect on where I am and  then showed me how to look forward to where I want to be. Buy this book! You will not be dissapointed!
630463949X|4.0|Bought this DVD for son who has wanted it for several years.  I watched portions of it with him on Christmas Day.  It was a very entertaining DVD and was excellently recorded.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This film should  be required viewing for every person on this planet.  It is a wake up call to all humans.  Some might argue that it goes a little too far and is too dramatic but I didn't mind that at all as it may be be necessary to wake most people out of their fantasies about what is really hapenning on Earth.
B00092ZL80|5.0|What a great DVD set. These 2 bands really complement each other. When they play the opening and closing sets together, it's something you really have to see to experience. I was lucky enough to see them live during the summer of 2005 in Mansfield, Massachusetts. What a great show and what energy both bands put into the show. Chicago has always been my favorite band ever since I can remember and throw in a supergroup like Earth, Wind & Fire and it makes for some of the best music you'll ever hear.
B000E5N62U|4.0|Got this album on iTunes for a quick road trip.  At first listen I was not impressed.  Ok, typical incredible Fagaen recording, but lacked the magic.  My wife said its all been done before and nothing new. Could not argue this with her. <br /> <br />I thought it deserves another listen and all of a sudden the bass line form \\"Morph\\" really sticks with me.  Man this sounds good and makes me tap the foot. This is a great song!   <br /> <br />The rest of the album is fantastic!  A very complete steady album that is very listenable all the way thru.   <br /> <br />Im back to buy the surround version as this album will stand like the others.  Does it break any new ground?  Not to me, but its great! <br /> <br />By the way, if you don't have it, check out Becker's \\"11 tracks of whack\\" recording.  Still ranks as one of my favorites.  I wish Walter would do another effort soon. <br /> <br />Why 4 stars?  Im stingy and don't just give them away. I think 4.5 would be in order.  This is the second copy I am buying so thats a good endorsement.  5 stars about has to make me cry or has to be on my play list for 10 years.    <br /> <br />\\"Is there gas in the car?\\"  Yes, there is still gas in the car!  Long live Fagen and Becker!
1878424777|5.0|This is a great book if you are interested in gaining control of your relationships and the freedom to be who you are. While society has conditioned us from birth, this book gives you the opportunity to redeem yourself and reclaim your life. It is very easy to follow and made a lot of sense to me. The basic agreements are simple steps that if you adhere to them will change your life. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants increase the power over their lives and to share it with anyone they care about.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Part 2 of a movie to rule them all
0385484518|1.0|something -- anything, really -- to scribble about. There's no wisdom, no ideas, not even good writing; it's crudely emotionalizing vapid tripe and nothing more. The only thing I felt was (assuming this Morrie guy was a real person) sorry for him to be used like that. Save your time.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Although I would only say this movie is about the same as the rest of the Pixar line-up (or maybe even a little lower) my 2 year old son has been watching it non-stop since the day of its DVD release, and it is by far his favorite children's title. It's a daily request and excellent tantrum causer when denied. We and our relatives have also contributed to the run on fossil fuels by accumulating multiple Cars license toys to go with my son's infatuation with the film. So if you are shopping for someone in the 2-5 year old male demographic, this is the movie to get. The transfer seems to be excellent and there are two short titles thrown in as bonuses that aren't bad either.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|Not a beatle fanatic by any means but I have been revisiting them the last few years and have come to enjoy them \\"again\\". <br /> <br />I have the special edition verson. <br /> <br />Regarding this recording, I am not sure I \\"LOVE\\" it.  Its interesitng to say the least but im not sure what it accomplished.  As it being a sound track for the show I understand,  but I can't fully endorse the remixing using other parts and say is all that great.  It sometimes seems \\"busy\\" for the sake of it.  Some of it works, some of it does not.  Its almost like a test recording where you can \\"name the Riff and where did it come from!\\". <br /> <br />I like remixed music.  Its fun and can refresh a classic. This was a very ambitious effort and im not overly disappinted in it.  If anyting it makes me want all the remastered catalog to revisit further this benchmark supergroup.  Maybe that was the intention, to reintroduce the music to a new generation and spark interest in the others! <br /> <br />4 stars because its a wonderful clean recording, a technical marvel and its Beatles!  Can one give less than 4 stars to them?  I can't!
B000ICLHIE|4.0|Like Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits is what he is.  You take him or leave him, but you ain't going to change him.  And if you leave him, well, that's probably just fine by Tom.  (Van Morrison would be in this select group too if he still weren't so caught up in hammering away over and over at music business insiders and assorted others who, he feels, done him wrong.)  For me, Tom lands right in the sweet spot and Brawlers and Bawlers are just about flawless.  Favorites:  the uptempo and atypical Lie to Me, Bottom of the World, Lord I've Been Changed, Road to Peace (would like it better if it were two minutes shorter), The Return of Jackie and Judy (an album of Ramones covers -- now there's an idea!), Sea of Love, Rains on Me, Long Way Home, Danny Says, World Keeps Turning, and the truly wonderful Young at Heart in which he channels Jimmy Durante.  One disc is much the weakest of the three discs.  It sounds tossed off, and -- as the title would suggest -- a collection without a family roof to fit under.  Even here, there are three or four keepers -- Two Sisters, First Kiss, Home I'll Never Be and The Pontiac -- but overall I'd rather Tom have not unleashed these [...] on the world.  But taking just the first two discs, this is 5 plus stars.
0618680004|2.0|\\"When people stop believing in God, they don't believe in nothing. They will believe in just about anything.\\" Chesterton<br /><br />In \\"The God Delusion,\\" Richard Dawkins sets out an epic quest to vanquish the forces of theism any and all places they may be found. To the sophisticated theologians who he in advance sees reading his book and smugly adding, \\"But I don't believe in an old white bearded man in the sky, either,\\" Dawkins is quite refreshing in saying upfront that he doesn't believe in any God, no matter how traditional or postmodern He is conceived. In this, he freshly brings to my mind his English writing forebear, ex-atheist and Christian convert, C.S. Lewis. Lewis recoiled at those who wished to look `deeper' than the outward sign of baptism to find `true' Christians, a task that in the end renders the descriptive word `Christian' into a meaningless colloquialism for `good person.' Likewise, Dawkins has no time for those who would turn the word `God' into a synonym for any force or perceived power that they believes guides their life, as if broadening the word `God' would undercut Dawkins's critiques of belief in the Deity. If language is to help us, it must not be reduced to nonsense. For the sake of understanding, let's leave words in their plain meaning of descriptive explanation of concepts, and avoid finding the deeper and truer senses of words that render them useless.<br /><br />Following his clarification of terms, Dawkins sets out to disprove God through a study of science, particularly his own field of evolutionary biology. His task leads him to offer a hypothesis of how we could have evolved to become believers in deities, an explanation of why he believes we (both non-believers and believers) do not take our moral advice from the Bible, and a dissection of why he believes religion to be not just a harmless false pastime but an active evil needed eradication.<br /><br />Imagine yourself in the middle of the desert. You come upon a pocket watch. Could this watch have come together by chance? No way. There is obviously a designer who put the pieces together to form the watch or at the very least gave the instructions to those who did build the watch. This is the basic argument from design; when we look out into the world, the places and organisms seem too complex to have come into existence without an intelligent designer.<br /><br />The sun appears to go around the earth, but we now know this is not the case. Perception is not always reality. The perception of design is another falsehood. It may seem that complex organisms must come from intelligence, but in fact, Dawkins says, intelligence in an endpoint of development, not the starting point. The basic question is; is Intelligence the force propelling creation (theism)? Or, is any and all intelligence we see the end product of a process that goes according to natural scientific laws without and intelligent design (atheism)?<br /><br />Dawkins here is recasting the old grade school atheist's question; \\"well, if God exists, then who created God?\\" He can't comprehend, despite his intelligence, witty writing style, and vast evolutionary biology knowledge, that religious people believe that there is a Being who has always existed and it is He who is behind the whole of creation we see. That is not the part of his book that needs real quibbling with. It is in his exposition of morality that he falls far short.<br /><br />Dawkins points to old Levitical and Deuteronomical laws and regulations that we rightfully don't follow today in order to point out that we don't get our morality from Scripture. Our modern morality, he says, comes from purely Enlightenment sources. He unfortunately fails to see that Enlightenment moral principles are the attempt to adopt Christian morality and dress it up as if it came from their own analysis based on reason. Yes, Dr. Dawkins, our morality really does come from Scripture. We do not arbitrarily pick and choose it based on time specific Old Testament (or New Testament) laws, rules, and regulations. For example, the practice of masturbation, called onanism by those who want to show off their vast vocabulary with a biblical phrase, is not condemned by Christianity because of the sin of Onan. Onan, because of cultural custom, was required to marry his dead older brother's widow Tamar. Any children begotten would be considered sons and daughters of his dead brother. Not accepting this, he chose to spill the seed outside of Tamar. His \\"sin\\" was not masturbation, but not living up to his cultural duty; a cultural duty we now rightly regard as a societal anachronism. Christianity condemns practices such as what is wrongly called onanism--and other practices such as fornication and idolatry--not because of specific condemnations scattered throughout Scripture (though they may be present), but because of general theological themes present throughout the Bible. The Church does not condemn gay marriage because of that famous \\"homosexuality is an abomination\\" phrase that rightly should be seen in its historical context of other laws requiring such absurdities as the stoning of indolent children. It condemns gay marriage because of the beautiful theological truths present, for example, in the Genesis creation stories that teach how man and woman are created for each other, and man is not complete without his companion. The Church may also condemn practices not appearing Scripture, such as abortion, nuclear war, and drive-by shootings, because she reads the implicit theological messages the Bible is richly filled with.<br /><br />Dawkins is passionate in his crusade to usher the world into an enlightened age devoid of theistic belief, but, like the 1960's predictions of the Death of God, the writings of Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett and friends will fade into obscurity and people mystifyingly (to the cultural elites) will remain religious, until the next generation of atheist prophets pop up again.based on time specific Old Testament (or New Testament) laws, rules, and regulations.

B00005JPKC|4.0|This is a well-made, honorable movie that somehow didn't quite click on an emotional level for me.  I'm an admirer of Eastwood's understated directing style, where he let's the actors do some acting without having to add frantic editing and other tricks.  He clearly believes that well-written characters, well-played by well-cast performers is about 80% of the trick to directing a good film...and he's mostly correct.  MILLION DOLLAR BABY, MYSTIC RIVER & UNFORGIVEN are but a few examples of his \\"less is more\\" style.  They are longish movies that give the viewer time to get to know the characters...yet they never really drag either.   <br /> <br />LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is extremely well-crafted, and is well-acted by a group of actors largely unknown to American audiences (exception being Ken Watanabee, whom we all got to know for his excellent work in THE LAST SAMURAI).   The young men who portray the doomed troops abandoned by Japan to defend the rocky island of Iwo Jima are all very good, and it takes almost no time at all to get used to reading the subtitles.   <br /> <br />Eastwood also does a good job of evoking the landscape of the island.  I've never been, so I don't know if it's accurate, but my impression after seeing the film is that this rock was a pretty uninteresting place.  Lots of desert landscapes, with volcanic  hills and very dusty beaches (there are some evocative scenes of soldiers going up the dunes near the ocean, kicking up so much dust that they can barely be seen).  It hardly looks like a  place worth shedding so much blood on.   <br /> <br />There are some powerful scenes.  The most horrific involves a scene of mass-suicide.  A squad of troops believes they have been ordered to kill themselves because they have failed to defend Mt. Suribachi from the Americans.  Some of the soldiers know that their general has ordered them to retreat to fight another day...but most refuse to credit this order and they begin to kill themselves one by one with hand grenades clutched to their bodies.  It's brutal and amazing.  You shake your head and wonder at the mindset that could lead to this.  And you also cringe for the young men who clearly are only doing what they feel their society wants them to do...none does it with anything but sadness.  It's a gory mess, and it will rattle the toughest moviegoer. <br /> <br />Another good scene features the Japanese meeting a wounded American soldier.  The frightened American meets a Japanese officer who speaks English and has good things to say about America.  The soldier draws touching comfort from this gentle contact, and after he dies, the officer reads to his men a letter the young American had from his mother.  The soldiers are all greatly moved by this simple letter...it puts a human face on the enemy. <br /> <br />But a lot of the film feels generic in its scenes.  It's hard to get any sense of the strategy being employed or of how much time is passing.  I have NO idea from watching the film how much time passes from when the Americans land to when the Japanese were completely defeated.  It feels like it could be two days or two weeks or even more.  To me, this is a mistake...a context that is lacking.  The film simply got a little repetitive.  Groups of outnumbered Japanese soldiers running from one spot to another, most of them being mowed down by American firepower on the way.  To me, rather than making me feel the random chaos of battle, I just felt like I was being left to fill in the blanks of what was going on for myself. <br /> <br />Part of the problem is that this style of rapid-fire, chaotic \\"war action\\" was done so well with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that it has frankly lost much of its power to stun.  Eastwood isn't quite the action-engineer that Spielberg is, so IWO JIMA suffers some in comparison.  RYAN did a darn fine job of showing me the carnage, randomness, brutality, gore, etc., etc. of men in battle.  That movie shook me to the core.  But sense that time,war movies that have followed cannot quite get the same feelings from me by showing similar (but inferior) scenes.  This is not to say that war movies have no power to stun anymore...far from it.  But these particular types of action scenes don't quite cut it anymore.   They feel derivative now. <br /> <br />The best parts of IWO JIMA are the quieter times, when the men (of high rank and low) consider their impending deaths, and we feel their sense of loss.  The knowledge of all the things they won't be going home to.  Their desire to draw meaning from the sacrifices they know they are about to make. <br /> <br />The movie is worth seeing, absolutely.  It is 140 minutes long, but the length was no issue for me.  I think I simply wasn't moved as much as the hype had led me to believe I would be.  I suggest going to see it without any preconceived ideas, if you can, and you will find it a unique glimpse at World War II, and at the effects of combat on those on the front lines.  Eastwood has done another stellar job on a film whose scale just occasionally exceeds his grasp. <br /> <br />(On the subject of \\"revisionist\\" history...I too am a bit uncomfortable about the depiction of the Japanese as being on the same moral level as the Americans.  It is well-documented [Bataan Death March, anyone] that the Japanese commited many atrocities on a large scale level.  My own father-in-law often spoke of arriving at POW camps after they had been abandoned by the Japanese guards only to find all the detainees had been slaughtered.  Someone needs to make a modern day movie version of James Clavell's KING RAT to show some of that horror.) <br />
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is a wonderful CD arranged by George Martin, who was part of the genius of The Beatles.  All the music seems fresh and new, even though it is simply rearrangements and recompilations of original Beatles tunes.  To hear John Lennon's voice on Strawberry Fields is particularly bittersweet.  Thank you, George and Giles Martin, for helping me remember why the whole world was in love with the Beatles.

It's clear, it gives some solid psychological background, enough information to start and continu with lucid dreaming for a long time. It's got everything i read somewhere else and more in it. If you get one book on lucid dreaming, this will have to be it.
1400031524|4.0|In Henning Mankell's \\"The Dogs of Riga\\" police inspector Kurt Wallander finds himself alone and possibly in peril in post-Soviet Latvia. He is truly a stranger in a strange land.   <br /> <br />The plot of \\"The Dogs of Riga\\", the second in Mankell's Kurt Wallander mystery series, is fairly straightforward.  Two bodies wash up on the southern coast of Sweden, near the town of Ystad.  Police Inspector Kurt Wallander is placed in charge of the investigation.  The investigation reveals that the bodies had drifted across the Baltic Sea from the Republic of Latvia. A Latvia police detective arrives to assist Wallander before the investigation is turned over to the Latvian police force.  However, Wallander is soon obligated to travel to Riga, Latvia's capital.  Wallander is immersed immediately in the Byzantine politics that engulfed Latvia and the Baltic States in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet empire.  He doesn't speak the language, he knows next to nothing of the political situation he has walked into, and yet plods on, determined to get to the bottom, not of the murders of the two Latvians, but of a new-found Latvian friend and colleague.   <br /> <br />Mankell's Kurt Wallander series is often compared to the Martin Beck detective mysteries authored by the husband and wife team of Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall. Wallander, like Beck, is a police detective in Sweden. Unlike Beck, whose beat was Stockholm, Wallander works in the small southern-Swedish city of Ystad. The Wallander series takes place in the 1990s while the Beck series took place in the 1960s and 1970s.  Although I tend to prefer the Beck series, the Wallander books are entertaining page-turners.   Mankell stays well within the `police procedural' formula and has not tried to reinvent the genre.  However, he has done a good job, in these first two volumes in the series, of developing the character of Mankell and his supporting cast of characters.  Wallander is no Sherlock Holmes and gets results more by perspiration than inspiration.  He is also a fully drawn character. We see him dealing with the break-up of a marriage, an estranged daughter, and a father who is developing senile dementia.   The supporting characters, particularly his fellow detectives, are also well drawn.    <br /> <br />Although I think I like the Martin Beck series a bit more, the Kurt Wallander series, so far, has been entertaining.  As noted, Mankell stays well within the confines of the police procedural.  However, he manages to put together an entertaining plot and keeps the reader `engaged' with his recurring characters.  Mankell does not hide clues from the reader.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  I found myself seeing `clues' throughout this piece wondering if and when Wallander would spot them.  Some may find that not to their liking, but it kept me entertained.  Recommended. L. Fleisig <br />
B000IHY9UW|5.0|This is one of Val Kilmer's best movies.  If you didn't know you would actually believe he was Morrison. If you haven't seen it you need to and if you dont' own it you should especially if you are a Doors or a Kilmer fan. I give this movie two thumbs up.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|There was never any doubt in my mind that Daniel Craig would make a sterling James Bond as I have seen most of his edgy, out of the box film roles in \\"Layer Cake,\\" The Mother,\\" Sylvia,\\" \\"Munich,\\" \\"Road to Perdition\\" to name several. Craig is and has always had weight, focus and importance on the screen. And as James Bond he brings all of these qualities to bear and \\"Casino Royale\\" is the better for it.<br /><br />Many actors were rumored to have been considered for the re-inventing of James Bond and Daniel Craig was not a popular choice but his interpretation here should put all the naysayers at bay for Craig more than re-invents...he makes this part his own.<br /><br />Martin Campbell (\\"Goldeneye,\\" \\"Beyond Borders\\") stays clear of all the wham-bam, thank you M'am special effects of all the former James Bond films and concentrates on the things that make all films important: character, relationships and emotional commitment.<br /><br />The James Bond of \\"Casino Royale\\" (it was the first in Ian Fleming's series of books on Bond) has just been given the so-called honor of the \\"007\\" impranteur and, though he has been an operative for a time, he is still considered the odd man out, the dangerous one, the one who will stop at nothing to solves his cases. On the surface this would seem like the ideal government spy but the operative word here is \\"government,\\" the biggest block of bureaucracy there ever is or was and as such \\"it\\" requires Bond to follow procedure as M (Judi Dench) reminds him time and again.<br /><br />The Bond of \\"Casino Royale\\"is physical, violent, without too much conscience, sexy, fit: more likely to kick you in the groin than serve you a glass of White Burgundy. But this Bond also has a heart and, though he has a couple of dalliances with women, he makes a real connection to one in particular, Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. Though I would have liked somone with a warmer, cushier screen presence than Green, this romance also sets up what is to become of Bond, romance-wise for the rest of the Bond series of novels and, I assume....films.<br /><br />The action sequences are personal and physical (the kind that you never saw Brosnan do) as well as excitingly staged and produced. \\"Casino Royale\\" marks a change of direction and focus of the Bond franchise and from the evidence on the screen, I would have to say it looks like the producers have a winner in Daniel Craig and a homerun in their first outing with him.for the rest of the Bond series of novels and, I assume....films.  <br />The action sequences are personal and physical (the kind that you never saw Brosnan do) as well as excitingly staged and produced. \\"Casino Royale\\" marks a change of direction and focus of the Bond franchise and from the evidence on the screen, I would have to say it looks like the producers have a winner in Daniel Craig and a homerun in their first outing with him.  <br />

B000JLTRKE|5.0|September 11, 2001, will forever be burned into the minds and heart of American; but Oliver Stone has created a movie that resurfaces the suppressed emotions that were felt as each survivor was pulled from the rubble of the World Trade Center.  This movie does an excellent job of evoking the fear, sadness, frustration and anger that was felt around the world that day as the lives of thousdands, from 87 countries, were taking in the terrorist attacks on the U.S.<br /><br />This movie evokes tears within the first five minutes.  There is no slow lead-up, the movie jumps right into the first terrifying events of that day.  And from that point, the movie remains fast paced.  I often found myself sitting just as I had that very day, with my hands clasped in front me, in a prayer like position, with tears streaming down my face.  And unlike many other emotion-evoking movies, I couldn't not stop crying once the movie ended...because unlike other movies, this was real; all too real.<br /><br />World Trade Center is a MUST SEE drama.  No matter your political stand, it is a movie you will enjoy because it is something that all of us American suffered through.  Oliver Stone took the politics out and focused only on the heroic tales that came from that day.<br /><br />It's a movie that you not only want to see, but own!
B000J4QWMC|5.0|Miami Vice, I think, is a very good film.  I saw the movie in the theater, but bought the DVD of the \\"Unrated\\" version because I liked the film, even more than some other people who have criticized it.  Overall, I find Michael Mann to be a very engaging director, his films very competent and compelling, and I like listening to his video commentaries. He's directed a lot of excellent films. Incidentally, and this is an argument defending the films mentioned here, some people thought \\"Heat\\" was too long. I try to understand people's arguments about these things, and I'm always willing to listen, but somehow I just figured these criticisms as much more inferior than the Miami Vice movie, an extremely intelligent actioner in the mode of Director Mann's Heat with Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, but with the visual extravagance in photography, in props, in script, and in the streamlined plot.  Miami Vice, especially the preferred Unrated Director's Edition available on home video, is a genuine interpretation of the original and popular television series from the late 1980s.<br /><br />The director, Michael Mann, was propelled into theatrical film making because of his work on that show.  He went on to create the truly-first film in the series of Hannibal Lechter movies: Manhunter.  The more recent Red Dragon movie is actually a remake of Manhunter.  Mann directed Heat with Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, and a hoard of other famous names.  He directed The Insider with Al Pacino, and Russell Crowe in his best performance.  He directed Ali, the Muhammad Ali boxing movie starring Will Smith and Jamie Foxx, a film also enduring lackluster reviews despite its competence.  He directed Collateral with Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise, a widely well-received film, for which Foxx received a supporting-role Oscar nomination, but instead received the Best Actor Oscar for Ray of that same year.  And now, he stars in this Mann film, at least their third director-actor collaboration, and this film has been panned by the public as \\"too much talk,\\" \\"not like the show,\\" or \\"more violent,\\" criticisms all of which have been completely off.<br /><br />Perhaps the masses are too finicky about artistic treatments to semi-mainstream products.  Such is the case with Miami Vice, a very-good-if-not-great actioner worthy of no less than a four-star rating.  What this film needs and deserves is critical support; but, don't depend on some writers to change their views from the mainstream here.  This reminds me of the early reviews on Ridley Scott's film, Blade Runner, which only a few critics supported originally, meaning they completely disliked it, and yet since have canted their opinions to make that film become widely accepted as a five-star classic holding the reputation of the then-minority.  I only wish I knew what the people who spoke negatively about the Miami Vice movie were thinking when they watched it.  Their attentions have been ignorant at best.as been panned by the public as \\"too much talk,\\" \\"not like the show,\\" or \\"more violent,\\" criticisms all of which have been completely off. <br /> <br />Perhaps the masses are too finicky about artistic treatments to semi-mainstream products.

0141304642|5.0|Esio Trot is just tortoise spelled backward! That's the secret to Mr Hoppy's magic spell, the one helping him win Mrs Silver's heart by causing her beloved tortoise Alfie to grow larger. The moral message is that Every Little Bit Counts, the illustrations are cute and well incorporated - at one point Mr Hoppy descends a flight of stairs made up of the text, and the book is short enough to be a bedtime story or a child's first BIG book. Like other Roald Dahl, it's also a bit twisted.<br /><br />Dahl uses common techniques with great success to make the story appealing to children: cute animals; an obvious (but uncommon and necessary) moral message with enough hints dropped for a child to grasp it before it is stated outright; presentations of ingenuity - like the turtle grabbing machine, that can be grasped but not too simply. Their subversion is pure Dahl. From the simple jokes a child could never get away with outside the sacrosanct world of books (\\"Poo is a very strong word in any language,\\" Mr Hoppy said, \\"especially with tortoises.\\") to Mr Hoppy's central trait of deceit, for which he is never called out and is in fact rewarded, this isn't quite what you expect from a children's story. Mr Hoppy isn't presented as a hero though - what's being cheered are the ideas at play. Except for making him the central character in a children's book, Dahl does nothing to characterize Mr Hoppy as a Sweet Old Man, going as far in the other direction as the passage \\"You never know,\\" Mr Hoppy said darkly. \\"You never know.\\"<br /><br />The author's note showcases Dahl's childlike ability to embrace conflicting ideas without question, explaining another part of what makes him appealing. On one hand he laments the horror done to tortoises imported to the UK from northern Africa, but on the other he shames his government for outlawing the practice and keeping families from buying tortoises.
0385486804|4.0|A young man, after years on the road away and deliberately alienated from his family, walks into the Alaskan wilderness and never returns. His body is found weeks later, leaving all with a paralyzing riddle: \\"Was Christopher McCandless happy when he died?\\"<br /><br />There is another question that centers around Chris McCandless. Was he an idealistic icon or a self-serving anti-hero? I think the answer falls somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />Jon Krakauer captures both elements of McCandless and spares nothing in terms of who Christopher truly was. Chris is viewed as not only the risk-taking intellect with a broad understanding of the essential, but also as a self-consumed rebel who's flagrant disdain for his parents drew along lines of deep hypocrisy.<br /><br />But it wasn't those elements of the story that frightened me. It was the cold, lonely way in which Chris suffered and died and the statement that keeps echoing from the pages as I read, seemingly from Christopher's own ghostly voice saying, \\"Was it worth it for me? To be this icon? To be the featured character in a new Sean Penn film? To be lionized by thousands? To live my life on my terms? No. I'm dead. And dead is dead.\\"<br /><br />I tried to force something that wasn't there, that Chris was happy when he died. Maybe he was, but Krakauer keeps from spoon-feeding us any such possibilities (thankfully) and leaves us to rely upon Chris' own haunting journals in the last weeks of his life. McCandless' words, as you will see, play more like a young man in quiet regret than a man who wished to spawn some modern-transcendental ideology. Even so, I am not sold that Chris was either regretting his decisions or praising his own free-spirited actions. I think it is a balance of the two.<br /><br />And it's in that moment of doubt as I read, trying to discover where Chris' mind rested in the last week of his death, that I grew afraid. That, coupled with an eerie picture of Chris in the front flap that seems to call out a warning to those who would follow the young man's footsteps, are enough to keep me from embracing the flamboyant view of life that Chris captured; or at least, to follow that view to the lengths he did.<br /><br />A very good story of decisions and the risk that comes with defying society.seems to call out a warning to those who would follow the young man's footsteps, are enough to keep me from embracing the flamboyant view of life that Chris captured; or at least, to follow that view to the lengths he did.  <br /> <br />A very good story of decisions and the risk that comes with defying society.   <br /> <br />

It is absolutely, amazing, the power in Buddy's voice at the age of 70! This CD is a little different than most of Buddy's blues. A few softer songs in collaboration with other stars, are included. But it's hard to believe, that Buddy, flawlessly hits high notes, I forgot he could hit, and if you're not paying attention, you'll get scared when he throws in a few of his patented \\"growls\\"!

B00011F5DK|5.0|I originally bought this game to have something to pass the time with my family and friends during recovery after surgery. I was literally laid-up and had to stay off my feet as much as possible (after major foot surgery). This game was/is great to play. You really have to think out your moves or eventually you'll lose. Spreading out your pieces from the corner is an excellent strategy I've discovered because it will eventually box in your opponent(s). I can't recommend this game highly enough. Try it you'll be hooked!
B000HCO83Q|3.0|I would like to give this one star or, if possible, no stars, but they put a lot of work into making this movie and gave it an honest effort. this seems to me a movie that probably looked really good on the drawing board, but that didn't come together well on screen. Wihtout spoiling it, I'll tell you I laughed when a certain carachter died in the movie instead of caring one iota. I think you can watch this movie and let your mind vegetate, but other than that it's not worth much. The only thing that keeps it out of the B-movie slot is the good acting, the hottie women, and things blowing up.

B00004XPPE|5.0|As a child of the '50s I can remember when the book came out, reading it and being terrified how the world could end at any minute. When the film was released it showed no softening of the message, but the impact was lost due to the release of Kubric's \\"Dr Strangelove\\". Somehow Peter Sellers humourous spin on things coupled with the superb final vision of Slim Pickens riding down on the bomb to the sounds of \\"We'll meet again\\" just had everyone I know crying with laughter at the stupidity of it all. Surely nobody would let this sort of thing happen, would they?<br /><br />. Looking at this film again many years later and it seems to have regained it's power to depict the frighteningly easy way in which we can slip into the abyss. The superb acting of Henry Fonda and Walter Mathau bring a terse and well written script to life, with the young Larry Hagman totally believeable as the Presidential interpreter.<br /><br />As we watch events unfolding in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the race of uncontrollable powers in the Third World to produce and stockpile nuclear weapons along with their delivery systems, \\"Fail Safes\\" chilling message becomes as relevant today as  it did so many years ago.<br /><br />Watch this film, then look at our present day political leaders. Apart from the fashions, has anything changed? The starkness of black and white as opposed to colour filmstock only serves to underline the warning that there is no middle way, we have to choose now as we had to choose then.<br /><br />A superb film that every thinking person will do well to watch and keep alongside \\"Schindlers List\\", both as a warning and a lesson.<br /><br />BUY IT!

It's a disney film. Just enjoy the beautiful colors, more than tolerable story line, exceptional music and campy laughs. I did rewatching it for the first time on dvd.<br /><br />One final point: Disney goofed in that they being one of the most left-wing liberal organizations out there mistakenly presented the Gospel to the world in cartoon allegory.<br /><br />Think about it: The only Son of the Most High becomes human, and dwells among men, \\"discovers\\" himself, all the while perfoming a myriad miraculous feats. How does he become a \\"True Hero\\"? By sacrificing himself for the one that he loves...His bride.<br /><br />Alright, it's a bit of a stretch and surely unintentional, but it still works. It's a beautiful thing!
B000JJS8TM|1.0|The truth is I am very unhappy with the cd release. I can understand the reasons why they produced the album, and why many would like it. But I was expecting a much different album where they mixed and sampled the different tracks in order to create brand new songs. A few added riffs or segues doesn't necessarily improve a song, and in general I felt that the \\"new\\" songs sounded too close to the originals (in some cases, identical). If you expect a revolutionary change to the classic Beatles songs, then it'd be better to look for something else.

That could be due to my taste and that I revel in 80s nostalgia, but I'm dissapointed in what is produced by the pop machine that is the radio.  So along come the Killers to change all that.  Say what you will about 80s music, but the Killers somehow capture the best of 80s music, mix in some new elements, and create a very lovely album here.  First off, the songs are full of hooks.  Nothing more needs to be said about Mr. Brightside, Somebody Told Me, Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, or All these Things that I've Done.  What is amazing is that every song on here could easily have been a single.  I haven't heard an album like that in a long time.  There is no filler here.  Smile Like You Mean It and Andy You're A Star are right up there. <br /> <br />What the Killers manage to do is not only capture elements from great bands like New Order, but they also have the songwriting abilities and energy to back it up.  The album, much like the energy of Brandon Flowers and co, never tires.  I have tried, but I cannot get sick of this album.  I have not thought that about an album in years.  The Killers show a lot of promise here and on the follow up.  I hope we see a lot of em in years to come.
B00005JPDY|3.0|In this film, which had some greatness in its grasp, the viewer is treated to an extra hour of standard 'intrigue' and tragic 'double-crossing' so that by the end in fact the boredom takes over and one is left feeling hollow.  Based ona semi-real characters dealing with the first twenty years or so of the CIA the historical narrative and view into the 'old boys network' of the WASP elite that ran the CIA after the OSS was wrapped up in the wake of World War Two, this protrait is good. However the back story of a bunch of agents analyzing a tape in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs failure and eventually tracking down the 'mole' only to run into a bunch of James Bond like double-agents is tragic.<br /><br />A decent film that has much to be desired.<br /><br />Seth J.

B00065GX64|5.0|\\"Who knows what it's like to be me?\\"<br /><br />An anguished cry from a tortured man, one that can't help elicit sympathy, despite the fact that the man in question in a serial killer.<br /><br />\\"M\\" is a revolutionary, incredible movie in many ways. It began the career of Peter Lorre. It was the last gasp of German Expressionism before the Nazi takeover. It is, in many ways, Frtiz Lang's best film. It's haunting, moving and memorable like few other movies ever are.<br /><br />Many people today forget what a major impact German cinema had on the development of movies. Starting with [[ASIN:6305075492 The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Special Collector's Edition)]] in 1920, and moving up through movies by greats like F W Murnau ([[ASIN:B000055ZB8 Nosferatu]], [[ASIN:B00005ASOS Faust]], [[ASIN:B0002DCHQA Sunrise - A Song of Two Humans]]) and Fritz Lang ([[ASIN:B00007L4MJ Metropolis (Restored Authorized Edition)]], [[ASIN:B0001UZZS6 The Testament Of Dr. Mabuse - Criterion Collection]]), Germany manged to put forth some of the best, most amazing images ever projected up onto a screen. Who can forget the arrival of the plague ship in \\"Nosferatu\\", or Rotwang's robot in \\"Metropolis\\"? These images are iconic in our society, a fact made all the more interesting when you consider that not long after \\"M\\" another German would make the Swastika a very memorable and iconic image.<br /><br />\\"M\\" tells the story of a serial killer who preys on children. We see him meeting a young girl as she goes home from school. We see him buying her a balloon. We see her mother wondering why she isn't home and calling out her name as the camera focuses on the pathetic place setting for a lunch the girl will never eat. We see her ball rolling away into the dirt near some bushes. We see her balloon rise up into the telephone wires.<br /><br />As the populace gets more and more concerned about these killings, the Berlin police get more and more frustrated, as does the criminal element. Sales of their various wares are down. Business is hurting.

B0009XT8YW|4.0|This was one of the best albums of its time, I still listen to it. I've always liked these two artists and when they collaberated on this album, it was my most played album in my Striesand collection
B00003CXCW|5.0|\\"I AM big! It's the PICTURES that got small!\\" <br /> <br />So we have one of the best, most remembered lines from Billy Wilder's best film, the other well known line being \\"Alright, Mr de Mile. I'm ready for my closeup!\\" <br /> <br />I saw this film for the first time yesterday. It was everything I'd hoped for and then some. Though it was made in 1950 it, like all classics, most notably Wilder's \\"Some Like it Hot\\", still resonates today. <br /> <br />The plot to this dark comedy/drama/horror film is simple: It opens with a corpse floating in a pool, and a narrator describing the life of an out-of-work screen writer (William Holden), trying to avoid repo men, hides his car at what he thinks is a deserted mansion, only to find it occupied by Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a famous film star from the silent era, and her butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim). After some minor misunderstandings, he gets recruited to polish up her dream screenplay, an adaptation of \\"Salome\\". The rest of the film covers her growing attraction to him and his semi-willingness to be used by her. <br /> <br />Norma Desmond is portrayed as a sad, lonely, borderline insane woman who haunts her old home, living in the memories of her golden past when she got, \\"17,000 fan letters a week!\\". She still gets some, though it's revealed they are being mailed by her butler. She was unable to make the transition to talking films. She dreams of making a comeback, or as she calls it, a return, but would never dream of simply going to the studio and asking for a part. No, it has to be on her terms, with her film \\"Salome\\", which, of course, must be directed by Cecil B de Mile (who, it's worth noting, appears in the film as himself). <br /> <br />William Holden does a wonderful job as screenwriter Joe Gillis. He's a hardworking writer, but he's had a lot of writer's block lately, and is on the verge of returning to Ohio to work for a newspaper when he encounters Norma. He knows she's just using him, and doesn't seem overly surprised when she claims to be in love with him. He lets her buy him lavish gifts, and offers no more than a token protest. When, at one point, he gets the guts to leave, he finds that she's attemtped suicide, and returns to her. <br /> <br />Erich von Stroheim's performance as the butler, Max, also deserves plenty of attention. Just like Max, he was himself a director, making the film \\"Greed\\", regarded as one of the best of the era, though also a very LONG film, clocking in at eight hours on it's first cut. He is one of Norma's ex-husbands, and goes out of his way throughout the movie to do whatever he can to protect her. <br /> <br />The film is very savvy about Hollywood, more so than even most movies today. In addition to de Mille's appearance, you can also spot Buster Keaton playing one of the \\"waxworks\\" at Norma's bridge game. Portions of the film take place on Paramount's studio lot. The film is well informed about the movie industry, but doesn't cram that knowledge down your throat. <br /> <br />Gloria Swanson, no relation, sadly, was, like Norma Desmond, a major figure during the silent era. When Desmond says, \\"Without me there would be no Paramount [Studios]!\\", it could well be Swanson herself talking. Unlike Norma, she continued on after the films \\"got small\\". She had a career in radio, and later in TV, and seemed content in her life. She was 53 when she made this movie, younger than many famous actresses today. She died in 1983, and left behind a wonderful body of work that awaits rediscovery by a new generation of film fans.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Every family has a few crazies, so nearly everyone can RELATE to this movie.  You might have to overlook some of Grandpa's improprieties, but once you do, you will be laughing at how some of these adventures could happen to any family - including yours.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|\\"Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good an' they die out. But we keep a'comin'. We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out; they can't lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa, 'cause we're the people.\\"     The history of the Dustbowl Era is one that looms large in the minds of most of my family. The mere fact that some of us were born in Washington to people that came from Kansas and Oklahoma explains volumes about what it must've been like in those places back in the day when you could have a wonderful crop one year, and the next year you could be turned out of your house and home.     John Ford's 1940 film version of John Steinbeck's \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a flim like none other. Listed on many critics film lists as the best ever made, at least prior to \\"Citizen Kane\\" showing up in that position starting in the late 1950's, it tells the story of the Joad family, uprooted from their home in Oklahoma and sent hurtling into a new life in California.     As the family travels to California, they deal with many setbacks, including the deaths of two of their clan. When they finally reach California, they find that a glut of cheap labor has led to depressed wages, meaning that for a whole day's work they earn barely enough to scrape by.     Eventually after many trials and tribulations, the family reaches a camp run by the government (with a camp superintendent played by a man who actually did run such a camp in reality). There the family finds a safe place to live, decent wages, and a hopeful future... at least until the past catches up with one family member.     While Henry Fonda plays the protaganist in this movie, the real stand-out star is Jane Darwell, who played Ma Joad. From her first real scene, where she expresses concerns her son might've turned \\"mean\\" while in prison, to a touching farewell to her possessions when she tosses them into a stove before leaving, to the end, where she has one last dance with her son then gets the last words in the film (those at the start of the article), every moment she's on the screen is incredible. It's a movie worth seeing for performance alone. Women like her are, to a great extent, what this country is built on.     This was also a very political film. It was one of the first films to show poverty, true, soul-crushing poverty, in the United States. Most of are fortunate enough not to know what it's like to nearly starve to death (heck, put all the family together and we'd start to influence the tides), but in the not-so-distant past people were starving, dying, on the streets of our nation. Not because they were lazy, or foolish, but because they were being destroyed by a system that had left them to fend for themselves.     It also explored, somewhat obliquely, ideas of Communism that were floating around at the time. There was a large, simmering, vocal minority that believed only Communism could save the workers of the world from exploitation at the hands of big business. Looking at the way the world was then, one begins to sypathise.     All in all, this is a very personal film that's also quite epic. You see the sweeping panoramas for which Ford is rightly famous, but then you also get the small strokes, the tiny personal touches, such as when the children see flush toilets for the first time. It's a must-see for anyone interested in history, and anyone interested in film.
B0000CFW87|5.0|What a fine talented young man. With every note he makes me feel refreshed.
0887307280|2.0|I read this book after an acquaintance highly recommended it.  I was not as impressed with it as she was however, for a variety of reasons.  First, the book is poorly written and therefore can be difficult to read at times.  Additionally, the writing style made me doubt the credibility of the author.  Disregarding that, the first half of the book contains very little useful information, if any.  It seemed like the author spent the first half of the book trying to convince me that it was a good book to read, and that he had a good point that was worth trying to understand.  I almost stopped reading it  halfway through because it seemed like such a waste of time.  When was he going to get to the point?   <br /> <br />The \\"meat\\" of the book started with Part 3 (out of 3) of the book.  At that point, the information became more useful and I stopped wanting to put the book down.  He brought up ideas and concepts that really do make you stop and think about your own business, how you're running things now, how you're going to change the things you're doing, and what your actual goals are.  I don't think his concepts are perfect, but at least you start thinking about how the concepts he discusses might positively or negatively affect your business.  Part 3 is worth reading if you've already purchased the book, received it as a gift, can borrow it from a friend or the library, etc.  If you're looking for a good business book to purchase, however, spend your money on another book- you'll get more bang for your buck. <br /> <br />In summary, save yourself time and skip to Part 3, prepare yourself for a cheesy and poorly written conversational style, and then figure out how the strategies discussed fit with your business.

B000J103PC|5.0|Meryl Streep nailed this part. One moment you wanted to poison her coffee and the next she actually allowed you to see her human side, in an industry that can rip you to shreds. Anne Hathaway was perfect as the ingenue who was routinely called fat for being a size six, hadn't a clue about fashion and has to make a decision between being envied and being happy. Supporting actress Emily Blunt was superb as the bitchy personal assistant, who ate nothing but a cube of cheese a day to keep her figure and keep her from fainting. <br /> <br />Can you tell that I loved this movie? One would think that this is strictly a chick flick but most of the guys I know that watched it also thought \\"it was good.\\" High praise.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I've only had this for about two weeks but we've used it every day (sometimes several times a day).  Does exactly what we bought it for.  Perfect for quick clean ups after dinner and just for general sweeping in the kitchen and on our hardwood floors.  This product is a real time saver and a MUST have for parents of little ones.  I actually ENJOY using it - even my five year old likes to sweep with it.  No trouble with the battery yet.  It does say in the instructions not to keep the battery in the charger for more than 24 hours at a time or it will deplete the battery life.  I've been extra careful about that just because of the previous reviews.  I wouldn't really recommend this for carpeting because it definitely doesn't do the same job.  But for hard floors you've got to have this!
0143036742|3.0|Lewycka has produced an easy read that is funny at times, with one or two laugh out loud moments. Valentina is a vivid antagonist who lights up every page she appears on. The father-daughter conflicts and seething sibling rivalry make for some excellent comic moments. Where the novel falls down is when it tries to evoke tragedy in glimpses of the family's past suffering. Lewycka certainly has a comic touch, but the sense of regret and decades-old pain she attemps to evoke here is beyond the faltering power of her prose. She is more David Lodge than Nick Hornby. I enjoyed the read, but forgot most of it within days. Sometimes you want a book like that, so if you are in the mood for a light read, you could do worse than A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian.

B00005QGAT|5.0|Michael Jackson may well be one of the most popular artists to have ever graced the pop charts, but even buyers need know that his album releases have a tendency to be inconsistent. Arguably his greatest creative period, was between 1979-1982. The beginning of this period, was when he dropped this album \\"Off the Wall\\", that many argue was his finest album (although \\"Thriller\\", was the greater commerical success). This album with the legendary production of \\"Quincy Jones\\", was to seamlessly mix Pop, Funk, Soul into a firecely chorrent album, that set a new creative high for Pop/Urban albums.  <br /> <br />Opening with a pair of Urban-pop tunes (\\"Don't Stop 'Till you get Enough\\" & \\"Rock With You\\") that were as heavily steeped in sophisticated R&B-pop showcase with a definite disco slant, as they are sublimely crafted pop tunes, the remarkably thrilling vocal performances from Michael chime beautifully with the brilliant songwriting, and intoxicating blend of strong melodies.  <br /> <br />These were cleverly followed by two resolutely Dancefloor orientated numbers in the shape of \\"Working Day and Night\\" and \\"Get on the Floor\\", that proved to be as vibrant & as colourful tapestry of alluring funk, and thrilling vocalism, by the real secret to there success was the driving and enormously catchy strings, guitar and Disco Beats (courtesy of \\"Quincy Jones\\"), that proved to be the most easily identifiable trademark here....so much so, that both songs are usually recognisable after the first 5-6 seconds of play.  <br /> <br />\\"Off the Wall\\" is a dazzling array of Funk guitars, subtle strings and horns, and still to this day remains a rousing and deeply dramatic piece of dance-styled mainstream pop, that definitely ranks among the best uptempo songs ever written. Again the double contribution of both Michael's gripping vocal performance and the virtually flawless production behind this track, marked this track out the become, not only a lead single, but quite possibly the most popular song of the album.  <br /> <br />The production team on this album takes something of a backseat here, as Michael gets to truly express his vocal range, with the stunning ballad that is \\"She's Out of My Life\\", and so proving, not only be a pop singer of some remarkable distinction, but also able to push his vocal range up several levels and deliver effortlessly skilled ballads. And also of having the double effect of giving the album enormous diversity.  <br /> <br />And along with the remaining tracks, that are all equally worthy of praise, you have not only one of the greatest Pop/rock albums ever made, but arguably one of the greatest albums ever made...period. There is no Filler on this album, and few could argue against Michael's singing/Vocal performances, which were virtually flawless, and not enough praise is given to Quincy Jones for embuing this album, with such a beautifully orchestrated production, that without either (Michael's singing or Quincy's production), the album just couldn't possibly hope to be the success that it was. As to whether this album or \\"Thriller\\" is Michael's best album, will continue to be debated, but both of what quite possibly are the finest collection of pop/rock albums ever made, should unquestionably be a part of anyone's collection.  <br />

B00006AG5N|5.0|All my adult life, I had completely dismissed Elvis Presley.<br /><br />I had heard that he never wrote any of his own music.<br /><br />I had heard that his producer had once remarked that if he could find a white man whose music had a black sound, he could make a billion dollars, and I had heard that Elvis was that man.<br /><br />I had heard Elvis's tamer hits played in grocery stores and elevators, as I bought dish soap or looked for a clock.<br /><br />I had heard all these things, and I had ultimately dismissed Elvis as a sort of pre-packaged icon invented by a record company--a 1950s Peter, Paul, and Mary--or a one-man Spice Girls.<br /><br />What I hadn't heard, however, was this CD, and when I finally did, my opinion changed immediately.<br /><br />This compilation is absolutely packed with outstanding songs, many of which still sound revolutionary today.  The manic drums and vocals and guitar and background vocals of \\"Hound Dog\\" must be punk rock's earliest manifestation.  The background vocals of \\"(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I\\"--that come in almost a full minute before the lead vocals--are still unique, even today.  And the playfully undulating volume levels and vocals and drive of \\"Suspicious Minds\\" help to shape what I think has to be one of the greatest, most soul-filled songs ever.<br /><br />Some of the songs are, of course, better than others--for instance, I could live without the merely tolerable dirge of \\"Crying in the Chapel\\"--but overall, this CD is priceless, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves music.  Anyone.

We bought this game for a family member for Christmas, but we loved it so much that we bought another one for us.  It's a great game for anyone 6 years on up!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Loved the price of the CD and ease of ordering.  I do believe the shipping and handling charges are over-priced knowing how much it actually costs to ship an item as small as a CD.  I do not like the fact that if I bought 4 of the CDs I would have to pay the same shipping on each of them.  That is an inflated charge which will probably keep me from ordering multiple items in the future.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is the most important film I have ever seen. It is IMPERATIVE not only that you see it, but that you convince everyone you come in contact with the urgency of doing whatever they can to deal with the \\"inconvenient truths\\" of its subject matter. Nothing else in your life will ever be as important as this, once you understand the problem and what's at stake.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Can't stop listening to it.  Even my kids (age 17 and 9) love it.  They just seem to get better with age.  Songs performed flawlessly - where did they find Steuart Smith (guitarist who replaced Don Felder) - unbelievable sounds from country to slide to rock to 12 string on Hotel California.  Highly recommended.
B0007OCG56|5.0|..I don't understand all the comments about how the husband is \\"too perfect to be believable\\".  He's not perfect, he's weak.  He allows himself to be walked over, and is so anxious to keep the peace that he does not defend his daughter or the employees.  This type of weakness is a serious flaw, in my opinion, because it causes others to believe that he is giving tacit approval; he's more scared of his wife than protective of his daugher.  I still like the husband, but I guess I am commenting on the other reviewer's comments, which I frankly don't understand.  I had no idea that Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni were such good actors.  Thumbs up for an absorbing movie!
B00006FR47|4.0|When Chicago V was released in 1972, the US was still at war in Vietnam, and Richard Nixon was nearing the end of his successful first term as president. But fatigue was gripping the nation and the band as well, which had been in the pop-musical spotlight for the better part of four years. Some of that fatigue is apparent on this, the first one-album release since the band's formation.<br /><br />Listening to this album now is a different experience that it was when I was a high school sophomore. Then, I was more excited by the band's big hits like \\"All is Well\\" and \\"Saturday in the Park\\" (whose opening piano chords even I could play!) but less excited by jazz and experimental music. Now, I can measure the change in my musical tastes by my appreciation of the cuts that did not become hits. \\"A Hit by Varese\\" is (mostly) a classic piece of energetically-syncopated brilliance. \\"While the City Sleeps\\" has a phenomenal show of triple-tonguing brass technique and neatly expresses the 70s paranoia that \\"men are scheming new ways to kill us and tell us dirty lies.\\" But something new has crept into the lyrics of several songs -- the disappointment that many Americans are still compacent about issues the band cares about. The disparity of reactions is expertly rendered in \\"Dialogue\\" in which Terry Kath and Peter Cetera play two faces of the American political divide. Kath, as the activist and anti-war voice, tries to goad Cetera into expressing upset over the continuing war and poverty. Cetera plays the happy college grad student oblivious to social ills, who only \\"hopes to study further...and...keep a steady high,\\" presumably with illicit drugs. That Cetera wins over Kath (and that the song is seemingly shut off mid-riff) has the intended unsettling effect.<br /><br />\\"Chicago V\\" has serious flaws, even in its hits. \\"All is Well\\" is a sweetly-harmonized and doleful look back at the painful end of a love affair. But the horn solo that Jim Pankow inserts into this graceful tune is mechanical and inappropriately edgy. And it doesn't take a PhD in musical theory to hear the opening bars of \\"Saturday in the Park\\" as flatfooted and unsophisticated. That the producer spared the red pencil on the badly-performed ad lib horn solos in the middle of \\"A Hit by Varese\\" is emblematic of the album's problems.<br /><br />Anyway, enough griping. Even longtime Chicago fans like me who have outgrown their youthful infatuation with the band will find gems here. The brass solo in \\"Now That You've Gone\\" is as bright and breezy as any of the band's best. \\"Dialogue,\\" heard in the context of a foreign war waged by an unpopular president, (sadly) resonates today with the same wicked insights as it did 35 years ago -- undoubtedly the reason Chicago still plays it in concert. \\"State of the Union\\" and \\"Goodbye\\" are solidly-constructed and listenable in spite of not being hit material.<br /><br />Suggestion: don't buy the CD for the bonus tracks alone! \\"Song for Richard and his Friends\\" is an expressionistic anti-Nixon piece that attempts to satirize the administration's pomposity and overreach with extended improvised feedback guitar. Listen to \\"Free Form Guitar\\" on the band's first album for a better example of Terry Kath's guitar genius. \\"Mississippi Delta Blues\\" is evidently a first attempt at the piece, but Kath's tentative stabs at shaping the tune's melodies sound nothing like the wonderful result that eventually landed on the band's 11th album. And only the most devoted fan wants to hear any of the band's hits (the marvelous \\"Dialogue,\\" in this instance) diced and sliced to fit the procrustean bed of AM radio's infamous 3-minute slot.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Chicago V\\" has terrific music that can be admired by fan and non-fan alike. Like them or not, Chicago was a terrific band whose combined talents occasionally crossed the line into musical sublimity. And for that, I am grateful and a still a fan.and inappropriately edgy.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Now that the DVD can be ordered I thought it best that I move my review from the theatrical release page to this one. <br /> <br />This new twist in the ongoing saga of James Bond is sure to please and entertain devoted Bond fans. After a long hiatus by the action spy figure, British actor Daniel Craig is chosen to resurrect the Ian Fleming character and Craig does it with a vengeance.  <br /> <br />What makes this film unusual is that it opens at a time in the life of our favorite secret agent before he earns his \\"00\\" status. (I guess that makes him just plain old \\"7,\\" not to be confused with \\"7 of 9.\\") He earns the coveted status before our very eyes by completing his second kill and a hesitant \\"M\\" (played by Judi Dench) promotes him.  <br /> <br />There's no honeymoon for our hero because his lack of experience as a \\"00\\" agent is evident as several important assignments go awry and bring a great deal of unwanted attention to MI6. Sparks fly between M and Bond when M expresses reservations about his progress as a \\"00\\" and Bond seems unsure of himself as he stumbles over his own two feet while honeing his lethal skills.  <br /> <br />With no time to feel sorry for himself Bond must quickly discover and foil a terrorist plot by Alex Dimitrios (played Simon Abkarian) and his beautiful but deadly wife Solange (played by Caterina Murino) to blow up a passenger airliner. Bond's investigation leads him to the Bahamas where he finds himself in a high stakes poker game attended by Dimitrios that requires a $10 million entrance fee. MI6 bankrolls Bond's seat but sends the lovely Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green) to safeguard the cash. Unfortunately, the faltering Bond manages to lose the entire stake in the card game.  <br /> <br />Another unexpected plot twister is that Bond falls madly in love with his partner, Vesper Lynd, and even resigns from MI6 to spend the rest of his life with her. I thought Bond's only true love interest was his wife Patricia; who was introduced to the storyline in \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" and subsequently killed at the end of the movie. It seems Patricia was the second time cupid nailed our Casanova of cloak and dagger and Vesper was the first. Needless to say, the romance doesn't last. (You'll have to watch the movie to find out why.)  <br /> <br />This rip roaring spy thriller is laced with plenty of intense action, sex appeal, and drama to keep your heart pounding throughout the film. The movie depicts the humble beginnings of the world's most celebrated spy before he evolved into the suave debonair secret agent that exploded onto the silver screen over 40 years ago.  <br /> <br />The larger than life James Bond character brings a whole new assortment of nifty gadgets to thrill and excite the audience. Yes, Bond is back - and not a moment too soon.
6305910324|5.0|One of my all-time favorite films! <br /> <br />I echo reviewer D. Knouse sentiments (excellent review, by the way) when he said, \\"One of the deciding factors I use to determine whether or not I will purchase a DVD is, 'How many times will I want to see this film?' Well, as far as this DVD is concerned I'm nearing the double-digits in viewings.\\" <br /> <br />I completely concur! <br /> <br />First of all, Josh is just adorable and what the other reviewers have said is so true about the genius of the game and the interplay of the characters.  However, what I found especially appealing is the frustration of the father.  As a father of five, I found myself connecting with this character, Fred (Joe Mantegna).  Fatherhood is an \\"on the job\\" training experience.  Most people fail to understand how frustrating it is to attempt to be the perfect father. Fred is searching for the right mix; how much to push his prodigy son, when to pull back, etc.  Of course he is frustrated! <br /> <br />I really felt that this film portrays what anyone would say is a typical loving father in a VERY atypical situation without a roadmap to direct his way.  He is trying his best, knowing his best may not be good enough, yet he continues trying! <br /> <br />Personally, I thought that the mother, Bonnie (Joan Allen), simply did not fully grasp the greatness of her son and so unjustly dismissed the coach. <br /> <br />The coach (Ben Kingsley) who was attempting to re-create the genius Bobby Fischer, simply did not realize that an even greater genius sat before him - a genius that could master AND enjoy the game while still maintaining a BALANCED life.  Of course, this realization finally dawns on the coach as he watches Josh's final play of the match. <br /> <br />This film demonstrates that the true victory in life is the friendships and relationships we have one with another.  Victory can be found not in achieving continual successes, but in the value of learning from our defeats and mistakes; for we are human and if success is not always guaranteed in life, failure is inevitable. <br />
B000GFLAI0|5.0|While I'd never considered myself a big Bob Dylan fan in the past, I do consider myself one now. Terrific tunes.
B000002I2G|3.0|Undoubtely the least populair of the 6 Jim Morrison era studio albums and that is not only because of the use of brass and strings alone. After having released 3 other albums, the first two being more a pair together, and with \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" (without the title track which appears on \\"Morrison Hotel\\") which sounds more towards what in latter days is called popmusic (here not meant negative in any way), The Doors unveiled their fourth release with an orchestra and several sidemen. Gone is the original 4 manbandsetup (vocals, keyboards, guitar and drums), in which place bassplayers (among them Doug Lubahn who shows up one more albums) sax, trombone and english horn appear, together with mandolin, fiddle and also congas. It is therefore no surprise that the already familair  bandsound has changeds somewhat, to say the least. There are only a mere 8 short tracks and it ends with another epic, the titletrack. Not on all the songs do they play with other musicians so it is sort of a mixed up album and therefore not very consistent. If they wanted to sound completely different from the earlier albums they succeeded but it did them not very good. The opening \\"Tell All The People\\" is not a Doors song in the sense of earlier songs and sounds more towards Frank Sinatra. You can hardly hear the band, it is more Morisson with an orchestral backing. \\"Touch Me\\" is complete different, it really wins with the help of a brass section. The same can be said of \\"Wishful Sinful\\" with strings. Omitted is a song in the same vein \\"Who Scared You\\" (then only available on the first compilation \\"Weird Scenes inside the Goldmine\\") and information is scarce wyh exactly this song was not on the album. The same goes for \\"Whiskey, Mystics and Men\\" (which never at all appeared on any album) with its own remarkable instrumental setting, including a jugblower, mellotron, marxophone and mandolin. I find that if these two beautiful songs were on The Soft Parade album this would have been more on balance. They could easly change their place with \\"Wild Child\\" and \\"Shamans Blues\\" which, being very strong songs and have more the original Doors sound, would have found a far better place on \\"Morrison Hotel\\". The other songs \\"Do It\\", \\"Easy Ride\\" and \\"Runnin Blue\\" are not very special, although pleasant to listen to. Closer \\"Soft Parade\\" is not one song but fragments of different songs made one. It starts with an announcement \\"You Cannot Petition the Lord\\"  (on its own also on \\"Absolutely Live\\"/\\"In Concert\\" and \\"Live in New York\\" on the Doors Box Set), the second piece \\"Can You Give Me Sanctuary\\" is just beautiful but then Morisson comes across the third part where he again croons like Sinatra. Not very Doors like though. Afterwards he is having all the fun there is and shows it, he shouts it litterally. Form there on the song goes on and on for some more minutes and builds rapidly up.  But all together it is less strong than \\"The End\\" or \\"When the Music Is Over\\" which have a more tight soundspectre. All in all this album again shows the songwriting and performing musicianship of the Doors as a band and their ability to experiment with other styles and involve new musicians but whether they succeeded in finding a new fanbase is in dubio. Likewise they did not play much of its material live. In total it was more a real studioalbum than mentioned to play outside.

0613325419|1.0|This has to be one of the most overpriced and under-satisfactory books ever. Nearly $20 for an ultra thin book the size of a Dr. Seuss story, completely devoid of pictures, but because it has Rowling's name on it, they feel compelled to overcharge the unknowing public. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, and if you do, don't pay full price. Absolutely and completely NOT worth it.
B0001907DA|5.0|Absolutley every Police Academy movie is good. Considering the fact that there is seven of them, I dreaded buying them all seperatley. But then I found this, the box set including all seven of them! It is a great deal that you cannot beat.
0618551050|3.0|Unfortunately this reminds me of the furore over einstein's theory of relativity some decades back, (and newton's calculus further back), when it was roundly attacked by people who did not apparently understand it very well.  It seems that here many reviewers are saying, well I did not understand string theory, and now thank heaven the author has given me leave not to.  Books in which the author claims to be on the right track and to be exposing others as charlatans tend mostly to have a short halflife in the intellectual firmament.
B000LC55F2|5.0|\\"The Prestige\\" is moviemaking at its best - engrossing story, fine acting, beautiful production, and a lingering presence in your mind long after the movie is over.  I saw this in the theatre on New Year's Eve, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes, it's a bit long. And constant twists and turns in the story line may leave some viewers baffled or irritated. But I found it fascinating on every level, from its portrayal of century-ago theatre to the philosophical questions it raises at the end. One of the best movies of 2006.
B00005JPAJ|5.0|I saw BABEL last night and I was deeply moved to tears by the end of the movie. This film is not only compelling and riveting but complicated as well. The movie interlocks four different stories all rolled into one. I didn't think that the movie was going to be as good as I thought it was. The beginning dragged on a little but it quickly picked up the pace and from then on it moved at full speed to the climatic ending. Brad Pitt (who I've never been too fond of) is excellent as is Cate Blanchett as his long suffering wife who is at the face of death through the entire film. Everyone in the cast is fantastic, the acting is great as is the writing and directing. Gael Garcia Bernal as a small time punk with his share of an evil streak is very good although he's hardly in the movie is always good to watch. The kids nanny mexican actress Adriana Barraza and the Japanese girl (her name escapes me) are both fantastic in their roles. BABEL is a movie that one must see with an open mind, eyes and ears. Is not your average type of movie. It is one that will leave you thinking long after the credits roll in the screen. It is a story about humans that experience highly complex situations in their lives and somehow it involves and touches more than one family. Highly recommended for those who appreciate movies that pick at their brains and forces them to take a deep, hard look at the world in which they live in and examine their lives. The plot of this movie is one that can happen to anyone at any time and the scary thing is that it has happened before and more than likely will happen again.
B00004XQP4|4.0|I know it's an uncommon opinion, but I actually find that \\"Warning:\\" is Green Day's finest hour. Although it doesn't have a certain slacker charm that made \\"Dookie\\" identify with the masses, that's okay because the group got older. Where \\"nimrod.\\" was the group experimenting outside of punk, it was somewhat unfocused and not one of their better records. However, they totally took a swing with the right direction on \\"Warning:\\" <br /> <br />This record is NOT a sell-out. But then again, they are like Metallica and U2, where their success gives them many critics. But the guy from Green Day could never have cared less. This album has some of their greatest song-writing, even though not quite everyone would identify with it. Here you hear instruments in the mix like mandolin, accordion, and harmonica. They totally experiment on the track \\"Misery,\\" although that one is great. \\"Waiting\\" and \\"Macy's Day Parade\\" are Green Day classics. The former has power-pop hooks that got people sold on the band in the first place and the latter is a great acoustic-style track. I think if you have an open mind for this style, you'll enjoy it. It seems like people who liked \\"American Idiot\\" would enjoy this record as well. It is a less epic and theatric album, and more easily digestible, at least for me. <br /> <br />Definitely recommended.

074356619X|4.0|Years ago I read Norman Vincent Peale's books on Positive thinking/attitude. It kept me in the right frame of mind to succeed when others typically give up. The Secret is the new century's version of these thoughts. I really enjoyed the Movie/DVD version, and I have purchased several extra copies for my 24 and 26 year old children. I now have the Book, the book on CDs, and the DVD movie. If you are looking for a practical \\"How to\\" book, the Law of Attraction by Michael Losier is short and well written. After one of my daughters watched the movie, she asked me several questions which I was able to answer by showing her the Law of Attraction book. Enough said.
B000BNI90O|5.0|At last ! Most movie soundtracks either propose a compilation of songs that you only heard a few seconds of in the actual movie or the principal musical themes of the characters and main scenes. <br />And how many times have fans heard a beautiful piece of music in the film only to buy the soundtrack and discover it's not on the CD. <br />So thank goodness for Howard Shore ! <br />After reviewing the special edition DVD's of the the Lord of the Rings movies, it was quite obvious that Mr Shore (like us) fell in love with the musical atmosphere of Middle Earth and relinquished leaving when all the movies (theatrical and DVD versions) were finished. <br />And so, for the greatest pleasure of movie soundtrack lovers (combined with Lord of the Rings fans) the first of three boxes of the complete recordings from the LOTR trilogy is a pure delight.  <br />Yes, many have remarked on the price of the 1st box, but frankly, I personally think it's worth every dollar ! The presentation of the 3 CD's + DVD is beautiful and the booklet is most interesting as a really detailled printed \\"how to make the music\\" guidebook. <br />One can only look forward purchasing the \\"Two Towers\\" version and later on the \\"Return of the King\\".  <br />Again, the final price tag is rather high, but this type of edition (complete recordings) and it's quality is rather rare, to say the least, in the movie soundtrack world and the music itself is timeless, so it'll give non-stop pleasure for years and years !

0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere is an excellent fantasy book (as my review title implies :p) based in modern day England. In the book, Richard Mayhew is a young man who's decision to help a wounded and bleeding girl he finds lying on the sidewalk. This act propells him into the world of London Below, a dark, magical version of London that cannot be seen by the inhabitants of normal London, also called London Above. When Richard returns to London Above and finds that he doesn't exist there, he is forced to stay in London Below and help the girl he found on the sidewalk in her quest to find out who killed her family, and why.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much and will watch it many more times.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|The movie begins with a car crash. We have no context for this accident and while we see a main character walk off unharmed and later show up in a psychiatrist office -- we have no idea what's happening. Watching this film is like being in a dream where the scenes change from one place to another and they hold together in a weird sort of way but when you stop and think about it, it doesn't make sense. <br /> <br />There's very little one can say about the plot without spoiling the film for the first time viewer. The scene to scene fades are fabulous, many of the scenes are visually stunning in the set up and beauty. The plot which is basically a psychiatrist treating a patient for a peer while she's on sick leave and the patient claiming he'll commit suicide is simple because as you move on nothing is as simple as that. You keep coming up with context that works for a while and then falls apart as the movie continues to be replaced with another supposition about what's happening. <br /> <br />I happen to love these movies where I'm thrown into the deep end not knowing what's going on and having to make my own reality out of it. Others hate this kind of film. For me, who likes to question what I'm watching seeing this on DVD is great because I can talk while the film is running and back it up if I miss dialogue. It's a film that really gets you wondering about the line between life and death and just how much it can blur. (As others have mentioned the ending should have left flashback out to make the film stronger but it's still well worth watching.)
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This is the story of Olive Hoover and her dysfunctional family and their road trip to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Early in the movie, we're introduced to her family and get a sense of what's about to come. There's her overly-optimistic, can-do father Richard (Greg Kinnear). Opposite Richard is Olive's maybe-too-down-to-Earth mother Sheryl (Toni Collette). To round out the family, there is her withdrawn, Nietzsche-obsessed brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), who has taken a vow of silence (COMPLETE silence), her Uncle Frank (Steve Carell), who recently tried to commit suicide after being spurned by a male student of his, and her curse-like-a-sailor grandpa (Alan Arkin).    Most of the movie takes place \\"on the road\\" with the Hoovers as one roadblock after another tries to prevent them from making it to the pageant. Parts of this are laugh-out-loud hilarious and parts of it are shed-a-tear sad.    The family finally makes it to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant and, just when you thought the roadblocks were hurdled, more issues arise. In the end, Olive participates and the results are hysterical on a level I've rarely experienced.    After finishing the movie, I couldn't help but compare it to National Lampoon's \\"Vacation.\\"    Both involve highly dysfunctional families.  Both center on a road trip with a less-than-reliable vehicle.  Both have the overly-optimistic, stay-positive dad.  Both have the maybe-too-down-to-Earth mom.  Both have the bitter elder/grandparent.  Both have the messed up relatives.    But, don't get me wrong. \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is still its own movie and is a big step above what was delivered in \\"Vacation.\\" To me, the movies are similar enough that if you enjoyed \\"Vacation,\\" you'll enjoy \\"Little Miss Sunshine.\\" If you didn't like \\"Vacation,\\" you actually might still like \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" because of the added plot lines that take it from being a simple gut-busting comedy into the realm of being a smart comedy with just enough realism to hithome. Plus, Abigail Breslin is downright lovable as Olive and reason enough to watch the movie.    The only real downside to the DVD is that it doesn't really have much beyond the typical commentaries and alternate endings. I was really hoping for some outtakes (particularly with Frank, Dwayne, and Grandpa), but there were none. Thankfully, the movie was good enough that I wasn't too disappointed.

0307346609|4.0|If so, this is the one for you. And it shows the various types of appeal of the zombie genre. On the one hand, I've always appreciated zombies, because they give you so many opportunities to fantasize about how you'd fight them. You can talk tactics with other enthusiasts for hours, and this book has plenty of such speculations: What would happen to zombies on the sea floor? What would we do with the frozen ones left after the war? What would happen if you shot one with a laser? And Brooks handles the political satire by wondering what various governments would do if faced with a deadly pandemic, and his speculations are both chilling and funny, because even the good old USA, though it pulls it out in the end, stumbles pretty seriously, and all so plausibly.
B000002ACR|5.0|If you read anything about the song So You Want To Be A Rock and Roll Star - including here - you'll see the claim that the song is about The Monkees, usually in a dismissive tone. It is true that one of the band members has been quoted as saying that he was thinking about The Monkees at the time. However, a simple listen to the lyrics once through would tell you otherwise. The song is about the rapid rise to stardom available to ALL bands at the time. In fact, I don't see how it could be anything other than a reflection of the Byrds own experience, screaming girls and all. There's certainly nothing in the song about television shows, or not writing your own songs, or any other criticism of the Monkees. And anyway, what's wrong with The Monks? They had great songwriters and great production, along with damn good vocalists. <br />While I'm at it, this is a great album. I was just a bit too young to  anything more than the singles that got played on Top 40 radio, and they were gone before I started buying records. It was obviously my loss - this was a stellar band.  <br />
1400049628|5.0|Part of the appeal of zombies is that it is fun to speculate about how you'd fight them. (Not so much fun with vampires and werewolves - they have supernatural powers and are bulletproof, so you're pretty much dead if they ever come knocking.) This great and hilarious little guide presents such speculations with complete seriousness and exhaustive detail. It's funny the way the survivalist couple in Tremors is funny: you laugh at them, but then you think, \\"Hey, I wonder how thick I should make the walls on my bunker?\\"

B00004Y87O|5.0|I used to watch this incessantly when I was a teen (one of the first movies we had on a blurry VHS tape we'd made). It's the real deal. All the cameos are first rate, camped-up fun. And Kurt Russell is one bad fellow. But not without honor. And, as with a lot of 80s dystopia (like Verhoeven's films), some of the swipes and gags have a little serious edge to them. I'd watch this any day of the week.

0307237699|4.0|I thought that Obama's book was a fairly good read.  My grandma in love with her senator and even though she lives in a downstate conservative area where he is popular none the less as he is viewed as not a part of the Chicago machine.  The book again rehashes his political philosophy and isn't so much a guide as it is a musing of generalities.  Far more conversational then informative, I think it shows Obama to be a bit old fashioned in style.  I feel with so many people with college degrees and a nasty cynical attitude it is important for him to work out the details and to present them to the American people if he wants to remain credible.  Regardless, hats off to an American statesman and senator who has served my grandma and her town well.

B000ICL3KG|2.0|Yes, I was very excited to receive the product ad it <br />was packaged and delivered well. <br /> <br />However, AMAZON should consider the situation with DVD orders <br />that are NOT for the USA...meaning that there are DVD regions <br />in the rest of the non USA world. <br /> <br />If someone orders a DVD, like I did, from Australia to Austrlia....it should send a signal that such need be <br />compatible with the systems in that country. <br /> <br />I took it for granted and assumed that AMAZON would know <br />where they were sending the product and meet the requirement.   <br /> <br />Also the DVD never did say \\"for USA systems only\\" or \\"for  <br />compatability with regions X,Y, Z\\" <br /> <br />I am still waiting for my refund. <br /> <br />Cheers <br />Mark

B000MNP2KI|5.0|From the moment the film opens, with it's gritty black and white (so gritty in fact that it had me wishing they'd made the whole film black and white) to the moment the Bond theme closes out the film, `Casino Royale' is probably the most intoxicating and rewarding film to come out this year. With all the pre-release criticism and speculation put to rest, Daniel Craig proves that blondes do have more fun, much more fun, for his James Bond is the most real, the most intense and the most enjoyable of the lot of them.  <br /> <br />With a plot that makes sense and is easy to follow, `Casino Royale' delivers on every level that a film can, providing entertainment for everyone. My wife, who is not a fan of Bond movies or even action movies utterly loved this film, so much so that she insisted we see it again the following night. With action sequences that look so painstakingly real, to emotions that look so painstakingly real, Daniel Craig and the rest of the cast hit every note just right.  <br /> <br />Starting us off with Bond earning his `00' status, the film gives us a great development of the man. `Casino Royale' is what Bale and Nolan did for Batman with last years `Batman Begins' for Craig and Campbell breathed life into a dying genre. Sure, everyone who loves Bond will love Bond, but even his fans will admit that the latest in the long line of Bond films was growing tired, but now, with `Casino Royale' under his belt, Bond has a new reason to breathe.  <br /> <br />I want to also make mention of Eva Green, an actress I feel is only a few short roles away from an Oscar, for her turn as Bond girl Vesper Lynd was brilliant. For the first time in the history of Bond films has a Bond girl been more than a piece of tail. Vesper is smart, seductive and essential to the development, of not just the story but of James Bond himself, for her character and performance add so much weight to his growth as a man.  <br /> <br />`Casino Royale' will go down as the greatest Bond film in history (that is until Craig and Campbell top it) and will be a reminder to all that just because Bond looks different doesn't mean it's a bad thing, for Daniel Craig has done things with this franchise that us Bond fans have only dreamed of. He made Bond cool again, and made him someone even my wife can watch again and again!
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|When John Woodsen is laid off from his job, he is thrown into a world of synchronicity, danger and intrigue. While The Celestine Prophecy is filled with a warm energy, there are moments of adventure that add an exciting edge. The lush scenic vistas of Peru are at times digitally enhanced to produce a visual paradise.<br /><br />When the characters approach life from a different perspective everything seems more beautiful. The basic conflict in the movie is more a war of ideas and one group wants to reveal the knowledge, while another group seeks to keep the mystery hidden from the world.<br /><br />If you have been wondering about the meaningful coincidences in your own life, then this gives insight into what is actually occurring. If you have any interest in how energy plays a role in your life or you have considered the possibility of life being much more than our daily physical reality, then this has much to offer. Although I'm not convinced heaven and earth are the same place, but I am convinced the world could be more heavenly if people showed more love. Much of this movie can be a reality, but a few scenes delve into a fantasy element that seems more mythological, yet entertaining.<br /><br />This may also intrigue you if you have felt like you have met someone before in a past life or if you have felt how people give you energy and make you radiate or take your energy and make you feel sad. The idea of being \\"open\\" is also briefly explained, but it can take years to experience a taste of this idea and in the movie the main characters have an almost spontaneous awakening.<br /><br />I did find it a little unnerving that I was looking up books about auras just before I watched this movie. I had no idea there would be visualizations of auras and recently read about how they change according to mood (there are cameras that can take pictures and they change colors - it just looks like energy floating around you - some books teach you how to see them and I've had a glimpse on occassion).<br /><br />From a spiritual perspective this movie is a beautiful explanation of how love can change the world and from a visual perspective the entire movie is an exciting journey into gorgeous mountainous regions, ancient ruins and unveilings of the invisible. The actors all seem to be on a similar energetic plane, in that the physical world seems less relevant and they seem to have an almost higher spiritual purpose. To me that made the movie more enjoyable, although some may see the acting from a different perspective.<br /><br />I think this movie will appeal to people of many religions because the spiritual path people take to openness/awakening/enlightenment seems to have common elements. While watching the movie, you may discover that this mysterious \\"Celestine Prophecy\\" is already coming true in the lives of people you know or in your own life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewFrom a spiritual perspective this movie is a beautiful explanation of how love can change the world and from a visual perspective the entire movie is an exciting journey into gorgeous mountainous regions, ancient ruins and unveilings of the invisible.

0767834739|3.0|Milla Jovavich is back as @$$kicking Alice in the sequel to 2002's `Resident Evil'.  In `Apocalypse' we are given more of the same but it doesn't seem to really perform as well as the first film.  The sets aren't as exciting or as memorable, and the inclusion of Nemeses may excite some it left me a bit stale.  Milla is still as great and as fun as ever, and new to the game stars like Sienna Guillory (who plays video game favorite Jill Valentine) and Oded Fehr do a fine job of supporting her but the real stars are the CGI effects which work well for the most part.  Expect lots of action and lots of blood but with Michelle Rodriguez's snappy Rain missing and the lack of originality found in the first `Resident Evil' film `Apocalypse' just isn't strong enough to warrant it's own following.  Maybe three's a charm.
0425173895|5.0|As seductive as a sudoku puzzle, with all the facts of a devilish murder laid out for the reader to solve, if only s/he reads carefully enough, this 1926 mystery is still captivating new readers.  A contemporary of popular mystery writers Dorothy Sayers and Marjorie Allingham, Christie writes novels which are less character-driven than Sayers's novels and less elitist (and sometimes satirical) than Allingham's.  Instead, Christie carves out a niche writing mysteries with unusually clever plots, even if, as in this case, she has to violate the conventions of the mystery/detective genre to make them work.<br /><br />No spoilers.  When Hercule Poirot, the French detective who uses his \\"little gray cells,\\" retires and moves to the small rural village of King's Abbott, he quickly learns of the death of Mrs. Ferrars, who, after her husband's mysterious death, had intended to marry Roger Ackroyd.  Soon, however, Roger Ackroyd himself is found dead, stabbed in the back in his study.<br /><br />An unusual number of complications make this mystery particularly challenging.  The disappearance of Ackroyd's stepson (his major heir) is thought to signal his guilt, but there are others who also have motives.  A maid has been dismissed under mysterious circumstances, Ackroyd's sister-in-law has serious debts, a stranger has appeared at Fernly Park at the time of the murder and has then disappeared, and Ackroyd himself has been trying to control his estate by securing the marriage of his niece to his stepson.<br /><br />Details of the mystery are not unique.  Christie also uses the attempt of a wealthy man to control his heirs' marriages in _Dead Man's Mirror_, for example, along with the familiar concept of a murderer entering and leaving a locked room via a window.  Mysterious strangers are a clich&eacute;, as are dismissed maids who have secrets. Throughout, the characterization extends only as far as is necessary for the plot.  Told by Dr. James Sheppard, a friend and frequent visitor of Ackroyd's, the novel is justifiably one of Christie's most famous, however--and its creative conclusion revolutionized mystery writing not only in its time, but forever.  Don't miss this one.  n Mary Whippleis justifiably one of Christie's most famous, however--and its creative conclusion revolutionized mystery writing not only in its time, but forever.

B000LN68JS|5.0|Good product, mounts easily and keeps my maglite secure and ready at all times.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|Let me preface my review by saying (a) I have never read the novel and (b) I probably read too much about the movie before I saw it. I also watch movies for entertainment, never searching, and rarely stumbling upon, a much deeper meaning.  <br /> <br />That having been said, I was sure that I would find this movie completely unwatchable. I watched it only because Wentworth Miller was in it. But I found that I was actually quickly captivated by the movie, even before Miller appeared. I don't find the premise of Coleman Silk's dismissal from the college completely unbelievable. I find it, unfortunately, all too believable that an esteemed academic COULD be quickly dimissed for innocent remarks made that had potential of being racist, even if they were not. What I did not find was the suspense that the description of the movie alluded to. I don't really see how the revelation of Coleman Silk's big \\"secret\\" was about to ruin his life. In fact, in consideration of the fact that the loss of his job was due to a racist remark, the revelation of his secret could have saved his life. His \\"secret\\" had much stronger impacts on his life in the flashback scenes of the movie.  <br /> <br />Ironically, I also found the casting of Wentworth Miller as the young Silk every bit as implausible as the casting of Anthony Hopkins as the elder Silk, even knowing full-well that Miller is perfectly cast in the part.  If only the Silk family had just one member that had skin nearly as fair as Miller's, I could have bought it. (Perhaps Miller's own family should have been cast.) But Miller looked like the adopted child in the family, clearly much fairer than his parents and both siblings, both an older brother, and a younger sister. I also found it implausible that Silk had developed an incredibly strong British accent, presumably from his time at Oxford, after growing up in New Jersey and attending NYU, and then retained that accent over many, many years teaching in New England.  <br /> <br />However, it goes without saying that Hopkins played the part as well as it could be played, even if the casting on it's face was less-than ideal. Miller's casting was ideal on it's face AND his performance was strong, but I do wonder how much of it was \\"acting\\" per se, and not emotion based on his own feelings and struggles with his identity. In other words, he was great, but was it really that much of a stretch? Nicole Kidman was excellent, perfectly pulling off her character, as she always does. Somehow, she is always believeable, even if she is a beautiful, classy Australian playing a somewhat grubby, class-less American.  <br /> <br />I watched this film on DVD, so I have to believe that nothing was left out of my version. But I feel like I may have seen an edited version based on other reviews. As mentioned, I found the movie to be far from suspenseful. While Coleman's secret may have had significance in his youth, I found it to be far less significant in his adulthood. I have no idea how people knew that Kidman's character was illiterate.  I also have no idea what the scene with the crow had to do with anything other than allowing a means for Kidman's character to confess further details of her past. If that was it's purpose, it could have been much more cleverly achieved. Perhaps these were details that were in the book but not well integrated into the film.  <br /> <br />Overall, the movie is very watchable. It is a good story that makes one pause to think about the struggles of people of color, especially for those who have never had to go through such struggles. But don't expect to be sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for some huge secret to be revealed or for it to come out and ruin Silk's life. It's a great drama, not a strong suspense.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This movie was great. There are Oscar worthy performances from an A-list cast. However, the person that deserves the most credit is Martin Scorsese. He has directed another movie that will go down in history as a classic. If he does not finally win an Oscar for all that he has done for the movie industry, there is something wrong with the Acadamy

B000001FQQ|2.0|The year was 1989, and there were high expectations that Kiss would be releasing a heavier album than 1987's \\"Crazy Nights,\\" arguably the band's worst album to date. With \\"Hot in the Shade,\\" Kiss delivered a mix of so-so new songs that seemed more like \\"Crazy Nights\\" outtakes. \\"Hot in the Shade\\" also has the distinction of being the first Kiss album not to have the Kiss logo prominently displayed on the front cover. Instead, it's repeated in the little circular postage stamp in the right-hand section.<br /><br />Things fall apart immediately with \\"Rise To It\\" slide guitar intro (think Cinderella's \\"Fallin' Apart at the Seams\\"). Next is a Gene throwaway,\\"Betrayed\\" that goes absolutely nowhere. \\"Hide Your Heart\\" is interesting because Ace Frehley released his veriosn the very same year on his \\"Trouble Walkin'\\" CD. And between the two, I find I prefer Ace's version. Most fans are familiar with \\"Forever,\\" the tune co-written by Michael Bolton. It became one of Kiss' highest charting singles, and got them quite a bit of airplay. Taken outside the context of this album, it was no better or worse than any of the other ballads being released as the music scene edged into the 1990's.<br /><br />After a few listens, I couldn't help but notice how many riffs or ideas were lifted from other bands. The biggest offender is the sad \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" rip-off,  \\"Read My Body.\\" It may be the worst song Kiss ever recorded. From its Casio keyboard inspired drum intro, to Paul Stanley's attempt at copying Joe Elliot, it's a disaster. \\"Prisoner Of Love\\"? \\"Love's A Slap In The Face\\" \\"Silver Spoon\\"? \\"King of Hearts\\"? All pretty darn bland and unlistenable. The only song I find even remotely enjoyable is \\"You Love Me To Hate You.\\" It actually has a great chorus that builds and shows the slight spark of creativity. Also interesting to note is that Eric Singer, Kevin Valentine, and a drum machine (most noticable on \\"The Street Giveth...\\") were used on several songs instead of Eric Carr.<br /><br />And then there's \\"Cadillac Dreams.\\" I'm not sure if Gene was lampooning himself when he sings, \\"Money, money, that what I want...\\" but it sadly has become his calling card over the years.<br /><br />Album Grade: Dere's \\"Cadillac Dreams.\\" I'm not sure if Gene was lampooning himself when he sings, \\"Money, money, that what I want...\\" but it sadly has become his calling card over the years.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|The plot of The Departed basically a question of \\"find the mole.\\" Jack Nicholson plays Frank, the head of an Irish organized crime unit in Boston. His protege Colin, played by Matt Damon, has joined the police force and works as a detective. Not to save the world, mind you, but to fish out information for the mob and prevent Frank from being arrested. On the other side of the law is Billy Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Billy comes from a family who has a history of ties to the mob, but Billy wants to put that behind him and join the police force. His shady past, however, makes him a better candidate for being an undercover informant. So there you have it. Two moles on two different sides of the law. Who will catch who first?<br /><br />The Departed is visually stunning, as any Scorsese fan will tell you is to be expected, but besides that it's enthralling. The characters are richly drawn and the emotions run high in this crime drama/thriller. It's also a story with so many twists and turns it was hard to keep up. At several times I thought the movie was about to end and then, nope, here comes another twist and the story goes on. It was great and multi-faceted. I think anyone who likes well-planned crime capers, and films about organized crime will love The Departed. With its all star cast and big name director, I wouldn't have expected anything less than perfection. It's nice that I wasn't disappointed.
1400049628|4.0|This was an interesting book, but not really humerous (well the fact that it exists is funny), it is written as if zombies were real and is convincingly detailed. But, it is written by Max Brooks, so a dry sense of humour does run in the family (dad= Mel Brooks). Personally though I find it as a great conversation starter either at work or home...just place it on your cube's bookshelf or your coffee table, and presto somebody will eventually ask about it. <br /> <br />Also heads up...Max brooks has a Zombie movie coming out, with reference to the book.

1843104954|4.0|Tony Attwood is THE world renown expert in the subject of Asperger's Syndrome--a form of high functioning Autism.  \\"The Complete Book of Asperger's Syndrome\\" is his latest and best book yet.  If you are going to buy only one book on the subject,  this is the book to buy. <br /> <br />I am the wife of a high functioning  Asperger adult.  Tony's book covers both children and adults and is one of the few books that acknowledges that AS continues into adulthood.  It explains HOW it affects the individual at all ages AND how it affects those around them. <br /> <br />We have to date purchased 7 copies of this book--one for ourselves and the rest for various professionals such as teachers and counselors we know.  We feel strongly that every professional that comes into contact with an Asperger individual needs to read this book.  It should be thoroughly read, reread, and thought about! <br /> <br />Tony's new book is one of the few to address the marriage relationship as it relates to AS spouses.  In MY opinion, the book only shortcoming is the book does NOT address how difficult it is to be the spouse of an Asperger person.  That is the sole reason I did not give it a 5 star rating.  However, Tony is the best and this is his best book yet.

0743289412|5.0|Stephen King has mesmerized me over the years with his horror stories. His knack for storytelling is unique and compelling, and here, with \\"Lisey's Story,\\" he is no different. What I admire about King is that although he's sold millions of books and made millions of dollars, he has not succumbed to writing for the masses. No, not everyone will get this book, but it is brilliant. The story is part love and part horror, and King manages to dig deep to where darkness lies in the human mind. He is unafraid to discover what lives there, and I am a better writer and reader for going along for the ride.

B000JJSPXQ|5.0|I bought this last month and haven't stopped listening to it! I remember Roxette from the 80's and enjoyed their music then. I had know idea they were still together all these years later. They did do well in later years in the USA. A friend of mine from Sweden told me they were still together since that is where Roxette is from. I saw they had a new collection of greatest hits and had to buy it. I had another one a long time ago but lost it. Half of the songs i knew and half of the songs i didn't know. This is a cd you can start at selection #1 and go right to the last song without stopping. Every song is great! Even my 3 year old twin boys love this cd and ask me to put on the song Dangerous and they sing to it. Fave songs: Spending My Time , Sleeping In My Car and Milk, Toast, Honey, and Stars. Gosh i just love them all! I am actually a country music fan. Keith Urban is my favorite singer and then comes Roxette!
1406821829|5.0|This is a really excellent book, especially for those people who loved the first story about Pollyanna. The first half of the book is a wonderful reintroduction to the little girl Pollyanna and the second half is the story of Pollyanna-grown-up. Her manner of talking has matured with her, but she still plays the Glad Game in a way to win over even skeptical readers. Altogether, it is a most satisfying conclusion and a book I would recommend to anyone who loves the winsome character known as Pollyanna.
1576754227|5.0|Brian Tracy seems to make a fine living reading all the self-motivation books out there and summarizing their contents in his own books. And hurrah for him!<br /><br />  There's nothing new in this book on overcoming procrastination - and that's fine with me, because Tracy has taken the advice of dozens of others authors and consolidated it here.<br /><br />  It's really a fun book, really well suited for those moments when you are totally confused about what to do next and wondering how you got there in the first place. In some ways, I wish Tracy had cut out the \\"in-between\\" words, just kept the \\"meat\\" and published the book in a smaller, pocketable version.<br /><br />  Even so, the \\"frog\\" book is a nice way to remind yourself to keep your eye on the target and not let all the swirling \\"other\\" things cloud your vision.<br /><br />Jerry

I am so glad I added this to my SECRET resources and I can't recommend adding this disc to your collection enough. It's worth every penny!
0451169514|3.0|\\"It\\" is certainly one of Stephen King's most recognizable novels, if not the masterpiece on which his reputation rests.  Most are familiar with the basics of the story: an evil force haunts a small town in Maine that takes the form of one's worst fears (a clown, a spider, etc).  The book concerns a group of children who fight the monster (as children), and follows that confrontation, as well as the return of those children as adults to fight the monster upon its return years later. <br /> <br />Taken as a light entertainment, \\"It\\" is more than successful.  King is effective enough at drawing his characters, and his famously twisted mind generates enough thrills in the horror passages to please readers.  While the novel's length can be intimidating at first, I appreciated the scope with which King draws the story, as he skillfully draws together the \\"Adults\\" plot and the \\"Children\\" plot in the book's final section.  A third section of \\"It\\", placed throughout the novel as effective intermissions, outline the history of the town (Derry) and the number of terrifying/horrible events that have taken place there over the years.  The strength of \\"It\\" is King's ability to use the book's length and scope as a means of enhancing the smaller details of his tale - it's easy to get enveloped by this world, and it's a wild ride. <br /> <br />Those looking for a little more than entertainment, however, are sure to be disappointed.  Subtlety is not one of King's strong-suits, and the novel does not completely re-pay the time necessary to invest in the novel (1000+ pages).  At its worst, the book can feel formulaic, and weighed down by its structure, to the point where you feel that King is counting pages, so that a scene of \\"horror\\" occurs at least once every 30 pages.    <br /> <br />For an imaginative tale to get lost in, \\"It\\" will certainly do the trick, but little of the book surpasses what is simply very well-executed entertainment.
0064431789|5.0|I ordered this book to be delivered to my 2 172 year old grand daughter who lives in Madrid.  She was born in Australia and while there travelled by air twide to Spain, several times to Portugal by car, and has had to sleep in different places all round the world during her travels.  Her parents when practical make sure she sleeps in a travel cot so the bed is similar to the one she had in Madrid when coming for the summer.  She has even slep in a caravan when she visited us once.  This book proved a favourite of my 3 when they were young and helps children deal with the prospect of closing their eyes and going to sleep (a fuzzy area in their imagination when no doubt they have dreams we never get to hear about), and as well as being fun I remember it dealt very well with that issue.
0790731924|5.0|The success of the 1987 Warner Bros. action film LETHAL WEAPON inspired director Richard Donner to reunite with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover for this first of three sequels which was more successful than the first film. Oscar-winner Joe Pesci(GOODFELLAS,THE SUPER,MY COUSIN VINNY,BETSY'S WEDDING,HOME ALONE 1 & 2) joins the cast as Leo Getz,who is often a nuisance to Sgt. Roger Murtaugh(Glover) and his partner-buddy Martin Riggs(Gibson). Not only that,Roger and Martin tease Leo often as if they were grade school kids. Leo's tagline is \\"Anything you need,Leo gets!\\". Once again Darlene Love again plays Roger's wife Trish. The Murtaughs' kids are back as well. The funniest scene in this film,believed by many,is when Roger sits on his toilet in his upstairs bathroom,and a planted bomb inside the Murtaughs' home explodes. In reality,that would have been sad. Patsy Kensit(BLAME IT ON THE BELLBOY) plays Martin's love interest. Great music soundtrack which includes the late George Harrison performing CHEER DOWN during the end credits.

B000EMGAOY|3.0|i bought this album around the time it came out.  they are a very talented band, but the songs are just not rememberable. the new single snow is more annoying than groovy.  i hold rhcp high because of their past successes.  fact is, if this was their only album they would be just like every other band out right now.  that goes against everything they were.  i know bands evolve.  but they should evolve like every other good band did and come out with unheard music.  they are following aerosmith's footsteps and writing filler music and capitalizing.  i know they have to eat and they love to tour.  so i can't knock them for putting out an album that keeps them out there.  but for people to say that this album is anything close to being legendary or ground breaking is ridiculous.  sorry,  it's just not that good
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Color, speed, drama and delightfully anachronistic music fill this surprisingly enjoyable movie set in turn of the century (1899-1900) Paris.  A boy falls for a courtesan, they decide to run away, but it's a love fated to go bad.  The story has been told many times before.  I fully expected to dislike the movie, but something about the pace, the unexpected musical twists, and the scenery made this a great movie.  The medleys (perhaps Montage is a better word?) combine classic musicals, R&B, cartoon music and grunge - and they pull it off successfully. Perhaps the only regret is seeing it on DVD, as the movie experience must have been grand. <br /> <br />That said, I saw it with my dad, and his only reaction was, \\"This is very strange\\"

0316168815|5.0|Alice sebold created a lovely aray of messy characters with all of their flaws and all of the things we love about them. Susie Salmon was lost at such a young age it was hard for all of us to read but it is one of those books your hands just wont let you set down.  I would have to say that easily my favorite part of the books is simply when she is sitting in her heaven watching everything that is going on witht he people she once walked with. In a way it leaves me with a comfort that the people i once walked with are watching over me as much as i am thinking of them. My favorite character is her father he reminds me so much of my own he would do anything to find who killed me. I would highly recomend this book for anybody over the age of 15 it is a lovely book that is full of love, hate and adventure i kind of wish my life was this exciting but withoug the whole death thing.
B00005UW7G|2.0|FOR THE LATE 1970s, the audio quality is surprisingly poor.  <br />It can barely be called hifi, the sound seems to be intended for <br />a tv set speaker.

B000A0GP0Y|4.0|I like a few Adam Sandler films, and this is one of them.  I admit I mostly liked the Longest Yard because I'm a big WWE fan, and the film featured stars like \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin, The Great Khali, Goldberg, and Kevin Nash (and probably a few others).  It was, however, disappointing that Steve Austin was only featured in a few shots.  He should have played a bigger part.  Despite all the wrestler appearances, I would have probably liked this film anyway. <br /> <br />I'm no fan of Chris Rock, but even he was pretty tolerable for the most part.  He played a nice guy in the film (well, as nice as a prisoner can be) and his parts were all pretty decent. <br /> <br />I had to laugh at the end of the film when the guards thought Adam Sandler was trying to escape, so they pointed a gun to his head and thought about shooting, but changed their mind when they realized he was only walking away to pick up a football.  It was an unintentionally funny moment. <br /> <br />The film did a respectable job turning a bunch of prisoners into football players.  They actually spent a good amount of time building them up, and training them, and correctly showing them how to play the game.  Overall, good movie.
B00005JLZN|5.0|This movie is well written and the acting is great. Yet Again, Kevin Spacey gives a great performance. His job being a drunk philosphy prof. walking down the street loudly lecturing people as they happen to walk by is simply brillant. Kate Winslet is very convincing as a sympathic journalist. The writing is original and thoughtful. It has a great premise with a even greater and suprising ending. I was pleasantly suprised by this movie.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This BBC production is one of the finest releases ever, being equal to the quality and appeal of the famed \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" miniseries. \\"North and South\\" not only takes time to create a complicated romance, but also weaves into the story events in the setting like riots and strikes that add layers to the story's plot. Performances across the board are solid thanks to excellent casting, most notably Richard Armitage with his Darcy-like character and Daniela Denby-Ashe as the heroine. This film is lengthy, but worth every minute. It is truly a hidden gem.

0792833201|5.0|Books are usually better than movies. The same can be said for this one, but not by much. The book added some much needed depth that the film should have used. Another level of creepiness, this time seen from the other realm and it's ghosts. <br /> <br />The film did a great job of keeping it's viewers creeped out with all the horror, ghosts and kidnapping of a Carol Anne. Good special effects, even for an early 1980's film. The crawling meat, the guy ripping the skin off his face, and the climactic ending were very well done. Poltergeist is one of my all time favorite horror films. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the acting immensley. Heather O'Rourke was such an extremely cute child. I can still see her cute image in the Rams football helmet as she slides across the kitchen floor, as she is asking for pepperoni pizza. Fun stuff. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson played the distraught, frightened parents. Their chemistry together was very believeable. <br /> <br />Tangina plays a huge part in the book, unlike the film where she appears only at the very end, and is only there because she was asked by the ghost hunters. The book has Tangina constantly dream about the \\"other side\\" and it's ghostly occupants. She eventually sees 5 year old Carol Anne lost in this other realm, and the dreams takes on another level of realism for her. She know understands that the little girl must be rescued. To make matters worse, she knows that she must confront the guardian of the realm; the beast. A creature who wanders the Freeling family home regularly without being seen. Very cool creepy visual. <br /> <br />I was freaked out on many occasions reading \\"Poltergeist\\". The part with the beast and describing it's thoughts and how it is filled with a venomness hates really got to me. The battle between the beast and the psychic Tangina in the other realm is epic. There is even a part in the book where the beast buries his horns in Tangina's eyes. Wow! It would have been great if the film, even slightly, delved into the other relam. <br /> <br />Bottom line, both book and film are great. Both are highly recommended.
B000ETQPYM|1.0|I never finished this book.  I gave it a hearty attempt more than once until I realized I felt like I was suffering throught it, and gave up. The storyline grabbed me. I wouldn't doubt that it would have been a wonderful book, had I been able to ignore the horrifying writing of this novel! After trying to ignore the writing, I realized I couldn't.  Things didn't always flow correctly and I found myself rereading things to make sense of what was written.  <br /> <br />If easily bothered by choppy writing and lack of style entirely, skip this book.  You'll be happy you did.
B000K7UBTI|4.0|THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN retcons the Iron Man mythos to a degree.  Given that Tony Stark was originally wounded in Vietnam in the 1960s and he would have been in his sixties, something had to be done.  So the creators brought the story into \\"now\\" and still maintained an Asian flavoring by setting Iron Man up against the Mandarin, one of Shellhead's oldest and coolest foes.<br /><br />Die-hard purists are going to be disappointed in some aspects of the film, but it delivers enough action and characterization to get the job done.  Strangely, though, we don't really get to know that much about Tony or his relationship with his dad, Howard Stark.  We don't even get to know anything about why he created the Iron Man armor when he plainly states in the movie that he's never invented weapons.  The Iron Man armor has been compared to a human-sized F16 fighter jet loaded to the gills with munitions and destructive power.  Not to mention all the other cool, on-board technology.<br /><br />The plot centers on Tony's efforts to help China raise a sunken city to engender goodwill that results in very profitable trade agreements.  However, the Jade Dragons -- a local group -- have attacked the dig site on a number of occasions to stop the city's recovery.  But Stark's technology is successful and the city returns to the surface.  Unfortunately, that return also heralds of the mystical forces that will ultimately resurrect the Mandarin.<br /><br />I'm not sure if pitting a technology-based hero against the supernatural was a good idea for a first Iron Man movie.  For the fans like me, it wouldn't have been that much of a reach bccause we'd all be familiar with the Mandarin (though I'm pretty sure the comics alluded to the fact that the Mandarin's rings were alien tech at one point and not mystical).  But newcomers might be expected to see a technology versus technology battle, and that's really lacking here.<br /><br />I didn't like the fact that S.H.I.E.L.D. was onstage mainly as the bad guys, or at least an opposing force, without any face time to put a more positive spin on them.  Nick Fury and his agents are some of my favorite characters.<br /><br />There was a lot to like about the straight-to-DVD presentation, though.  The use of CGI animation throughout the film was good, and so were the action sequences.  One of the other BIG pluses was that a LOT of the other Iron Man armor was shown.  The specialized deep-sea armor took center stage during one battle.  And many of the other suits were on display.<br /><br />Some of the scenes felt rushed, and plot development was thin.  The Mandarin was late in getting into the mix, though the four Elementals working on his behalf were there, and never quite came to fruition as a real threat.<br /><br />But the chance to see Iron Man onscreen in your living room is just too good to pass up.  Buy this one for comic geeks' night, or for the kids.  Then have a seat with your friends or your children, and get down to a night of superheroing Iron Man style.inly as the bad guys, or at least an opposing force, without any face time to put a more positive spin on them.

B0000248GR|4.0|19 years after Mike Oldfield's groundbreaking and complex debut album he returned to drink from the well which had launched his career onto an unsuspecting public. It is easy to criticise Oldfield and record label Warners for the opportunism of this album, but one has to remember the difficulties Oldfield had endured through the late 1980's thanks to Virgin Records indifferent promotional attitude to his work. Pressured throughout the decade to follow \\"Tubular Bells\\" up Oldfield resisted Virgin's entreaty. That he eventually chose to record a follow up album for a new record label shows a clear attempt on Oldfield's part to stick two fingers up at Richard Branson et al, like \\"Tubular Bells\\" this album was an act of rebellious revenge.<br /><br /> Musically it is also very satisfying, polished and precise Oldfield has never struggled when it comes to producing memorable and often entrancing music. Warner's cleverly marketed the album at the emergent audience for \\"New Age\\" music that Enigma had established. The lead track \\"Sentinel\\" is a perfect evocation of Oldfield's multifarious thematic style. Certainly large swathes of the music use the \\"Tubular Bells\\" as a basis, but Oldfield often takes us on a journey heavenwards as the guitars soar and range. The major difference is the production. Trevor Horn brings a polished over produced sound that is at times clinical. The aggressive improvisation of \\"Tubular Bells\\" is not replicated and nor is the energy. Nevertheless on tracks such as \\"Weightless\\" and \\"Tattoo\\" Oldfield produces some of his most emotive and memorable music. This is an experiment that could have gone terribly wrong, but in fact it is an excellent nostalgic addition to Oldfield's fascinating body of work.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Joe Wright did a stunning job with this magnificent version of Pride & Prejudice. Keira Knightley shines as Elizabeth Bennet, and the supporting cast, including Donald Sutherland as the kind, softspoken Mr. Bennet, Jena Malone as the silly Lydia, and stunning Rosamund Pike as Jane, is delightful as well; but it is the gorgeous Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy who truly captures. There's not a slow moment in this film; it is steady, enchanting, and worth a thousand views.    The enchanting melodies used for this film's score did much to enhance the tone of the film; the piano solo Dawn is exceptionally haunting, as is Liz On Top of the World. It's inspiring me to sit myself down on a piano again, although I'm sure I would ruin the music rather than do justice to it.    Filmed almost entirely on location, the only set built for the production was the ballroom in which Darcy and Lizzie first meet. The use of Chatsworth House, Wilton House, and Basildon Park, as well as other grand, stately homes, provided a beautiful setting for this extraordinary adaptation.     SPOILER/ENDING ALERT:  Here's an interesting bit: my favorite part of the movie - the ending - features Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy outside, enjoying a moment together under starlight, sharing one of my favorite film conversations:    Darcy: \\"And what am I to call you when I am cross? Mrs. Darcy?\\"    Elizabeth: \\"No, you may only call me 'Mrs. Darcy' when you are completely, perfectly and incandescently happy.\\"    Darcy: \\"And how are you this evening... Mrs. Darcy? Mrs. Darcy... Mrs. Darcy... Mrs. Darcy.\\"    This ending, not in the novel, is apparently also not included in the UK and international versions of the film, having not gone over well with British audiences. As a North American audience member, I'm particularly glad this ended up in the release on this side of the globe - it is truly one of the most tender endings I've had the pleasure of watching. (It's also two more minutes of Matthew Macfadyen, which isso not a terrible thing.)         For any woman who loves the Jane Austen classic, I'm sure she feels she owns Elizabeth Bennet, or sees herself in Elizabeth in one way or another, so obviously casting the role well was of great importance. Lizzie is strong, insightful, capable and witty - the model heroine - and Kiera Knightley was arguably the best choice for this role. There was effortless chemistry between her and each of the actors with whom she shared the screen.      It's rare a book translates to film as exquisitely as this.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|it got here so quick, thank you  <br /> <br />great price and great condition <br /> <br />
1582701709|5.0|`The Secret' is a great inspirational book. It is a feel good book. It is easy to read and understand, and very uplifting. It should be a must read for everyone wishing to better his life. It is especially useful for those among us who are frustrated with the way things are going in their life.    The book, or `The Secret', is about the Law of Attraction. This law states that like attracts like, so when you think a thought, you are also attracting like thoughts to you. In other words, think good thoughts and good things will come to you, and if you think bad thoughts then bad things will come to you.     According to the author, everything in your life is the result of the law of attraction. It is a natural law of nature. It is impersonal and it does not see good things or bad things. It is receiving your thoughts and reflecting back to you those thoughts as your life experience. In other words, the law of attraction simply gives you whatever it is you are thinking about. That is, what you think literally becomes your life.     This concept is not new. Many books in the self-help section of bookstores carry books discussing the Law of Attraction. It is found in many religions, philosophies, Western and Eastern traditions, and in New Age literature. According to the author, luminaries such as Einstein, Plato, Newton, Emerson, Lincoln, and Ford, to name just a few, knew the secret and applied it to their everyday life.     To illustrate the Law of Attraction, here are a few quotes from the book:     \\"This is really fun. It's like having the Universe as your catalogue. You flip through it and say, `I'd like to have this experience and I'd like to have that product and I'd like to have a person like that.' It is you placing your order with the Universe. It's really that easy.\\"     \\"When you visualize then you materialize. If you've been there in the mind, you'll go there in the body.\\"     \\"Your mission is the mission you give yourself. Your life will be what you createit as...\\"    Our words are so powerful, they can be used to create or destroy. Remember the saying, \\"Words are mightier than the sword\\"? The Secret presents us with people who thought uplifting thoughts and then, at some point, became successful.    But is it really that simple? Can we truly have anything we want in life simply by thinking about it? Can a mass murderer visualize himself as the President of the US and actually become the President? Consider the following: If only 100,000 Americans visualize themselves as the next President, will they all become Presidents? What about if only 100 out of the 3 Million Americans visualize themselves as the next President? Will they all become Presidents? Assuming each President is elected for only 4 years, we can have only 25 Presidents every century (100/4=25). So how will the Law of Attraction work in this situation?     If every person on the planet visualizes himself as a billionaire, will we all become billionaires? If so, then who will work in our factories and offices? Who will pick up the trash in the morning? You get my point. We can't all be rich.     If all we get in our life is happiness (by visualizing it), how would we know what happiness is in the first place? Don't we need sadness in order to appreciate happiness?    This list could go on and on forever.    Other than its obvious weaknesses, I recommend this book for its uplifting message. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that `The Secret' isn't a secret anymore.

B000GFLE86|1.0|I'd listen to anything Madeline sings, but truly, this is a great CD!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|..I still was able to find the charm in this one. I dare say I enjoyed it very much!  I like both the Firth and the Knightley versions. Funny how when we think of the BBC we think more of Mr. Darcy (Firth) and when we think of this one we think more of Elizabeth (Knightley).     There are many scenes from each of the P&Ps that I can say I like over the other, so I can't pick a true favorite version. Even with significant script downsizing and tweaking in this version, overall you still get the many *SIGH* moments between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth and the laugh out loud moments with Mr. Collins (I'm forever a fan of the Hollander actor who played him in this rendition!). You sympathize and adore Charlotte (who is very believable as the plain \\"spinster-in-the-making\\" than the other versions) and WHO can bring aristocracy to the screen like the dame Judi?  This role was made for her and out of all P&P ladyships, she is by far my favorite portrayal. I was also happy with the Lydia casting - her portrayal was the perfect comedic silly and selfish.    LOVED Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennett!  You get an idea of why they aren't in the best financial shape with his laid back and resigned attitude - the go-getter he is not. The scene between he and Lizzie at the end is very touching.  Any daddy's little girl will be moved when they watch it.  I know I was and still am every time I see it.    Matthew MacFayden did a fine job with his portrayal of the handsome and initially stoic and snobbish Mr. Darcy.  I think his emotions and tenderness really trasmitted itself well across the screen as his feelings grew for Elizabeth.  Truly FINE performances from all of the cast.    Some have brought up the discrepancies in this P&P, yet I do not remember Mr. Darcy swimming in a lake and coming out of it sexy and dripping wet in the book like he did in the Firth version - yet we do not complain about it. That's because it was a GREAT scene (for the ladies) and it didn't take away from the movie.  There are going to be changes in each one, as long as it doesn't take away from the romance of the two and the gist of the story (again many only have 2 hours), I think when given a chance, P&P lovers will really enjoy this one.     I would have loved to have seen more effort with the costume designs, but overall I really LOVED the movie and occasionally when I have 2 hours on a rainy day, I'll pop it in. It's one of my rainy day favorites!
0823016285|5.0|The Artist's Complete Guide to Facial Expression by Gary Faigin is one of my favorite art books because it isn't limited to a particular medium. My goal as an artist/illustrator is to portray people as realistically as possible, and this book is filled with hundreds of pictures of expressions along with the facial muscles that produce those expressions. The demonstrations show the artist how to portray even the subtlest emotion. But this book isn't just for artists whose style is realistic; artists who prefer cartooning can also benefit by understanding how to translate complex expressions into simple lines.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I've always dreamt of the day I would hear \\"Without You\\" translated into Spanish.<br /><br />Nothing is more romantic than the Spanish language, or the other romance languages. In fact, a cursory glance at history reveals the European-Mediterraneans invented romance. They swept into Northern Europe chewing cloves and wearing nothing more than form-fitting silk pants and loose blouses. Regardless of the weather, in their silks they introduced tenderness and compassionate mannerisms into the Teutonic milieu of Northern Europe, a social climate literally indistinguishable in its sexual violence from the Klingon empire.<br /><br />This requires some explication of Klingon history. It wasn't until the 14th century that the Klingon homeworld Qo'noS was inundated with the technologically advanced Hur'q. The invading Hur'q stole the sacred sword of Kahless the Unforgettable, a messianic Klingon responsible for many norms of the Klingon warrior creed, including many of the brutal love rituals, such as glaring at one's husband/wife with hostility, and also the ritual of at some point drawing blood with a large curved knife with a demon carved on the handle (the Klingon angel). The Klingons eventually repulsed from Qo'noS the Hur'q and reverse-engineered their transportation technology. This enabled a crude, boorish race to move into space, dilluting what had previously been a gentleman's game, something like a mannered round of chess in a Genoese court.<br /><br />Il Divo: they are in this seaborne Romance model. They are not a pack of  pelt wearing Gauls with at least 57% of their bodies covered in battle-hardened scar tissue.<br /><br />Add this cd to your 'classics' section.
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|The mystery in this movie was excellent at holding my attention. I was intrigued until the ending which was a let down and bordered on the cheesy. I think fans of M. Night Shamaylan's films would enjoy this flick, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend it. Great acting, though.
0944092705|5.0|I love Eggleston's photos because I have lived in the mid-south area during the period in which the pictures were taken.  Great book.
B000H5TVO4|5.0|Here are the songs that were all over the radio in the 80s and 90s...songs I grew up listening to and howling (er, singing) along to but never knew who sang them.  I stumbled across this gem the other day and I can't stop listening to a few of the songs, especially Fading Like a Flower, Joyride, It Must Have Been Love, Dangerous, and Listen to Your Heart.  Granted, a couple of these songs have been remixed into techno, but the originals are truly classics...you will be smiling after listening to it!
B00004XONN|4.0|I have mixed feelings about Kid A. Some of the songs, such as Optomistic, How to Disappear completely, and Idioteque deserve five-star ratings without question. Radiohead went in a radically different direction from OK Computer and I felt that some experiments succeeded where others didn't. This being said, Kid A's good songs make it one of my favorite albums. There aren't any bad tracks... but I just felt that not all of them deserved five or even four-star ratings.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|I did not think that they could do better than Saw 2, so was I in for a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Everything has gotten better with saw, and this time they have truly outdone themselves. The plot is better, and there is more of everything than in 1 or 2.<br /><br />More blood, more traps, more characters and storylines..just more of everything.<br /><br />Also there seem to be a lot more twists and turns in this one.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about it , is that it picked up right where Saw 2 left off, as Amanda in closing the door on the cop.<br /><br />This movie is so good, and so full of surprises, that I can't say anymore or it will spoil it. I will only say that Jigsaw is still alive in this movie, not dead dead like I thought from Saw 2.<br /><br />This would be very hard to top if they decide to make a Saw 4 !
0446528056|1.0|Don't know how this book continues to be on the Bestseller list.  I am up to page 180 and find it the most boring book I've read in a long time.

B000IU3E5A|5.0|Best and most readable book I've ever read on this subject.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie is Jim Henson's magnum opus. There isn't a fantasy movie out there that brings you to a whole different reality like The Dark Crystal does. Yes the movie is all entirely by puppets and yes there isn't a human being in site. That's the beauty of it. With a combination of an excellent story, innovative (for its time) animatronics, beautiful sets and cinematography you get a truly dazzling experience that any fantasy fan would be a fool not to miss.     The biggest aspect of Dark Crystal is the setting. They created a whole different world with its own animals, plants and terrain. The level of detail put into creating this new world is staggering and you get some good scenes to soak yourself up in it. From the rock caves of the Mystics to the jagged spires of the Skesis castle to Aughra's planetarium to every landscape in between. You will get drawn into this alien world. The beauty of the sets and location shots is only enhanced with some fantastic cinematography and conventional effects.     Since we are essentially talking about a puppet show brought to you as a feature film let's talk about the puppets. Granted they might seem a bit archaic by today's standards, they were nothing short of incredible back in 1982. To have puppets act and react in such an organic and lifelike fashion was never done on film before. This is the first movie where you get that sort of eye and mouth movements we have come so used to with current animatronics. Famed artist Brian Froud created all of the creatures and characters for Dark Crystal and if you're a fan of his work you will definitely see it. When you look at the majesty of the Mystics you forget they are just people covered in foam latex.    Of course having a truly creative setting and truly creative characters would not be enough to make a great movie. Lord knows fantasy fans have seen plenty of examples that prove that point. However this movie has a story that is as classic as any fable you have read before. By the time you finish this movie if will feel like you just read a grand fairy tale... only about wondrous and fantastic creatures never seen before. It's not deep storytelling. Then again it shouldn't be considering the mythical theme.     The only version you need to get from this movie is the one that's been released from the beginning. They did it right the first time when it came to extras. Here's what you get:    The World of the Dark Crystal - a fantastic 60 minute documentary that covers everything from conceptual design, to creating the puppets and sets, to cinematography and more. You also get interviews with key staff like conceptual designer Brian Froud as well as Jim Henson and Frank Oz. This feature is worth having. Trust me.     Deleted Scenes - Essentially scenes of the Skesis Emperor's funeral. Not as exciting as the documentary and I can see why it was taken out of the final cut of the movie.     Original language workprint - This is cool. The first idea for the movie was there would be a totally original language(s) that would be spoken and then subtitled for our benefit. I think it would have been awesome to see that, but in the end the studio chickened out. At least we get a taste of what it would have been like in these test prints. Keep in mind they aren't scenes in full production so they look grainy and there is some harsh dubbing with Frank Oz filling in some voices.     On top of that you get dolby surround and Spanish mono, character drawings and profiles, separate music score, talent files and trailers. Not bad if you ask me. Don't bother with the Collector's Edition. All you get is essentially the original script, some storyboards and additional illustrations. Not worth the extra price. The Jim Henson Family Film Collection is a good alternative too, with all the extras mentioned on the original edition as well as two other Jim Henson films.     I will admit that some people might be put off of this movie due to the lack of human actors infront of you and the fact the puppet animatronics might feel dated. It's a shame people would feel that way because The Dark Crystal is fantasy storytelling at its finest. If you are a fan of the genre this movie is an absolute must. If you're a Muppet fan... well these aren't Muppets so don't expect Fraggle Rock when you see it. Any fan of grand storytelling who wants to be whisked away to a strange faraway land will find what they are looking for in The Dark Crystal. Do yourself a favor and check this movie out.
0307155102|5.0|This was my son's favorite book when he was learning to talk.  We spent so many happy hours looking at the hundreds of pictures.  They are arranged on pages that represent scenes of everyday life, 'peopled' with animal characters. For example, at the grocery store you see pictures of fruits, vegetables, and meats on display for the shoppers, and a long checkout of packaged items. Grocery staff and customers include pigs, raccoon, bear, and rabbit.  In a cut-away of the rabbit family house, you see all of the family members getting ready for their day. There are about 40 scenes in the book with a short narrative and 20+ items per subject, including The Bears' Farm, Keeping Healthy, In the City, In the Kitchen, Trains, Little Things, etc., etc.  All objects in the book are labeled, so you can read the name of each object to the child, and then, of course, they want to try to say it. They can see that each has a printed name, and get the concept of reading. Then they can learn to read each word. <br />  Now that my son is grown, the BEST Word Book Ever has become my present of choice for all expectant moms, babies, and little children.  I couldn't recommend it more highly!  It is pure pleasure to share it with a little one or for them to enjoy on their own!
0783227434|4.0|When is a horror movie funny? When Sam Raimi teams up with Bruce Campbell in what has to be the craziest mix of an entertaining script with a great big heaping scoop of the living dead. Army of Darkness if the third installment of the Evil Dead series and is probably the funnest, and that's saying a lot. The film is rather quirky in its film style, but that's the beauty of it. If you ever wanted to laugh in the face of zombies this is the best place to do it.  <br /> <br />Although this is a sequel to the previous Evil Dead movies you don't have to worry about not seeing the previous movies. It all ties in quite nicely with a quick little intro, which is all you really need to get back up to speed. Also this one goes into a very different direction in regards to the plot and a lot of the scenes while still giving you a few scenes that feel right at home with those of you who loved the last one. The script is great with some of the best one liners and site gags you can find in movies. Bruce Campbell definitely has made his character, Ash, his own and has taken him to new heights with Army of Darkness.  <br /> <br />The special effects are decidedly Raimi style with a combination of low budget effects like stop motion and cheap animatronics along with some impressive makeup and practical effects. The thing is they all blend in a very enjoyable way. When a special effect is cheesy Raimi knows how to play it to the hilt and he knows how to make the more refined effects just as outrageous. The movie isn't technically perfect and in a way it seems to revel in it. Little plot holes poke in now and then (like Ash's double barrel shotgun having the ability to shoot more than two shots at a time) but again it feels like they are almost deliberate.  <br /> <br />If you can watch a horror type movie that is more tongue in cheek than anything else then this is definitely the movie for you. It's very rough around the edges, but in a polished way (confusing eh?). The real trick isyou cannot under any circumstances take the movie seriously. The movie doesn't do that and as long as you don't either you should have a blast watching Army of Darkness.  <br />
0307276902|5.0|I was amazed by this book.  I know that the author had some issues regarding making up parts of the things that he did and had happen to him but over all I believe that his writing showed the world what an addict is willing to do to be able to do drugs.  It also showed what true addiction does to the person and their families.  It was compelling to witness the sorrow and heart break.  I believe that the author was judged too harshly and I hope that he is able to maintain his sobriety. <br />Thank you, <br />Donna Abrahm <br />
B00003CXXP|4.0|This is not your standard science fiction by any means. While it is flawlessly executed and done beautifully I am afraid most mainstream viewers will just not get it. Ultimately A.I. is a fairy tale of the purest sort. I mean a really freaky and fantastic fairy tale done with some killer sci-fi special effects. Add a mess of non-fairy tale content along with a very different movie pace and you might just begin to understand this movie. Don't say I didn't warn you.  <br /> <br />Spielberg made this movie for Stanley Kubrick, who first thought of it in the mid 1980's. Though Spielberg was the one to write and direct it the movie is very much Kubrick-ian. I don't mean the mild Kubrick. I mean the trailblazing Kubrick. I noticed A.I. follows the same formula as 2001. In that I mean the story takes dramatic shifts to far left field and then far right field. Though I find it fascinating, A.I. will likely lose a lot of viewers in different pace changes. The movie shifts gears more than a formula one racer. It starts off as a family drama, then gets really sadistic and cyberpunk-like, then moves into Blade Runner territory, then goes WAY out off the park with the fairy tale wrap up. If you ask me that end part is the coolest part of the movie, and that's why I'm not going to spoil it. <br /> <br />Special effects are perfect in about every detail. The CG and digital effects are practically seamless. I am amazed how well Spielberg made it all fit together. The tech is cool, but nothing jaw dropping. I liked seeing the futuristic cars and VTOLs as well as the cities and ruins. Of course the robots are the neatest things in the movie. I especially liked the robot teddy bear. Acting is very good with special kudos to Haley Joel Osment  (A.I.'s star robot) and Jude Law, who plays male sex toy Gigolo Joe.  <br /> <br />Bottom line the story is solid and engaging. It is a perfect tribute to Stanley Kubrick and I consider it a complete success in what it sets out to accomplish. A.I. is in no way ever going to be a blockbuster. If Spielberg were smart he wouldn't expect it to be. It is far too experimental for mainstream audiences. I would say the truest of sci-fi fans should watch this along with people who are really into cerebral or 'what the..?' type movies. I would love to see the masses accept this as a true work of art, but I know not everybody can look at a Van Gogh and understand it.   <br />
B000IU3XTM|4.0|on first listen i was actually pretty disappointed because i compared this CD to O. but the more and more i listened, the more damien rice's haunting voice and smart, simple lyrics really stuck in my head. that never changed since the first cd. this guy still embodies good folk music, in terms of honesty, simplicity, and storytelling ability.    after a few listens you really get a feel of rice's style and how this cd, although not on first impression, is very similar to O. for example:    \\"elephant\\" is much like \\"blower's daughter\\" in pace and even the chord choices. it was even titled blower's daughter part II before it was released onto the CD.    \\"sleep don't weep\\" is much like \\"cold water\\" in terms of its mellow pace and also some chord choices. even the theme is the intimate interplay between a relationship, one part sung by rice and another by hannigan (which by the way is beautiful). it also ends with a sort of calming sound. cold water ends with the chants, sleep don't weep ends with some water bowl or something.    \\"me, my yoke, and i\\" uses almost the same chords as \\"volcano\\" (a VI and IV progression), although it is much different in pacing.     stylistically, there is a lot of mic red-lining that i think is done on purpose by rice when he sings loud, much like the first CD's \\"i remember\\" when the vocals get very intense. also, the recordings all have a charming home-recorded feel to them as there are noises of squeaking chairs and the  echoing of a room.    but of course this cd has its differences. there is more piano (which i like), and a lot more about sexuality. i guess it's like an evolution of rice's honest lyrics - he sings candidly about the vulnerability and animal passion of sex.    and who could forget these crazy lyrics    \\"do what you must do to fill that hole. wear another shoe to comfort the sole.\\" - sleep don't weep    \\"my cave is deep now yet your light is shining through.\\" - the animals were gone    \\"does he drive you wild or just mildly free?\\" - accidental babies    and much more.     yeah. good listen. although you may not like the songs the first time through, i guarantee at least a few songs will really stick to you.
B0001I55SS|4.0|Disney is not known for innovative science fiction movies. It seems there is a reason why Disney is not known for Sci-Fi. With not much to show for in the genre other than Escape from Witch Mountain and The Cat from Outer Space, Disney didn't put much focus in the genre back then. The Black Hole is probably their most ambitious attempt at serious science fiction they have done. It succeeds on some areas and doesn't on others. I guess it will really depend on the kind of stuff you are looking for.     The greatest success of The Black Hole is the model work. When you get to see the main spacship, the Cygnus, close up and the camera pans around it slowly it's a sight to behold. Other models like the survey ship Palomino look good as well. Not too much detail, but just enough to make it both believable and neat. The interior sets, while not top notch, are also impressive and give you a decent representation of the scale of the Cygnus as you see long hallways, large botanical gardens and a massive command bridge. Another VERY neat thing about this movie is the robot design. Every single robot is cool from the intelligent and witty V.I.N.CENT to the intimidating and tough looking Maximillian. The robots and ships alone are worth the price of admission.     The story itself is actually good, but it suffers from some odd twists here and there. This is especially true in the final scenes, which start to absolutely makes no sense whatsoever. You will wonder what they bozos were thinking by the time you get to the end. Another weak point in the movie is the action scenes. While some do the movie justice most seem to be put there just to try and add more excitement while not lending itself to the story whatsoever. Still both these shortcomings, as boneheaded as they seem, are fewer than the well executed stuff. Acting is good for its time and considering the production company, with Ernest Borgnine and Maximilian Schell giving the more dynamic performances.     Special effectsare comparatively weak even for the late 70's with exception to the model spaceship work. Lasers and stuff like look tacked on. You can see the wires on the actors on zero gravity scenes. Stuff like that. The soundtrack is great though. You get a nice full orchestral piece that has both a grand and eerie sound to it. Hats off to composer John Barry. Conventional effects and lighting are mixed bag with some very cool stuff and some either over the top or half-baked stuff sprinkled throughout the movie.     There are various versons of this movie out on DVD. The ONLY one you should be looking for is the one that includes the \\"Through The Black Hole\\" featurette. These days it costs about the same as the other versions and you get a documentary that gives more detail than I expected (including an explanation regarding the horrible final scenes). You also get the cleanest transfer of all, digital surround sound, French and Spanish language tracks and the movie trailer. Considering all you get is the movie from other versions this is like striking gold for any fan.      All in all if you like focusing on the story or are really into robots and neat ships then The Black Hole will do you good. If you have to have intense and believable action then maybe this movie isn't for you. Keep in mind that this movie is by no means perfect. It goes off on some weird tangents that not even Stanley Kubrick would have come up with. However it's another one of those footnotes in the annals of the science fiction genre and is worth a look.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Every song is great not just the title. I really enjoy this C.D. I am 50 and granddaughter is 13 we listen together and both think Taylor Swift is awesome.
B000001GBJ|5.0|The songs on this collection are all very beautiful.  My favorite is the \\"Ode to Spring,\\" an enchanting melody one cannot forget.  I can listen to this CD over and over again.  I bought two additional copies for my friends and have made another copy so that I can play it in my car.
B000002UAU|3.0|<br />Not having been much of a Beatles fan, I was intrigued about assertions that Sgt Pepper & \\"The White Album\\" were so influential in the rock genre & on the entire world of music.  Maybe I had too high of expectations... I ended up really liking about half the sangs (the first listen was dissappointing but they grown on me). <br /> <br />Now, my review is written from the perspective of a casual listener and not as die-hard Rock & Roll fan.  My previous exposure to Rock & Roll went something like: <br /> <br />> As a child I grew up with the MTV bands... Iron Maiden, Motley Crew, Van Halen etc., <br /> <br />> I outgrew those bands by the time I was 12... but a year or two earlier I was introduced to Led Zeppelin and Creedence Clearwater Revival... they have certainly survived my musical maturity.   <br /> <br />> In my mid twenties I \\"discovered\\" The Doors, Simon & Garfunkle, Cafe Tacuba, El Tri, Caifanes and more recently Real de Catorce & Jimi Hendrix.  At the same time... I have \\"discovered\\" bands like the Rolling Stones & others... but haven't been impressed.  I am still in the process of expanding my collection of this type of music... and just started searching for stuff by The Greatful Dead & Frank Zappa. <br /> <br />So from that limited perspective my opinion of Sgt Pepper is: <br /> <br />>  Some catchy, eclectic, smart tunes like With a Little Help, Getting Better, Fixing a Hole, Within You, When I'm Sixty Four, Good Morning Good Morning <br /> <br />>  The Beatles musicianship is moderate on this album.  They aren't quite as limited as their early years... but they certainly aren't anywhere near bands like Led Zeppelin or Real de Catorce. <br /> <br /> <br />Now in terms of the assertions that this album has a great deal of historical significance... I am certainly not an expert on Rock & Roll history... but I really don't buy its historically importance: <br /> <br />>  Crazy Psychedelic arrangements with strong ethnic (particularly spice route &blues) influences... the concept was pioneered & well promoted by Esquivel a full decade earliery. <br /> <br />>  Thourough fusion of Psychedlic elements with Blues and Rock & Roll... The Doors had already issued two very successful albums before Sgt Pepper <br /> <br />>  Psychedelic Folk Rock.... already successfully recorded by Simon & Garfunkle prior to Sgt Pepper. <br /> <br />      <br />Again without claiming Rock & Roll expertise... it seems to me that The Beatles were merely an opportunistic pop band that rode the bandwagon of The Doors, Simon & Garfunkle and many others. <br /> <br /> <br />With that said, if you happen to like The Doors AND Simon & Garfunkle... you will definetely find a handful of songs that you will absolutely listen to regularly. <br /> <br />
0307276902|5.0|I loved this book, I am looking forward to reading My Friend Leonard.  This books is raw, riveting and graffic.  Makes to see the uglyness of addiction. . . this needs to be said.  I want my teenager daughter to read it.  She might think twice before she uses.  HE may of imbellished the truth but only made the truth of addiction more real. <br />
B000EDWL82|5.0|...this cd is always on my playlist....sounds like a little bit of inspiral carpets,echo and the bunnymen,new order....greatlyrics and upbeat tempoes,and the slow songs are listenable....they DONT sound like the bravey,the killers or interpol,they have their OWN style....buy this cd!... a keeper!
0307341542|5.0|Very rarely do I come across a book that I just cannot put down. \\"Sharp Objects\\" is one such novel.  <br />Very well written, great story with a surprise twist, it will keep you up until you finish it!!!
B000J103X4|4.0|I really enjoyed the Game's first CD, but he continues to follow through with the same hang-ups from the first disc. The beats are solid, and his flow is even better than before. But (and this is a big but) the amount of name dropping (especially Dr. Dre and Aftermath), along with the seemingly recycled rhymes in almost every song (constantly using the six-trey Impala, for one) really hurts the album. Instead of furthering his craft a little bit more, he stays constant with his formula. Which, not to say, is a bad thing, but it wears it's welcome out before you reach the halfway point of the disc. But for the album itself, I was pleasantly suprised with the quality of production. I wasn't sure if not being affiliated with Dr. Dre would hurt the Game a lot, and it really hasn't. There are many producers who are still willing to work with one of the finer MC's in rap today and it shows on the record. Some key tracks are the singles, \\"One Blood\\" and \\"Let's Ride\\". I enjoyed the will.I.am. old school banger \\"Compton\\" and Just Blaze's \\"Remedy\\" is solid as well. I would suggest that if you are a fan of the Game, then definitely pick this record up. If your expectations are low, then you will be pleasantly suprised.
B00005B4GU|2.0|One really good song, \\"Like Spinning Plates.\\" The rest is a bunch of moody wailing to a casio keyboard and a drum machine. Seriously, do these people in here really prefer this sound to the sound of the first two albums? I don't think there is some great evolutionary process at work here, I think they have gotten lazier and each song is starting to sound less unique in comparison with the others.
B00003CWPR|3.0|Hard to believe that this is the same director who directed Clockwork Orange. I get the uber wealthy illuminati families, I always thought that's what went on in those huge mansions anyway, along with the satan worship and blood sacrifices.  But, I didn't think it could be sooooooo long and boring.  If it wasen't for the prettyness of the 2 main characters and skinny model nudity, no one would watch it or try to figure out what the \\"deep\\" meaning of it is suppose to be, Oh, did anyone else notice that in almost every scene there was a christmas tree with colored lights? Oh,wait, I get it now, life is ugly but, the colored lights are pretty. Very deep.  When I do watch this movie, it really makes me wonder how Tom could divorce the beautiful Nicole for the blah Katie, no accounting for taste I guess, and was it a real marriage anyway? Enjoy!
032147404X|3.0|Scott is great on all his photoshop books, but there are so many better books on Digital photography. (Bryan Peterson's books for example)  <br />This is a very quick read and very little on how to get the photos shown in the book. Also Scott's style of being so full of himself really comes across in spades in this book.  <br /> <br />Save your money!

1582701709|4.0|The subject was presented in a great format. Easy to read and understand. It was easy to see that God was involved in the subject from begining to end.
B000JVRPUI|4.0|Great HD-DVD set, love the tin, miniature Robby, lobby cards, extra features...etc.  But the poster that I waited 8 weeks for arrived in a flimsy, dented cardboard tube which didn't even have end caps (!), and the poster itself was crinkled, creased mess.  What a disappoinment.  I'd gladly have paid a few bucks more for shipping if they'd sent it in a sturdier tube. :(
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Before I really delve into my own review, I'd just like to point out a small piece of absurdism and downright laziness in the Amazon review above.  \\"All hail the 80s\\"?  Please.  No one who has followed Depeche Mode's career with any degree of interest considers them an \\"80s band.\\"  And tossing around such shallow catch-isms simply diminishes the lasting and continuing relevance that the band brings to the music world. <br /> <br />Anyway, enough time spent on such petty issues.  Now that \\"Playing the Angel\\" has had time to settle in and take its place among the rest of Depeche Mode's canon of works, we can look at it for what it truly is:  a rather stunning piece of work.  Although it's far from a perfect album, I can safely say at this point in their lifespan that Depeche mode is having the type of career that U2 SHOULD be having, but for whatever reasons simply are not.  If you look at the careers of the two bands, you will notice some similarities. <br /> <br />Both are among the few bands who originally gained fame and noteriety in the 1980s, yet who continued to release material and maintain their popularity through the present day.  Both reached a career apex of sorts in the late 80s, and reinvented themselves in the 90s--U2 towards a more technologically-savvy, European sound, and Depeche into a more musically diverse and harder sound.  Fast forward now to 2005, and both bands have released albums that represent a return of sorts to their \\"core\\" sound.  However, while U2 delivered the flat, uninspired mess \\"How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\", Depeche emerged with their musical integrity firmly intact with the fantastic \\"Playing the Angel.\\" <br /> <br />While DM ventured off into a grittier electro-rock sound in the 90s (with more success than failure, it should be noted), Playing the Angel finds them crafting an analog synth-driven sound that harkens firmly back to the bands Violator heydey.  Don't be misled, however, by thinking that Playing the Angel is merely Depeche Mode getting lazy and retreating towards familiar sounds and structures.  Though the band's trademark synths, and Martin Gore's trademark observations on love, sex and religion, are pervasive on the album, Dave Gahan and Co. understand that living solely in the past dooms a band to a career of mediocrity (I'm looking at you, Bono.) <br /> <br />So we have distorted synths and power chords driving the chorus to album opener \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\", a fuzzed-out guitar break in the album's centerpiece and leadoff single, \\"Precious\\", and a thunderous, industrial instrumental breakdown during \\"Sinner In Me\\" that serves as a smack on the back of Trent Reznor's head to remind him where this sound came from in the first place.  On top of the musical stylistic achievements, the band has also added another \\"first\\" to their catalog--songs written by someone other than Martin Gore.  Dave Gahan (with some help from studio keyboardist Andrew Philpott and touring drummer Christian Eigner) penned three tracks on the album.  And although only one--the bouncy sing-along \\"Suffer Well\\"--is truly a standout track, it shows that, 11 albumns and 25 years into their career, the band is not afraid to try new things. <br /> <br />Gahan's songwriting efforts also seem to have provided Gore a swift kick in the rear, as his batch of songs on this album easily ranks as among the best of his career.  The aforementioned \\"Precious\\" (destined to reside amongst the band's best singles), the gospel-tinged electro stomper \\"John the Revelator\\" and cinematic closer \\"The Darkest Star\\", among others, highlight a songwriter and a band still brimming with ideas, not relaxing on a staid formula. <br /> <br />Which is not to say that everything here is perfect.  Every Depeche album has featured Martin Gore taking over on lead vocals for a couple of tracks.  And while his turn on the gorgeous \\"Home\\" from 1997's Ultra highlights all that is good about a Gore-sung track, the two offerings here highlight the opposite.  Over-wrought, over-embellished and generally sub-par, \\"Macrovision\\" and \\"Damaged People\\" could easily have been left off of the album to no one's detriment.  Ditto the plodding Gahan number, \\"I Want It All\\", a 6+ minute tune that doesn't really go anywhere.  Also, the creeping \\"Nothing's Impossible\\", while not in itself a bad number, suffers from under-production and general blandness (something which was rectified on the band's most recent tour.) <br /> <br />So we have--as with most previous Depeche releases--a generally great album with a few clunkers sprinkled in for good measure.  By far an improvement over 2001's ridiculously understated (and mis-named) \\"Exciter\\", \\"Playing the Angel\\" is a remarkable effort for a band soldiering on after 25 years as synth-driven rock pioneers.  The songs are generally top-notch, Gahan's voice is in fine form, and (U2 take note) the band as a whole sounds energized and interesting.  A \\"return to form\\" that meets all of these criteria?  If only all bands could be this interesting.
B000H5V8DG|1.0|My one star review here has nothing to do with the show but this shody dvd set thats been released.  I bought this back in November and got it home checked the bottom of all the discs and they were all scratched and smudged.  I had to return all 29 discs for replacement and today (23/1/07) I received back the discs I sent in for replacement in the first place. I don't believe Buena Vista cares about quality control of their product whatsoever.  I will never ever purchase a set from Buena Vista again.  To have maybe one or two DVDs scratched might be acceptable to some people but not an entire box set.
B000063DGC|5.0|Review no.64.Hadn't heard this amazing 70-minute,fourteen track live archive performance in ages. Released, following five years of Randy Rhoad's untimely death. Paying (of course) FULL homage to one of the best metal/hard rock guitarists ever. I was one of the fortunate fans that saw Randy play a month before he was taken from us. Tracks here that more than served the purpose of re-living one of metal's true great moments are \\"I Don't Know\\", the awesome \\"Believer\\", a stoner's anthem \\"Flying High Again\\", the rocking \\"Steal Away(The Night)\\", Sabbath's \\"Children Of The Grave\\" and \\"No Bone Movies\\". Essential!
B000K9L32U|4.0|I live in the US so Take That is relatively unknown to me, except for that one hit Back For Good.  That said, I do not believe I have any bias, good or bad, toward the group.  I just know that the album is really good in terms of adult contemporary sound.  I assume most people who are disappointed were expecting bubblegum pop.  Now, don't get me wrong, this album is still very pop, no rock or jazz influences whatsoever.  But the tunes are very catchy, for the not-so-young crowd.  The album is highly enjoyable. Glad I bought it.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The only complaint that I have, is I was never able to see the performers on this album live.  The songs are all fun and touching and just really tell the story very well.  I highly recommend buying this album...it is just great :)
B000HBKCDC|4.0|Heard and saw her do \\"Silent Night,Holy Night\\" live on TV- it was magificant,so I got the album. It is the best of all the tracks.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie will live forever as a cult favorite . <br />It is my opinion that anyone who watches movies <br />will find something to relate to in this one. <br />It has all the elements of action, humor and emotions <br />balanced with the effects and actors blending seamlessly <br />as heros and villans twist the plot at every turn  <br />in George Lucas's Star Wars fashion. <br />I will watch this one again and again with the feeling <br />of seeing it for the first time.  <br />
B000H0MKGK|3.0|I loved both Room for Squares and Heavier Things, but am disappointed by Continuum.  I bought the whole album on itunes the day it was released.  I've listened to it now three times, and besides \\"Waiting for the World to Change\\" -- nothing has stuck.  Frankly, most of the songs sound the same to me.   <br /> <br />This was quite the opposite experience with the first two -- especially Room for Squares.  That album hit me like a ton of bricks.  One song was better than the next.   Not so, or at least not yet, for Continuum. <br /> <br />I will keep listening, but am starting to doubt my expenditure of precious itunes $$ for the whole album.  I think I should have picked and chosen a few songs instead of going whole hog.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I love this movie.  Its one of those movies that you just watch when you need a good laugh and a pick me up.  It really is the perfect romantic comedy.<br /><br />:)

B0006GAOBI|5.0|With almost 1000 reviews for this movie and a rating of 4.5 stars, I seriously doubt there is much else to say. This movie is simply amazing, and is undoubtedly a modern cult classic that will be remembered for ages. <br /> <br />I've seen this movie about 8-10 times, and it never gets old.
B00005MP58|5.0|One of the best made movies in the world. <br />5 stars. <br />Story characters music everything. <br />A must buy movie. <br />
B000J103PC|2.0|This movie was just... -missing something. I kept thinking that all of the drama was leading somewhere, but, really, it missed the climax. I thought that the Miranda Priestly character (played by Meryl Streep)was WAY too soft spoken. -We kept turning up the volume on our tv because most of the time it seemed she was MUMBLING her lines! It was irritating. In my opinion, the story had potential, but what it turned out to be was -just weak. -And predictable.<br /><br />If it hadn't been for the clever name of the movie and the fact that Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway were the main characters, I can't see how it would have ever made it to the theaters. -Overdone advertising, and someone who has friends in high places is most likely the reason. The 'trailers' for this movie pumped it up to be something it just isn't.<br /><br />Dissapointing.
0142004235|5.0|One of my all time favorites. I read this book many years ago and recently purchased it for my home library.  I enjoyed reading it just as much the second time around.
032147404X|5.0|I wasn't sure about this book when I ordered it, but, it has turned out to be a goldmind of information. You can learn as little or as much as you want at each sitting. Each page has something different. It very quickly and easily tells you how to set up for different situations and shots. I know I will referr back to this alot. It makes a great reference book.
B000AP04L0|5.0|If you work in an office, especially if you work in a cubical farm environment, this may just save your sense of humor when there appears to be no light at the end of the tunnel.  This movie is so good it's become a cultural icon.  Do you live in the culture?  Then you must see it!  Usually I describe something in more detail than this, but where to start with Office Space that others here have not covered well?  Besides, you wouldn't believe me how good it is until you see it.  There are websites upon websites dedicated to this movie, parties celebrated that are themed to this movie, cultural nomenculture spawned by this movie.  And it deserves it all.  The \\"flair\\" in the special edition is worth it, if you can get that version.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|Disappointing. An interesting idea which doesn't live up to all the hype. Maybe after watching the Cirque de Soleil show and buying it as a souvenir / reminder I would rate it higher but, as a stand alone Beatles album, the others are better. It definitely would not be a good introduction to the music of The Beatles for any prospective or newer fans.
B000035Z1Z|2.0|I have watched this wonderful movie so many times I know all the dialogue. <br />The acting is perfect!  The music well choosen.   <br />This is my favorite modern romantic comedy.  I make all of my friends watch it and they become fans as well.  <br />
078322611X|5.0|I saw Field of Dreams in 1989 at the theater with my wife and cried my eyes out at the end of it.  She thought I was totally crazy and freaked out over the tears that I was shedding over a movie about baseball.  When she asked me what was wrong, I didn't know what to say because I had no control over the tears that were flowing.  It surprised me as much as it did her.  I've since seen Field of Dreams about twenty-five times, and it's now an American classic.  I no longer break out in tears when viewing the film, but my eyes still get kind of watery for the magic of the movie hasn't diminished with time.  It's just as powerful now as it was eighteen years ago.<br /><br />As all of you probably know by now, Field of Dreams deals with an Iowa farmer named Ray Kinsella (played wonderfully by Kevin Costner), who hears a mysterious voice in his cornfield one day, saying the famous words, \\"If you build it, he will come.\\"  Since Ray's the only person who can hear the voice, he has to wonder if maybe he's going just a little bit crazy.  As the movie progresses, Ray decides to do what the \\"voice\\" wants and plows under a third of his major crop so that he can build a baseball diamond for no apparent reason.  Now, everybody in town thinks he's absolutely nuts. His wife, Annie (played by Amy Madigan), sticks by him through thick and thin, but she does worry about how all the mounting bills are going to get paid.  In time, however, the ghosts of baseball players from the past appear from out of the cornfield to play on this rather unique ball diamond, including the legendary \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson (played by Ray Liotta in one of his first acting roles).  The catch here is that only Ray and his family can see the ghosts.  With the bank threatening to foreclose on the farm, the \\"voice\\" tells Ray to go on a long journey to get a reclusive novelist, Terence Mann (played by James Earl Jones), who lives in Boston and an elderly doctor, Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham (played by the late Burt Lancaster), who lives in Minnesota, and to bring them both back to the ball field.  What happens after that is for the viewer to find out as the film delves into the emotional need for a special \\"reunion\\" and the sheer magic of making your dreams come true.<br /><br />Let me just say that at the end of the film, the camera rises up to show hundreds of cars approaching the Kinsella farm at night, which is poetic in that it eventually happened in real life.  Since 1989, over a million people from all over the world have visited the real Field of Dreams, which is located on the eastern side of Iowa about seven miles outside of Dyersville.  This movie not only touched my heart, but evidently the hearts of millions of others.  It was even nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture of 1989.  I consider this film to be # 1 on my personal top-10 list because it not only deals with the reunion of father and son, but the possibility that you can actually make your dreams come true if you believe in yourself.  This special two-disc anniversary edition is definitely worth the upgrade.  I spent the money without a second thought.  The first disc contains the complete theatrical release, plus a full-length commentary by its director, Phil Alden Robinson, and the director of photography, John Lindley.  The second disc contains a number of featurettes.  The first is a thirty-minute get together between Kevin Costner and three baseball stars, Bret Saberhagen, Johnny Bench, and George Brett.  They watch the movie at Kevin's house and then discuss their careers in baseball, their sons, and how the movie has affected their lives.  The second feature is a look at Galena, Illinois, which was used in the movie to represent the small city where \\"Moonlight\\" Graham lived--Chisholm, Minnesota.  The third feature is a look at the real Field of Dreams outside of Dyersville, Iowa, and how it's grown since its construction in 1988.  This is a great little documentary that discusses how this magical field has affected the hundreds of thousands of people who have visited it over the last fifteen years.  The fourth feature is the Bravo show: From Page to Script, which deals with the novel, Field of Dreams, and how it was turned into an Academy Award nominated movie.  If you love the film, you're going to enjoy this fifty-minute documentary.  You finally get to meet the author of the book, William Kinsella, and to hear how the director, Phil Alden Robinson, began to doubt himself during the making of the film.  All in all, this is a very special movie with wonderful behind-the-scenes stuff that certainly adds to the enjoyment of the movie.  As Phil Robinson says, though the film didn't win Best Picture of 1989, it turned out to be a movie that literally changes people's lives for the better.  That's the big reward for him.  Highly recommended.sses how this magical field has affected the hundreds of thousands of people who have visited it over the last fifteen years.

B0009H1CKG|1.0|I am fairly new to the P-Funk experience (less than 5 years), but I do know Funk. I bought this DVD with high hopes and expectations, especially Maggot Brain, which is one of my all time favorite live songs. I must say I was greatly disapointed when I watched it. Not only does the song lack the raw power and heart-felt intensity it was originally created with, but the lights and (attire) don't set you in 'that' mood. As others have mentioned, it is good to see George in 2004 performing, but I feel that he should have stopped performing about a decade ago. Furthermore I was insulted that he would dare attempt to fuse rap/hip hop with funk, but a step further, to dare say \\"welcome to the world of funkadelic\\". Do not be fooled, this is not Parliament nor is it Funkadelic... If you want real funk, look elsewhere as in Mothership connection, now that is Funky. Don't waste your dollars unless you enjoy hearing old classics butchered by \\"funkadelic\\".<br /><br />- A Very Disapointed Fan

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Very retro 70's, very heavy and just true rock worship. <br />In the vein of SIR LORD BALTIMORE, BLUE CHEER, DEEP PURPLE, URIAH HEEP, PENTAGRAM, SABBATH, ZEPPELIN, this stuff needs to be in your collection.
B000F3T7R4|3.0|This album showcases the reasons why David Coverdale never made it big in the years between Deep Purple and his Pop Metal days. You have to love the voice (one of the best in hard rock history), you have to hate the cliche blues rock, the uninspired arrangements, and the often stupid lyrics (even though Trouble is still fairly light on the lame macho lyrics that would dominate Whitesnake's following albums).     Trouble contains three good songs: \\"The Time is Right for Love\\", \\"Love to Keep you Warm\\", and \\"Take me with you\\"; the rest is mediocre blues rock that really hasn't aged very well. I'd give Trouble 2 stars on account of those three songs. With the addition of the four bonus tracks from the great Snakebite album, as is the case on this edition, the rating increases, but given the fact that the Snakebite full album is currently available on Amazon for under $7, while this Trouble CD at present goes for a whopping $44, I would say it's a no-brainer which of both CD's to buy.    Apart from Trouble, the other early Whitesnake albums that you should cherrypick instead of buy altogether are Lovehunter (only 2 great songs, i.e. Long way from home, and Walking in the shadow of the blues), and Come an' Get it (only 1 great song, i.e. Don't break my heart again). The early Whitesnake albums that do belong in your collection are: the underestimated gem Snakebite, as well as the classic albums (before Whitesnake turned pop) Ready an' Willing, Saints & Sinners and Slide it in.
B0000029DD|1.0|I was drawn to this CD because of the repeated use of Hallelujah in various TV shows.  I'm sorry to say that none of the other songs on the CD come even close to the appeal of that Leonard Cohen classic.  I was surprised and very disappointed.  Should have just downloaded that one track.
0375505091|5.0|The pictures in Annie Leibovitz's most recent work: A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005 are intensely personal and arresting.  Annie Leibovitz is my favorite photographer and this most recent work is a testiment to her vision and talent.  The pictures are a collection of her professional life and her personal life, with many pictures of her parents, children, deceased partner and other family members.  Every time I open the book, I see something new that I missed upon the previous viewing.  Her pictures make you feel akin to the subjects that are in them.  She shows the beauty in what most would feel was mundane matter.  She is, simply put, the best.

B000LC55F2|5.0|This year brought us two magic movies and both were good in their own way. Only one of them was truly great, though. I enjoyed \\"The Illusionist\\" thoroughly. My only problem was that I felt it was bogged down by a rote love story and a predictable ending. After seeing \\"The Prestige\\", I felt like the filmmakers had learned a lesson from \\"The Illusionist\\" on how not to make a film about magic. Of course that isnt really possible considering they had to have been made around the same time. In fact, \\"The Prestige\\" may have been shot earlier as Nolan was getting in to work on the next Batman film. In several interviews, Christopher Nolan regarded \\"The Prestige\\" almost as a stop-gap film. He said he wanted to do something small and quick before going back to Batman. Which makes his achievement here all the more impressive.  <br /> <br />He has crafted a movie with real magic in it that seems to have an endless amount of thought put into it. This movie gets better and better and better every time you see it. For this man's stop-gap film to be so thoughtful and rewarding, one can only imagine what kind of a movie he would make if he was really going all out. But maybe that kind of toss-off attitude is what's key to this movie's success. It feels so fresh and alive partly because the performances seem off the cuff and spontaneous. Like maybe the director got together with some buddies and said, \\"Let's have some fun with this\\". And much of the fun in this movie revolves around messing with your head. Yeah, you. The one watching the movie. <br /> <br />\\"The Prestige\\" plays like a magic trick from beginning to end. Without spoiling anything, I must say that the description of a magic trick that Michael Caine gives in the movie can easily apply to the construction of the actual film he's saying it in. The opening shot is really fantastic as it sets the dark mood and gives you an important clue in unlocking the film's secrets. Of particular note as well is the fine work of the twolead actors, particularly Hugh Jackman, who has displayed an incredible range this year with both his dual role here (don't ask) and his career best work in \\"The Fountain\\". These two incredibly talented guys spar with each other in a far more satisfying way than Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti do in \\"The Illusionist\\". Here you feel a real danger and ferocity that hits you right in the gut. Kudos also to David Bowie for being awesome in just about everything I've seen him do with acting. He makes Nicola Tesla, a real man, this iconic, almost Godlike figure of mystery and genius. <br /> <br />I think I've said enough. This movie stands on its own as one of the best movies I've seen this year. And I've made it a point to see pretty much every movie that has been buzzed about or praised this year, along with some pretty crappy ones as well (as of now I've seen 87 movies released in 2006).
B000IFSDZQ|5.0|This Box is completely amazing! Roxette fans around the world need to have it! All the 20 years of carreer explendid arranged in four cds and two dvds. The ultimate collection for those who love pop music.
B000J103PC|2.0|I'm surprised this got such good ratings here. The story line is thin. A young girl comes to Manhattan and gets a job as an assistant to a bitchy magazine mogul. Nothing much happens, it's like a one-joke comedy, wears thin with the similar scenes becoming redundant. Meryl Streep does her best to save it but it's just not a good story and nothing much happens. Add a star if you like chick flicks or love Streep in any role.
0618680004|5.0|This book is a can't-miss title for anyone who wants to understand where religious thought fits into the story of humanity.  Using sensible language and an easy-to-read style, Dawkins explains why people believe and what the consequences of that belief are.  Anyone on the fence about religion MUST read this, and it will entrance, amuse, and enlighten everyone else too.  If you've ever sat and wondered about any aspect of religion, from 'what do people believe' to 'why do they believe it' to 'does it matter,' you can finally get the answers here and go from  wondering to understanding.  This delightful bestseller is one of the most important books one can read in order to truly understand both human nature and human culture.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Not much to say there except that this is a great concert DVD of stars playing George Harrison songs. Well filmed and the music is great. Could be one of the best concert DVDS ever.
0740748475|4.0|I was quite pleased with this set. The books are very nice, the printing is good and of course its quite fun to read.  My only problem was the box it came in had a bit of a problem with some of the cover peeling a bit. Other than that its a great set and I'm glad I got it! Great gift idea.
B000286S8S|5.0|I was very young to really appreciate the in-s and outs of this band and the members between SAMMY, Roth and EVH!  I honestly can consider myself a newbie to this time-tested rockers.  I just downloaded this off of iTunes and i can tell u folks, every track is amazing! its like when Lars (Metallica) said once: \\"i was always amazed with G&R\\"...if i may borrow this line, i had always heard of the great EVH vs. Hagar vs Roth but honestly never appreciated this Guitar work before today! EVH is an amazing talent and it will continue to influence i am sure allot of new artists. My brother in Law was debating with us about Slash, Sammy, EVH, and Edge (U2), Clapton  and apparently they all chose EVH.  I didn't believe it till i heard it!  EVH is an inspiration. Anyone interested even remotely in any of these guys in EVH's history, should get this album because it is truly harnesses from almost all the worlds EVH has been to and in!
B000006TRV|5.0|'The Wall' is one of Pink Floyd's darker albums however it is still completely unmissable. With two discs that offer 26 songs it is immense by Floyd standards and gives us some of their more commercially successful songs. <br /> <br />'The Happiest Days of our Lives' and 'Another Brick in the Wall' sets out the angry, detached mood that is present in much of the album. As well as these, haunting tunes such as 'Hey You' and 'Is There Anybody Out There' give the image of a lone voice crying in the wilderness, an image that one may frequently envisage throughout this album. <br /> <br />Nick Mason said in his biography of the band that Roger Waters presented 'The Wall' to the rest of the band members as an almost finished project. This is very much evident in the dark beauty of the album that was always a hallmark of Waters' work. It is doubtless that 'The Wall' is up there with 'Dark Side of the Moon' and 'Wish You Were Here' at the top end of the Pink Floyd spectrum.
B00080ZG10|5.0|The directing by Scorsese was superb the acting by Dicaprio, Blanchett and Beckinsale was fantastic. It sparked an interest in the life of Howard Hughes who was before my time. I think that even though the movie was long the most interesting part about Hughes was his later years starting with Vegas. Yes he accomplished a lot in his 20's but his recluse days is really when a lot of things occurred such as the sale of his beloved TWA and buying the casinos. Dazzling performances.
0618680004|3.0|For a guy who hates religion, he sure acts fanatical about his far-left politics.  This is the kind of book that should be approached with caution by those who make more than $75k a year and drive hybrid cars.  Reading it may lead to near unapproachable levels of confirmation bias and smug self-satisfaction.  BE AWARE.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have spent my entire life in the study of American history, and the wars of the 20th century.  While many Movies on those subjects are entertaining, most are sorely lacking in historical accuracy.  Band of Brothers however succeeds at every level.  The accuracy of the historical details is amazing to begin with.  That is put together with a story line that pulls you in and leaves you wanting more.  You connect with  the charecters, and feel for them as they go through their trials and tragedy. It was everything I personally could ask for in a television program. The documentary episode that ties all those aging veterans together with the characters brought to life on film (actually them), and the stories they told, was very poignant, and powerful.It was the perfect closure for their true story.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|With all the hyperbole and commotion regarding the selection of Daniel Craig as James Bond, one would think this movie would rank low in the 20+ Bond movie catalogue.  Surprisingly, Casino Royale (2006) revising a franchise that appeared to be coasting on its laurels and becoming more extreme and foolish at every turn.<br /><br />Casino Royale returns us to the origins of James Bond.  Amazingly played with emotion and grit like no other Bond, Daniel Craig introduces us to a fresh new Bond character ready to fly into action.  The action sequences are amazing and adrenalized, and the story moves with an excellent pace (even though the movie is slightly longer than most Bonds).<br /><br />The Poker scenes are well shot, and the banter between M and Bond show once again why Judi Dench is a spy-diva's dream.  The movie is so satisfying that it leaves us wanting for more Bond, and soon.  Well done!

B000JLTRKE|5.0|On September 11th, 2001 the world changed forever.  For Americans, things changed the most.  There are hundreds of millions of stories about that day that could be told.  WORLD TRADE CENTER is a film that attempts to tell the story of that day seen through the eyes of two Port Authorities who became trapped in the rubble beneath the World Trade Center and who were eventually rescued.  The two men the movie revolves around, John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and William J. Jimeno (Michael Pena), had entered the World Trade Center to assist firefighters and other law enforcement in evacuating the buildings.  As things turned out it became they who needed to be rescued as the buildings came crashing down.  The story of their survival and rescue is just a glimpse of the heroism showed by countless Americans that was displayed on September 11th and in the aftermath.<br /><br />WORLD TRADE CENTER is probably Oliver Stone's most approachable and least controversial film ever.  The film has broad appeal, not only to those who lived and worked in New York City, but across America.  As alluded to before, every one of us has a story about September 11th.  The film just focuses on two men, but by doing so it becomes universal:  the story of John McLoughlin and William J. Jimeno are all our stories.  We might not have all been physically present in NYC when the towers fell, but we watched it on television.  That was a day that there were no divisions in this country.  Strangers willingly helped strangers and at least for once in a generation, we were all simply Americans.  WORLD TRADE CENTER depicts this and it does so it a non-patronizing, yet honorable way.<br /><br />I was a bit leery about watching WORLD TRADE CENTER.  Granted, Oliver Stone is a gifted filmmaker.  However, most of Stone's films are extreme.  In general the Stone canon is comprised of films that offer a bleak and despairing view of people and life.  Often his movies are quite violent, crude, and vulgar.  He is able to craft together a decent story from the most unusual sources and he has a master command of camera technique and cinematography.  However, the nihilistic tone of many of Stone's previous works made me reluctant to watch.  After my family and some friends had seen the film and recommended it, I was willing to give it a try.  I'm glad that I did.  Whatever messages Stone has tried to convey in previous films and films yet to come, WORLD TRADE CENTER Stone reminds us that we are all Americans, even himself, and that even in a messed up crazy world hope still remains.is able to craft together a decent story from the most unusual sources and he has a master command of camera technique and cinematography.

B000HT386M|5.0|Among life's few remaining constants is this one: Adam Sandler makes good, entertaining movies.  Some of them might be mindless and juvenile, but they are all fun to watch - and I happen to think that Sandler has evolved into a pretty decent actor.  I must admit, though, that I wasn't all that excited about seeing Click (they must not have had much of Kate Beckinsale in the previews because the woman is some more kind of fine).  It's not exactly a bold, original premise, and the whole point of the story is self-explanatory.  We grow up being told not to wish our lives away, so I guess there was a little bit of a nag factor in the back of my head concerning this modern-day rehashing of the old clich&eacute;.  And, yes, some of us have no desire to ever see David Hasselhoff in anything, but fortunately we have such likeable stars as Henry Winkler and Christopher Walken (who's always good) balancing out the Hass factor.<br /><br />It's not a complicated story.  Michael Newman (Sandler) is a workaholic who lets his work come before his family - even his gorgeous wife Donna (Beckinsale).  He thinks he's doing the right thing, pushing himself to get that promotion and move up to that higher salary in order to better take care of his wife and kids.  The wife and kids, of course, start complaining about how they hardly ever get to spend time with him anymore, which leads to arguments, which leads to Michael going a little mental because of all the stress.  Even the lack of a universal remote control is enough to send him storming out of the house.  Sound familiar to anyone?  I think so.  Well, Michael does find a universal remote, courtesy of Morty (Walken) in the Beyond section of the local Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  Forget the TV, this little baby really does give him remote control of his universe.  He can mute the sounds of his angry wife or barking dog, fast forward through such unpleasant tasks as showering or driving to work, freeze frame everyone around him at the click of a button, etc.  Despite Morty's warnings, he comes to rely on the fast forward a little too much, and the next thing you know he's fast forwarding through his entire life, losing years at a time.  He sees the kind of loser he became as he auto piloted his way through life, but by the time he realizes that family should always come first it's too late to do anything about it - or is it?<br /><br />Certainly, there are parallels with It's A Wonderful Life, and you can toss a few pinches of A Christmas Carol in there, as well.  Don't forget the crude humor, since we are talking about an Adam Sandler film here.  You can't have an Adam Sandler film without at least one fart joke (I won't even mention the duck).  Just be glad that David Spade and Jon Lovitz don't pop up anywhere.  Sandler really does have a top-notch cast and crew with him this time (well, except for Hasselhoff).  Beckinsale's charms are obvious, Walken's acting skills are legendary, director Frank Coraci has already proven to be a perfect fit for Sandler in The Wedding Singer and The Waterboy, Rick Baker's make-up effects are top-notch, and the list just goes on.  They even got Dolores O'Riordan to perform a futuristic jazzy version of the Cranberries' Linger (she's the lead singer of the group, in case you didn't know).  It's a little hard for me to see \\"Fonzie\\" playing a grandfather, but Henry Winkler still brings an unequalled coolness factor to any project he participates in.  Finally, you also get to see Julie Kavner, the woman behind the voice of Marge Simpson.<br /><br />Adam Sandler fans will almost certainly enjoy this movie, but I think Click should appeal to just about anyone who enjoys a good comedy.  Naturally, some will dismiss the film as stupid, but it isn't completely about the comedy this time around.  There actually is a message to this film, and an important one - it's one you already know, but that doesn't make it any less important.n, etc.  Despite Morty's warnings, he comes to rely on the fast forward a little too much, and the next thing you know he's fast forwarding through his entire life, losing years at a time.

What's important is not letting go, we only have ONE planet and we should listen to anybody with this degree of intelligence who has something to say about it. <br />We haven't received the Earth from our parents, we are borrowing it from our children.  Take a look and recommand this DVD to your friends.
1563890119|4.0|Well, this wasn't the first \\"Sandman\\" volume I had read, although I should've (the first one I read was \\"Season of Mists\\" or volume 4). Of course it's important, since it establishes Dream as the protagonist and all that, but it's not my favorite. <br /> <br />Personally, the artwork is iffy and is not my thing (Dream looks oooold). The stories are entertaining and well thought out, but a bit too jumpy (this is because Gaiman was experimenting with styles at the time). The later volumes are much more cohesive and, I think, of better quality. <br /> <br />Still, any fan of the series needs the first volume, especially because in \\"The Sandman\\" the story comes full circle at the end, and skipping almost any part of it would leave you hanging. <br /> <br />And it's still a good read, regardless of art or style or whatever :)

It's almost as if there were 10 different very interesting ways to end this movie and they picked the worst one possible. Truth be told..if you really MUST see this movie..don't pay money to do it.
0812548094|4.0|My mom's work has a 'free book exchange' where you can bring in books and borrow the ones other people have brought in for awhile. I asked her to bring me some. The first time she brought Wizard's First Rule and three books in the Crown of Stars series by Kate Elliot.    I started with Wizard's First Rule and went on to read the others before having her take them back and get more books. The second time she brought back Stone of Tears and Blood of the Fold. I couldn't help but notice how long SoT is compared to BotF, but I personally don't shy away from long books, and I had gotten attacheed to the characters from reading the first book. So I went ahead and read it.     One thing that I can say is that there is always something going on. Like a good book should, there's an exciting scene at the beginning to get things rolling. The main characters split up in the first half of the book, but I found there's not as many dead spots as in the first book, simply because all of the characters at least have something to do. I personally didn't have any problems with the writing style.     Why am I'm knocking off a star, then? For the number of distasteful scenes. Now, Wizard's First Rule had a section that I personally found uncomfortable, but it was just one part. In the sequel, there are multiple scenes of mass murder, ritual murder, rape, torture, beheading, sex with demons, and other things that I think most people would rather not read in detail. Here, all are described with varying (but still too much for me) degrees of explicitness. IMHO, these kinds of scenes in a fantasy novel are best left implied or vague, if they are included at all. In this case, they would not be out of place in a gothic horror novel, and certainly don't fit well with the adventurous tone of the rest of the book.    Not a series you want your kid to read after Harry Potter.    Also, one more thing I wanted to note on: the quality of the binding. Every single one of these books my mom has brought me has had a broken spine. Don't expect it to last.
B000784WMW|5.0|I love the novel \\"Jane Eyre\\" and it bugs the [...] out of me when I have to watch a movie version that bears only a passing resemblance to the book.  Why is it that screenwriters feel compelled to make up their own lame dialog and add scenes from their own feeble imaginations or delete crucial scenes that are in the book, when what is written by Charlotte Bronte is far more brilliant and compelling than anything they'll ever imagine?     This adaptation (I found it on tape in the early 90s) is the best ever adaptation - dialog lifted straight off the page and, in my opinion, best of all, they include the gypsy fortune teller scene!  Timothy Dalton was born to play Rochester and I love Zelah Clarke as Jane.  Get this version, I promise you won't be disapointed.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|It's too bad they had to finish the Fire Fly series with a Horror Movie.  It's great for a Sci Fi, blood and guts movie, but it destroys the enjoyment of the Fire Fly series.  Watch Fire Fly.  It is great.  This does a great job of finishing the master plot of Fire Fly, but it has too much horror bagage with it.  If a well edited version came out, then I'ld recommend it.

B000HEYVD6|4.0|This book starts off slow, and throws too many characters right away into the story line. Once past page 50, the story picks up. It's a book that will draw you in and keep you up reading at night.
B000IMUYJM|4.0|Black Christmas is just that...a dark,  dreary,  psychotic Horror Movie dealing the welfare of 5 College girls in a sorority house preparing for the christmas holiday.  Scary as Hell.
038572179X|4.0|Ian McEwan is obviously a master of the written word-this book is beautifully written, and for that reason alone I would recommend it to anyone. Yet McEwan is definitely more talented at telling a story than at crafting it. His characters are carefully faceted and his prose is delicious and lyrical, but the plot begins to peter off halfway through and the novel never regains momentum.
B00005JMK0|4.0|This was a great movie that I watched so many times growing up. I had the VHS untill recently when my house was broken into and it was destroyed. I really miss the song at the end. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE if any one is paying attention we(the public)need this on DVD. Great movie. This is the first time I have left one of these remarks about a movie, but i really needed to on this one.

1400032717|3.0|I admittedly didn't expect to find this book convincing-a book narrated by a boy with autism sounds like a daunting challenge for any writer. Mark Haddon pulls it off with crisp elegance and a little bit of mystery. A quick read that will stick with you.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This is exactly the kind of tool I've been needing in my cleaning arsenal. It works nicely like a swiffer, with its pivoting head and lightweight design, however where the swiffer fails, this little device takes over nicely. It tackled the mess of being a rabbit owner--loose fur, hay and little turds--very nicely without scaring the rabbit. The moderate noise of the motor is a nice alternative to the deafening decibals of a standard vacuum. It also picked up lint and dust very close to the edge of the baseboards. For my hardwood floors, this is a really great sweeper. Ultimately, it's a replacement for vacuuming, swiffering and washing my floors, but for a moderate sweep up, it's much easier than a broom, tons easier to manuever than the corded vacuum.

B000HT3Q3M|5.0|I would say this is one of the best CD's you can possibly expect especially in the recent decades of lousy music by \\"high school\\" bands with snobbish attitude. It certainly reminds me of what the creative spirit can make a difference. Besides performance and music arrangement, their selection of music compositions is superb and entertaining. Although being recorded in the stereo format, it sounds great through my seven channel surround system. Thank you George and Al for a great work. Keep it up for us.
0790729652|5.0|According its main features, every society generates its own myths. And this comic definitively must be considered among them. Batman is the son of the shadows, whose familiar disgrace is simply an unconscious trigger that allows us to identify with him against his sworn and untiring fight against the forces of evil. The mask is a symbol of mystery and his bat - cave is profoundly disturbing.<br /><br />This first entry of this saga, is at least to my view, the best of all because it depicts with astonishing lucidity, the psychological springs and the origin of his out of this world behavior. A double life, who may be carried to mask his sorrows and profound sadness, a man who finds shelter and redemption around his heroic actions, surrounded of first-rate technology,  but told with intelligent humor and brilliant dialogues in order to balance the enormous affective and emotional burden of Bruno Diaz.<br /><br />Tim Burton' s stages reminds too much the futurist environment pf Blade Runner, in order to recall us the state of things around the mental state of a post-industrial society, where the sunlight has vanished; thence, the narcissist pathology of The joker (Jack Nicholson), as the man who seeks his expected revenge; a journalist who falls in love with the enigmatic and mysterious Bruno Diaz, a millionaire who simply does not fit into the conventional patterns, and a social body tired of waiting but that firmly believes in Batman. Such emotional power reaffirms a terrible disappointment around the justice system and transforms Batman in a minimalist icon.<br /><br />An effective movie who puts us in contact once more with the secret and mesmerizing unconscious power of myth in modern times.
