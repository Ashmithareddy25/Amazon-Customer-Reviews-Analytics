B00COHAUD4|4.0|We really enjoyed this story and love between a mama and children.  And we were frightened a few times.  Great story.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was really setting my sights low on this book based on reviews from friends, but I was pleasantly surprised! Of course, not everything goes according to plan, but it's the moral of the story that really impressed me. I was very pleased with the series.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I use it in all my computers.  There is a lot that you can not do unless you have it.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This works perfectly with our BOB SE Single stroller. More storage space than the BOB brand console, and much less expensive. Fits my two wide-mouthed insulated Klean Kanteen bottles perfectly, with extra room for my phone, tissues, keys, and more. Great buy!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching fire was awesome! Now having said that, it is not quit as good as the hunger games. This book by all means is a top contender and an extremely good book. But as the fallow up for the hunger games, that book was the single top number one book of all time for me. That is the only thing that makes this book look bad, because it is not. I would highly recommend all these books any day!

B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved it.  Very well written, plenty of action, excellent plot, and lots of depth to that plot.  Reading the 1st book is necessary before starting this one.  I highly recommend it.
B005XBA9Y8|2.0|Sorry to be a grump but Mercury release many of these in far better SACD hybrid form.  So, yes the Mercury sound is remarkable.  Many, but not all, the performances memorable.  But many of us have collected these over the years and have most of the good stuff and the SACD disks are grand so.... buy it?  I didn't.  Now that this is released, seach around in the used shops or on Amazon and grab the same masterings for 2 or 3 bucks.

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game Is  really fun and challenging. At times it's to challenging that would be one of the only downfall of the game . Also if you want to be able to keep up with the upgrades that you need for the levels to be possible you need lots of gold
B009O2XY12|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! and it's FREE!<br /><br />FUN..FAST... EXCITING....CHALLENGING...A GREAT WAY TO SPEND A SHORT BREAK AND TO TAKE YOUR MIND OFF OF WORK....PATTY IS A HOT KISSER!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|There is so much action in this game it's unbelievable!  I love the fact that you can create your own fighter,so it looks close to what u look like.  Or what u wished u look ed like.  It is so real life looking and the enemies can be ferocious.  Very exciting.
B00G32OMF8|2.0|Self absorption is not a sin...boring self absorption is.  Perhaps this film says more about where our culture is in 2013 than chronicling the failures of the Western European/U.S. political systems.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Very cool game, it has great graphic and sound. It's fairly easy. The controls are easy, and It lets you win the first couple of round so you can warm<br /> up
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is the best album of all time!  Musically the songs range from complex melodies to songs you can sing along with.  The songs remind me of the original Stryper metal days, but with a lot more depth than our 80's music.  They lyrics are bold and inspirational.  Best of all Michael Sweet's heavy metal screams are back!  The talent of all of the band members really shows in this album.  Look out world - Stryper is back!!
B00004SZWB|5.0|Just what I wanted, I love me some Stevie Wonder, Brings back so many good memories.<br />Shipping was right on time for my husbands b-day, Hip Hip Horray!!!!!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|The beginning was a bit slow and bland but right about when the first key was uncovered the pace picked up considerably and I had a hard time putting it down. I am also surprised that this book is free. I could have paid just to finish the whole story.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bill Bryson's writing is a pleasure to read. This is the most fascinating, easy-to-read slice of history I can ever recall reading. I wish all history books were this interesting.
B00F031X62|5.0|Having had the pleasure of seeing Jimi play LIVE a few times in 1970, I must say that THIS CD comes very close to that &#34;Experience&#34; more-so than a lot of others except for Hendrix in the West which was also a masterpiece!!!  Many of us have been waiting for this release with baited breath!! THANK YOU...It was WELL worth the wait!!! A MUST Have for collectors as well as those (if there is anyone out there, un-familiar with his music) NOTHING LIKE &#34;LIVE&#34; HENDRIX!!!!!!
B00BT70J6S|5.0|I was fortunate to have heard Vladimir Horowitz three times in the late 1970's, including two recitals and an appearance with Zubin Mehta and the L.A. Philharmonic featuring the Rachmaninoff Third Concerto. While the recitals were certainly memorable, the Rachmaninoff concert was on an entirely different level. Horowitz played with such involvement and intensity that I think he forgot all about the audience. Normally a pianist of compact movements at the keyboard, something that some members of the current generation of pianists could learn from, I was surprised to see him throw his arms straight over his head after a dramatic run during the third movement. Boy, was he was on fire! The audience went crazy when it was all over - I can't remember how many curtain calls there were. That was a concert to remember.  While there are many outstanding recordings of Horowitz live, nearly all of them are products assembled from various recitals rather than representations of what a Horowitz recital was actually like from beginning to end.  The exceptions, of course, include the 1965 return to Carnegie Hall after a twelve year hiatus from concertizing (although the recording of that historic event was originally edited to correct some mistakes), as well as the 1953 Silver Jubilee recital that was out of print until its 2009 release in the massive Original Jacket Collection ([[ASIN:B002P3J3BW Vladimir Horowitz- The Complete Original Jacket Collection]]).  While the Original Jacket Collection included a couple of other concerts in their entirety, most notably an incredible 1951 Carnegie Hall recital, nothing remotely approaches the scope of this new anthology.  Any reservations I had about duplicating the Horowitz recordings already in my library, especially the material in the OJC set, quickly disappeared as I listened to the first recital. From the opening Bach Toccata (BWV 911) to the final encore, Horowitz's signature Carmen Variations, there is the sense and thrill of &#34;being there.&#34;  The taxing program is a demonstration of Horowitz's tremendous resources and stamina, yet the discharge of controlled energy is so relentless that the listener can only marvel that it could be sustained for two hours. There's a sonata by Clementi, a forgotten composer almost single-handedly revived by Horowitz, Schumann's &#34;Arabesque&#34; and then Chopin's B Flat Minor sonata to finish the first half of the program. Imagine closing the recital with Liszt's Fifteenth Rhapsody after two demanding (and utterly riveting) Rachmaninoff Etudes Tableaux followed by two no-less demanding Debussy Etudes and then one by Scriabin. And four encores followed all of this!  The next recital, from February 21, 1949, is just as remarkable. Horowitz opens the program in an unorthodox way with three of Mendelssohn's &#34;Songs Without Words&#34; and then segues to Beethoven's sonata op. 10, no. 3. One would think the order would have been reversed, but creative programming was among the many things that made the pianist's recitals so interesting. While I'm typically not fond of Horowitz's Beethoven, this is a first class reading all the way, superior to the relatively fussy recording he made for RCA in 1959. (Horowitz's outstanding &#34;Moonlight&#34; sonata from 1947 also surprised me.)  There's a scintillating &#34;Vers La Flamme&#34; (check out the priceless youtube clip of Horowitz playing this in his living room ca. 1974) and a cluster of Kabalevsky Preludes to close out the first half - again, stuff that nobody was playing at the time.  The second half features a trio of Chopin Mazurkas, although not as charming as they would become in later incarnations from the pianist, the A-flat Ballade, then a manic Sonetto 104 Del Petrarca followed by a gorgeous Valse Oubliée. Horowitz again closes the program with the Liszt Fifteenth Rhapsody, another tour de force that must have provoked an instant standing ovation. His energy was just amazing:  five delicious encores follow including the finale, his famous arrangement of &#34;Stars and Stripes Forever.&#34; The sophisticated Carnegie Hall crowd actually bursts into applause when Horowitz launches into Sousa, and they were not to be disappointed by the pianist's jaw-dropping rendition. With this type of pressure it's no wonder Horowitz quit playing in public in 1953 and didn't return to the stage for twelve years.  There are countless highlights that deserve comment, but in the interests of brevity I'll touch on just a few. Schumann's &#34;Kreisleriana&#34; from December 1968 is outstanding; in fact, despite a noticeable flub in the third movement and occasional loss of focus, I prefer it to the recording released in the OJC box, an alternate (and far less desirable) version of a Columbia record which attained classic status soon after it was released in 1970.  The recital reading flows naturally as Horowitz moves from one episode to the next whereas the OJC recording has artificial pauses between some of the episodes which Horowitz wouldn't have intended. &#34;Pictures at an Exhibition,&#34; from the April 23, 1951 recital, has a volcanic power that exceeds even the other remarkable readings included here. In fact the entire recital, chunks of which were originally issued by RCA on two LP's in the 1950's, is extraordinary, including a stunning Chopin Polonaise-Fantasie, a gorgeous Nocturne, and an unusually intense Barcarolle among other things. Other highlights include a reading of Mendelssohn's &#34;Variations Sérieuses&#34; from 1950 that tops the blistering studio recording Horowitz made in 1946 - not because it's faster, but quite the opposite. There's a stateliness and poetry to it combined with those propulsive Horowitz octaves that make this performance unforgettable.  Horowitz's Prokofiev Seventh sonata from the March 1951 recital is an absolutely titanic performance where savage outbursts alternate with periods of repose, and a finale that erupts in a controlled fury. The Scriabin and Rachmaninoff pieces scattered throughout the set are of course superb. This is music that was suited to the pianist's background and temperament, and his understanding and performance of it are inimitable.  While Horowitz knew himself well, programming things that he had a great feel for, not everything he undertook came off well, especially some of his arrangements. Liszt's &#34;Vallee d'Obermann&#34; from 1966 is certainly exciting even though I think the pianist's additions are unnecessary. In the case of the emendations Horowitz made to Balakirev's &#34;Islamey&#34; and Liszt's &#34;St Francis of Paola Walking on the Water,&#34; I believe that the changes not only add nothing but actually detract from the composers' works.  His arrangement of the Liszt Legend, for example, turns it into such a series of pyrotechnical effects that it barely resembles the original score. Kempff's thrilling 1950 recording of the Legend and Arrau's monumental &#34;Islamey&#34; are proof enough that they don't need enhancing. The Liszt sonata from the 1949 &#34;Private Collection&#34; disc is also problematic. In this case Horowitz decided to cut from the score, from bar 291 to the middle of bar 313, and while he must have thought it an improvement, it would be disingenuous to describe it in any way other than as an example of bad judgment. Barring that, Horowitz's reading is organized, fluid and epic.  Gratuitous bursts of speed and crashing chords were sometimes part of the Horowitz territory, but they occur much less frequently throughout these Carnegie Hall recitals than one might expect.  Yes, the piano is occasionally &#34;turned upside down&#34; (the Tchaikovsky Concertos come immediately to mind - thrilling, yes; but just too fast), but the overwhelming majority of these recordings feature miraculous (and poetic) music-making from a charismatic personality who had the technique to execute what most others can only dream of.  In summary, then, this set isan irreplaceable document of great piano playing from one of the greatest musicians of the twentieth century.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Amazing! King at his best. He writes beautifully and his stories are always so unique. This book delivers just like all his biggest hits have. King still has it.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Tartt continues to write (as in The Secret History) with a teenage male as narrator.  It works well for her.  She succeeds in getting her locations right on target.  Manhattan and Vegas are right on.  Theo is a believable character and you really care about what happens to him as he goes from one place to another. There are so many poor novels out there today that it's a pleasure to read something substantive and well written.  I'm only half way through but I look forward to my daily session with this book.

B00CRS88IO|3.0|The interesting parts are interesting but he gets out of some pretty sticky situations too quickly.  The clothing descriptions are a lot like Clive Cussler's technique and about 1/2 paragraph too long.  To me, it detracts, not embellish the story line.  It reads quickly because the excitement level and wanted more at the end.  There is a teaser of the next book at the end and I read through that as well quickly.  More stories of the same please and I'll deal with the parts I don't like.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The daughter of some friends of mine had osteosarcoma, lost a leg and ultimately her life.  She was younger than the kids in this novel, but the insights and emotions are true (if a little... optimistic).  Not every family survives this tragedy, and if you've ever been around or part of a family who has gone through it, you can understand why.
037575251X|5.0|The book arrived in very good condition, well packaged.  Jack London has the ability to write with detailed descriptions of his life in the Arctic.  The stories are spell binding.
0385537131|4.0|I liked this legal mystery for several reasons.  First and foremost, it has a great plot that flows well despite many twists and turns.  Equally good is the cast of fully-fleshed out characters that populates the book.  Virtually the whole cast is multi-dimensioned and nuanced.  The author skillfully sets up a conflict between good and evil, but there is nothing over-the-top in either direction--these are real people reflecting their times and circumstances.  It gets pretty ugly when the story dips into the racial history of the South--Mississippi in particular--but there is always the hope of redemption held out for contemporary characters who are the heart of the book.<br /><br />So \\"Sycamore Row\\" is, at its base, a very, very entertaining story.  Very hard to put down in any of its section, and impossible to stop reading in its last 150 pages.  Highly recommended.
0743270754|5.0|Abraham Lincoln was the ultimate politician.  His political strategies, which are well detailed in this book, are a blueprint for modern day politicians.  He was very astute as well as being resolute in accomplishing his goals.

B00D954ACC|5.0|Populaire 2012 French movie.  5 stars ★ and loved it ♥<br /><br />I really loved this movie.  I watched it on my kindle with Netflix streaming (on the app).  It's a romantic comedy in the late 1950's setting.  The name Populaire is for the famous typewriter machine by Japy Populaire.  It's a feel-good-romance, in which it's a little predictable but with a little realistic touch to it.  There is more to the plot than the romance and I liked that.  I was laughing and cheering for Rose.<br /><br />The story focuses well on Rose Pamphyle - played by D&eacute;borah François. She wants to be more than a store clerk for her father's shop and be engaged to a local mechanic.  But she's very clumsy.  She then becomes a secretary for Louis &Eacute;chard (played by Romain Duris), even though she only uses two fingers to type and causes chaos (accidently shreds important document and broke shredding machine).  But that's all ok for Louis because he plans to have Rose become the World Champion in typewriting.<br /><br />The acting was really good.  Sometimes I was so focused on them that I'd forget to read the subtitles.  I really liked Rose.  The actress did a great job, especially with her typing skills.<br /><br />There's other subplots like Louis and his friends, Marie and Bob Taylor (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo and Shaun Benson) and their two kids.  Marie Taylor is Louis's ex so that gave a good twist.  I liked her as well.<br /><br />I really loved this movie and now am in the lookout for a US region dvd.
B004LWZW2E|3.0|This was a rather good movie with scenes that made me jump, which is hard to get me to do.  I knew nothing about it, other than it had a good rating here on Amazon.  The story developed well until the climax.  What a let down that was!  It was as if the writer had lost their way, or their interest in the story, and just grabbed at an ending, which I guessed before it came.  If they could cut off all the scenes after the revelation and change the ending, it would be a really good movie.  Now it's just fair.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|this show is the best horror show on TV. i cant wait to buy the other seasons and watch them with my friends
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The writing deserves a five-star review. This is amazing Neil Gaiman at his finest:<br />creating impossible characters and making them perfectly believable. The dark undertones are there as well, in spades. So why only 3 stars? I'll be frank-it's the price. This is a novella, at best, not a novel. And for this price I would expect a novel. I would buy this no matter, but would only do so with discounts added on top of a discount. Not that his writing doesn't warrant top price, but this is still an asinine charge for a short story.
B0002ADY1A|5.0|Great Album! Every song on this album are great to listen to. They don't make albums like this anymore. There is something about those old 70's bands and the analog recordings that they just can't come close to. The musicians were better, and they had not gone into the 80's cheesy sounding stuff yet. Buy it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a good game fun too although it needs minor improvements. It could have better graphics and it could make thing such as avatars a little easier to get.

For the most part it is a good game.<br /><br />  Sencerily,<br />  Anonymous

B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love the symbolism behind &#34;Walking Dead&#34; and how it isn't really speaking of the undead walking around, but more of the actual people trying to survive in a Zombie apocalypse.  The fact that this show isn't all about blood, guts, & gore and actually puts emphasis on how the characters grow and evolve throughout this ordeal is what makes it wonderful for me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have a day care and this teaches while having fun.  you learn to match colors, count and more.  The sound effects make them laugh and it is great for all ages.  My autistic child really gets excited.

B009369Z8A|3.0|My husband would have rated it higher, as he enjoyed both the movie and the book &#34;The Wettest County in the World.&#34;  I though the item was expensive, as it only came in this combo set, and would have preferred to be able to save money and just purchase the Blu-ray only.  As far as the quality went though, all was wonderful.  Packaged well, played well!

And yes, I read the first book - what a painful experience that was.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'm going to keep this short as I'm only a few weeks in and I haven't given this mouse time to settle.  The responsiveness of the optical sensors are great for everything I've used it for at this point.<br /><br /> From browsing, to mmo play and twitch shooting I have had a great user experience.<br /><br /> The switches have a nice tactile clicky feel to them which I hope doesn't degrade too much over time.<br /><br />The configurability and macro settings are outstanding and have been useful for helping me click the big cookie like a pro.  I like the cool led heart beat under the anchor, it is a nice touch.<br /><br />I haven't played around with reweighting it as that's not really a requirement of mine but for those who need it, the capability is there.<br /><br />I am most impressed by the device meeting my needs for a daily driver with the extra buttons and agility for my evening gaming sessions without having to spend outside of a budget range price.  Additionally the customer outreach and support process seems top notch.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Not a big Lady Gaga fan but this song is very catchy...  Ehy do I have to come up with more words than I feel I need to express my opinion
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is awesome because there are SO MANY charms! Just think of the possebilities! Just one problem, I keep getting stuck on level 32. A little bit easier please?
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book definitely held my attention right from the start. The only thing  I would have wished for was a different ending. It ended rather abruptly.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I liked this book because I like how August shows his feelings and how the book goes from different people's point of view<br />-Jacob S.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game each board is different easy to get addicted I don't have facebook so 24 hours waiting between the quests to get to the next levels seems excessive none the less a great game
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy this free game but I do wish the gem prices to get other horses weren't quite so high.
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|Very solid, fun and entertaining album. A great follow up to the suburbs though a completely different tone and feel.
0143039431|5.0|I love the book, what a hard time they had trying to stay alive.  It really is a hard book to read because of the way they spoke in those days.  The grammar I mean.
B0091PDC5U|2.0|This is not a greatest hits collection. It is a collection of out-takes and live tracks. the sound quality is excellent but this does not in any way represent Stevie-Ray's studio output.
B00DW36G32|2.0|Somewhat predictable and storyline was weak.  Travolta amd Deniro are great actors but it seemed odd they both agreed on this film.  Wasn't &#34;big&#34; enough for them, if that makes sense.
B00EWCV7QS|4.0|Lots of action and testosterone-Classic Arnold Style action movie.  Jesse Ventura is good in this as well.<br />It does have some bad language but most of them do.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Outstanding movie. For the goofballs that say this is too violent for their precious son/daughter - Why are you letting them watch it? If you know it's &#34;violent&#34; then don't let them watch it. Look! I've instantly solved your problem - aside from you being an overbearing and overprotective parent.<br /><br />My daughter (2 years old) loves this movie and I think it's exceptional in plot and creativity. It's not another boring Veggie Tales, it's a fun and entertaining movie for adults and kids.
B006MPKDD6|5.0|This is the third book in Michael Connolly's Harry Bosch series, so if you haven't read the other two – starting with the black echo – then you need to do that first. For those of you wondering whether to continue with the series, I absolutely recommend you do. In the concrete blonde, we are taken back to a case mentioned in the previous two books – the doll maker serial killer that made Bosch famous. The book weaves together a court case and the hunt for another serial killer, and the interaction between these two key settings is riveting. And if you're interested in romance – the book gives an additional bonus; Bosch is in love.<br /><br />Finally, it's worth noting that if you buy the book on kindle, amazon gives a very cheap upgrade to add to the audible audiobook. For me, listening to the story added some texture.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Classic and goody!! The Griswalds are sooo funny in this movie and we can't forget about Uncle Eddie. Good times!
B00CH3DBNQ|2.0|After knowing what happened to Malala last year and seeing her interview on TV, I wanted to do someting to show my support. I bought her book.  Unfortunately I'm sorry to say that I am having a difficult time getting through it.
B009NXV51S|5.0|Just got done watching ALMOST FAMOUS for the second time.<br /><br />Despite a few annoying moments, the movie is an absolute gem. I love the understated simplicity of so many of the performances.<br />There are some incredible moments!  Like when Kate Hudson just looks so hurt and is fighting back the tears and all she says is: &#34;What kind of beer?&#34;<br /><br />I so want to go into that world right now. The 70's were bad ass.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This US a great book! The author puts inside the book it almost feels like you are right along side the characters. However, very angry at a certain point of the book. The choice that was made I'm still trying to understand... ;)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very fun. I'm on level 34 and it is pretty challenging. But I wonder how my mom got on level 110???
B005TKD8ZK|5.0|It holds the two points of appeal for me, writing and running. How running turned his life on its head is inspiring. Writers need not be sick, weak and unhealthy
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I saw this randomly from Netflix and fell in love with it. Can't remember where I bought it but I now have it and  almost all of the music from Glen Hansard, Markita Irglova, Swell Season and The Frames.
B007N6ZH5M|5.0|A brilliant, brilliant book. A very fresh and unusual look at the recent history of nations which hold within it the future.
B008EEZ64Y|2.0|Loved the ending.......it made up for the discomfort I felt while reading the book. I loved hearing the author's many life experiences that led her to the story line. Life does mold you. Interesting while odd. Bravo Jonas! Bravo The Giver.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Very sensitive portrayal of a man on the run and a little boy with a lot of heart.  Warm and moments of excitement.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game has high quality on graphics but you have to pay money to get good items for your character other than that it is well worth the time
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|greatest thing is having a bigger screen. kindle version is great. one of the greatest games ever.cant wait for the next game that comes out.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I am an old man. I love to read. This was a fantastic story written at a breakneck pace. I love the style of writing.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It probably won't be everyone's idea of a good time but it is really cool and well done. I read reviews about it before buying, but was not disappointed at all. At first i wasn't sure about the animated look of the game, but it did grow on me very quickly. The gameplay is actually pretty cool and i like the touchscreen interactions. It is pretty graphic though, so definitely not for little ones.  This is a great addition to my growing Vita game collection, even though i only just started chapter two.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|This is one case I agree with the professional critics that this movie missed it's target.  Tried so hard to be like MIB and failed so miserably to do so it was often dishearting to watch.  The effects and acting were OK, so not unwatchable, but not a satisfying experience.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|always wants money in the middle of playing and having fun the *buy* come up and if you don't buy than your game goes bad
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I don't think King tried very hard. I could tell what was going to happen very early on. Not that it was overall a bad thing, I guess he just played to what fans of The Shining would expect.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My coworkers are addicted to this game.  I'm not but I do play it every day.  Pretty fun game for all.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|For a live style of the story Hansel & Gretel, the movie is fun to watch, and has neat special effects for it, and some a good story line for it to
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|My 6 year old really likes this game.  She plays it on her kindle fire that we bought last year.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I never thought teen books could be so engrossing. Katniss is a star.  Hope the movie is just as good.
B000FBJHT4|1.0|I do not believe one word this man wrote in this book. At points it actually funny. The title is very misleading. I can't think of a worse book. If you believe this crap then you are mentally insane.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|I needed to give it 5 stars to make it work.<br />Still testing it out, I have not found how to refresh or add new content after it installed,<br />So I had to remove the app and reinstall it to make it find the new movies.<br />The player works well with many different movie formats and I am very pleased with its performance.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|An excellent story by Sanderson, bringing his own style to the superhero/villain genre.  This is no simple comic book turned into a novel, for Sanderson has raised this genre to a new level.
0061950726|5.0|Fantastic book based on historical events in our country with regards to orphans in NYC. Quick, interesting read & eye opener for those of us who find immigration & adoption personal. Shipping with this particular vendor was slow.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was my favorite out of the series. I felt like 1 was too much like 50 shades and book 2 was starting to get interesting. Book 3 I felt I connected with the characters more. There weren't so many unanswered questions...well until the end that is.<br /><br />Looking forward to the other books coming out.<br /><br />This book actually made me fall in love with Gideon. I was so so with him in books 1 and 2.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I don't think I've read a bad one by Brandon Sanderson, and this one definitely continues that trend. Again, the level of character development and how much you CARE for figments of a man's imagination never cease to amaze me.
B007VUCAVO|3.0|I found this to be not all that different than the free version. But it does what it says it does and I am still using it because I paid for it.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I heard No More Hell to Pay and had to buy the whole album. This won't disappoint! High vocals, great harmonies, monster guitar solos! A mix of old Stryper with a more modern approach.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite apps.  It has many puzzle sizes and difficulty levels, so it's good for beginners and experts alike.  It shows you your mistakes and has a help button.  At medium difficulty in the 15x15 puzzle, I usually need help. It's not one of those brainless games.  You really have to think.  Great brain exercise!
B0086700CM|3.0|I'm having trouble getting the hang of it, however I guess the more you try the more you well improve.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|If you are just starting your own business or are thinking of starting you own business, this is a great book to read.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This came right on time. Perfect packaging and sealing. Quality was great! Definitely do not have any complaints. One of my daughters favorite movies!
B009G41CG2|2.0|The other jahjong game that is put on the barnes and noble knook is so much better than this one.  It is so much fun to play.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This series is awesome, and the 4-book bundle was really cheap. I need 9 more words so here is a sentence.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|was not worth putting on the kindle fire.  very disappointed in the game.  Like the one on the barnes and noble knook.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This is a wonderful narrative jam packed with typical interesting Bryson facts. As usual he captures the mood of the era.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|Fun game.  I only wish I could really bowl as well as I can on this game.  If you are a true gamer this might be too mild for you.  Works for me though.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|Please look at my review for My Alarm Clock.  It was locking up, so I uninstalled it and went looking for something more reliable.  Alarm Clock Xtreme isn't as slick as My Alarm Clock, but it plays my music, has multiple alarms and doesn't lock up on my Kindle Fire.  Also, it sounds the alarm but doesn't turn on the screen, which probably saves on the battery.  So far, much better.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|This was a good movie, but after reading the book, I was a little disappointed.  But overall, kept my attention and I thought the acting was excellent!
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Actually, I liked My Alarm Clock at first, multiple alarms, my own music, etc.  Then it began having problems with alarms not going off and locking up, so I had to reinstall it.  The Kindle Fire and My Alarm Clock don't seem to play well together, so I got a different one.  I suspect that part of the problem was My Alarm Clock's need to check for the weather, which I had switched off, but it still tried to get the weather, even when I wasn't connected to the Internet.  My new alarm clock, Xtreme Clock, seems to be working well and doesn't have any obvious Internet connection needs (no weather, etc.).  It's not as slick as My Alarm Clock, but it works.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|An all too plausible scenario carried out to the last degree and presented through flat, one dimensional characters that one never really cares about. Although I did finish the book I kept wondering why I was taking the time with a book that could have been done so much better.  I was vastly disappointed in what I hoped would be a much more engrossing and entertaining read.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it, beautifully constructed. A love letter and homage to all things from the 80s, really enjoyable. One word that closed the deal for me: Ultraman.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is a good read. Has a very good storyline and I have enjoyed reading this and will be on to the next one soon.
B00C5R7F8G|3.0|Terrible writing style. Disconnected development of what the author is trying (a good descriptive word) to tell the reader.  I would't buy it again!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved it the first time I read it as a teenager. Thrilling and enthralling- I fell instantly in love with the sweet, compassionate, boy-genius. I wanted to read it again now that the movie is out and though I remembered the main plot points, it was still just as exciting the second time around. I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days. If you are the least bit interested in science fiction or fantasy, read this classic and you'll love it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Use it everyday and have since switched to this as my main email address due to it's ease and efficiency!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this sweet but tragic novel. It was hard to put down, I look forward to reading more of this author's work
B004ZH66XO|1.0|Had to delete it due to its lameness. Could possibly be fun for others who don't find simple things entertaining.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I cant get enough.  I even take nh kindle with me tl play while I'm traffic. does wonders tor road rage.
B0089LOG02|2.0|I wanted very much to like this book as I was intrigued by its subject matter and it sounded like a coming-of-age tale, which I always love. Sadly though, I ended up returning my Kindle version almost immediately. I felt the writing style to be a bit lacking and young adult-ish. I was expecting literature and this book did not deliver. It simple didn't grab me or enchant me like good books do.<br /><br />I was looking for amazing prose and a fine piece of literature, and so ultimately found that this was not the book for me.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|The quality of this toy is incredible!  My grandson is 6 months old and loves it.  I would highly recommend this toy to all new parents.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|Although I read the whole book and found the end worth the multiple points that just did not &#34;work&#34; for me overall it did not encourage me to desire to read the next one of this series.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I like this app because you don't have to go all the way to the web just to look something up. Now all you got to do is click and type! It saves you more time to! Now you know I love this app!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I haven't read the book, but my son loved it!  I was very happy that he got 10 out of 11 points on his AR quiz. He only missed one question and he also wanted to read another book like it.  Does anybody have a good book that they can recommend?
B000MV9026|2.0|This movie doesn't play in the player because the disc is too thin and the lazer goes right through it!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is so fun I also got the second version and enjoy that as well! Starts out easy but then gets challenging .
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The English to me have such a dry sense of humor, but its hysterical to view a take on their wealthy and their presumed attitudes. This series is so entertaining, and in many places so funny to take in.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|In this book, Dave Eggers tries his best to wake the reader up and make them pay attention to the demands put on us all by social networking and the uses of data collected by various and sundry technologies.  While it seems that Eggers slammed out this book in no time at all (it's not his best work, in my opinion), it does do the trick.  I will never look at a social networking site, nor read an ad for a job in a tech company quite the same way again.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Hard to follow but I made it thru.  Had no clue they were making it into a movie.  Well be interested in seeing how the movie is treated.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|my dreams have come true!!!!!! thank you! I've been waiting for this on my kindle feels like a thousand years!
B0040X46TE|5.0|I love this CD...I could listen (and sing along) all day long.  His music is magical, and so wonderful.  I'll be buying more for<br />my sisters and my daughter.
B008469DGY|3.0|I'm not good at direction games, especially when speed is involved. I just wanted to sit and look at the scenery and listen to the background.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|Works well and fast. Very helpful while learning calculus based mathematics. Has customized keyboard that makes inputting math symbols very easy.
B009XWD02G|1.0|I added this before I found out it was not the one that I wanted to use. I can't really rate it.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Who was going to tell me that after thirty years full of classics,Stryper would do his best album and honestly is what I think. I will not make a review song to song, just say that this cd is awesome. Mixing hard rock and classic melodic heavy metal . The years do not affect this band (have done a deal with the devil???). God bless this band.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Once I got the hang of it, this is really great. My songs are all there for, me all in a row. Wow.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Refreshing, humane,unespected, a milestone, a fundation, a promise of a future masterpiece that I'm absolutely sure all your current and futere readers eill wait anxiously to devour as soon as it's released.<br /><br />My most sincere thanks.
0345803507|5.0|This completed the set!  I was anxious to read on when I received it and I was not disappointed at all.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game has been great. It even have me a few scares.  It has a nice visual screen and most tasks aren't too obscure.  Sometimes, the button placement a makes you click on something you didn't mean to but overall a good game.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I resist reading books that are movies, but liked it anyway.  It's interesting use of language and descriptive passages, it's poignancy without sentimentality and the ending.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The best mystery I've read in a long time. There were many surprising plot twists, but all were plausible and well-done. But the most fascinating part of the boo in my mind is Flynn's dissection of popular concepts of long-term relationships. I don't want to include any spoilers, so I'll say no more. I like Natalie's review a lot, though, so if you haven't read this yet and want more detail, see: [...]
B00COMLLX2|4.0|I love pinball and these games are lots of fun. There are specific goals to achieve and they are challenging.
B00D7OMNXS|1.0|Blu-ray disc does not work if there was a zero rating I would've given it that second I returned it  2 TIMES; I ended up not being able to use the Blu-ray disc. I took one of the Blu-ray disc to Best Buy's so they could test it on their Blu-ray player; they informed me that this was not usable in the United States.<br />From: Frank S. from Long Island
B002CIY8EM|5.0|With more than  billions of stars (suns) out there it is simply stupid to think we are the only life at the level and above what we are.<br />I've visited some of the sites on our planet and have seen work done by our ancestors which we today can not compete with.  This book asks questions we can not answer, but because of the questions, some day we may find answers.<br /><br />Dan Salerno
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|A way-too-predictable look at a world in which today's internet privacy and social media trends have been carried to their extreme conclusions.  Unless these are issues that you have never thought about, you'll find nothing new here.  The presentation of the issues is done as a series of long, dull lectures of the sort you might expect to hear from a cult leader speaking to their clueless, fawning followers, which is the role taken by the book's main character.  I kept waiting for something unexpected to happen.  Nothing ever did.  I was bored.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Each room is so different.  I hope it isn't a let down.  Time passes quickly by as you concentrate on each clue.
B00FQU93OS|5.0|Very good collection of Seether's biggest hits.  Any Seether fan will recognize that most, if not all, of the required songs are on this disc.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is simple and very entertaining. Having a hard time putting it down. Glad they offer it on kindle!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I loved the happy ending, on such a sad life.  He over came, but at such a cost!  I loved the resolution of his romance.
0545615402|5.0|This collection is a must-have for hardcore Potter fans and anyone who wants to prolong the magic. To begin with, they are beautifully made and of good quality. The paper of the pages feels just like that of the original Harry Potter books, and overall the books are bound well and don't seem cheap. The covers are definitely something I'd expect to see at the Hogwarts Library: they are attractive primary colors and jewel-toned, staying with the Harry Potter theme.<br /><br />As for the contents of the books, they're quick reads but they give tons of extra information on the wizarding world. Don't expect too much on Harry Potter himself, but you'll learn a lot about his world. Reading these books feels like the first day Harry walked into Diagon Alley. The best book is the one about Beedle the Bard, because it contains full stories of legends referenced in the books. It also has papers added into it, written by Dumbledore, giving insight into Dumbledore's mind and personality. Magical Beasts is peppered with notes from Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
B003G4W49C|5.0|So glad I read this before the movie came out.  Reading is always so much better!  The book had tender moments, carried the story line well, and was a great example ofthe benefits of mentoring.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|A great little movie!!! The kids really loved it and the adults enjoyed it too. Funny for all ages (=
0345525558|4.0|I found it interesting to know that flowers could convey so much!  I never knew that, so that, in itself, made the book interesting.  The characterization and settings were compelling and vivid, but I had to go with 4 stars because i just found the mood so overwhelmingly sad and lonely.  I think that's because this author is so very good at what she does, but it made me unhappy even though the ending sort of played out with a little hope.
B009LDD4V4|4.0|The conclusion of Season 7 had Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel) on the run with her baby Christine, framed for a murder she didn't commit by the brilliant killer Christopher Pelant (Andrew Leeds). However, the first episode of Season 8 brings them home to Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz), as Brennan's expertise is needed in discovering the killer of a high school guidance counselor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Pelant continues to terrorize the Jeffersonian team, taunting them with murders they cannot pinpoint on him, as well as sabotaging their bank accounts, keeping them under constant surveillance and otherwise taking over their lives.<br /><br />Other key episodes include &#34;The Method in the Madness,&#34; where Sweets moves in with Booth and Brennan; and &#34;The Patriot in Purgatory,&#34; where the team struggles to learn whether a man who died in 9/11 was a victim or in fact a perpetrator.<br /><br />In &#34;The Bod in the Pod,&#34; the team learns about Cam's new secret romance; and in &#34;The Diamond in the Rough,&#34; Booth and Brennan go undercover in a dance competition.<br /><br />Some supernatural elements come into play in &#34;The Shot in the Dark,&#34; when Brennan is shot and nearly dies, causing her to visit with her long-dead mother. The question is, did she really speak to her mother or simply dream it?<br /><br />In &#34;The Fact in the Fiction,&#34; viewers meet a new intern, Dr. Oliver Wells, as smart as the other squinterns yet impossibly obnoxious and difficult to deal with.<br /><br />Finally, Booth has a shock in &#34;The Party in the Pants,&#34; when he reunites with his mother (Joanna Cassidy) after over twenty years' separation and must come to grips with the circumstances that caused her to leave him and his brother Jared as children.<br /><br />As usual, this season provides viewers with a satisfying mix of intriguing cases and personal situations, especially now that Booth and Brennan have a young daughter. Despite the grim predictions of many, putting the two leads together in a romantic or personal way hasn't deterred from their crime-fighting focus in the least!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Does what it is supposed to and does not require an external power source. So far so good. Definitely recomend.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|As always this program keeps up with the tradition of new ideas for the future and some will come true some day. It was not quite as good as the other series of Star Trek thus the 4 out of five stars. However it is worth watching.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Nicely packaged.  I've enjoyed the Director's cuts, particularly of Aliens.  I have seen Aliens hundreds of times, but not the directors cut.  The extra footage on LV-426 before the alien attack began was a nice surprise.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|From the first few pages I knew I would like this book. I fell in love with Mia from the very beginning. I never write a review but I felt I HAD to for this book. It makes me appreciate everything I have, all my loved ones. Thank you Mia.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Not as gripping as the earlier volumes in the series, this installment at least restores many familiar protagonists after the disconcerting book four where we were confronted by many new faces and plot twists. There are plenty of surprises, plenty of shocks and of course anyone who has followed the saga to this point is naturally going to read on. The language/expression changes again, is a little inconsistent, but perhaps that is inevitable with books written years apart.<br />There is also a considerable sense of padding and filling-in, but never mind, the tale is good and is moving forward and the best heroes are still around (or at least, so we hope!)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't beleive I have wasted so much time playing this game it is addictive and fun.<br />It is pretty interesting game and fills down time. I find myself playing more than I thought I would
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great. love this game. my grandson also plays this game and he us only 2. great friends on line to chat with aldo
B008Q0AJA2|3.0|I'm Not a huge Jim Carrey fan but it was a decent movie. Glad it was free with amazon prime.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|I love the horror genre, and this got my attention from the get go. I could not stop watching it. Its actually scary and that surprised me for a TV show.
B009XI7RF6|4.0|My 2yr old likes it and its good for teaching him about mixing colours. Sometimes he needs a little help as its a decent puzzle game too. Unique
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|Cool graphics, smooth operation &amp; nice upgrades.  Good for killing time or just for fun.  Plus it's fun to kill things, digitally that is.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|couldn't really work out what advantage this gave over the volume control that came with the nexus 7. No point
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a great looking and playing Mahjong game for Android.<br />Got it as the free game of the day in the Amazon app store.<br />Would happily pay full price for a game like this.<br />...but if you've never played Mahjong-like games, maybe try something free first to make sure it's your thing.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|Interesting and very nerdy which is good. A simple game with a good physics engine. Too complicated for little kids but for adult nerds its a great little game.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time and find it fun. I'm active on it so add my ID: EBYVQEN. Thanks. I will visit and send gifts!
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Different type of puzzler, interesting. Graphics could of been a lot better, very basic indeed but does what it is supposed to do. Liked it.
B00FKAA3MA|3.0|Em's word play & lyrical gymnastics are as good as ever on this album, but the problem is he keeps talking about the same old bull s***.    His Mom, His Ex-Girl, move on already...you are 40 years old now. Start talking about something meaningful, that is happening in the world. You aren't a kid anymore.    The beats are VERY mediocre at best. They either recycle tired old country or rock songs or sound like a generic casio keyboard.    Em can still spit with the best of them, but he needs a producer who can give him direction & topics that will bring out the best in him.    His mind & lyrics are as sharp as ever, but he sounds like he's lost & doesn't know which direction he should go with them.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really really like this game. It keeps me occupied on rainy and boring days. Keeps my brain active and challenges my mind
B004P8JPS6|4.0|One of the best that I have read.  I like the fact that there was more twist and turns in this book and not so predictable.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very fun and addictive game. It is very challenging and it is fun to see where I compare with all my friends.
1107699894|5.0|Its a great book, the exercises are really. I got it for my cousin as she had finished  the intermediate grammar book. And she is learning a lot from it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Once you start playing you won't be able to get enough. The only bad part is only getting 5 tires.
B000HZCZYW|5.0|i absolutly love this movie. I am a hugh Star Trek fan. My dad turned me onto it when I was little.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Very good production. You have not only the best songs but also one of the most beautiful shows to watch, with good dancers, performers and a nice stage.
B009LDD5E0|5.0|I love the Glee series and so does my family.  We watch it over and over again.  I would highly recommend this movie.

B00003CY0V|4.0|and oldie but goodie! I love john Travolta. The movie was in good shape no scratches. the product was shipped on time and no damages.I have no complaints.
B00EFB8UHU|5.0|I wish I understood French. I've always been a fan of Stromae. For this album in particular, I loved the amount of emotion that can be heard from his tone alone along with interesting upbeat elements. I still haven't gotten tired of this album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is great fun.  I enjoy the changes in the game from level to level.  It keeps it interesting!

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Loved visiting Doc after all these years. Abra was awesome. I am glad you didn't go into too much detail when the True Knot had their steam from the baseball boy. I thought you may go further, glad you aren't that writer.<br />Basically, having read all of your works, this is a great read.thanks Constant Author!!!...
B00ESNE696|5.0|Best show on TV  the actors the writers the story lines are all awesome I love how quickly amazon update the shows
B005S9EKCW|5.0|LOVE this movie. Don't listen to the nay sayers. Acting and Singing was great. You won't be sorry if you grab yourself a copy.
B00AEFY552|5.0|My favorite movie of all time. Russell Crowe is epic in his performance. I cannot think of a greater gladiator movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I could not put this book down. Period. I purchased it at 8am on a Friday and when I looked up at the clock, starving and tired eyes it was 8 pm. The last 30 pages of this novel touch your soul on a level that no other book ever has. It took me a week to write this review just because I wanted to see how long the characters stuck with me. Liesel Meminger, Hans Hubermann, Max, Rudy, you know their fates, Death tells you up front, he hates mystery, but it still does little to lessen the blow at the end. Markus even makes you care about Michael, the son of Rosa's Hubermann's rival, who only makes an appearance for perhaps 30 pages but the way he weaves him in and fleshes him out elevates him from the level of a simple placeholder to &#34;my Lord, I love this character.&#34;<br /><br />There is no way you can walk away from this book unchanged. It will stick with you forever. I bought it because the movie looked interesting, now I refuse to see the movie because I dare not let them ruin this wonderful piece of literary art that some day will join the likes of Steinbeck, Verne, and other classic novelists on the bookshelves of timeless works. Buy this book. You certainly will NOT regret it. That is my promise to you.
B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|Sometimes movies need to be made to awaken people's sense of justice.  12 Years a Slave has a similar role in doing that to Schindler's List, other than that Schindler's List also was about the power of one individual to make a difference.  12 Years a Slave is very, very realistic in presenting the life of slaves, but is equally conscientious about not being overindulgent in it.  The director, Steve McQueen (no relation to the 1960s actor), was discreet (tried to neither underdo nor overdo) with depicting the naked humiliation and floggings, didn't explicitly show the sexual molestation by a cruel master of a young slave woman, and often chose to show disturbing things from some distance and without total clarity.  Close-ups of brutality were done with the minimum of gore necessary to depict the reality.  Sadly, many people today believe slavery was only a side issue in the Civil War, and I hope and pray this film will wake people up to the historical reality.  If we wish to avoid future catastrophes like the Civil War and World War II, we need to be very careful to not allow our societies to get used to cruelty like was done to slaves and to Jews.  The three moral flaws of both the southern slaveholding system and the Nazi Third Reich were their racism, their overemphasis on submission to authority without regarding themselves as accountable to God for how they treated those under them, and their hierarchical system which had no accountability.  The slaveholder was accountable to no one, nor was Hitler.  I hope that this film helps more people realize that any government without an accountability system is a recipe for disaster, and that they will be more active in grassroots activism for that reason.<br /><br />Just before seeing 12 Years a Slave, I saw the new movie All Is Lost that has Robert Redford trying to survive alone at sea.  I mention All Is Lost to make the point that 12 Years a Slave gets its strong sense of justice from its acknowledgment that there is a God of justice.  In both movies, the character is trapped and without any reasonable hope, though he keeps trying to escape his predicament.  I think this one's a lot better.  All Is Lost was about self-reliance against the forces of nature, and really nothing more.  God was either distant or nonexistent, and the movie ended without any acknowledgment that the last-minute rescue was God's intervention.  12 Years a Slave insists that there is a God of justice and that He will ultimately not allow this system of brutal slavery to continue.  It serves as a reminder of a horrible past, but is made even more timeless because it places the focus of the moral struggle on who God is.  The slaveowner believes God is all about subservience.  The slave believes God is about kindness and supporting the cause of those who are cruelly persecuted.  There is some good discussion toward the end about God's justice in Brad Pitt's small but memorable role.  The movie could have used a bit more, but what it has is sufficient.  Pitt's character helps our hero, Solomon Northup, regain his freedom.  Brad Pitt was a producer for the film.<br /><br />The acting is excellent in the movie.  The script has dialogue that I can believe would have really been used, and usually comes off sounding like it's authentic instead of like a theatrical performance, which is good.  The movie does very well stylistically at presenting the atmosphere in a realistic but also beautiful way.  It was filmed in Louisiana and has carefully conceived outdoor shots, realistically lit interior shots that still feel artistic, and a stunning reminder of the disgusting contrast between the plantation mansion and the outdoor hard work of the slave.  It made me realize, even more than I already did, how much simpler it would be if the slaveholders just treated their slaves with respect, paid them well, let them work for whomever they chose, and let them climb the ladder through hard work.  Instead, it's a daily powerplay, an internal struggle within the overseer and master as to how much torture the slave should get, and a constant fear that the slave will rebel.<br /><br />If anyone thinks he/she could handle watching two pretty brutal flogging scenes, three scenes of discreetly presented naked humiliation, and human relationships between slave and master that are harshly realistic, I recommend this.  It's not something you \\"must\\" see if you don't have the stomach for it.  But it's a monumental movie and probably will become the best movie showing the reality of slave life.  It goes neither too light nor too heavy in depicting the reality, in my estimation, and will hopefully make many people more attuned to justice and willing to fight against injustice.
B000INAXGU|4.0|Getting to know the new stuff included. I had all the previously released material, but it is nice to have all my faves on one cd.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|Great historical reference if your hobby is military history and / or if you build WW2 model submarines. The dubbed in english is very well done. The movie running time is a bit too long.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|this kept my attention and did not see the end coming. i found it an interesting twist on beings with super powers.
B000FA675C|5.0|It keeps you guessing and trying to solve the mystery throughout the story.  Spellbinding!  I loved the descriptions of the locations and it brought back visual images of my time in Italy.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|A Harilous movie. Brad pitt is a fabulous actor in this movie. Very violent and grusome, but if you can get past that its a great movie. makes you think of a different way WWWII could of ended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very entertaining! Takes you to a different time and is very accurate. You're will want to watch it all in one sitting.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Gerard bulter. Do I need to say anything else?Great action movie and also a very moving movie. If you like movies that are gruesome this is the one for you.
0744014956|5.0|Great stuff! Don't remember why I purchased it before. But if you do love GTAV, this is something that you have to get!
B002D0L0R2|5.0|I love musicals. They always seem to lift you up no matter what mood you are in.The songs are cacthy too. If you are in love with musicals, zac efron or just like movies in general this is the one for you?
0385349947|5.0|I cannot recommend nor speak more highly of this book. This book puts in perspective the many facets of issues women face in the work place, among our personal relationships with significant others, and fighting the \\"social norm.\\" Sandberg addresses the internal conflicts women face as we try to tackle everything in our lives and why we ought to stand together and change the way we are looked at by society. Best book I've ever read. I'm forever a fan.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I love Matt Damon. People are always judging movies by the actors in the film rather than giving the plot a chance. This movie is about our destiny and whether we are  in charge of it or if someone else is. I know I am not the only one who thinks about this question. If you are curious about the past, present and future this movie emphazises on it all. Great movie!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Although this movie didn't hit top charts, if your a person from the Johnny Sock-O,Giant Robot, Goldar, Godzilla era then you will appreciate this movie.  Brings back the memories of the old Godzilla movies and Robot hero's from childhood to a new level of technical and special effects, not the old model train building and plastic doll crushing houses we came to love.
B00005JL78|5.0|I first saw this in a class for High school. It makes you wonder what the future and how it pertains to the future. What will the government be able to see and hear about us in the future. How much more controlling might they be?
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Very entertaining and clever. I wanted a book that would make me laugh while on vacation. This book delivered and more!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|A great Jane Austen book brought to life on screen. The actors were fabulous in their parts. I know this movie like the back of my hand, that is how much I love it. If you are into romantic movies, this is a good one to watch.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|Bought this as a 'no reason' gift for my wife so I could clear the recording from our DVR that had been taking up disk space for almost two years. Now she can watch to her heart's content, without having to speed past the commercials.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|There are so many movies out there about Cinderella and the glass slipper. This one is a good one that gives it an interesting aspect that some might not thin of. If you are romantic person, or like the sotry of Cinderella, you should watch this movie
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|This season is off to a great start, which is refreshing cause I thought season 4 was a little dragging and slow.
B002YNS0VC|5.0|This is a great book to read for anyone who is creative and stuck! I recommend you read this for inspiration. This book will help me to move pass my fears, relax and enjoy the ride to what I want to do.
0763644765|5.0|This is a fantastic potty book. We started potty training our kid a little on the early side but now that he is 2 years old he loves reading this book! Even though he is not yet potty trained, he can say the words &#34;undies,poop and potty&#34; because of this book. He actually will pick up the book and read it himself in his own baby language. Also, he will ask us to read it and after we are done he will say &#34;again, again&#34; to read it to him again. Also because of this book he will sit on the potty occasionally.
B00AEBB8BU|5.0|Three Days of the Condor a  favorite for me!<br />It was very entertaining in its presentation and can be viewed over and over again and see new actions.
0312330537|5.0|A vivid journey through India that you will not find in the tourist guide! I just love this book and ill read it again!
B003G4W49C|4.0|This has been a gripping story.  I am looking forward to the next one. Ender is the best and worst a person can be.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|The movie was good and unique the actors were good as well.  I was just a little bored with all the digital effects.  Seems there is just to much digital movies these days.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great program, we watch 2-3 at a time. Will hook you! When nothing else is on Tv we watch this.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I am  so addicted to this game! I love the different puzzles, and challenges. Plenty of ways to keep you moving forward, without completing the game too quickly.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book grabs the reader from the start and doesn't let go. You can't help but love Auggie 's sweet character and feel his fears, anxieties, nervousness towards starting school and making friends. The dynamics between Auggie (with his  deformities) and the reaction of his family members, teachers and peers is both realistic, honest and heartfelt. The story provides a wonderful opportunity for discussion about differences, caring, kindness and tolerance. This book examines character and depicts human shortcomings, as well as strengths, brilliantly. What an amazing book for the middle grade readers to engage with in literature circles.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|hi this is a great game / activity but you should not have people writing this thats not fun the game is
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Much too long---GET TO POINT!!!!!  It could have been half as long. This is the first of the series I have tried--would not continue.
B000784WMW|5.0|Very beautifully done, only Timothy Dalton and  Zelah Clarke, can do justice  to this movie,  This was the first time I got to see the entire movie,  I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />Thank you!
B008Y5T5ZE|3.0|The acting is excellent and Johnny Depp delivers a great performance. The movie is very interesting to watch and is a true mystery. The plot is very strong, taking you step by step of the 9 gates and the 3 books. However, there are holes in the story and the ending leaves you hanging with no real answers. I was hoping for that wow moment and found myself disappointed.
0744014956|3.0|For starters. The book arrived on time. Its exactly as pictured. And it serves great purpose. But the thing is, it seems used or like the pages were wet at some point. The pages are all wavy. Maybe it was put together the wrong way. I cant tell. But it is a great strategy guide. Thats the only reason i gave it 3 stars and not 1. This guide has it all. Spaceship parts, letter scraps, submarine parts, Epsilon things, and anything else you could want so you can achieve 100% completion. (No Jetpack though. Methinks by now we have all realized that there is no jetpack. Maybe it'll be on DLC. Hopefully.. Oh and the book looks great on the outside. Matte black with the green &#34;V&#34;..nice.. plus you get a lithograph. Any questions feel free to ask..
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So much fun. A great game for those days when u need to just relax and forget your troubles. So great.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Amazing app must purchase if you don't purchase it you don't know what you are missing.I would purchase this by November 5
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow. Just wow. How do you do it Suzanne Collins??? You are as great author and I love the Hunger Games!!
B009PMB3CI|3.0|It's pretty good, but it gets boring...you just do the same things over and over again... But when I babysit, they always like to play games with the puppy
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Didn't bother keeping this game on my device. Not at all fun. This is not a bingo lovers first choice.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very good graphics and a lot of fun to play. Time flies playing this cool game! My daughter got me hooked and I love it.  U can feel the joy of an actual kill, without really killing any animals!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You don't &#34;have to&#34; be a facebook member to play, but you can if you like. The levels are easy to hard and even though the lives are renewable, Oh golly it can be a challenge... Especially if you don't &#34;buy&#34; your way around using real cash. The graphics on this game are fabulous and I'm only at level 54 right now. Golly it seems like I've matched those silly little ping pong balls thousands of times each. absolutley fun to own!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|No glitches on Kindle Fire 1st generation.  Graphics clear.  Good balance of point and click and HOS.  I would have liked a strategy guide, but on the other hand, this just made me work harder!  I'll be buying Enigmatis 2, if I can find it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|it is not working for me .. i tried many many many times to install it and make it work, i spent an hour with google support but with no luck, they say that my router settings has something wrong but i checked everything and did everything they mentioned but again not working .. i think that the device is good but it is not working for me and support are not good at all
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|Wow. This is the real deal. What a wonderful, musical, intelligent, heartfelt recording. Great songs. Great performances. Great production quality. If this does not catapult Mr. Porter into the forefront of jazz composers/singers, there is something wrong with the universe. For me, there are songs here that should become standards, and he provides readings of his material that are, in turn, robust, sensitive or powerful, depending upon the style. An excellent, excellent disk.
B004P5RMZ2|4.0|The extras are good to hear once or occasionally. After that, I like that it had the original concert with more of just the music.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book will become a classic - it is that good.  Beautifully written, portraying the harsh realities of Nazi Germany during the war through the eyes of the protagonist Liesel and the narrator Death.
B008GWOVB8|5.0|Makes you want to dance! Very tasteful music, I love the dance moves. Plus, I mean JOHN TRAVOLTA! Really enjoyed it.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|...til yesterday! In a simple word: AMAZING! Believe whatever hype you're hearing and get this album! Melodic, yet bone-crunching guitars...and I have no idea how Michael does it - his voice SOARS!!!! I would have to agree and say this is their BEST ALBUM, and I've been into this band since 1984's YABA EP. No More Hell To Pay is a STELLAR return to form and does not disappoint!!!!!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book has a great balance of sentiment and scares! Loved it and realized that I need to read more Neil Gaiman!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book, could not put it down wanted to know the end.  Loved the characters! You will not be disappointed.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The first Chromecast device Amazon sent me did not work. I spoke with Google support and they told me the device was defective and I should return it to Amazon. Amazon was very good about the return and replaced the device with another one. However, the second device also was defective. I spoke again with Google and they instructed me to return the device to Google and they would replace it. Both Google and Amazon were excellent to work with.<br /><br />Third time was the charm.  The replacement Chromecast device sent from Google works great.  Set up was a snap. Everything worked exactly as advertised. I'm now able to broadcast whatever is on my laptop to my TV using the Google Chrome browser and the new Google Chromecast device.  Just remember to download the Google Chromecast add-on to the Chrome browser.<br /><br />I rated this transaction as 3 stars because of being shipped 2 defective devices from Amazon. Fortunately, Google is really good about helping if there are any problems.<br /><br />I love Google Chromecast and would highly recommend you try it.  It's the perfect add-on for a flat screen TV.
B00AEBBADG|3.0|I saw this movie many years ago. I bought this for a friend who wanted his wife to see this old movie. She had never seen it. I really never cared to watch it again.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Allegiant followed it's predecessors path quite nicely. I won't get into the spoilers, but I think it wraps up the series quite nicely. If you have read the whole series the ending makes perfect sense. I was proud of Roth for doing what needed to be done there.<br /><br />Yes, there were some holes in the story you could drive a truck through, but I don't mind them so much. I expect some of that from reading YA. We're not talking about Tolkien or Austen here.<br /><br />I was not so thrilled about the constantly shifting POV, but I can tell you from a teacher's perspective, it will make a great mentor text for that.<br /><br />This is not your &#34;Harry Potter lives no matter how stupid he is&#34; series, so why should it have that ending.<br /><br />Go Veronica!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all the books,but this one was the best. Hope to see more books from the author. These books were addicting.
B0056TYT66|5.0|Installed fine. Works great. Great to have both USB 3.0 and SATA III.  Only advise to those who wish to add a combo card: please make sure it fits as there are numerous and different PCI slots on a motherboard.  See your motherboard instruction manual first.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I love the show . . . looking forward to another season of ups and downs and new revelations.  DELANA all the way.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|If you have any doubts that Bowie's got it, just buy and listen. Best album of the year due to being a complete surprise.
B00FN811SY|1.0|I would love for Amazon to make this available for my Kindle Fire HD. I have it on my iphone. I would hate to have to trade in my Kindle for an iPad because of 1 app.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I must be dumb, I couldn't really figure this game out and dumped it pretty quickly.  Didn't seem to be much to it to me, wasn't worth the bother.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love the game but don't like the fact that you have to pay for extra hints!! It is very addicting! Don't want to put my kindle down.
B00BPXAQQO|5.0|My granddaughters love the dolls. That's enough! They are easy to handle for little hands. They hold up well with active little children.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I can't remember the last time I read a whole book through it's entirety since I was a kid. Great Book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it and tell everyone to read it they love it too --  I never wanted to put it down - it's what u call a page turner of finger fliper since it was on my kindle
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love it.  So creative and entertaining.  A show we couldn't wait for.  Now we can't way for number 2 :)
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is an awesome CD! I Can't give it enough stars! I Definitely recommend it, even if you are not a Stryper fan.
B00E9P959O|5.0|It's Rush, really???? Anytime the answer is &#34;Rush&#34;, the question is irrelevant. Great remix and much more enjoyable to listen to then the original disc.
B00D48BT5A|5.0|Enjoyable.<br />Usual Bryson mix of fact, insight and wry humour.<br />Also depth of research is stunning as he cross links events.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I love Bill Bryson and have read several of his books. Once again he has written an informative, witty, and thoroughly entertaining novel.
3527406018|5.0|Griffiths stricks again.  This man is amazing.  He is not only ridiculously smart, but knows how to help you learn topics that are ridiculously hard.  Most undergrads don't require this book.  I didnt, but I still bought and read this.  I loved it, and Griffiths is great.  buy it!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|this is a very fun game but no way am I going to pay for levels or link to facebook! disappointed
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is Stryper's heaviest record and it has hooks galore. The guitar riffs are unbelievable. Some songs have a cool, gritty sound, but with huge, soaring choruses. Songs like \\"Sympathy\\" and \\"Legacy\\" will get into your head and stay there. The album is well-produced with tons of low end on drums and bass, yet without a hint of muddiness. Highest marks.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I never really watched the original Star Trek.  I've seen the occasional episodes (enough to know about the universe Star Trek exists in) but have never watched it from beginning to end.  Then again, the beginning of The Original Series predates my date of birth by over 20 years.  Maybe one of these days I'll get into it but not before I finish Enterprise.<br /><br />This series is pretty amazing.  The premise of it is that it's the middle of the 22nd century and Earth's Starfleet has finally developed their first ever Warp 5 capable starship, the Enterprise, designation NX-01.  In this age, the crew is afraid of the transporter (&#34;what if it doesn't put your molecules back together right?&#34;), shuttlepods are used to get from Enterprise to a planet and airlocks are still heavily used, phase pistols are brand new (there are only 15 of them in existence, all of them aboard the Enterprise), and polarizing the ship's hull is the only way to prevent against catastrophic damage to the ship, with shielding still in development.  The Vulcans believe that humans are far too emotional and illogical to be in deep space, and actively try to hold them back.  Vulcan mind-melds are considered taboo and those who perform them are looked down upon.  It's a strange world for anyone who has seen even a little of the original series, but most of the differences are gradually and artistically resolved throughout the series; commendation should really be given to the writers for the great work they did presenting an almost unrecognizable past to Star Trek and then resolving it throughout the series to the universe The Original Series existed in.<br /><br />The series, so far, is very well written and directed.  The episodes are entertaining and thoughtful.  If you enjoy science fiction, you'll definitely enjoy this series.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The Husband's Secret, although clever, reads like a script to &#34;Desperate Housewives Down-under.&#34; It probably has a great audience among devotees of the television series.  TDG
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such a great and enjoyable series.  It is refreshing to watch a series that takes us back to a time when life was much simpler. No extreme violence, sex, or killings.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|As a look into the lives of oppressed women , &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; is among the best fictionalized accounts. A great book club selection which would be sure to lead to lively discussion.  TDG
B00F91SCXC|2.0|The fakeness of the CG zombies really ruin the film, there are better zombies in pretty much any other zombie movie (indie and big budget.) The large scale action sequences aren't bad though.

B003VR5PPY|3.0|Played this game through once and really enjoyed the choose-your-own story.  I know there are at least 5 more endings, and I started another game but honestly couldn't push myself to go through some of the tutorials and puzzles again
B00EKR61FM|4.0|Summit Entertainment releases what fans of sparkling vampires and shirtless werewolves have been waiting for since the day the last film was put in theaters - &#34;Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga.&#34; Many will be sad that it is probably the last item we'll likely see from Stephenie Meyer's series of best-selling novels. Others will be ecstatic that they'll hopefully never have to see another piece of product from it again.<br /><br />&#34;Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga&#34; is a 10-disc collection that includes everything you could ever want in regards to the blockbuster film series. It's all encased in a cardboard slip-cover and housed in a hardback book holder. Every entry gets its own movie and special features disc except &#34;Eclipse,&#34; which only gets one with bonus material and the feature combined. There's also an extra disc filled with even more extras.<br /><br />It would be literally impossible to list all the special features included in &#34;Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga.&#34; Let's just say that if you love these films, you'll have days of material to sift through. Audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes, music videos, and deleted and extended scenes are just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />While most religious folks tend to frown upon the idea of a girl pining for a dead guy who drinks blood and wants to be a vampire, I tend to look at the positive aspects of the &#34;Twilight&#34; series. The films reflect strong moral values when it comes to the subjects of abstinence, dedication, family loyalty, and even hints of a pro-life message.<br /><br />To give my two cents worth, I find &#34;Eclipse&#34; to be the strongest entry in the series. It has a good balance of the romantic and horror elements thanks to director David Slade. It's obvious that he was constantly trying to push the darkness and vampire / werewolf violence as far as he could in a teen-friendly PG-13 movie. This comes as no surprise since Slade headed up the extremely gory and satisfying &#34;30 Days of Night&#34; and obviously has a fondness for the undead.<br /><br />To go over the high-definition transfers of each film would be redundant. The video and audio qualities are clean and clear. Whether you like them or not, the surround sound will pull you into the middle of the action, drama, and romance found in these movies.<br /><br />&#34;Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga&#34; will be pleasing to the people who it was designed for. Millions of teen and adult females will scream in delight at the sight of this exhaustive box set. There will even be a few guys like me who get excited. If you're looking for a way to collect all these movies and their special features in one simple package, you need not look any further.e extremely gory and satisfying &#34;30 Days of Night&#34; and obviously has a fondness for the undead.<br /><br />To go over the high-definition transfers of each film would be redundant.

B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Very powerful movie. Russell Crowe was amazing in this portrayal of schizophrenic. Very true to life because it was based on true story.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|Not quite as good as the 1st one but much better than the second. Very funny movie. Would highly recommend.

B001EN71DG|4.0|I thought this was the set that was the originally released movies.  Not!  this set have all the newer stuff they added.  NOt what I wanted.  I opened it and watched the movie, so I will not return it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|WOW!  If you have anything important on your agenda, you better not start reading this book; it's a page turner from the get go.  Grisham really nailed it with Sycamore Row!  Such a great plot, interesting characters, and a fantastic conclusion.  In so many of Grisham's books, I am so disappointed in the resolution, but not in this book.  I don't live in the South, so it's hard for me to imagine all the issues of race, color, etc.  It always seems to be a part of every Southern story, and this is certainly no exception.  Good reading, for sure....
B00DBISUWS|5.0|I bought this CD after watching the video for Annabel. I assumed that most of the songs would be similar. I really love the song Drew.This is my first experience with Goldfrapp and I'm certainly impressed.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|I was soooo impressed with this because it just sounds soooo good. I mean, not only are most of the songs great Genesis songs, but they were &#34;on&#34;, i.e. &#34;firing on all thrusters.&#34; Beyond that, I mean also that the recording and venues and engineering in my very un-expert opinion and to my very untrained un-expert ears were all done expertly and/or with really high quality musical instruments and/or really high quality recording equipment and/or masters of sound engineering in the employ of these incredible musicians Mr. Banks, Mr. Rutherford, Mr. Collins et al. What I'm saying here is that usually studio recordings sound better than live recordings (to me) but this recording sounds as good to me in its quality, its cleanness, clearness, etc. And it's awesome that they are recorded in Europe because Three Sides Live was all or mostly recorded in the U.S.A., so instead of giving us more of the same they gave us more of a variety. And hey, we DO tend to associate the U.K. more so with Europe than with the U.S.A., and they ARE from the U.K. Also, for the price this is one heck of a great deal, especially if Amazon continues to offer the AutoRip option for this live album. Disclaimer: I'm a Genesis fan.<br />Peace, Jerry (Jerome Walker)<br />P.S. One of the songs is recorded in Helsinki, AND Helsinki is the capital of Suomi (Finland), AND Finland is populated by Finns, AND Finns speak Finnish, AND Finnish is one of the high-speed-low-drag-intensities-in-ten-cities-works-fine-lasts-a-long-time-won't-rust-bust-or-gather-dust--iest languages on the planet.

B002SJKWZ4|3.0|The programming of the remote is very tough. The look/feel is amazing, and the case it comes in is really cool. But there are subtle differences in the movements that make it hard to program and control.
B00G8P2B4E|4.0|This is perfectly popular at our house. Well received in the theater and we were happy to be able to get it instantly for home.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the first!  So suspenseful, definite page turner!  I jumped straight into the third book because I was so invested in these characters.

B00CHVIAS4|2.0|This movie was so average or below. It was not something we would watch again.  Just OK.  My nieces (ages 8, 10 and 12) felt the same way.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|Short and to the point... I just gotta say, this is one of those albums that you can play all the way through. It's really that good! Go check it out! It is very reminiscent of Let Go. At least to me!

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse is very nice well built, just wish it was wireless. It fits vey nicely in my hand and the customizable buttons are in a great spot. Only thing I would have liked to see is minor, being the custom led is only for the Anker logo, not the whole mouse. So you can have a red logo but the top roller and speed lights will remain blue. But overall, very solid for a mid-level gamers like myself (I use it for League of Legends) and exceptional price for the quality!
B00198X0WC|5.0|This movie has been a sleeper classic for a long time. But, I think The Abyss and Cameron's other lesser known masterpiece, True Lies, finally deserve to be treated with the same kind of respect as T2, Aliens, Titanic and Avatar.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, The Abyss features the finest performances of Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's illustrious careers. It features some of the greatest drama James Cameron's ever written, including a powerful scene of all the principal characters, desperate to give Lindsey (Mastrantonio) CPR after drowning.<br /><br />I can't wait to see Cameron give this movie the same beautiful picture and sound quality that we got in his recent Blu-ray releases of Aliens and Titanic.<br /><br />Jim, I know this movie was a headache to make, but thanks to your special extended cut, people have really fallen in love with The Abyss and we deserve a little more respect than to be IGNORED!

B0054R6BFM|5.0|I got this book and just couldnt put it down. I finished in it a day! I felt like the double narration was so different from most books iv read and i loved the way he was able to react as she said things and both of their feelings were so clear. I think i was so cool how they were both the narrator at the same time and how they didnt change it into part like in breaking dawn (even though i loved that too). I think the idea of this book was so interesting and i absolutely loved reading it. I'll definitely read it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Probably the best 3D game for the kindle. It doesn't freeze or take too long to load. A highly recommended game for horse lovers.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I literally dont even know what to write about this book. After i finished it, it took me forever to find another book to read because it was so good that i couldnt find a book to follow it. It was honestly just so well written and i loved how it progressed and all of the little things in it that were so memorable. I'll definitely read this again
B00BD99JMW|2.0|What would you do if the one you anticipated so much failed you?<br /><br />  What if it did not turn out the way you want it to?<br /><br />  Those are just two of the many questions I wanna ask now to each and everyone who have read this very epic ending of the best selling series Divergent by Veronica Roth.<br /><br />  Before I ever got to read this book, I know for sure that it won't end the way that I want it to. I know that it will be a very wrecking ending. Though it did not make me sob, I think that it was still so sad. And just one thing, I think I get it why it happened like that.<br /><br />  Veronica made sure that the book would get all the right things it should have; she did not listen to the fans who want every little fantasy they want to happen; she made it really her own story and no one could tell her what to do, which I believe each author should learn from, BUT, there's a big BUT here, people anticipated, waited and begged for it for a year and they ended up tearing and breaking, on bended-knees of why , why, why it turned out that way.<br /><br />  AAAAAARGGGH... I can't put into proper words how I really felt when reading the book.<br /><br />  There were times that the feeling was intense and there were times that the feeling was just not it! I was disappointed actually. I expected a lot and maybe that also made other people get mad. We expected a LOT from it.<br /><br />  But what made me love it is that it was a big twist. Although it was not more of &#34;Allegiant&#34;, it was more of the world outside, where EVERYTHING IS ALL EXPLAINED HOW EVERYTHING TURNED OUT FROM THE FIRST BOOK TO THE SECOND BOOK.( I am trying to lift up souls here so that you should read this ending but when you read lots of reviews around the web, it would be hard for you to do it. )<br /><br />  OH GOSH, Tris is just so stupid. I believe she is so stupid but NO, I believe it was for the betterment of the people in the city. Caleb was more of a douche, but I still feel sad for him. He haven't gotten to say sorry to Tris and be forgiven!<br /><br />  THE BEST CHARACTER I REALLY LIKE IN THIS BOOK IS PETER! You know what? I actually felt a Sutter Keely in him where Miles Teller played him in the movie adaptation of the book Spectacular Now. I can feel him in my mind. It was just so touching that one would sacrifice his memories to become a better person. oh god.<br /><br />  to end this review....<br />  THIS BOOK DID NOT CONCLUDE EVERYTHING. IT JUST ENDED WHAT WAS SUPPOSE TO END.  I WOULD STILL WANT YOU TO READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT READ FOR YOU! :)<br /><br />MAYBE THIS BOOK DID NOT AMAZED ME LIKE THE WAY DIVERGENT DID, BUT IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT VIEW FOR YOU. :)<br /><br />I WOULD GIVE THIS BOOK A  2/5 ... This is sad but I guess it was still a good book inspite of the tragic ending.<br /><br />Making this review makes me so sad because it would be the last time to review this series and it wasn't the best one. I wish Veronica can redeem herself next time. I hope she won't stop writing just because of all the hates.eel sad for him. He haven't gotten to say sorry to Tris and be forgiven!<br /><br />  THE BEST CHARACTER I REALLY LIKE IN THIS BOOK IS PETER! You know what?

B004U7JYXS|4.0|The film is mighty expensive. Each shot cost nearly a dollar. But the output is fantastic, a near-match to old polaroids. Nothing beats the instant gratification of watching the instax film develop mere seconds after the shot.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Great album- Sir Elton John returned to his musical beginnings ❤️❤️❤️  Refreshing to listen to his voice across the decades
B00EMXBZKA|4.0|Ogilvy is pompous throughout the book. In fact the book is a celebration of his successes, his reasoning for how he achieved success in advertising. However I can't think of a better classic memoir about advertising, and his advise on campaigns stands up in the digital age. I was engrossed in the material throughout, never feeling his advise was outdated. Worth a read for anyone considering a career in advertising, marketing, copywriting, and or brand strategy.
1593082045|4.0|The prints were too small. I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, but didn't finish the book, because the letters were too small.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have been using this app faithfully for about a year now.  This is the best alarm clock I've tried over the years.  I have no complaints and I've never had any issues using it.  I love the fact that I can set multiple alarms and am able to hear the alarm from multiple rooms since I can crank up the volume.  I highly recommend this one.  The snooze button works great too.  Also, if you are one who accidentally turns off the snooze button, I suggest creating multiple alarms closely timed to one another.  I normally don't have this issue but do it for backup.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I am more than a fan. I have Nine Inch Nails piercing through my veins. Of course I would buy a hard copy of the new album to add to my collection. The seller was prompt and I received my item in good condition.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved Divergent. Loved it. Insurgent wasn't as great, but I was still very much looking forward to the release of Allegiant. I felt the plot was somewhat slow and sporadic, thus I had a harder time becoming committed. I can easily say that this series end is one if the most disheartening of nearly any trilogy I have read. I also found it difficult to distinguish between which character was narrating and had to check chapter titles often. In my opinion, this ending is poorly executed and does not provide a consistent continuance of an otherwise enjoyable series.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Mindless entertainment. Just need to fill the mind while watching TV? This works great. Nice little puzzle app. You can get a bit carried away though.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|Great reading.  Could not put it down.  I had forgotten how much I enjoy Ken Follett's writing.Lots of WWII History.

B009LY72LQ|3.0|I got these for my daughter.  She likes to create her own dolls but these could stay together a little better.  An arm falls off a lot and having a second wig would be good.  One doll is always bald or she wraps a scrap of cloth around her head.

B005LAII08|5.0|We LOVE this movie!  Having a curvy little girl with slightly crazy hair who loves unconventional things, Merida is a great role model.  It helps that she is Scottish too, since my MIL is off the boat Scottish and my DD really relates to that.  I only wish Disney had not changed Merida in the marketing on lunch boxes and backpacks and 12 inch dolls.  We preferred her as she is in the movie.
B008602KQI|4.0|It was an exciting story and the heroine was lovable and believable.  I was looking forward to reading the followup books.
0316017930|5.0|After you read this book, you can understand that “There is no one who has been a genius since he/she was born”, but that statement makes us to expect that you can be genius if you use the “Rules to become a genius” which was stated by the author, Malcolm Gladwell. He explains how the genius people succeeded.<br /><br />This book is consisting of 2 parts, which are “Opportunity” and “Legacy”. In the<br />Part 1, Gladwell explains what you need to be successful. He uses ice-hockey players, the Beatles, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, Robert Oppenheimer, Joe Flom, etc. as examples of successful people. He states people generally need to do their work for at least 10,000 hours to become a remarkable professional on it. “Genius” people, such as Mozart and the Beatles got the great opportunities to play for more than 10,000 hours. In the case of the Beatles, they got an opportunity to go to Hamburg where they had to play for eight hours a day not depending on their will. That made them practice over 10,000 hours. Another genius person used in the book is Bill Gates. His first important opportunity, according to Gladwell, was that he got sent to Lakeside High School where he could use time-sharing terminals of computer. There were only a few schools in the world that could access to a time-sharing terminals in 1968, when he was an eighth grader. Second one was that mothers of Lakeside had enough money to pay for the schools computer fees. Also, the university happened to have free computer time between 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. These opportunities gave him extra time to practice. But most important one was that he was born in 1955 just before computers’ development. He succeeded because of an incredibly lucky series of events. Gladwell says “Even if people get similar opportunities, it is up to the timing of the opportunities that the person succeeds or not.” At the end of the Part 1, Gladwell reveals that “Intelligence is not always the cause of the success” using Christopher Langan’s case as an example.<br /><br />In Part 2, Gladwell talks about “Legacy” which is inherited by the one’s country or ancestors, and how it affects to our lives. “Cultures of honor”, a particularly virulent strain, tend to take root in highlands and other marginally fertile areas, he said. In those areas, you can’t farm, so you raise goats or sheep. The kind of culture that grows up around being a herdsman is very different form the culture that grows up around growing crops. Farmers depend on cooperation, but a herdsman is off by himself. Also, he is under constant threat of ruin through the loss of his animals, so he has to be aggressive and make it clear that he is not weak. These differences appear today, which results in the characters of southerners and northerners. According to Gladwell, southerners are more likely to be angry than northerners because of these facts. Next, he talks about the airlines. Once, Korean Airline made many plane crashes because of the legacy. It means that the main cause of Korean plane accidents were the lack of communication and it was caused by “Power Distance”, an attitude toward hierarchy. It was strong in Korea, so the serious and important information could not be possesd well together with the first officers and the other attendants. Then they made incorrect judge to get tragic accidents. Finally, he explains why Asians are industrious. He says that is because many Asians were working at paddy fields. It has required them many efforts and patience to work every day even before the sunrise. It also has affected to Asians’ good ability in mathematics because patience is the key factor to solve the mathematics problems. So his conclusion is that the culture is also effective to make outliers as the chance.<br /><br />In the epilogue, he is talking about “education and success”, and tells us that we need to recognize the importance of opportunities and the legacy. What he is trying to say through this book is “Give equal opportunities to everyone.” If everyone gets opportunities, it means we all have the same possibilities to become outliers. He says “The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.” He explains that’s because outliers are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. This book makes readers think about how people can give equal opportunities to everyone, including poor people and young people.<br /><br />Minori A. Period 6
0060555661|5.0|Well worth the reading. For once a book on investing that makes sense. Warren is right. Wished he was updated to the 2013 situation.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Boring. I was looking forward to the third book and was disappointed on all fronts. I would have rather waited an extra couple of months for a book that coincided with the first two books in the series. I am surprised so many people, I am assuming multiple people read Allegiant before publication, reviewed Allegiant and no flags were raised. Unfortunate. I like closure but would only recommend reading the first two books in the series. The 3rd, Allegiant did not add to the story. The first two books I could not put down and re-read multiple times. However, I had to remind myself to read Allegiant as it did not capture my attention. I kept wondering if I had missed the 3rd book and was somehow reading the 4th ... disconnect between the books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great world that Hugh Howey has created. Greatly written that is. The world itself is full of terrible things and surprising secrets. A fantastic book. Incredibly well paced and written. I am off to get books 2 & 3 now!
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|The first time I ever saw it was with my parents when it first came out in theaters and it seamed like a pretty good movie even though it was R rated. I watched it through Amazon.com recently and it still seamed like a fairly good movie.

0307950654|1.0|This is clearly a writing exercise that is extended for hundreds of pages, to see if P.D. James could write like Jane Austen.  Dragged out plot, no suspense, no Austen humor, not a good read.  Ultimately a real letdown.

B008B1BL4E|5.0|This a superbly written book, destined to become the new, 21 st century paradigm for that Great War of 1914. There is a new generation of monographic studies which Clark has woven into a majestic tapestry of scholarship and evaluation. There are so many books on the First World War, so many are valuable or insightful, so many are patriotic pomp and circumstance. Clark starts and stays within a realm of human agency and interaction, commencing in 1903 with the opening of the Balkan imbroglio. It has been seen as  stew pot with too many cooks, too much fire, too much history and not enough humanity. Clark provides a  balanced account, everyone gets blame, none escape scrutiny, all are in it together. It starts with the advent of modern Serb irredentist nationalism and the murderous coup in Belgrade and flows to Sarajevo a decade later to the murder of Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie ultimately plotted by the same gang, the Black Hand. Clark ends with a roundhouse analysis of the July Crisis and a conclusion explaining how and why the powers of Europe found themselves despite their better instincts on a road to a war that they decided to start because they found it unavoidable and which they were convinced was started by someone else. There  is some superb analysis of  strategic decision making as complex,  that policy as foreign policy was the result of ministers, bureaucracies, ambassadors, generals, prime ministers, public opinion, generals and bankers in an ever changing matrix within each nation and within the alliance blocks. The result was a level of uncertainty about where,how and by whom decisions would be made. The resulting uncertainty tended to heighten the risk of conflict rather than relax it.<br /><br />It is difficult to say that Clark has discovered any thing new in secret archives now open. He relies on several post 2000 research studies by German, Russian, Balkan and Anglo-American historians to bring him up to date. But most of his key insightscome from the shrewdness of his analysis and the detachment of his evaluations  from some partisan framework.
B005DJREJS|4.0|Fun to watch, takes you back and lets you laugh at similar experiences from back in the day. Very funny.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|This is a really good replica. It actually looks like the ones in the movies and it's very light.<br />It has two brooches to help hold it in place so you won't have to worry about it being upside down.<br />I would highly recommend it!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Could not believe how good this book was. I don't give five stars very easily, but I could not put this book down!
B004132HZS|5.0|Everything was perfect! I enjoyed it very much! Thanks a lot! I would definitely recommend you to other people shamelessly!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I really liked this movie, I was not sure what to expect with mostly mixed reviews from friends and online. This movie had grey opening act followed by a great climax and very well done finaly. The action was very well done and little to no gore for a zombie flick, with very intense moments. Well done storytelling and editing, with just the right amount of exposition.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Game is fun but can be a little annoying on some levels takes forever to get through them. I am up to a challenge but geeze some just are a pain and you wonder why you have players that have been stuck for x amount if days you end up getting bored cuz you can't get through so you just stop playing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You should get this game it's awesome it's fun and its adding candy to the game so what's not to love.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|This book is geared to young readers, maybe middle school or high school.  Since I am a senior citizen, I recognized about 10 pages in, that I had made a mistake in picking this book.  Don't get me wrong, I like edgy contemporary novels, but this one is not my cup of tea.  Teen angst has been better done than this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes you think.  Enjoyed the challenge, and await the other floors to be ready. Would recommend over the no brainer games.
B0084PAOMM|5.0|I follow a low carb diet &#34;ala&#34; Dr. Richard Bernstein's book pertaining to diabetic solutions.  He references Taubes' studies and writings in his books.  The first half of the book fills the reader with all the prior scientific studies that lead to the conclusion that the fault of being fat lies not in lack of exercise or too many calories but in the massive amounts of fast acting carbohydrates that most of us  consume.  The second half of the book is helpful information on how to make the right carbohydrate choices to live a healthy life.  All those fasting acting carbs create too much insulin from our pancreas and overload our blood sugar levels from the rapid response that causes the body to store the excess energy as fat in the body for later consumption when we feel starvation.  Of course, most of us never feel that starvation and still keep on eating the wrong things and get fatter and fatter.  I've followed this low carb diet for over a year and lowered my A1C diabetic test scores to the mid 5's level. ( The latest American Diabetic Association guidelines say a score of 7 is satisfactory for a diabetic -- foolish!!!)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Best trilogy ever! I love all the unexpected plot twist this series has. It keeps you on the edge and I can even wait for the movie!!!! Divergent is the best book in the whole world everyone needs to read this there is nothing u can predict will happen its that amazingly written!!!
B008UWEFU6|3.0|I did not buy this book for me. I don't care to read about some lady that ties up some guy and beats his naughty little bits with a spatula...or whatever they do. I bought this for a friend. Amazon insists that I give it a review. And my friend now likes this book which has created an interesting situation for me in that I now have an insight into her freakyness! What does THAT MEAN?!?!! Do I have to learn to tie knots?! Do I have to buy a spatula? Is that even the right spelling of SPATULA!?!?!?! I AM FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW... I Don't want her to punch me in the naughty parts... DO PEOPLE REALLY DO THAT?! I think I like her but if she likes this book then she might expect me to take it to the next level! OMG - What if I show up on her doorstep Dressed like Tarzan with a pet monkey and a bottle of cooking oil and she rejects me?! That is a long walk home... and the poor monkey didn't ask for this! What about the monkey?!?!?!  He just came a long for a laugh or to hold the camera.  OMG - I forgot the camera. THIS IS ALL TOO MUCH!!!!!!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My 3 year old niece Penny loved this app and was absolutely engaged the entire time I let play this on my phone. She loved all of the puzzles and from what I saw, the colors in this app are amazing. Her mom actually called me today to thank me for letting her know about the app, because Penny's letter recognition has started to improve at a noticeably faster rate than before. I know what this app has done for my niece and I would recommend this app for anyone who has a pre-k aged kid.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|This is a must read for anyone looking to start their own tech company. I learned a great deal from this book and highly recommend it. It has helped me a lot in my personal startup.
B004EPZ07A|2.0|My review has nothing to do with the movie, I love this movie. My bad review is because they sent me a use copy. When i purchased this movie it clearly stated new but when i open the package the dvd had a use ticket on it. Very disappointed
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Enjoying game so far! I have not had any issues at this time on my Kindle Fire. Graphics are great. Well done game.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Really nothing else to say - extremely boring and the dual perspective didn't do the book any favors.  Seemed like a book in a completely different series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting. I can hardly wait until I get new lives and see what the next challenge is. Enjoy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|please put in realms it dose not work for me when dose it come out is making me ANGRY! !!!!!!!!  &gt;:( tell<br />me when it is coming out PLEASE TELL ME NOW OR LATER IM BEGGING YOU PLEASE TELL ME OR JUST<br />PUT IT OUT PLEEEEEASE!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!???!?!?.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been playing on iphone for months. Thanks for finally making an application for kindle fire. Also play on facebook...so many more helps there. Hope an update will make them available here too. Big screen helps my old eyes while playing too! Waiting for Papa Pear to come to kindle soon....I hope.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|great app to check on my google mail, calendar, and circles. Easy of search. great to have this for my kindle
0440539811|5.0|Before reading the Trilogy - stop! Read the parent first, the children (The Trilogy) will be understood better: study 'Principia Discordia' (Illuminet Press 1991 purple/pink cover - has artwork - is the version I discovered) for enlightenment. Now you're ready, it is hoped, to go from the pan into the fire. Believe me, it's a trip! Full of fantasy, tons of philosophy, huge helpings of sex, politics atop politics, who-done-its, how-they-did-it, and at the end, hopefully, you'll be convinced. Of what, only YOU WILL KNOW. Have fun! This is filled with chuckles. Hopefully, you've read enough to get all the puns. Do try the why of why.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|This movie was a fun romp and well done.  The CG were great and expertly done as well.  This movie requires a certain degree of suspension of logic and likelihood but it is done in the spirit of classic science fiction.  It possesses all the drive, machismo, and boldness of the orginal Star Trek in an earthly setting suddenly run rampant by 'B' movie Godzillas, Gameras, and the like.  Except that in this version, there is no unnamed guy schlepping around in a cheesy monster suit; instead the amped-up computer graphics turn this into a thumping thriller, which, though generally predictable in plot, was entertaining in its raucous nature.  Definitely worth the price.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|If you don't make the level you have to go on facebook or buy tokens.  Why???  It is just a game, I don't like bothering other people when it comes to playing some stupid game.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|A fun movie and a consistent extension as a sequel.  I am particularly impressed with the movie's treatment of technology in the timeline of the Star Trek genre given that this is definitely a prequel; The Enterprise looks more like a Rube Goldberg plumbing project than an interstellar starship.  But I applaud the boldness of the movie writers to properly 'date' the technology with all its potential foibles and flaws.<br /><br />The acting was good and I was particularly pleased to see Uhura take a more commanding lead.  Captain Kirk was given wide birth to deliver his role but the other 'legacy' roles of Spock, Scotty, and Bones seemed slightly limited to a thin scope of persona determined by predecessor roles and stories.<br /><br />Nonetheless, in spite of the fact that action-scene begat action-scene begat action-scene in this movie, it was a good time and I enjoyed the development of the Star Trek genre in its own timeline.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|It was alright but kind of silly and formulaic at times. I was hoping for more funny lines but they weren't there..
B001PJRAUS|1.0|No really, I don't. I completely fail to understand how this managed to get a 4-star rating. It wasn't funny. It wasn't witty. It wasn't even written or performed particularly well. The premise had promise, but I just can't seem to wrap my head around where it went from there. In all honesty, it came off like bad fan fiction. *Really* bad fan fiction. It's not like I went into this expecting to watch another version of \\"Pride and Prejudice;\\" I expected things to get mixed up and crazy, for Amanda to be a total fish out of water and for hilarity to ensue. I suppose I can even understand her completely mucking the 19th century manners up ... or at least I could have if she hadn't claimed to have had most of the book memorized. If you've really read a book that many times, you'd at least have some vague idea of how to comport yourself in the world of said book, right? I mean, unless you're a total idiot... like Amanda. The girl didn't even try. Anyway, it was a mess. The \\"heroine\\" has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and neither does her supposed love interest. The only bit of charm in this whole debacle was a few of Elizabeth's scenes in modern times; she managed her time-swap much better than Amanda, and frankly I'd rather have watched a show about Elizabeth Bennet making her way as a nanny in modern London than what I actually sat through.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Lots of fun and great special effects. The plot was a little over the top at times (a bit unrealistic), but I had a good time.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My husband has PTSD and needs white noise to sleep.  He formerly used a box fan running all night (which I was not a fan of). I downloaded the free version of this app and have been using it for over a week with GREAT success - he loves it. It helps me sleep, too - when I do wake up, it's easier to fall back asleep. And it helps drown out outside noise so our dogs don't bark as much. Today I purchased the full version so I could play the app for him and also read on my Kindle until I'm ready to sleep. I'm very interested to experiment with the binaural beats feature.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Alan Jacksonis  so talented in his writing, singing and presenting his music.  This album shows all this and even more.  We love it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|this game  seems to be well designed . works alright on the kindle fire so far. asked to rate the game a lil to soon though
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I choose to watch the movie. Because it looked interesting. But It is rather long for me. But it was kinda worth it.
B001UFQNF0|3.0|Just plastic, it looks nice with the lights and everything else but I don't think it's worth every dollar you pay for it but its ok.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played!! If you don't have a pet this game is awesome for you!!!!!!!!! I especially adore the cute little pets. You are aloud to buy pets with kibble,get them tiny adorable houses, and take care of them as if their your own(which they are). I highly suggest you get this app because it is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Wow...whole new sound from AF.  This is their best album, from the jarring intro \\"Reflektor\\", to the more traditional AC fare like \\"We Exist\\", to the disco-noir of \\"Joan of Arc\\", to the melancholy \\"Porno\\", this is sonic brilliance on a whole new level from Arcade Fire.  I have yet to listen to the new Pearl Jam album all the way through and I\\"ve played Reflektor about 40 times now.  Its Arcade Fire's \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\"
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Let me start by saying that I love the voice and works of Donna Tartt.  I so anticipated this book, and thoroughly enjoyed most of it; however, if I am honest, I skimmed several sections of the book, without later repercussion.  The plot is very good, to the end (I will not include any \\"spoilers\\")--but the end is a fizzle.  The realizations and resolutions near the end of the book would have been the perfect true ending of the book.  Unfortunately, Ms. Tartt continues on in a philosophical \\"rant\\" for another 50 pages.  I read all of those pages, hoping for something--ANYTHING--else to happen.  Nothing does.<br /><br />Having written the above, you would think I didn't like the book. That is not true, and that's why I gave it 4 stars. I did enjoy the book.  But... you know how you can get so \\"sucked into\\" a book that you continue to perform all of the every-day-necessary tasks but you're still \\"living\\" in a book?  I was that way with \\"The Secret History\\". Not so much here.  That is absolutely not to say that she only has one good book \\"in her\\".  Both are great books.  It's just sometimes there's a story that can sweep you away.  There were times when, for me, \\"The Goldfinch\\" was one of those stories.  Just not completely.<br /><br />With a Donna Tartt story, the bar is very high.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I didn't want to watch this at first thinking that it would be silly, but my husband read the book and was interested.  I was surprised that it was a great film.  Interesting plot, not over the top action, and although there are zombies in it, it's treated in a different way than I expected.  Not really a horror film or an action film, kind of a mixture.
B000JWTX3Y|5.0|This is a really cute movie with no swearing & no sex but a nice story line.  I love it.  Lindsay Lohan and Chris Pine are perfect in their roles.  I wish they would make more movies like this one.
B00DGR8WSQ|5.0|I love this show! Is the perfect childhood memory I used to watch this show every week and back then I feel in love with the caracter
B00CM4VC7M|4.0|It's about half the size I expected it to be but it is really cute and I can't wait for the next Sailor to come out!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved this amazing story of a beautifull, brave young girl and her boyfriend Four going through amazing things to be free together. I would give it a five star, but the end was kind of depressing. I won't spoil any more; if you want to find out if you like the Divergent series, you'll have to read it for yourself. I'll just say one more thing though; the journey through the lives of these amazing young adults, in my opinion, is definitely worth a few minutes of sadness you get from the end of the book. Happy reading!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, but I liked more the end of it, where the author reminds us all the possibilities that we have everyday.<br />The author also points out that all our actions have consequences and many times we are not aware of this.<br />At the end, e everybody has secrets.
B005PK553C|5.0|More more I want to watch more seasons of American Horror Story.<br />Love all the actors hope there's more seasons to watch them on American Horror Story.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|I love the chemistry between the actors. I love that the characters are all less than perfect in one way or another: glasses, wrinkles, figures, in love with a &#34;drip&#34;, etc--because it brings parts of the story closer to one's own world. Or at least it does if I overlook &#34;Amanda's&#34; super-fabulous house/job. It's a movie that I can watch multiple times and enjoy it.
0142180300|5.0|This was a well written book that covered a lot of territory. it had many photos and Feynmann diagrams that helped in understanding concepts
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing writing, amazing cast. A chance step back in time and to pop across the pond via my TV. This is great Television.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|It is a cardboard box with misc. pieces thrown in with no instructions,  And no way to complain or a place to even ask a question.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I liked how the movie started and was anticipating more to come.  I am a huge Star Trek fan but you just can't take epic scenes from the old series and twist them!  It is wrong and I was so pissed, it made it hard to watch the rest of the movie.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This movie was good. I love stories of romance that takes you away and let you live with the character
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Awesome!! No skipping songs here!! For me, Black Radio 1 is STILL in heavy rotation. You will not be disappointed!!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I loved this verson of jane eyre. It shown me a different side of the story. It was worth watching
B0061DOEJI|5.0|I love music and I use it to keep me company during the day as I work.  I love the mix in this booklet.  I play it when I'm cleaning house etc.  It takes me back to some very good years in my young life.  Smooth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|I recommend this game to anyone.  Just wish there was more levels.  Enjoyably easy yet challenging at the same time.  Love it.
B008F1NICI|5.0|This is a great prog rock album from a very mature band. Great light and shade and the strings really add depth and warmth to the sound.
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|The last of us are one of my favourite games of all time and one of the reasons is the music is beautiful. The soundtrack especially good to listen when you're driving in autumn.<br />The music is setting the mood just the right way, from the sound of calming and peaceful to sad and creepy.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the game or the music this album wil not disappoint you! &#60;3
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|too easy.  did not keep my attention.  was not too long before I started looking for another game to play.
B008RKGF1I|4.0|Love the music.  Love the dancing.  We watched the Intern which made several references to this movie resulting in our watching it the following night.  Let me suggest that our path be followed.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|When i first downloaded the wewther channel app, it was great. But since they updated it, the app doesnt update the weather attomatically. Also i have figured out that it drains my battery. My advice, dont buy this app if you want accurate weather or a full battery. Change it back to the way it used to be!!!! Now i hate this app and i deleted it. There are other great weather apps on the market, so try tjem first.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|My wife and I saw the movie when it first came out.  The book provides background which makes the movie more enjoyable.  Way ahead of its time.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Gave the doll to my niece and she was so thrilled to add it to her collection of Monster High dolls. I have always enjoyed playing with dolls and to see her play made me very happy.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|I really enjoyed seeing this with my kids when they were little. We watched it again, after many years, just the 2 of us, and though it was entertaining, it wasn't as much fun as sitting with the kids!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book, I could not put in down! The story, the characters and the way it all came together......absolutely beautiful!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is the TV show about a serial killer, from his perspective. Dexter works for Miami Police Department as a blood splatter expert and is called to analyze crime scenes, sometimes ones he's responsible for. He works with his tom-boyish sister on the force, Debra, who has no idea of his hobby of murdering.<br /><br />If you like quirky, off beat shows with unique characters and gore, this is the show for you. It's clever with great characters, good dialogue and gruesome murders. You never know what's going to happen, especially this First Season, where there is a twist at the end.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another best seller for Stephen King and rightly so. He puts his soul in every story. This book would have been good with any character instead of Danny Torrence. I hated to know that little Danny went through the hard times that happened to him. Loved this book.
B00FVZAPB8|5.0|I love Beatle Paul, Wing Paul and Solo Paul with all my heart. But I'll let my ears, and not my heart, talk about his New album. And my ears say IT'S GREAT! I almost feel they moving and dancing while the music is going on. That's the magic only this kid of 71 years old can do. Paul, God bless you, boy. God, thanks for had given us this gift. My ears have just one more thing to say: LISTEN NEW.<br />AND LISTEN AGAIN.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|Funny series of videos. Mike Myers is a comic genius and the blue ray quality really shines.Lots of fun, baby!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Both games are from the same developers.  There is a story and then an activity.  It is good for busying oneself without needing as much attention as reading a book.
159514188X|5.0|This book is simply amazing I loved every bit of it. Great thing you can listen to the tapes on youtube, cause it feels like it's kinda real idk it's just amazing. The whole thing. As for the conditions of it: as perfect as bought directly in any bookstore.
B00371XIJE|5.0|good movie about a man and his loyal dog. Good acting and realistic reactions to life's issues.  The dog seems to age perfectly.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Her album is pretty awesome. The music is upbeat and energetic but not overpowering. In all its just a lot of fun to listen to.
B00742BVW8|5.0|This film has some of the best photography of any film in any language.  It is the most expensive film made in China and has very large cast that shows up during battle and crowd scenes.<br /><br />Hero has a strong story line based on the actual first emperor who unified China.  All of the major actors and actresses do a good job, including strong roles for two women warriors.  Their fight in an autumn forest with red leaves blowing in the wind is visually stunning.<br /><br />One thing I like about this film is that there are no &#34;bad guys.&#34;  The three assassins are honorable and convincing.  Even the emperor respects them.<br /><br />Jet Li plays a young magistrate who arrives at the palace to receive the emperor's thanks for defeating the assassins.  As in Kurosawa's famous film Rashomon, there are several versions of each situation.  First Jet Li describes his meeting with each assassin, and then the emperor describes what he thinks might have happened - both use flashbacks to show the same vignettes but with differences..<br /><br />China in autumn resembles New England in autumn and many scenes are filmed outside in beautiful country with nature and the turning leaves adding to the beauty of the photography.<br /><br />This film is among the best historical martial arts films of all time.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Hangover 3 continues the story when one of the wolfpack is kidnapped by an angry gangster and they must track down Mr. Chow, who has escaped from prison in Thailand and is on the run with gold he stole from the gangster.<br /><br />I loved the original Hangover movie. At the time, I thought it was one of the funniest, most original comedy I had seen in a long time.  Hangover 2, basically repeated the story in a different setting and lost some of the magic that the original had.  And now Hangover 3, doesn't even come close to matching the effort of the 2nd installment.  The movie seems less of a comedy with its crude humor and laughs like in the first two movies and more of a dark humor action film.  if I hadn't seen the first two movies, I may have not been so disappointed because as a dark action movie it was average enough to watch but I kept expecting the jokes to happen that never did.<br /><br />It seems like the writers ran out of original jokes that made us laugh in the first movie and went into a different direction with the same basic plot.<br /><br />For all the things that the first movie did that worked, this movie lacks all of that.  Definitely a disappointment and maybe a good thing that they are ending this series before it totally ruins my memories of the first.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|The game itself is addictive.  I don't think I should have to have Facebook to play a game.  The continuous having to wait for more lives is stupid.  I've had enough of it, so I quit.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Easy to download age appropriate and go's off the new movie that just came out.<br />I still love this game. I still love this  game it's fun to play
0385350864|4.0|It had some sad parts, obviously, but LIFE has sad parts.  I disagree with those who complain that Bridget hasn't 'grown up.'  She's sloppy and flighty and verbally incontinant; but those things aren't really things to be grown out of.  They are personality traits, like her kindness and her humor.  Overall, I felt like this picture of Bridget-Jones-15-Years-Later was believable.  If you don't like Bridget, you don't like these books -- I did like her (in the previous 2 books), and I do like her (in this one).  I enjoyed this book very much.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My kids and I can play this game for hours. It's very entertaining and some times hard to put down.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Good blend of love songs and party/drinkin' music! I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of country music!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My daughter lives this movie- she could watch it a million times and never get tired of it! Prompt service too!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an amazing show--I am very anxious for Season 4 to begin in January. Great writing and acting and Maggie Smith is terrific!
B00338QENI|4.0|Very insightful story about HELA cells.  Reveals some pretty severe discrepancies between the races during the 1940's-50's.  Addresses interesting ethical questions regarding past medical laboratory experimentation.
0596805527|5.0|Great book, tons of information.  Not as easy to read as some other books, but then again, this is a reference manual.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|This book was chosen by my book club.  Very interesting story, related to famous art piece even though it was fiction. Easy  and quick to read.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|The characters that infuse Hitchcock films are what make them classics.  The diner moments are especially worth watching in this.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Simply perfect Korn.<br /><br />Yea Korn all day everyday. updapte your new music experience, this is the best alblums I harnbnmhghh
B00466HM28|4.0|Great bang for the buck....Don't get me wrong, I have owned the mpc3000 and this is not that...but then again it is not intended to be!!!  This is for mobility, like taking it in a backpack with my laptop and sony MDR's and making a beat at the airport.  The keys are small, but good enough to bang out a melody, or a bass line.  Nice program to assign midi notes to pads.  I have used it with a couple of DAW's and have had no problems so far.
B00G32PQNA|1.0|boring  doesn't go anywhere  dumb waste of money, no plot and does not go anywhere, completely boring, don't waste your money
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Purchased from the Amazon France site.<br /><br />This was such an awesome read. Wonderfully descriptive writing, by descriptive I don't mean hundreds of pointless words I mean, beautifully crafted and to the point, not a wasted word in sight.<br /><br />It follows the tale of Ian Fleming - a young intelligence officer during World War II. The novel starts at a frenetic pace and never lets up until the very last page, very James Bondish!<br /><br />I'm not usually one who likes historical novels, but this one just didn't read like a 'boring history retelling of factual events' at all.<br /><br />Fleming is sent, laden with gold, to France with a tempting offer for the commander of the French navy. The question is whether Fleming will get there before the devious commander sells out to the Germans. Really don't want to say more except read it for yourself to see what happens next.<br /><br />Twists and turns ensue that usually feature in a Bond movie. If you love great thrillers you'd be foolish to miss out on this one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I saw another game like this one and it was not starting and my kindle fire broke now I'm on my phone playing the real my little pony
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It has been awhile since I have really gotten lost in a series, until this one.  From start to end, all I wanted to do was continue reading to find out what happens and when I wasn't reading, I was thinking about the characters, twists, love stories, betrayals and how applicable it is to society and government today.  These books gives the feeling that you are going on this journey along with the characters and I couldn't help but think what faction I would belong in or what I would do in the crisis situations.  I laughed, I cried and it opened my eyes and reminded me important life lessons on selflessness, courage, love, faith and family. It would be nice if there was a happier ending, but unfortunately, that isn't how life works. I am not sure what age group the target audience is, but I think it is definitely for more \\"mature\\" audiences to be able to process and understand the violence, science, government, etc.  I reccommend this series, but make sure you block out several days because you will want to read them non-stop!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I've enjoyed most of Stephen King's books, and this was no exception in that regard.  That said, it's not as refined as The Shining in which we are first introduced to Danny Torrance as a young boy.  I enjoyed how the author developed Dan as a man who faced and overcame his addictions.  Although I enjoyed Doctor Sleep, I won't be likely to re-read it.
B00G32TD98|3.0|Pretty solid, especially the first half. Not nearly as scary as people make it out to be, though. Still some very freaky moments.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Program speaks for itself.  Fantastic acting, good historical context, all in the beautiful British scenery. One of the best series I have ever watched.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I am a father and it's an interesting insight into the deeper understanding of a mother's point of view. The women are portrayed very realistically with most of the flaws being realized by themselves near the end of the book. The men are not entirely villainous but neither are they virtuous nor their points of view fully explored. It is a good read for a heartbreaking set of stories. Men, it gives us a new look into our women.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It has a surprise ending..... I liked it a lot though. I was just very surprised to say the least...
B005PW3OS8|5.0|A good film with a hero who is worth believing in.  All American, good clean fun, , glad there wasnt any sex or language.  the hero doesnt have a dark side - that is nice
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|E-Squared is a delightful gem of a book that introduces and/or reaffirms a healthy, loving and light-filled perspective on Life - with a capital 'L' that honors the richness of our individual connections to this Life and to each other. So simple, but certainly not simplistic, this quick read offers a bounty of intangible gifts to anyone from kids to the very long-lived; setting in motion any of the nine curiosity-invoking experiments can easily reap not only intangible gifts but tangible goodies as well!  Go for it... find the fun and feel the sun shining more brightly in your world for having scooped up this treasure. Thank you, Pam Grout!
B007BT0RKG|5.0|I travel a lot these days and at times, even I have a GPS, I use this app to scan the surrounding area when I am in a new area. On my Kindle, which I always have, can park somewhere safe and look at what's around me from an aerial perspective. No more - having a bunch of maps in the back seat. Nice !
B009XIXVU6|1.0|This book was so hard to follow.  Too many characters and by the time he gets to the next character you forget who all the others were. It was frustrating to read.  Very disappointing from his other books.  I'm an avid reader and this one took forever to get through.  I finally gave up on it half way through.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Liked the writing style.  What an interesting story.  Never knew things like this happened so long ago.<br />Opened a whole new topic for me to read about.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|this game is fun easy and addicting. great for young kids or adults. my kids will enjoy playing this game with me.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Very good movie - lots of action - good surround sound, great scenery!  you really can't go wrong with these 2 fine actors!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|So much fun...beautiful graphics and constant entertainment. I think this will be my new addition.  The creators of Ice Age and the game producers did an outstanding job.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The end was horribly sad, but I'm very glad I read it. This is a story of life and sacrifice, and growing into adulthood. I wave goodbye to Tris, Tobias, and the others, but take with me the lessons of Veronica Roth, about the true meaning of family and love. A very good book, and a very good outlook on life.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Great for kids!<br />My little guy loved all the characters in this movie, lot's of fun.<br />I loved it then ('80s) and even more now!
B00DSY8D36|1.0|I downloaded this to my galaxy note 10 and it will not open any pdf documents.  Ican view them but everytime i try to select a document the program shus down. Would prob be a great app ifit worked.t
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very good book that offers a lot of outside materials to provide contextual evidence in the rise of Jesus and his followers.
0744014956|4.0|This is a typical strategy book with maps, vehicle/weapon stats and walkthroughs. It fills exactly the role that I bought it for. The binding is good quality and I'm quite satisfied with the content and the item itself. Its a great strategy guide!
0679809015|5.0|a lovely, durable board book offering good illustrations, simple text, and lots of opportunities to make animal noises together.  Interesting even to the pre-walking set.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I came across this book on my Kindle and was not familiar with the author, but was looking for a change of pace.  It was a good story and i would probably recommend it.  Not sure I would read another of hers, but perhaps I should read another just to be sure I'm not giving up before I give her a real chance. It was very nice to read a book set in Australia.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|Always enjoyed watching Hans M. in any role!  Wished he was the hero.  All the characters gave a lovely performance.  Loved the story.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Once again, I am IN LOVE with Kiera Cass's Selection series. Just like the first book, I couldn't put this one down. I even found myself reading it during work, hoping and praying my boss wouldn't catch me!<br /><br />If there is anything negative I could say, it's that the wait for the next book is so, so long! Though I guess Kiera is keeping to a schedule of 1 book a year. The first came out in April of 2012, this one April 2013 and the last is May of 2014. Six more months feels like a eternity. I had purchased The Elite by pre-order so I got it delivered to my Kindle the day it was released, but I didn't end up reading it until now because honestly, I had found other books to read and other series's during that time. As much as I loved the first book and gave it 5 stars too, by the time The Elite came out, I sort of forgot about it.<br /><br />I don't want to forget about this series again when The One comes out, but sadly I know I will.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|good clean fun and excitement.  the &#34;Before&#34; scenes were artfully carried out making the &#34;After&#34; scenes believable.  great prequel for the avengers.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Acting is fine. There is nothing to set it apart from the other action adventure movies. Figured out the plot in the first few minutes. I prefer more intrigue, mystery, and suspense from my Trek world. It's an average Hollywood shoot 'em up film, but in space. I was relieved to see the story line follow the original &#34;prime directive&#34; even though choosing to do what was right was the difficult option.<br /> Entertaining for new Trek viewers! Loved the Tribble reference.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It is a well-paced game; the graphics are excellent, and it does improve one's powers of observation.There are various settings, so as you master levels, you don't have to stay with the same picture.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Thrill ride of fun and excitement!  Great movie!  I can't wait for the next installment of the iron man series or avengers series.
0756686970|5.0|My grandson loved it! At one point he misplaced the character and the entire household was on hands and knees looking for it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game thanks everyone should do have this game.  Very addictive I wish there would not be any levels to stop.
B000002KE2|5.0|Classic album by a classic hard rock band. There is not much more to say, they represent the 60s/70s type of music.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Actually scarey , ok used to bad horror movies this one scared me good. Also scared my girl she won't watch it alone
B00F1W1SQW|5.0|The band is in top form here. A lot of the songs are long and demanding utmost concentration but are brilliantly performed, making it very difficult to pick a highlight. The setlist btw is their most coherent and varied since Score. As all of you know by now, the boys are incredibly strong technically and all of them have terrific chemistry. I should also mention that they are also fantastic songwriters. This is by far the best DVD Dream Theater has ever put out. The sound and picture quality are stellar. It's almost on par with Opeth's Royal Albert Hall DVD in every notable category. It is a must buy for any rock or metal fan, even for those who are new to Dream Theater.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's addictive! Lots of fun! Can't seem to get enough of it. Need to make it easier to ask friends you know play the game for help.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Way too much going on in this movie when there are action sequences.  It was too hard to tell who was fighting and who was standing around.  I feel like there was a lot of effort on the part of the special effects team to create a mind blowing movie but this is not the way to do it. I never saw the ending so I cannot tell you if I thought the plot was worthy. With a new computer and all I kept getting this error message that my computer was not HD compatible and could not understand why if my TV and computer are more than capable of delivering HD quality.  Go figure.
B00DSLZCR4|5.0|Allie Brosh is an amazing author and artist.  This book will keep you laughing read after read. Highly recommend  :-)
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|I began reading the Hunger Games shortly before the first movie hit the theaters and I was expecting both book and movie to be at least somewhat horrible. What I discovered took me be surprise. Despite the first-person perspective (not at all my favorite narrative style) I found the plot gripping and the characters engaging.<br />While I would not unreservedly recommend this book to adult readers (the plot, symbolism and language are all deliberately simplified), it is clearly a perfect fit for its intended audience and for that reason I am happy to give it full marks.
B0010SKSTO|4.0|I read this book for my communication class and loved it. Very interesting learning many nonverbal communication that happens everyday.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Phenomenal book. I don't know how Coben can weave in so many twists and keep the story cohesive. Every page to the very end was a complete surprise.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Again, the singing and dancing were superb.  I wish they made more movies like this one.  The Romeo and Juliette story is always wonderful and with the addition of singing and dancing it was even better.<br />Mary DeBoer
1451666179|5.0|I have loved reading Allie's Blog for a very long time.  This book was absolutely wonderful.  It was filled with old favorites and a bunch of new stories and pictures.  The book is very high quality and the pages are bright, colorful, and fun.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|My Fair Lady<br />Not only is the story wonderful, but the singing and dancing were incredible as well.  At the end she really was :one Fair Lady.&#34;<br />Mary Deboer
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Very well written storyline, as most masterpiece theatre series' are.  You will find many familiar faces in this series if you're a masterpiece fan!
B0055OK2T0|5.0|it was a very good movie had me on the edge of my seat thank you i would see it again
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but with every listen it grows on you. There are a few bland tracks worth skipping, but the majority of the album is finesse. If you're an eminem fan or even hiphop fan period, give it a chance
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minions and this game is so cute. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes minions. Fun and cute
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I miss the old Grisham books .  This was an okay story and held my interest, for the most part, but it was so unbelievable it didn't feel right.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Well it's kinda slow a lot when updating doesn't work when trying to update but it's fun and entertaining to do talk to friends and get in touch
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Dave Grohl rocks...literally...for putting this together!  Great viewing.  Love the proverbial stories behind the story of the famous recording studio. This now belongs to the rock of ages of great historical documentaries that include Sun Studio, Chess Records, Stax Records and Motown!  '-)
B0012GTZC0|3.0|Nothing surprising here: just a well paced spy thriller that is fairly formulaic but still quite enjoyable. Lacks overall depth but is plotted well.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I almost didn't purchase this DVD because of the other reviews, but so glad I did! She was very pregnant while she filmed this and I found that very motivating. Other reviews complained about quality of production and that it was filmed in her living room. Again this motivated me to do the DVD, a more realistic atmosphere to what I have at home compared to the DVDs shot in a studio gym. Very good pace, not too hard but definitely a great workout! I have already recommend to other preggo mom friends and they enjoy it too!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This game is so worth the money. NO HIDDEN OBJECTS! A extraordinary story line and really great graphics. Wonderful exciting challenging puzzles, you really need to think. But they are not so hard you become frustrated.<br /><br />Traveling from one time to another with the graphics ever changing and at times the transformation is both a little scary, not really, and fabulous.<br /><br />Once you get through part one the scenes become electrifying. Really quite marvellous.<br /><br />Any true to heart P&amp;C Adventure Enthusiast will love this game. I played it on a Kindle Fire Hd with no problems.
B0012QRPU4|1.0|Why do I hate Breaking Bad?  The acting is excellent, direction good ...  but the plot is alternatively terrifying and relentlessly depressing.  Strange, the things we Americans find &#34;entertaining.&#34;
B001JIHGO0|5.0|I Love this movie ---- But I couldn't finish watching it because the movie continued to stop for 3-5 minutes and then would run for about a minute. This happened at about an hour into viewing. This was the first movie I rented from Amazon, and I am NOT impressed. Maybe someone from Amazon could refund the money, or offer the movie for free so I can actually finish watching it.<br /><br />I will NOT rent another movie until this issue has been resolved - Thanks
B005Q1W10A|3.0|It's schmaltz and BS... with excellent historically accurate costuming and great antique cars.  I find it boring and aggravating.  My wife loves it ... and I love my wife ... hence I try to shut up.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I love Bryson's writing even though at times he may delve into a little too much detail. This look at all the events of 1927 is a microcosm of America between the world wars. Fascinating stories of the race to be first to fly the Atlantic and even about Babe Ruth. Great reading. Couldn't put it down.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|This is so addicting!  Love the challenge.  Best game ever.....<br />Finished part 1 and so happy part ll came out for me to keep on going!!!
055357342X|5.0|I love the story ~ Thank you George R. R. Martin for sharing your writing talent. I am loathe to put the book down, and look forward to Book 4!
B00459EZLW|4.0|Sad that this was not picked up by another network or at least a movie to wrap things up like Serenity.
0345535421|5.0|George R. R. Martin has written a towering tale ~ I cannot put the book[s] down, and will dread coming to the end of the last. I hope this is a book #6!
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|Absolutely hilarious show that never fails to brighten my day! I don't usually collect TV shows, but made an exception for this one because it's that rare combination of intelligent humor & depth of character that just never gets old. I even got my husband hooked on it after only a couple episodes, so it's safe to say that we'll be watching it many times in the years to come!
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|I think a lot of reviewers are being a little too overly critical on this release.  If you love Donna Summer, you will love this album.  It was made as a labor of love and a tribute to the five time Grammy winner and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, Donna Summer.  Looking at it with this perspective, gives you a whole new way of listening to it.  Overall, I think most of the remixers did a awesome job.  This is a collection of some of Donna's biggest hits reworked by many of today's biggest remixers.  Each one, including Giorgio himself have all been deeply affected by Donna's music, talent, personality, and that VOICE!  And each one has given a little bit of their own talent back to Donna.  No one or no thing can ever compare to the originals.  Do not go into this thinking that any of these will top the versions we all fell in love with and remember.  Having said that, there are some pretty noteworthy selections here.  I think Love to Love You Baby by Giorgio, Hot Stuff by Knuckles/Kupper, I Feel Love by Afrojack, Love is In Control by Chromeo, Bad Girls by Gigamesh, MacArthur Park by Laidback Luke, Sunset People by Hot Chip, Working the Midnight Shift by Holy Ghost!, and Last Dance by Masters at Work are songs I have played over and over again.  We also have a new song here, La Dolce Vita, also produced by Giorgio.  I have to say I got teary eyed the first time I heard this song.  I particularly love hearing Giorgio sing 'She was my dolce vita, and I miss her so.  She was our dolce vita and we miss her so!'  She was most definitely my Dolce Vita and I do miss her more than anyone can possibly imagine.  I hope this album sparks interest in releasing more Donna vaulted songs and maybe a remaster of her ENTIRE catalog.  So put the cd in your car player, open the windows and blast some Donna Summer through your town.  Love to Love You Donna indeed!!  XOXOX
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|I really enjoy this show. To bad tv can't put more show like this on. Most of the show that are suppose to be funny are dumb.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|The first warning is that you will ignore many of your daily tasks once you start reading this powerful book. The second and more important warning is that our technology is well on the way to creating the society that Dave Eggers depicts in this book. In spite of the seriousness of the subject matter, Eggers manages to make us laugh at ourselves, as the characters in the story willingly sign over their souls to their corporate masters.<br /><br />I rarely if ever read a book a second time but I'm already planning on reading The Circle again and again.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This was one of the best movie plots I had seen in a long time. It made you want to watch every minute to see what was going on.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|No problems at all powering usb mics, keyboards and midi controllers. No complaints at all. Thanks for an easy transaction.
0375703764|4.0|House of Leaves was recommended to me by a good friend. I saw his copy and noted the thickness and immediately thought- hey thats a good value. Upon further inspection, I was also totally impressed by the unconventional presentation. In fact, I always felt that if I were to ever write a book, I'd do it in some crazy, non-linear,  extra-visual way this book does. Granted, that style works better with the horror here than the romantic comedy I was devising.<br /><br />House of Leaves is clearly an experience. If you ever meet someone else you has read it, you'll have so much to talk about.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|One of my major complaints about most modern Christian music is the lack of musicianship in most faith-based bands.  That's why I've always been a fan of Stryper.  They can more than hold their own against the majority of classic guitar-driven rock/metal groups and do so without all of the dark imagery normally associated with heavy metal.  No More Hell To Pay, their latest record, doesn’t really break new ground, offering all of the overdriven guitars, searing harmonies, and Biblically influenced lyrics that fans have come to expect.  That’s not a bad thing.  In fact, it’s this familiar recipe of heavy power chords, blistering solos, and transcendent vocals that make this album so enjoyable.  We’ve all heard this version of Stryper before but never with so much fire and fervor.<br /><br />Michael Sweet's voice is strong on this album, and he still can hit those upper stratosphere notes just as well as contemporaries like Rob Halford, Bruce Dickinson, and Geoff Tate. The twin guitar attack of Sweet and Oz Fox could stand alongside classic duos like DeGarmo/Wilton (Queensryche), Murray/Smith/Gers (Iron Maiden), and even more modern contemporaries like Gates/Vengeance (Avenged Sevenfold).  For their part, Tim Gaines (bass) and Robert Sweet (drums) aren’t as visible but their fingerprints are all over this batch of songs as they lay down a solid, heavy groove for Sweet and Fox to riff and solo over with reckless abandon.  Over the years, the band has evolved into something more respectable and mature than they showed on previous albums like The Yellow and Black Attack and Against the Law; and nowhere is that more evident than on tracks like &#34;Revelation,&#34; “No More Hell to Pay,” “Te Amo,” and &#34;Water Into Wine.&#34;  In fact, the opening riff to &#34;Water Into Wine&#34; is one of the heaviest riffs in their catalogue, and it's hard not to bang your head a little to that one.  Gone are the layers of makeup and ridiculous bumblebee-influenced outfits, leaving behind a finely tuned band that rips through this particular batch of songs like a much younger band of musicians with fire in their bellies and salvation in their hearts.<br /><br />Personal Favorite:  &#34;Te Amo&#34; could stand alongside anything from Iron Maiden's heyday in the early to mid 80's (circa Powerslave).  The twin harmonies on this one are enough to make guitar purists sit up and take notice.<br /><br />Misses:  “Jesus is Just Alright”-this cover of the old song by The Art Reynolds Singers (made popular by The Doobie Brothers) seemed out of place here and should have been released as a bonus track.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Stryper is a great, heavy band who are technically proficient players and songwriters that use their talents to glorify God.  No More Hell to Pay could easily serve as a sequel to their guitar masterpiece To Hell With The Devil.  Pick this one up and crank the speakers to 10.outfits, leaving behind a finely tuned band that rips through this particular batch of songs like a much younger band of musicians with fire in their bellies and salvation in their hearts.<br /><br />Personal Favorite:  &#34;Te Amo&#34; could stand alongside anything from Iron Maiden's heyday in the early to mid 80's (circa Powerslave).

B007BZM3HK|5.0|Arguably the song of the summer 2012. It turns out Canadians are pretty good at music. At least thats what my former Canadian girlfriend would say. We used to be such good friends and now we hardly talk. She says we just need some space, but its a long distance relationship. I really hope we don't fall apart.
B005FRF6PC|3.0|I think the book would be better in Spanish.  Some of the translations / sayings, in my opinion, were not top notch.  Still interesting to see why he is as focused and detrmined as he is.  Vamos Rafa!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|NEAT Clock. Like the looks and function of this app.  Can't wait to get more upgraded edition. Thank you for this cool clock.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Loved the book.  Easy reading and kept me wanting to read more.  I will definitely get another book in the John Puller series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun and so totally addictive!  Thanks for a fun challenging game!!  I would recommend this game to anyone.
0553801473|5.0|Great great book but I was sad when it was over because the next book doesn't come out until next year or possibly as late as 2017!!!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Ive been a long time fan of Agent Pendergast, and I love to see how he problem solves. Thay are always every entertainin<br />g books...and I loved the new twin sons twists and cant wait to see how this pans out in his next book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this...I wanted more !!!! It's really ,intense, I struggled a little, to figure out some clues, but it was such an awesome game.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Don't play this game if you have any other work to do.  It won't get done. At all. You will cry when you have to wait for more lives.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! It really exercises your brain while you play. It's addictive and really fun to play. The only draw back for me is that you only get 5 lives at a time. You can win to get to the next level, but after you use up the 5 lives given, you have to wait for 30 minutes to get more. Other than that, I truly love this game. Now if only Pet Rescue Saga would come to the Kindle Fire, that would be wonderful!!!!!!!!!!
B008Q08IV4|5.0|What is NOT to love about this movie? Great acting - great plot and just a great snuggle up on the couch and celebrate life movie!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I love the first two films but I shall say this the packaging is FABULOUS....I AM SO GLAD I WAS ABLE TO CATCH IT ON SALE WHEN OFFERED FOR $17.99!!!!
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Will and Jaden Smith deliver with this exciting if predictable SCIFI story.  You know how it's going to end so it's all about the journey.  Good solid entertainment.  Nothing too deep or troubling.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This story kept me reading. I read it while on a plane.  A perfect read for travel or the beach.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Can't believe I waited so long to watch this movie.  It was a beautiful story that leaves you thinking of it for days after.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|Before I begin I can't specify enough to leave your Twilight expectations at the door because this is far more graphic and plot specific. I really like Twilight but TVD blows it out of the water even surpassing the TVD books. This season is no different and in my small opinion the best yet. Each episode from Season 1 until now constantly surprises leaving you wondering what is next and the finale this season is no exception. I have the set simply because of the added extras it includes. Bonus scenes, commentary and oh the gag reels! If you our a fan its definitely worth having, if you never seen its definitely worth seeing from the beginning..you will be slightly lost if you don't but will quickly catch up. My best advice is if you think you might like it try it. I really don't think you will be disappointed.
B003F1WM2K|3.0|Although I loved Patti Smith's Horses, I never listened to its lyrics at the time I played it again and again. Patti is a clear writer and makes the retelling of her life easy-to-understand. Unfortunately, as I was never a grunge poet, I was unaware of many people in her circle of friends, so her name-dropping wasn't as meaningful to me as it might be to other readers.<br /><br />My takeaway was that she crafted her skills based on her observations. She started out as a rock music reporter and what she learned must have seeped into all of her pours. She understands the mood, tone, and visuals to a T.<br /><br />Learning about Robert Mapplethorpe was interesting, too, and how he evolved into being a photographer. As I'm always evolving into being &#34;something,&#34; I love reading about other people's journeys.<br /><br />I gave this book 3 stars because if you don't know something about Patti Smith, it isn't the most fascinating read as there are so many references to people and places that are long gone. If you want to learn more, it's great.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. Finally something different for the viewers. Refreshing change from the same old lawyer/cop dramas the US keeps regurgitating.
B0002ADY1A|5.0|Best Heep in my opinion. This and magicians birthday are the only Uriah Heep albums I have owned. Definitely<br />Better than the MP3 version I replaced my worn LP with.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I have been listening to Stryper from the beginning of the band, I have all the albums and all I can say this tops them all Christian metal is back where it should be at the top of its game and Stryper are better than ever. Unlike so many bands reforming very few have the original line up, not Stryper all original members still playing great music, the album dosen't have a dud song on it at all every one of them is pure metal with a message, stand out tracks for me are Sticks and stones, water into wine and saved by love. This album is outstanding buy if you won't be disappointed.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Great entertainment. Can watch it over and over with no adverse effects. No brain required to participate. Great for rainy days.
0670024813|4.0|This book was the second half of the beach reading.  Yes, it has taken me this long to finish the book.  The first was, “Unbroken” which was one of the best books ever, and this one was good.  Just good.  It was long, and on a topic of some general interest, but not a page turner.  I have read most of all of Jared Diamonds stuff, and if you have, he does not come from a Christian World view, he is definitely an evolutionist.  But before I am judged, do realize that it is wise to read from all sources.  There were many chapters in this book, and some of them, came and went with little impression.  Mostly, they were read to be read.  But there were two chapters that I rather liked.  One chapter was about conflict resolution, and in fact, learned about conflict in a primitive society.  What was interesting was the parallel to the church world.  Conflict in this culture is about the restoration of relationships, not merely about assigning guilt.  The chapter caused me to think about the Biblical text a lot.  Of course the book was about comparing primitive societies to modern-western societies, and at some moments, I was thankful for the West.  Another chapter that was interesting was his explanation of the development of religion.  Of course, he does not believe in God, but looks at it through a lens of the utilitarian purpose of religion.  This was interesting, and also helped in connecting with people.  I would assign this fact of religion being part of every tribal in every land to be the image of God, and the tao that C.S. Lewis mentions, but it was still a interesting read.  This might not be a book worthy of a full read, but there are a few chapters that spark interest.  Not a bad read, just a long one.
B004JHYRYU|5.0|You get lost in the prose (poetry) of Ondaatje. I watched the movie, but the book is several times superior.
0061928356|5.0|This is a well written thought provoking book, that created an excellent discussion for my book club. Everyone enjoyed reading it and thought they were lucky to live in the USA and have their families born here.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book. Very intence!!! It is not just about the sex like everyone made it sounds. It has a great story line.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Very good book. Inspirational. More people should take a good look in the mirror after this hoot of a tale.
B001HN6922|5.0|This was just what my grandkids needed on a rainy cold day. Movie is very colorful and a good clean story line about an additional race in the European circuit. A CARS take with a James Bond theme. Mater gets confused for being a spy in solving a diabolical Lemon car crime ring to make reliable cars pay for their mistreatment and to make money for the Lemon crime ring. Mater is a kind of Pink Panther, while befuddling things for McQueen's race he is accidentally helping the British crime stoppers and becomes aware of his being an idiot and decides to save McQueen from his mistakes and be a hero by being brave and joining the British spy agents in stopping the bad guys and solving the mysteries with his vast knowledge of car parts he is able to trace to the real perpetrator.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I purchased two of these units for my cars.  They are well built and fit solidly in the 12V sockets in the car.  They charge iPhones and my iPad quickly.  Well worth the price.  I would buy them again.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Just one listen, but it sounds amazing. Great songs, great guitar work, Tim's bass is all over the place, and the drums sound huge! Michael's vocals sound as good or better as back in 1986.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|While the story may be loosely based on a true event, they did take some liberties. It was entertaining and I thought Sandra Bullock did a great job immersing herself in the role.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I don't have much time to read so pick my choices carefully. I am so glad I took a chance on this because the time was a great investment. James gets you thinking in a way that makes this book hard to put down. He inspired me after almost 5 decades to stop wasting my ideas by forgetting them.  Instead, now I write ideas constantly.  Thanks James.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Very entertaining all around, although there is a lot a shooting (but I believe that's part of the comedy). It is nice to see some older action heroes...
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|This book is pretty good but a little confusing in the begging for me. I recommend this book to kids ages 10-13. Has a pretty good plot and solution. Teaches kids to not take things for granted and to live life the way it should be lived.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|This movie was just okay. While the story was fine, I thought some of the images a little too disturbing for the little ones. And this was not as funny or entertaining for the adults, either.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very entertaining.  A nice read which ultimately leads to a real moral analysis.  I recommend this book for a beach or vacation read.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I understood the premise and what the were aiming for, but it still seemed to fall short. And it is definitely not for everyone (my husband didn't like it). Might be confusing for some.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|we really really enjoy the good wife, so glad to be able to catch up on past seasons we  missed
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Excellent graphics and great story. This was entertaining for the children and the adults. It was good to see the &#34;beginning&#34; of Mike and Sully.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Addicting but fun to play! Some levels are very challenging. I am stuck on this level and have been for a couple if days!
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This was very funny for the kids and adults. Good graphics. The story was well written and entertaining as well.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|This review is for the blu-ray picture quality, sound quality, etc.-- not for how good the story or acting is. \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" has an AMAZINGLY beautiful picture, with very accurate colors (as with the flesh tones, for example), vivid colors, and it's EXTREMELY sharp. The audio is excellent as well.  You will be amazed, literally, by the gorgeous, brand-new-looking HD picture quality. I'm very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />GREAT job on this film's Blu-Ray picture, just beautiful HD quality.  The sound is perfect, too, just coming out of my HD TV's speakers-- no sound bar is involved.  One of the three best older-film blu-rays, for picture quality, that I own, of over 100 blu-ray titles.  The movie looks about 40 years newer than it is!<br /><br />I have always loved this film for its timeless children's story, musical numbers, script, and acting.  The picture quality makes it all better still.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended blu-ray.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Entertaining for the whole family, and definitely a twist on the whole Santa Claus tradition. I would recommend, especially for something to watch around Christmas.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Casting was perfect.  You don't often get any better than Denzel Washington.  The story really isn't about &#34;Flight&#34;...but more about the fact that &#34;drugs&#34; destroy otherwise brilliant minds, bodies and lives.  Frankly, the story was too much reality for this gal.  I would have much preferred a story ABOUT flight and the passion that one has for it....a lighter venue.  I gave it four stars because of the talent that was cast in making the film.  As for the story, 2 stars would be good for me.
B0060D3BWK|4.0|While I liked this and remember it from my younger years, I would not recommend it for younger kids as there are some scarier images and themes for the younger ones. Good Halloween movie, though.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I purchased this app as Amazon said it was compatible with my Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505.<br />It's not. The tutorial isn't even able to be finished as you can't create objects. Press enter to make the object? Nope.<br />A simple patch to fix this would be nice but I won't hold my breath.<br />If it actually worked I might review it with a better score.
B006JPML7K|5.0|This sequel was done just as well as the first. It was also entertaining for the children as well as the adults.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is very addictive. I love playing Castleville on Zynga and now I have Legends on my Kindle!<br />Great
B002OQT928|4.0|This is about the same as the other movies, although I believe the graphics are better than the original. The story isn't bad.
B001EC3JME|5.0|It is a little tight for the light I have but that is probably better because I don't have to worry about losing my light.
B0051XSKSU|5.0|This is a very entertaining and fun movie for the kids, as well as for adults. The visuals are also great.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|What can i say, if you like Queen you will like this set. Has all the hits I remember and some I didn't.
B0060CXAHC|3.0|While the kids liked this one fine, I did not find it really entertaining for the adults. I also found problems with the story and the fact that the main characters could be downright mean sometimes. Disney has some better films out there.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Awesome! Loved everything about the movie. I just ordered the series of books. I plan to finish catching fire before the 22nd when the movie is released.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Both my children and I really enjoyed this movie. Great story, voice-acting, and visuals. They would watch this over and over if I let them.
1416955070|4.0|There's lots of reviews here that can explain the basis of plot. I'm only going to say it was nice to read something that's current w what's being written lately...and its done in a very plain way. The writers style isn't overly done or distracting.  I enjoyed reading this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|An unusual story, hard to put down, very well written--excellent  and unusual metaphors.<br />Because I know someone who operates exactly like Amy, I did not find the happenings hard to believe at all.<br />I could relate!
B00AJLHUAS|4.0|Interesting to redo your music w a twist...remake it with a jazzy sound.  Its a new way to introduce yourself to a new audience people who frequent the movie theatres! That's where Id heard it first in jazzy form. From what I understand music came from The Great Gatsby film starring Tobey Mcguire and Leonardo DiCaprio . Music is great. Wonderful spin on Ferry's past work.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I have lost my colors, bombs and can not get into my account. I go through a go around changing passwords on younot recognizing my email.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|I really didn't care for it and can't understand why people rated it so high.  If you like cheesy sci-fi then this is for you.
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|I love this game.  Can go as fast as slow as you  want, do the same level again to increase score. If you like puzzle style games, this one's for you.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Godzilla creatures fight the (human operated) Transformers.  Characters participate in a few well done MMA scenes.  Most of the characters are flat stereotypes.  The movie is not of great interest.
0891419063|5.0|Wonderful book. My son is a military buff and he reads all he can on the subject. This book and others by E.B. Sledge are actual accounts from a soldier who was there and they are very well written.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game only been playing the a few days but it rocks and you can connect with the face book friends
159562015X|4.0|StrengthsFinder 2.0 is like having a 'Work Skills Horoscope'. Now you can know your 'sign' and the 'sign' of your co-workers/team mates to better understand motivations and what types of work make them happiest!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Excelent lots of fun makesnyou think i highly recomend itfun.fun.fun.yes it is fun.really like the skellitons with the bad bafks. the physics. is chalinging
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Has been my favorite movie ever since I was a child. You don't find many films that spend their time with uplifting themes. This one does. And the music will leave you yapping your foot and humming the songs for days afterward.  It is a timeless treasure.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Really good plot with unexpected twists and turns.  Can't wait to see Season 2. I'm liking Season 3 a lot currently.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|Beautiful, adorable cat and kitten pictures accompany these fun little poems.  Very imaginative poetry, and quite like what I think they'd be thinking, having had cats for over 25 years.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Great comic-- love Allie. Sorry the review is lame, but there are so many good ones up already. I really just want to click the five stars and go back to my meager 1/2 hour lunch hour. Get the book. It's totally worth it.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|A solid story with a well built world around it. At times a little confusing, but he gives you time to catch up and figure it out. Kept me in the dark and guessing what was going on until the very end. Not the best writing I've ever seen but I was very involved in the story. Looking forward to the next one.
B008JFUS0U|3.0|How do you spell sensory overload? Visual overload; aural overload; too, too much. Computer Generated Imaging is fine if it augments a good story, but there was so much CGI that the uninitiated (ME!) couldn't decipher the plot. Of course there are the good guys and the bad guys, but some times even the good guys were sorta bad. And some of the bad guys were even worse! But I am NOT a member of the target audience for this one.<br /><br />Directed by Alan Taylor (\\"Game of Thrones\\"), this jumbled slugfest had dismemberments to spare, plus thunderbolts, space ships, and family tiffs among immortals. (Only two little chaste kisses though; it is, after all, PG-13)<br /><br />Here we go again!<br />  * Chris Hemsworth (\\"Rush\\") is Thor, back to save the universe.<br />  * Natalie Portman (\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\") returns as Jane Foster, the scientist he left behind...once.<br />  * Tom Hiddleston (\\"The Avengers\\") is resurrected as Loki, the bad brother nobody likes! Remember what The Hulk did to him?<br />  * Stellan Skarsgård (\\"Romeo and Juliet\\") is back as Dr. Eric Selvig, the man we first see running naked on a news broadcast. His lecture on the convergence of the planets is received by a singularly bored class...of senior citizens.<br />  * Idris Elba (\\"Prometheus\\" and \\"Luther\\") overlooked by Yours Truly in the first Thor, he's back again and I'm glad he is on our side!<br />  * Zachary Levi (\\"Tangled\\" and \\"Chuck\\") is the third spear carrier from the left...smile...<br />  * Ray Stevenson (\\"Rome\\") is Thor's right-hand man.<br />  * Kat Dennings (\\"Thor\\") is back as Darcy, who provides the too-scarce comic relief. I found myself looking forward to anything with her in it because I could relax a bit and laugh.<br /><br />A word to the wise: There is the patented Marvel comics \\"teaser\\" just before the closing credits, but if you are patient and sit through an endless scroll of technicians involved in this project, there is a second teaser!<br /><br />Amazon will notify mewhen the DVD is available so I can advise my JayFlix.net folks.
B006VREHRS|5.0|Unique and Intriguing Show! Great show! Very well done and keeps my interest through each episode. I love the costumes and set details.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I wanted a game that I could play that would either challenge myself or one that  would keep me busy while watching TV. The different levels of this game gave me all of that. Great memory game.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|It doesn't take a clairvoyant to understand that ''Reflektor'' re-defines indie music and thus, it is destined to generate love and dislike, possibly in equal amounts. Being one of the best bands the current indie scene has to offer, Arcade Fire takes a bold change in their musical direction, steps away from their comfort zone, jettisons all the concerns and potential trepidation associated with keeping up the mainstream success, and introduces a dark art-rock album. The opening track ''Reflektor'' gently warns the listeners that this album is not aiming to repeat the cleaner rock patters of ''Neon Bible'' and ''The Suburbs''. And it only takes three to four songs to realize that the lyrical themes of isolation, alienation, love in unexpected places, resurrection, and disappointment coupled with 80s electro disco sound and synths are not only captivating but they are also bold and refreshing. Songs like ''Here Comes The Night Time'', ''Joan of Arc'', ''Awful Sound'', ''It's Never Over'', and ''Afterlife'' are not only beautiful, but they are intricate, complex, and unpredictable in terms of composition. The whole album creates the feeling that you are possibly stuck in the most dire situation but you are not giving up on life. It is like you are trapped in a dark disco, you are confused but you still have the urge to dance. And just for this reason, ''Reflektor'' is an epitome of how a decent indie album can integrate both craftiness and simplicity into its lyrics and production. Is this album the next ''OK Computer''? Maybe not. Do we care if it is? No. But that's exactly why it is possibly the next best thing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. It was one of the first games I downloaded to my Kindle. It is easy to play and I have not had any issues of any kind. I have been playing this for over a year now.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Terrific! This is what launched robert Downy Jr's acting career into the main stream. Before he was Iron man or Sherlock Holmes, he was a real actor and Chaplin proves this over and over again. A star studded film that has found it place on my all tiome favorites list.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I downloaded this thinking that it would help me to see attachments on Facebook.  This review should not be used to judge the application, since I was trying to use it for the wrong purpose.
B00F35BV64|1.0|Gene Roddenbury had his ashes launched into space recently. i think it was to get away from this piece of crap. Not only does J J Abrams rewrite the history of the original Star Trek Series, he has the gaul to think we won't notice. I'm no Trekkie, I've never been to a convention, nor have I ever dressed up as a Star Trek character, but I am a fan of the series(s) and i  have to tell you that i was insulted and appalled at what they allowed this hack of a writer and sorry excuse of a director to perpetrate onto the masses. This is CRAP! Please don't buy it, please don't rent it, please don't do antything that might encourage these morons to continue to destroy the greatest sci fi fanchise in history any further.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|The visuals are stunning. Roy's death scene is epic, reminding me for some reason of the Burt Lancaster's final scene in The Swimmer.  The larger than life male figure tragically fallen.  Good stuff!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I can't get enough of this series. I hate all the gore and guts, but i realize this was a brutal time in human history, so i allow for it, but the story telling is wonderful and the characters are splendid. The actoring and directing come together like the perfect ballet. Motion and flow accompanied by thrilling sounds and moving music. HBO has done it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|One of the most fun games I've played...but ended WAY too soon! I hope New rooms come soon! It's just hard enough to make you think. But not hard enough to give up..EXCELLENT...
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I'm either getting too good at this or the games are getting too simple. But I can't stop playing the damn thing!
B0091WNK8M|4.0|My kids and I love this movie. I would have given 5 stars but did not just because it has a little violence and language. Great action for my kids to enjoy and they love the characters.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Never boring, full of action and felt realistic. A good plot and like the idea that there could be a sequel.
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|I play cross me as well but I like this game better. The puzzles are more challenging and there is a better variety.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book makes you really think about your reactions to things that happen in everyday life.  Life is too precious to waste on anger and hostility. Be thankful everyday and try to appreciate the small moments.  The simpler see the most fulfilling.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Great movie fast paced I'm not used to zombies that run though. I would recommend this. I'm gonna rent more movies
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|Great game to play alone or with someone else.  Graphics are good and the characters are funny.  Easy to manipulate, but challenging to play.  Fun!  Works good on my Kindle Fire.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Satisfactory camera bag. Has a lot of Velcro padded compartments to store all camera , lenses and etc.  Didn't-'t care for the  tacky signage on the zipper pulls for Amazon. Gave it a cheaper feel because of the colors. It does hold most camera  needs, but I would of liked not all the advertising for Amazon.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|Her photography is stunning! I want to lick the tablet. I will enjoy trying to recreate her recipes. I also enjoy reading her blog.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not super hard but fun for the price.<br />Clean graphics. Easy to manipulate around the rooms.each level gets more complicated.

160774273X|5.0|Dynamite book. Years of trying to make good bread and working my ..... off to get it done. Always failed to meet my expectations.  Then bingo. Ken's book and cast iron no knead bread recipe. First time out of the chute It was &#34;perfecto&#34;. My children, in laws and lady who sells her home made bread at farmers markets share photos of the finished product and tips. My children call me. &#34;hey dad, what about doing this and see what happens, or I blew it&#34;. It's fun.<br /><br />I constantly thank my son's mother in law for giving your book to me as a gift. It has encouraged several others to get into the bread making fun.<br /><br />I now buy flour in 40 pound bags.Who would of thought.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|It was really really really good! OMIGOSH YOU GUYS NEED TO READ THIS BOOK IT IS THE BOMB DIGGITY AHHHHHH
B000YJ6736|1.0|The only reason I finished this book was because it was the only unread book I had on my kindle during a recent flight.<br />On Chesil Beach was stilted, boring and in my opinion a waste of time.<br />The main characters, Edward and Florence,were never well developed in the book.<br />I was as disappointed with the story as Edward was with his wedding night and as put off by Florence and her foolish, stilted behavior as she was with Edward.<br />I would not recommend this book at all.<br />Even a cereal box would be more appealing as reading material!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is fun to play when I got nothing to do it sucks u can only play it with wick but still a good game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like the puzzles, too bad there are only ten rooms. But I'll definitely be on the lookout for more room additions
B008GJVEZ2|5.0|It's not really a mob movie.<br />It's not an epic movie.<br /><br />Why would I give it 5 stars?<br /><br />I like movies based on plays, yet this is not one of them.<br /><br />What is it?<br /><br />This movie is framed beautifully.<br />It has wonderful dialogue that creates a sense of a mob movie without it really being one.<br />I say that only because the mob sense is really more setting.  It's not action packed. It's not realistic.  It's not a mob movie.  It's a drama cast therein.<br /><br />The acting and staging are strong.  The scenes are constructed and edited to beauty.<br /><br />The scene when they come to get Albert Finney is worth seeing the movie alone.<br /><br />The idioms that percolate through the narrative are curious, but become iconic by the movie's conclusion.<br /><br />So many icons in the film beyond the hat and its leitmotif.<br /><br />The dialogue is strong and smells of film noir, but it's a new language, even though the film is years old.<br />Fully fiction. There is no real setting here, but you are taken to this place where the mob talks hard and eloquent and new, and may not have the Mamet stammer.<br /><br />It's still not my favorite film.  There are many, many more.<br /><br />But each time I see this film come up on my TV guide, I know I want to hear and see a bit of it.<br />It never tires.  A great film.
0756697875|5.0|These books truly just show you the different sets that have been offered in the series over the years.  However, it's done creatively, and if you have a young guy or gal who is into cataloging things (like mine is), you'll find him/her pouring over this book again and again.  This is a cute book series, and the bonus figure makes the price a little more worth it.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|A well-done but not especially entertaining post-apocalyptic story.  Cruise does fine and the special effects are fantastic, but the plot and dialog are pretty sparse.
B004JMZPJG|2.0|Not a good fit for my camera.  Little too big for my Fujifilm HS50EXR camera.  Otherwise it is a great case.
B00G32OER4|4.0|It was pretty good and exciting.  You actually get to see things rather than just having to use your imagination
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|This is a great family movie to watch. There is quite a lot of laughing too, we really enjoyed Monsters University!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|It is a cute little game. And it is a fun game But im doing this to get a bonus level.
006202406X|5.0|Very happy I didn't listen to all the negative reviews! Great ending to the series, although sad. Will read again!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Imagine Dragons knows how to make music worth listening to. I like all the songs on the album which is rare.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a really fun game me and my younger sister both like playing it she is really good at it. She is like a fruit destroying god she gets a better score on this than me most of the time.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Great read! Everyone should read this book it will greatly improve your life and interactions with people. You won't regret it!
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|This is a good app because i can know the weather today or next week or in another location or the next day or yesterday! So buy the app or whatever floats your boat i guess!
B00BAXFECK|3.0|The first 500 or so pages were great! But from there on I just got bored. I loved the beginning. I loved the middle. The end just dragged on and on. It was interesting because I kept having to reset my thinking. I would be read page upon page as if in a Dickens novel and then out of nowhere a cell phone or computer reference would be made. -Reminding me that this novel was set in 2000.  The dialog and mannerisms of its characters was very unsettling (in a good way) to the time frame and circumstance surrounding them. It is hard to go into what I did and didn't like about the book without giving the whole thing away. So I will just say that you should go ahead and read it. You won't be sorry. Although at about page 550 (if you are anything like me) you will no longer be straining to stay wake to read further.  In fact, in May just aid in helping you to fall asleep.
B005PK56TA|5.0|By far, the best season of a great show. Well thought out and very well developed. Nothing else to say.
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|First the songs Al picked to do are truly a great mix of the very best of the Beatles. he treats them with the utmost respect while adding his own take that only a guitarist of his caliber can pull off.
0316204366|3.0|There can be no doubt that Gladwell explored a wide variety of situations and personalities. Equally, he analyses with depth the contrasting and conflicting vicissitudes of life: all that glitters is not gold ... do not settle for appearances for they not be realities. While one celebrates the triumphs of various underdogs over their superiors, this seems lost in the multitude of situations with Gladwell's subtle interpretations.  In the end one settles for the simplicity of the Biblical confrontation between David and Goliath. Go David! Go!
B005LAIIN0|1.0|This is a great movie, but I am returning the Blu-ray + DVD + Digital copy I ordered. This set does not include a Blu-ray copy of the original theatrical release. It includes only a Blu-ray copy of the UNRATED version and a DVD copy of the PG-13 version (as well as the digital copy). I wanted a Blu-ray copy of the PG-13 version. Anyone know where I can find that? There doesn't appear to be one on Amazon...
B005PK553C|5.0|Once I started watching episode 1 I couldn't stop! The only glitch is that you can only watch it via wifi using Amazon instant video.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|What a great movie! Entertaining, action packed, witty, and most of all- believeable!<br /><br />John Cale, a capitol policeman, is interviewing for a job with the White House Secret Service when an attack occurs. He has to spring into action to save his daughter and the President of the USA while insider terrorists work to take over the government.<br /><br />I found the movie to be completely believeable about who is behind the attacks; all the 1 star reviews are religious and conservative nut jobs who would prefer to think otherwise. You can be your own judge however!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Compared to Taubes's earlier book, _Good Calories, Bad Calories_, this one is much more reader-friendly. Compared to any diet book you might read, this one has the scientific fats about the effects of eating carbs vs. fats vs. protein on the body.<br /><br />I'm a physician. I wish every patient I've ever had—thin people, fat people, everyone—would read this book.

I actually tried doing a bit of this work out in my early 2nd trimester, and I was overwhelmed both by the intensity and by the fact that Erin was performing it so far along in her own pregnancy. I absolutely DO NOT recommend it - your pregnant body is at the gym most of the time already, since it is building a baby.  However, the Postnatal Rescue dvd by Erin O'Brien is a very good and well thought out training dvd.
B00ET0PZDO|3.0|This game is lots of fun and makes you think. I took a chance and found it well worth the 99 cents.<br /><br />Update: While this game is lots of fun I noticed it was sucking the life out of my Kindle's battery, even when I wasn't playing. Not sure what the problem is, but I uninstalled it and all is good now. I guess for some reason, on my Kindle, the program keeps running after playing.
B00FKAA3MA|3.0|I love eminem, respect his work.  While I dislike most of his last few cd's, I will still listen to whatever he drops just because I know what he's capable of.  Summary of what probably will be a long rant: Overall this is a mixed bag that won't have much replay value except for a couple songs.<br /><br />Good:<br />FINALLY got rid of the ridiculous accent that he used a little on Encore and throughout Relapse. In fact I would have LOVED Relapse if it weren't for his stupid accent.  Also he isn't yelling on every track like he did on Recovery.  If you were like me and just wanted Eminem to go back to using the same voice that he did on his first 3 cd's, then you will love that about MMLP2.  obviously it isn't the same EXACT voice since he's older and voice is deeper, but besides that it's the same.<br /><br />Lyrically, his flows are on point and he has a lot to say here.  Some of the stories he tells are very interesting and funny. Again, on this note he is definitely living up to the MMLP name here.<br /><br />Bad:<br />Beats are not great.  Only a few of the songs have hot beats, especially in comparison to MMLP or Relapse. Very silly beats and samples. Overall there aren't a lot of head nodders here.<br /><br />Hooks are corny. he sings too much.<br /><br />Singing.. He actually has a song on here where he sings most of the way and it's just terrible.  And the featured artists who sing over the hooks take away from the song, make it feel much more Pop than Hip Hop.  If you typically like Pop music more than Hip Hop then this should be a good thing for you. For me, it's bad. I can't bump this stuff in my ride with the windows down.<br /><br />I give this 3 stars even though I have more bad things to say than good things because I feel like the cd, as a whole, is very listenable from front to back. The songs that I don't like do sound like they belong here. There are only a couple songs I want to skip.  Most songs are tolerable if not great.<br /><br />This isn'ton MMLP1 level but it definitely isn't as horrific as Recovery or Encore.  I think people are 5 staring this a lot just because they are happy to hear him stop screaming/yelling over the track like Recovery, but by no means should this cd be 5 stars. MMLP1, SSLP, and even eminem show are deserving of 5 stars.  This is just good not great.
B00DJ80VLS|2.0|I am a DT fan, but I can INSTANTLY tell from the samples here on Amazon that this is NOT the band who'd written other great works. This sounds much more like 80's Ratt or Poison than DT. The sound compression (as others have mentioned) is obvious. I don't see the same drumming from Mangini as I did Portnoy. Disappointing.

1451666179|5.0|I was surprised at how long this book was, much longer than I expected.  And I was surprised at the amount of new content.  I would have been perfectly happy to buy a book of all her old material, because I've gotten so much pleasure from it, but the new stories are just as good as, if not better than, the stuff she's put online.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  I may well simply buy a copy for everyone I know as their Christmas present.  It is a book that drives one to evangelize for it because you want everyone you know to experience the joy and hilarity and poignant understanding of the difficulties of being human.  The story about the goose had me roaring with laughter.  You need this book, I promise.

0380807343|5.0|Coraline and her parents have moved to a new house. Well, part of a new house anyway. Dotty former actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible live on the ground floor with their collection of geriatric Highland terriers. They enjoy eating boiled sweets and reading tea leaves. A crazy old man with a big moustache lives in the attic. He spends his time training a mouse circus. Coraline and her parents live in the middle of all that and Coraline knows that there is something peculiar going on. Yes, more peculiar than her new neighbours.<br /><br />She discovers an old door in the drawing room that sometimes leads to a brick wall and sometimes leads to the other house that is just like her house but other and elsewhere. In the other house live Coraline's other mother and father, a black-button eyed and papery skinned pair, who have been waiting a long time for Coraline to come and join them. Now that she's finally arrived, the other mother and father want Coraline to stay with them. For ever.<br /><br />Coraline is a wonderfully creepy book. Neil Gaiman has succeeded in writing a story for children that demonstrates what being brave really means. Coraline is a true hero since, despite being really, badly scared, she goes on to do the right thing anyway. The other house is a mixed up, terrifyingly disorientating place and the other parents, button eyed mother especially, are truly menacing. Luckily for Coraline, she isn't completely on her own when facing the terrible otherness - the almost friendly black cat that hangs around the house seems to know what is going on and, while her oddball new neighbours aren't always that helpful, they do provide many moments of amusement.<br /><br />This special 10th anniversary edition of Coraline is a delightfully produced hardback with a new cover design and illustrations by Chris Riddell (of the Edge Chronicles and Muddle Earth fame). Each chapter is preceded by a full-page black and white illustration that depicts important charactersor events from the story. Riddell is an excellent artist and the illustrations that he has produced for Coraline really capture Neil Gaiman's characters and help to reflect the danger that Coraline faces.<br /><br />This new edition of Coraline also includes an interesting introduction by Neil Gaiman himself in which he describes how he came to write the book and also the various houses and experiences from his own life that inspired the world of Coraline. This introduction combined with Chris Riddell's illustrations really serves to enhance the book and highlight just how special a story Coraline is. All in all, this is a wonderful edition of a modern children's classic and Coraline would make a great gift for an adventurous child who isn't afraid of a fair dose of mystery and spooky goings-on.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|Not necessarily the \\"best\\" movie I've seen lately, but it's the one I've enjoyed the most. Rented it last night and will be buying it. Action packed without being too incredibly gory and I liked all of the characters. Laughed a lot, had me on the edge of my seat a couple of times.
1423141997|4.0|The Son of Neptune is the second book in Rick Riordan's Heroes of Olympus series and marks the return of Percy Jackson. While his whereabouts had become clear to readers towards the end of The Lost Hero, Percy himself has little idea where he has been and what he might have done to earn the hatred of the Gorgon sisters. Although Percy's inconvenient amnesia means that he doesn't remember killing Medusa, her sisters certainly do and so they have been pursuing him with a vengeance (and a tray of sample snacks) across the country for months. Fortunately for Percy, the pursuit ends just outside of Camp Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Camp Half-Blood.<br /><br />After being ambiguously advised by Juno, Percy decides that he will head for the relative safety of Camp Jupiter and, along with Hazel Levesque and Frank Zhang, two demigods who happened to be on guard duty outside the Camp, he manages to defeat the Gorgons. Although Reyna, the Praetor of the Camp, is initially distrustful of Percy, she allows him to join the legion on a probationary basis and assigns him to the Fifth Cohort. It soon becomes clear that life amongst the Romans is just as complicated and dangerous as life with the Greeks and so Percy doesn't get to enjoy his safe haven for long. After the Fifth Cohort win the Camp's war games, Mars appears and orders that Percy, Frank and Hazel embark on a quest to the North to free the imprisoned Thanatos and so restore order to the underworld.<br /><br />The Son of Neptune is another excellent adventure story from Rick Riordan. While Jason Grace is a great hero, Percy Jackson is even better and so it is wonderful to be able to follow his adventures once again. The quest to free Thanatos involves lots of thrills and spills and so this story contains all the excitement that fans of Percy's previous outings will expect. As well as the action there is also plenty of humour, wit and the occasional dire pun. The story and the characters of The Son of Neptune result in a fascinating mix of Greek and Roman mythology as the fantastical worlds of the various demigods collide.<br /><br />Aside from Percy, a number of other family faces and fan favourites pop up with delightful effect in the course of The Son of Neptune. Several interesting new characters are also introduced. Hazel Levesque and Frank Zhang are the most important of these as they, as well as having their own mysterious back stories, accompany Percy on the quest and actually share the narrating duties with him. Hazel is something of a tragic figure who has experienced more than her fair share of sadness although she possesses great power and bravery vital to the success of the quest. Frank has his own curse to bear and, while more obviously strong that Hazel, he is perhaps the most vulnerable of the three heroes. Despite this, he has a sense of duty and a loyalty to his friends, as well as a tendency to be amusingly klutzy, that makes him particularly endearing. A new favourite though has to be Ella the Harpy, a useful bookworm, an amusing linguist and a total scene stealer. Hopefully she will play a larger role in future books in the series.<br /><br />Like all good adventure stories, there are also several nefarious villains involved in The Son of Neptune. While the Gorgon sisters and Ma Gasket are all on the humorous side, Gaia is as menacing as ever and Polybotes is certainly not to be messed with. Even Octavian looks like he might shape up to be a dangerous foe for Percy.a fascinating mix of Greek and Roman mythology as the fantastical worlds of the various demigods collide.<br /><br />Aside from Percy, a number of other family faces and fan favourites pop up with delightful effect in the course of The Son of Neptune.

B00ESB75FA|3.0|The show just isn't as good as it was. Now a rather weak story that seems to putter along to its drawn out conclusion.

Let alone finds someone who would want to marry that.

B0000261TE|5.0|My favorite 'Journey' albums are the first two...the 'pre' Steve Perry projects.  Basic 'four/four 'rock & roll' being lead by the amazing guitarist, Neal Schon...So when I decided to procure this 1996 effort by Mr. Schon with help from some of his old 'Bay Area' buddies and Jonathan Cain, I figured I would be filing the CD in the 'R&R' section of my collection...possibly the 'blues' section.  After listen to it, I slid the CD into my 'Jazz' section.  This is a beautifully produced collection of music that shows Neal at his smooth...seemingly effortless...best.  Take the time to slip on a set of headphones, close your eyes and take a very pleasant 'audio ride'.  DO NOT make a decision about buying this CD based on your opinion of 'Journey'...be it pro or con.  If you want to experiance one of the best...if not, the best...guitar players to come out of the 'Bay Area' plying his trade with the help of some friends...then get this CD and know you will have 'no regrets'.

B002WV5A9G|5.0|I think it's one of, if not, the best Star Trek movies.  The actors must have studied hours of the old shows to get the mannerisms characterized by the original actors/characters.  Just the bomb.  I've watched it so much, I know the dialogs to most of the movie.

B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I've listed to Eminem forever, and he's still my favorite rapper right now.. but my favorite Eminem album is the Eminem Show, where he was probably at his peak, followed by this one.  It took me awhile to like this album, but I really think its very good material.  He pokes fun at a few old songs, raps about his ex again (which come on that should be dead and over by now).  It doesn't seem to be his best work, but its pretty close.
B00BATG18K|3.0|This book is a cruel disappointment.  Amy Tan is an author who has established herself in large part with stories of mothers and daughters.  I have no problem with her revisiting this concept, but I missed a spark between the duo in this book.  This book is set in a courtesan's house in Shanghai of the early 1900's.  While this is an elegant, first class house, of course the courtesans all have tragedy leading them to this place.  Violet, the madame's daughter has grown up believing she is American which she views as superior to her Chinese acquaintances.  Lulu, her mother, gathers her mysterious past close.  As the book continues, Violet discovers she is in fact half Chinese, and through trickery gets left behind as a courtesan in another house.<br /><br />The setting of this story could not be more intriguing.  However I feel its promise is robbed by characters unable to speak authentically through the mannerisms of the age.  The terms describing the trade of the courtesan are couched in the phrases authentic to the period, but the emotions of the story are lost in stilted terms.  I know from dozens of novels that this failing is not intrinsic to the vernacular.  Added to this problem is the fact that Violet is just enough unsympathetic to make her predictable and boring.<br /><br />Descriptions of the setting and era themselves are fascinating.  The clash of native Chinese with the foreign settlement is instructive.  The world of viewed Shanghai as an international city when, in fact, it was really a group of villages living as a town.  Within this milieu, the clash of the American mother with her &#34;Eurasian&#34; daughter is the more poignant.  Certainly the plot is entrancing enough to carry me through 600 pages, but the regret of fallen Promise still stings.

B0056FMNYA|3.0|I price-matched the B-Grip here and purchased at local BB. Overall, it's a good design and the materials seem to be solid and it's made in Italy! :)  However, it can't hold up with full frame body with grip and heavy pro lens (and not design for flash). I tried the B-Grip with D700+grip+70-200 2.8 or even the shorter 24-70 2.8. The whole thing tipped off to my side. It's very uncomfortable and unstable to carry and walk around. I was afraid to damage the lens mount due to the downward pointing position and the pull at the battery grip and body. It got better without the grip, but still not comfortable to walk around.<br />I returned the B-Grip and got the Spiderpro Holster and it's a much better way to carry heavy gears at the waist level. It's comfortable and I can release the camera quickly. The lens is not pointing downward and can add a flash too. It costs 2-3X more than the B-Grip but I think it's worth it for heavy equipments, and especially good for events/professional use. Nonetheless, the B-Grip is good design for smaller DSLR and light weight prime lens.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Much better than some of the other games of this genre that I have played. The small images are not that much of a challenge once you get the concept, and the big ones are a challenge. Lots of options so you can be as hard on yourself as you want to be.

B000063JBY|4.0|I'm not an expert on EDM, so my review is from the standpoint of a casual listener. From that POV there is one extremely interesting thing to say about this album - it has stood the test of time. 18 was considered an interesting, fun album to listen to when it first came out and it is still an interesting, fun album. I bought the four best reviewed Moby albums and made a KILLER disc of my own of the best songs culled from all those records. Many of my favorites came from this disc, and that's saying something considering how good the other discs are.

0553062182|5.0|Wow. Wish I had known about this among time ago. Since I was a teenager I started noticing that I was more sensitive than others to noises and sensations. Ticking clocks, clothes that are are a wee bit too tight, shoes that aren't shaped right, little sounds and distractions that most people easily ignore - I have been haunted by for many years. Never did I know that it meant that I simply had a more sensitive nervous system than the average person. I used to think there was something wrong with me because of it! Now, I realize these are normal, although not \\"average,\\" but also that my sensitivity is also the same reason why I am a talented artist & poet & designer. I'm able to read into a person or a place, and follow my intuition in a way that somehow creates magic. This book has helped me see that! And I'm so glad the Highly Sensitive Person subject has been breached!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super challenging and addictive. Keeps your mind spinning. Can't wait to get to the next level and the next! Keeps me up way past my bedtime.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book can only be described as beautiful. I mean it. I have read some seriously good books in my time, and this easily makes my top 8 (Hey, 1-7 are the Harry Potters) as one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />There are several things that I want to talk about in this review, starting with the story.<br /><br />The story was fantastic. It was about a girl with thyroid cancer (I think. Lost my copy before writing this review. Typical.) Who meets this drop dead GORGEOUS guy at her cancer support group. It's love at first sight for him (as is revealed at the end of the book), but it really takes her months to feel that way about him. When she does start feeling that way for him, they're in Amsterdam, there to meet their favorite author. A few weeks later, something inevitable for many cancer patients occurs.<br /><br />The writing was even beter than the writing on &#34;Before I Fall&#34;. My only complaint is how much cursing there was. Even though I'm 14, I HATE cursing. But, I guess that I can overlook it.<br /><br />The love story was very well written, though it does get a tiny bit mature at one point. Younger readers should skip that scene.<br /><br />The ending. God. When it was coming, I saw it, but it was still heartbreaking. It made me cry for days after.<br /><br />If I could give this 100 stars, I certainly would.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I enjoyed parts of the book - but the ending was abrupt and a total letdown. Not sure what the author was thinking with that weak ending. Readers beware.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A fantastic piece of science fiction. Wish I had read this 20 years ago, but better late than never. Great story and I love Cards writing style.
B00COWOXGE|5.0|A classic, this is one film that I can watch over and over again. Great performances from the entire cast.
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|Eminem's journey as a rap artist,seems to have reached it's conclusion in: The Marshall Mathers LP 2! At 41, he has nothing more to prove, except maybe the title of oldest rapper around. However, this newest(Hopefully, final) studio album from Eminem is maybe one of the most unique rap albums ever?<br /><br />The lead single(Berzerk) is one that takes getting use to. However, it was still a major hit & proves that Em' still knows how to give us Slim Shady.<br /><br />The track Survival is a rock anthem type of track that talks about Em' staying power & why he has intentions to push his rap career forward.<br /><br />The standout cut to me is a song called \\"Headlights\\" in which Eminem finally offers an apology to his estranged mother Debbie Mathers, for years of abusive rhymes put on very public display most notably in \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" from The Eminem Show.<br /><br />Overall \\"The Marshall Mathers LP 2\\" succeeds(less as a sequel to the 2000 blockbuster\\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\") & more as a follow-up record to his previous worldwide hit\\" Recovery\\"<br /><br />At age 41, and a huge musical legacy behind him.Although this new Eminem album is another classic for him. It might just be time for Em' to hang it up for good. Rapping is a young man's game.
B00CXQL828|5.0|There is no chaining up these dogs.  Can't believe there are only a 3 piece and what a 3 piece it is. These dogs howl.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I thought this book was absolutely fantastic! Not going to lie though complete mind-f***!! Be prepared too be completely shocked and awed! I would recommend this to someone with some time on their hands, because you won't want to put it down!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is a great CD, you will not want it out of your player.  The heaviness of the recording is very profound.  The drums and bass and heavy and set the tone for the guitar work, which is great btw!  Michael's vocals are amazing, can't believe this guy is 50 and still blowing the ceiling off.  I have been a fan since the beginning (yellow and black attach), seen them over 20 times live, have meet them...this CD is the icing on top of the Yellow and Black striped cake!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I've had this app for a whole day now and I have to say it's the easiest and most fun way to browse one of my fav sites on kindle fire. DON'T try to use your web browser on your kindle, just get this app... Less of a headache. The only glitches I've ran into.after my short time using it was the fact that sometimes boards or pictures take a few moments longer to load (nothing crazy annoying, just a few seconds or almost a minute at worse) and the app will crash every once in awhile. But it litterally takes a second to restart and brings you right back to where you were before. So, overall, I would definitely say those app is worth the memory space. I mean it IS free so the subtle glitches aren't so annoying that it makes your experience horrible a<br />or a good excuse not to use the app. I would definitely say my obsession has been rekindled!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun game with excellent graphics.  Unfortunately around level 25 you will start running out of moves and have to retry, which you can only do few times before they charge you to continue.  No thanks, I'll just use another app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love those game because you get to ride on the subways and do a lot of cool stuff that is fun
B00BD99JMW|5.0|From the first sentence to the final one, a fast paced read. With wonderful characters that pull you into their story.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|This is a strange one, on one hand McCartney's obviously trying to make a great album and has many personal improvements, but somehow it doesn't quite deliver greatness. First, this follows his last album of new material, Electric Arguments, which is arguably his best solo album, so that's always hard to do. On NEW, he sounds great singing and the music is alive for sure, more original rock songs than anything he's released since the 70's. He's also pushing himself lyrically more than usual which he always desperately needs to do and those two things elevate it from most of his albums. But it's the songs that are what last, so what do we have...<br /><br />The great: New, a very Beatlesque catchy song. A little slight on lyrics, but the lines \\"don't look at me\\" repeated and the closing modest crescendo are great. Can bring tears to eyes of real fans. It's the best track on the album and nothing matches it, so that's always a little let down. Some complain it's too like Penny Lane... who are these fools?<br /><br />The good: Road, Appreciate, Get Me Out of Here (bonus track), Alligator (cliche, dreary guitar work on this one bogs it down though, could be great with better treatment)<br /><br />Average: Early Days (nice, but overrated), Hosanna, Looking at Her, I Can Bet (Wings '76, if you like that, Beatles '66 would be better!), Save Us (a pop rock 'single,' so that's a good road to hear him go down, but it is generic; co-written with Producer whose average skills delivers an average song)<br /><br />Below average: Queenie Eye, lame chorus, pulled from a kid's game, a literal McCartney nursery rhyme. Think \\"Get Back,\\" but with 'Patty-Cake Patty-Cake' as the chorus; On My Way to Work, what should be a b-side song, but with a pretty nice guitar solo; Everybody Out There, ok chorus effect to his voice, but the verses are repetitive and too trite.<br /><br />His late career renaissance has given us many good albums and is arguably his best period, post-Beatles: Run Devil Run, Driving Rain, Chaos & Creation in the Backyard, and Memory Almost Full. He may be entering another period (to go along with new marriage) and his work is on an even higher level with Electric Arguments and NEW. Hope he never dies or gets too old or ever stops making music.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't stop reading! The characters seem like every day people who you can relate with...except the complex webbing of their lives is the great surprise. The author did an amazing job at intertwining every character's lives, which lead to several reveals that will shock and entertain you!
B000002C2E|5.0|While not immediately accessible, this album is a slow moving leviathan. Really, the best collection of song writing I've ever heard. Who else could have given us this album? A truly great artist delivering what people could only hope he would ever do again. It may not be the young Bob spewing out generation turning anthems, but it's still fantastic music... a deep, sad album to ruminate with. I'm not always in the mood for it, it's that kind of album, but if your heart's ever broken or you're experiencing some kind of profound loss, I defy you to not get lost in this album. It's like the best friend you'll ever have to commiserate with... Haha, oh thank you gods of music for sending this guy our way.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I really loved the way this book was written. I have already seen the show prior to the book, so it was quite interesting to compare the two, as they are not identical. Piper is a great writer and dives into the crime she committed pretty much immediately, which made the book interesting right off the bat. I definitely recommend it!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|An amazing story that everyone should know. To have her strength and conviction I Written very well,<br />S truly incredible
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I don't think this review is even necessary but I just have to say how fantastic of a writer Anthony is and you cannot miss reading this book. It's a classic!
B00D4FDNIO|4.0|Nice mix of classic UK house and new house. Great first album can't wait to see what's next from these two brothers.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Loved the first movie; JJ Abrams and company brilliantly updated the Star Trek franchise in the first movie -- if you saw and enjoyed the first movie, you will be pleased with this second outing.
B009HEMJCW|4.0|I stumbled across this movie on tv several years ago and really liked it. So I was happy to see it on Amazon Prime. It is a very sweet movie overall but at times to want to wring the mother's neck and snap Edwards....watch it and you'll see what I mean.
B00B49GSOS|5.0|Excellent production (of course), very close to the book -- looking forward to the second movie, which ought wrap up the storyline.
B00FWLTPU8|5.0|The kind of Sci-Fi I'm into. It's right up my alley. When I was a kid, I spent hours watching Godzilla movies. Kids love it too. They sit on their kindles watching it until I force them off. LOL
0670024856|3.0|I love her writing. The history and science was fun. All I can say was the story had some odd twists to it.
B0087X728K|5.0|The price for the compound is great, the shipping was fast, and this paste is the best and only I'll ever use on a pc.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|It was a very good movie that kept you engrossed in the struggles. I am looking forward to the sequel
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Super easy to connect, works great for streaming stuff from the net to TV.  My favorite feature is actually the &#34;beta&#34; function that allows one to stream browser contents to TV.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game is amazing i played the demo and i loved it if i could i would give this game a 6/5 stars get it
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This album blew me away!!  It not only evoked major emotion within me, but also the true metalhead within me.  Couldn't stop rockin' out.  This is definitely Stryper's \\"divine\\" masterpiece  :-)
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|With each consecutive album, the guys from alter bridge branch out farther and farther from their old days and sound. They write increasingly heavier music, yet also more melodic. Each song is an epic in its own. Wether the song begins softly then blows up into a heavy hitting riff or super fast Verse or of the song starts heavily and adds a soft, almost Led Zeppelin-Esque bridge, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />This is by far their best album, which I believe was not going to be possible after AB III.
B00902AKK4|2.0|Controls Are stiffAnd Awkward For A Game Which Appears To Be Directed At Younger UseRs. AlsoWhatTheHeck IsWrongWithAmazon's InteractionWithSwype???<br /><br /> Uninstalled. Yay.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's sooooo addictive it took me at least 20 minutes for each puzzle but was worth it it was really fun
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Always top notch! I just love these authors. I have never been disappointed. I can't wait for the next one!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|hey facebook is a really good way to get a hold of your family,or friends. you can post thing that happen in your life ,or your how you day was.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|ABSOLUTELY one of the best shows on TV today.  I LOVE Castle.  Own every season of this series.  I appreciate not having to see a lot of blood and cruelty.  It is a joy to watch them solve the mystery.  The cast has a great chemistry.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is one of the best weather apps that I have used. Thank you for it !!<br />I have been looking for several years for a good weather app and it was right under my nose.
B00A757EFW|1.0|This sucks.  It's only let's you get past  one level before it stops.  I am going to uninstall this.  If these google products would support flash there are many free Pac man/chomp games for free  all over the web.
B007FSF1FE|5.0|Great album by Mac. Some new sounds infused with his old styles make this a must-have for any fan. You won't be disappointed by this album.
1451666179|5.0|Do not read this book if you have a headache; it really hurts to laugh that much when you have a headache. Do not read this book if you have a full bladder; it's really embarrassing to laugh that much when you have a full bladder. So take some aspirin,sit on the toilet,and definately read this book! I know what I'm getting everyone for Christmas this year,but I may have to include a few emergency supplies...
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I've read a lot if books but this one is the first to surprise me. Definitely worth your time and money.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is in severe need of more levels. It is interesting and fun and can be at times challenging, but i was finished with all of the levels in no time at all.
B0093X80VQ|5.0|I live this book spool much and a lesson in this book is not to stop because of the risk you are taking!
B005HSL626|3.0|Great stress reliever when what you really want to do is hack someone's gourd off. But we are adults and we know better. Hence Fruit Ninja.
B00BXDOSXS|2.0|Didn't work for me on my Kindle Fire, so I've removed it. Could be that I don't have that many videos on my Kindle, but I was disappointed in the software's performance.
1449437524|4.0|Funny, but a little on the short side. I was hoping there would be more than the original web comic in the book, but there isn't.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Love David Attenborough's voice-over!  This is visually stunning, wonderfully descriptive, and captivating all around!  If you want to be amazed at the world around you, this is HIGHLY recommended!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Intrigued by the Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game movie trailers, I decided to read the book before seeing the screen version. I can't believe I haven't read his work before. I now see why the series has so many honors and awards. It was totally captivating. It is one of those rare novels where the ending was even better than the story, which was fascinating. The book did, in my opinion, have one flaw. (Which lowers my rating to 4.5 stars) I could not suspend my disbelief concerning the children's ages. I compensated by ignoring the author's words and adding three years to everyone's age. That done, I throughly enjoyed the story.  After finishing, I noticed that this is a quintet. I will start the next story immediately.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is a really awesome box set for a true fan and we would highly recommend it. The photo does not do the packaging justice. The case is actually a book with photos and such.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Couldn't put it down!!  Can't wait for the next book to find out where it takes us in the lives of Gideon and Eva!!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|The Duolingo app is based off of the website with the same name. It currently has lessons in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and English. This is a complete course that teaches you a language in bite sized pieces with a fun method. You start at the bottom of a tree and work your way to the top where you can win a trophy. By the time you are done with your tree you will have 1500 words from the target language in your vocabulary. You'll able to read and write in the language and maybe even enjoy some television.<br /><br /> How do I know? I've completed my Spanish tree and am now brushing up. I'm currently level 17 in Spanish. Yes, you level up, because this is a game-like environment designed to inspire you to try harder to learn faster.<br /><br />Duolingo can be free FOREVER because they use translations provided by users to sell to companies like CNN. You are providing a service (translating) in exchange for getting a service (learning a language).<br /><br />If you want to learn a language fluently on your tablet get this app and the Memrise app (which is also based off a free website).
B00G32OER4|5.0|Way scarier then the Exorcist. Recommend this movie to everyone that loves scary movies! Don't watch at night especially alone!
B003ELKNH2|4.0|Brought back the old days.  It was good seeing Mr. Sheen in action although it probably took him in the wrong direction for future movies.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Cute movie, i have read the books so it made more sense to me, I think that if you didnt read the book or never been pregnant it would be irritating as the girls are very dramatic. Overall i enjoyed it, made me laugh!
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|after a few hours of gameplay, logged off for a bit. when I got back on, none of my advancement had been saved. fun,but pointless when always set back further than when you quit
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love the show!! Can't wait till Sunday again! This last week was a bit slow but I'm sure this week will pick up!!
B002I0J5FG|4.0|Two great games in a single package.  &#34;Shadow&#34; looks good reformatted for the PS3.  Overall, the two games together are a great value.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I downloaded this to my kids tablet and they really like this game. Very simple item to review. Its a good app
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I downloaded this to my kids tablet and they really like this game. Very simple item to review. Its a good app
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Normally I don't review if I really hate a book, I was brought up on the if- you- have- nothing- nice- to- say philosophy. For ALLEGIANT, I feel compelled to forewarn people. This book is downright insulting to fans of Roth's previous novels. The prose is atrocious, the voice dead, and the plot missing. I have serious doubts that Roth even wrote it and if she did it was over a weekend. Why the editors let this out is beyond me, except they will still make oodles of money and I guess they don't really care about nurturing her career.<br />I couldn't finish, I abandoned the book, something, I almost never do. What a shame.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George has done it again! Characters you love to hate, then appreciate, then hate all over again, woven into a complex tale of thin loyalties and war for power. A must read- just be prepared to spend a lot of time in Westoros!
B003XF1OJK|4.0|Good, detailed backstory into the HALO universe. It's a difficult task to create a book series on an existing video game canon but the author does a great job balancing all the characters and story into a cohesive tale.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game. So happy it's finally on kindle fire. I'm addicted and now I see y every one plays it
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This album is a gift from above that just may deliver quality metal back to the mainstream. Whether you've been listening to Stryper for the last 30+ years, or just heard about them for the first time... this album will blow you away.
B009KKLQVS|5.0|A gift for my husband who loved, loved, loved this. We  may be old but the music still makes us feel young. Classic Beach Boys!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|More to come, my son and I enjoy watching. The Series has been on  for years, used to watch long ago!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I use it without a problem on both my laptop and my android phone.  I just wish you could add/edit ID3 tags for all the mp3 files in this app.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|any book of Malcolm Gladwell I buy and read immediately. He has such an interesting way to look at things from a very different angle. The research and facts are well done as well. You might not agree to everything he writes but the narrative is colorful and so easy to read. that you only stop once you arrive at  the end. definitely a page turner!
B001LM1456|3.0|Solid movie, better than Hulk. Not the best of the Marvel movies, but it gets the job done for me.
B00821OX98|5.0|FS does a great job in getting you involved with the characters. Plus it doesn't skimp on the special effects.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is the most attractive weather app I've seen. Good looking and informative with a wide variety of data at your fingertips.
B00E7Z7D2M|1.0|To hit the market just one year after the release of Black Radio 1 (a classic) sounds like the record company was quick to push out a follow up. Add as many R&B &#34;names&#34; as possible, water down the playing (where's Casey??) and sell it as a R&B release. Listened to it once and gave my copy away. This is what's wrong with the music industry...profit trumps artistry. Too bad, the guy's got incredible talent. Too bad we don't get to here it on Black Radio 2. Buy the trio CDs instead.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read all three books and I loved them.  I think I will read them again.  Can't wait until the movie comes out.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|After I missed several episodes, I decided to make the purchase here.I love Norman Reedus and Andrew Lincolns on screen awesomeness in the zombie apocalypse!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|this albumn is very easy listening and very clear.this is also quite leyed back .<br />Josh Groban has a lovely tenor voice-all very relaxing

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game to play but challenging at the same time.  You have to have some strategies and luck to win.
006202406X|1.0|I don't even know where to begin with this book....the first two books were amazing, and it's almost like another person was writing this last book. It was the most disappointing book I've ever read..in my entire life..and I'm almost 30. There were so many things about the &#34;big reveal&#34;, aka genetic defects, that didn't make sense, there were quite a few holes in the storyline overall, and there were some things that seems to be introduced and never discussed again, like some of the characters that didn't really serve a point (Zoe=who cares??). But, what I am most upset about, as about 95% of people seem to be, is the seemingly senseless death of Tris. Why did she have to die? She is built up to be this amazing girl who survives sooo many things, only to be shot by a man in a wheelchair after surviving the death serum? Why didn't her brother run in and save her? That would have made sense to me, because he would have redeemed himself in saving her, and she would have lived. I can think of many other ways this could have ended, and the way Roth decided to end it was the worst possible way!! I can be ok with characters dying in the end of a book if it makes sense, or if its necessary, but this wasn't. And the few people who actually liked this ending are saying that you can't always have your &#34;happily ever after&#34;? Just because they could have lived doesn't mean that it would have been a happily ever after...Tris would have had to grieve over the loss of her parents, and friends, and find her place in this new world, and Tobias would have had to make amends with his mom and deal with the departure of  his dad, as well as the loss of friends....their life wouldn't have been easy, but they would have been together, and I think that's what people should have gotten out of this book. If I could give zero stars I would, or maybe a generous .5 for effort....no, I wouldn't actually. Hollywood, if you're reading this, know that I wont go see any of the movies until the last one comes out, and I see what you've done with it...you had better change that ending to one where neither Tris or Tobias die, otherwise you will have a sad sad turnout for this movie series.
B003UESJEM|5.0|Recommended by a friend - EXCELLENT movie - excellent acting, etc. Great stars and excellent storyline - very apropos in today's work environment!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I just downloaded the update, I like it much better than the old one.  The pictures are a bit sharper, and accessibility is improved.  I thought that I had lost all the puzzles I bought,but I noticed a button, on the top left, to redownload my purchased puzzles, and there they where.
B007Z58RLC|5.0|If you are on a search for self and you haven't read this book yet I highly suggest that you do. Regardless of what stage in like you may find yourself at you will find reflections of your own life in this book, and you may find hints to your future path.
B008Y70TMK|4.0|Its a classic film for the 80's that highlights the hijinks of the era.  Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd at their finest
B008Y212PI|4.0|A fun and addictive game. Great time passer. Starts out too easy but as the grids get larger the puzzles are more challenging. I love it!
B008ENA74E|4.0|I thought this would be a dry but informative book- how wrong I was! It captures emotions that we all share in addition to opening our eyes to what is still going on in the caverns of Wall Street which affects us all.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I don't like this app and give it only 2 stars.<br />First off, it wouldn't work right for me.<br />Didn't seem to like running on my Kindle Fire<br />so I deleted it from my cloud.<br />I just found it to be a waste of an app.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I am not a huge fan of YouTube so this app<br />didn't do much for me. It didn't always work for me<br />so I deleted it from my Kindle Fire.<br />I didn't get much use of it so I give it 3 stars.<br />it's not bad. Just think it's OK.
B00A757EFW|5.0|5 stars for Pac Man. I love this app.<br />Brings me back to the days when I use to love<br />playing those big video games in bars and also<br />at arcades. It's a smaller version but is the same<br />affective challenge as the original games.<br />I enjoy a challange once in a while and who better<br />to challenge than myself?
B003G4W49C|4.0|Enjoyed Ender's Game.  Read it in one day. Looking forward to the movie and the rest of the quintet of books.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Excellent story line. Unique science fiction roles for gifted children with a well thought out plot with a satisfying ending.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The book was well researched.  Telling the two stories and using a modern day teen, made it even more interesting.  Just shows that history repeats itself despite our best intentions. I have already recommended it to several people. Would be especially good for book clubs.  The book has many discussable moments.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Well I haven't actually tried it out yet but based on what I've read it sounds great thanks for all the reviews without them I wouldn't know if I should get it or not
B00G32QIEG|4.0|It was an ok movie, pretty bland plot and predictable outcome, but entertaining hour and a half of my time.
B002VWNID6|4.0|Cheesy, yes.  But I don't really care.  A good retelling of an old story.  Worth it for Snape as the Sheriff.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|First the app forces me to update and then decided not to open after the update.. So upset with this app right now.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game is so addictive. I love that I can play it on my kindle without internet and it saves my progress till I get some where with internet to update.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I got this  pro app free as the free amazon app of the day. Before that I had the free version and liked it. The pro is great. It does everything I need it to.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I do like the game and think it's fun. But I am having trouble finding the rules b/c I just don't get why I can't move forward. It tells me, I think, that I need more pts w/one of the birds but I can't figure out how to get more pts w/just that bird. So until I can figure that out I can't play forward which is too bad b/c I really just started. But what I played I did enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really good game,but people can hack the game,and there are apps,mainly aiming at hacking,there are also apps that people can use for hacks
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love the symbols and colors.  It is truly addictive and takes only a few minutes on each level so it is good when you have a short break.
B007XAYKX8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I did not know anything about MotoGP and now I do and it's really interesting. The director did a great job on the history and details of this sport. Highly recommended.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|Fantastic almost magic romantic evening of song and music in the port of Portofino.<br />Bocelli at his best. This album, for me, rates just behind `Live in Tuscany`
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|The craft quality is very smooth, light weight, and safe for kids. The design is very cute too. I like the way they insert something inside salt & pepper shaker to create sounds. My 2 yo son loves it! we have several Hape products and they always delivery good quality products!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good spectacle great special effects, cool bad guys, lots of action, a little hokey( as a comic book movie should be) great costumes and casting
B00E25KVLW|5.0|I've never used Ruby much less Ruby on Rails.  This was presented in such a way that helped me understand the basics and more.
B00AC8ZIXO|2.0|Not much to the movie, no great effects, weak story and acting, no real reason to watch this mess of a movie
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|A brilliant Bluray release of an incredible story!  Picture and sound, menu features and quality are to the max on this release!

B00F91SCXC|5.0|One of the Top 5 Zombie movie made in the last 20 years Brad Pitt acting was excellent, this movie need a sequel.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game n fun to play. Down side is you only have five energy things at a time, so u only have five fights at a time unless u buy more
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|I got this game as soon as I saw it. After beating the original a while back, I needed more. I just got what I asked for.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is a wonderful NDE book. While having her experience in heaven, she has such a wonderful feeling of love surrounding her when she connected with her loved ones who had gone before. It really made a deep impression on me and I felt the love of my father and sister who have passed away. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|I gave this 5 stars because it's fun.  I'm not a gamer, either, so it must be pretty user friendly.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book had its moments, but was missing a clear narrative like the other books. I found myself getting bored reading it. That said, it had some nice moments.
B000KUD2G4|4.0|Got rid of a pesky, hard to isolate, ground loop hum on my PC without degrading the signal as far as I can tell. Reasonable price. I'd say try this first before exploring the much more costly audiophile grade products.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very fun challenging time consuming game but hate having to wait for lives or constantly ask on Facebook (I get annoyed myself with all the game requests I get) so I don't wanna ask my friends all the time. Wish time between lives was less. Producers are more concerned on getting likes and some levels very hard to complete without power ups. They give you a few but in the long run you gotta but them:(
B00G4PX1MO|2.0|Yet again the title says &#34;KINDLE TABLET EDITION&#34; it shows up on my kindle's app store, but when I try to even look at it, my kindle says its not compatible!<br />I've played the first game on my pc. would love to give them my money and time for it on my kindle, but I guess they would rather just waste my time.
B0042AGNAK|5.0|Movie was much better than the majority of the reviews I had seen.  The plot and the acting were OK (not great).  The special effects were very good (and definitely cool).  Recommended.
B00FAIPDAE|1.0|Sound is ridiculously annoying, and the controls are impossible especially when I just want to exit the game after I accidentally start it.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|I have to admitt first that this movie isn't the best there is but it has the action and special effects to make up for it. Jamie Foxx played a good role. Loved that Tatum was awesome. Plot was predictable and it was a littke far fetched but I loved it. :D
6305428042|5.0|The DVD was in great condition. The kids and I have very much enjoyed the movie night after night and it has become quite the favorite
B008OOYALE|1.0|Dragon vale is way better.<br /><br />They TOTALLY ripped it off<br /><br />Don't get this game,it's bad.<br /><br />I'm telling you don't get it!<br /><br />Get dragon vale instead.<br /><br />Btw, dragon vale has an update where you can get light and dark dragons plus magic!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Sucks up a ton of space for nothing.  And not really free. I will stay away from glu mobile from here on out.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|we all like all things star trek and hadn't seen this movie yet. I loved it and watched twice already!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Bought for making beer bottles into drinking glasses. Haven't found a good enough method to make a clear break. tried boiling water/ice water, found better results with the tapping method. One light clean line is all you need! making my bottles into candles! takes time and patients and LOTS of bottles. Worth the money for a new hobby I think!
B008JFUNJQ|5.0|This year I became a fan of the Ender's Game books. I read Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow, Ender in Exile and Speaker for the Dead.  In anticipation of the movie Ender's Game, I also looked at a lot of the online material about the movie including trailer, clips, and interviews with the director and actors. The net result was that when I went to the movie the first night it was out I was so concerned about how close it would be to the books, what other people would think, if people who had not read the books would understand it, etc. that I missed a lot of detail and was not completely excited about it. I would have only given it about 4 stars.<br /><br />Last night - five days later - I went back to see it again. I went with the idea of just enjoying the movie on its own merits. This time, I WAS TOTALY BLOWN AWAY. Gavin Hood (the writer / director) in describing how it would be possible to condense a novel the length of Ender's Game into a two hour movie has said that some of the some of the thoughts or dialog in the book would have to be done by the acting through facial expressions, body language etc. This time I was very conscious of these subtleties. As a result, I understood the movie much better and even found myself becoming emotionally involved. Some of the intriguing literary / story devices include the bugger's hand being used as a weapon early in the movie and being used to wipe away a tear at the end. Of course, there's the famous line, \\"The enemy's gate is down.\\" that appears two at critical points in the film.<br /><br />Asa Butterfield does a really fine job as Ender. He has to supply a lot of those facial expressions and body language that Hood talked about. I found Asa to be an impressive actor in the Merlin series and in Hugo, but I think he was even better here. I was also particularly impressed with Aramis Knight who plays Bean. His kind of friendly, kind of all-knowing smile captures his relationship to Ender. If you've read Ender's Shadow, you have a better appreciation of what I mean.<br /><br />One criticism of the movie has involved the \\"aging up\\" of the characters compared to those in the books. Actors like Asa, Aramis and others still look youthful enough to convey the basic ideas of the book about young people in war and their ability to think strategically. It would have been very difficult to find much younger actors with the ability to meet demands and subtleties of these roles. Furthermore, characters like Ender age several years in the book. This would have been difficult to portray during a reasonable movie production schedule. As it was, there were problems associated with the actors' ages. The costume department had to design outfits like the Battle Room uniforms to \\"grow\\" with the actors over the half year required for principle photography.<br /><br />I was impressed with the visual quality of the film. It was \\"filmed\\" digitally in high resolution using Red Epic® cameras. I saw the movie both times in IMAX®. Some things were almost too clear. Hopefully the Blu-Ray version will capture much of this detail. The sound in our local IMAX® Theater was almost overwhelming. The picture on the screen was actually shaking at times from the noise of the rockets and explosions.<br /><br />Lest it appear that I am totally biased in favor of the movie, I feel obliged to point out a few things I find as shortfalls. One scene involves Bean being tied with a rope to execute a special maneuver in the Battle Room. In the Ender books, there is a lot of significance to the rope -- actually a special type of \\"line\\" - and how Bean came to possess it. A bit of explanation would have been useful in the movie. Just a few words to indicate that Ender built the raft used in the scene with Valentine would have been a nice addition. There have been a number of comments that there should have been more time and detail spent in the Battle Room. Personally, I concur with this. By the same token, I understand why peoplelike Orson Scott Card (the author of the books) were concerned that too much time in the Battle Room would be boring to some viewers.<br /><br />I am anxious to see the DVD of Ender's Game. I hope that there will be extra material showing more detail of the movie's production such as the special effects used in the Battle Room scenes. I hope we will get to see some deleted scenes, etc. If the film company keeps a typical schedule, this should be in the February / March time frame. Until then we will just have to wait. I do hope that we will be able to see some of the other parts of the Ender series in the movies too.<br /><br />The bottom line is, Ender's Game was really better the second time around.<br /><br />Edited Feb 22, 2014<br /><br />Now that I have seen the Blu-ray I can actually comment on that rather than just the movie itself. I still enjoy the movie and have watched it another three times - once with just the director's comments overriding the audio. As hoped for, there are some nice extras on the Blu-ray. Of particular note are the deleted scenes. Gavin Hood really wanted a couple (an extended good-bye scene when Ender leaves for \\"Battle School\\" and an extended scene of Graff persuading Valentine to pressure Ender to return to the military) to be included, but these had to been cut for timing and other reasons. I highly agree that they would have added to the movie.<br /><br />The second thing noteworthy on the Blu-ray is the audio. As I noted previously, there were some very impressive scenes during the Imax presentation. The Blu-ray does not disappoint. If you have a system with a good sub-woofer you will feel the rocket engines and explosions. This is now my \\"go-to\\" movie to demonstrate my home theater's sound system.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the Blu-ray and highly recommend it.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Love it and I will be buying more Gaga music. She has really outdone herself in this song and I admire her art, music and passion.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Good, no nonsense help guide for technically struggling e-authors. Examples are easy to follow. Perhaps covered elsewhere, it could use a graphic about how large pieces of written works are organized; is TOC before title page, intro etc. ( footnote as reference would be satisfactory)
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|I was very disappointed because I loved a Time to Kill but this isn't in the same league. There is no hero much less a character that I cared about. In fact, the characters were so unlikeable that I hated wasting my time with them. I ended up skimming the book to see if it got any better and it didn't. Plus, the plot was boring - there's nothing exciting about a will contest no matter how hard you try.
B0026IUXME|5.0|This review contains spoilers:<br /><br />The memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman form the basis of this brilliantly portrayed story, as a gifted pianist defies life and death odds in Nazi occupied Poland.<br /><br />The Pianist illustrates the depravity of supporting a death culture, as the consequences of it's evil means rapidly close in on Polish Jews living in proximity to the Warsaw ghetto.  As freedom is increasingly restricted by the Nazi invasion, the Szpilman family adjusts to each upheaval until they're faced with a threat to their existence.<br /><br />Throughout the horrifying ordeal, Szpilman's gift of music brings beauty and tranquility to his surroundings, whether expressed before an appreciative audience or within his own soul.  This inner solace is a refuge from the outward circumstances, exposing the futility of restricting human freedom, and the insatiable appetite for control.  As Szpilman's fight for survival is juxtaposed against the determination to murder, the opposing forces come face to face.<br /><br />Adrien Brody's performance is amazing.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|It was the most fascinating show. The characters were marvelous, especially Maggie Smith. The whole series just kept you guessing what would happen next.
1937053571|5.0|I don’t even know what to say, or write, about this book. About how much I have adored this series, how I have come to love it, and just how amazing the final book in the series was. I really can’t put my love for it into words. I can, however, say that it was a book worthy of drawing the series to a close, and it was everything I was expecting yet not.<br /><br />Sentinel was beyond amazing and everything I hoped and more. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Jennifer done a wonderful job at tying up all loose ends, shedding light on mysteries, blowing my socks off, and  bringing the series to a end. I experience so much reading Sentinel.<br /><br />Alex is indeed the symbol of strength. Throughout the entire series, this girl has shown me that she has true strength. She, in a way, taught me that everyone has an unbreakable strength within the core of them. Alex has always been one of my favorite heroines, strong, determined, stubborn, and a fighter. To see how far she has come from the first book to now, was beyond a doubt, wonderful. She really went through hell in her journey, but when I read the last sentence in Sentinel, I knew Alex got the ending she deserved.<br /><br />Aiden, to me, is the symbol of love. And boy, does he have a heart of love. I have adored, and crushed, on Aiden since the moment he appeared in the series. He swooned me, and made me melt into a gooey mess multiple times. He really is the perfect man for Alex. They bring out the best in each other, the perfect balance. And like Alex, Aiden has grown so much. And to see how far he has come since Half-Blood, it makes me realize what an amazing character he is.  His love for Alex literally seeps off the pages of the book, and I can feel that love so strongly. And the ending he got, perfect.<br /><br />Seth is the symbol of redemption. Though from the very start, I have not liked his character. He annoyed the every loving crap out of me; I can now say I do admire him.  Yes, he has his douche moments throughout the series, but  he has also earned my respect. He does some amazing things within Sentinel, things I did not expect at all, but was very happy to see. His growth, personal and emotional, really shows through at the end.<br /><br />Now, there are so many wonderful characters in this book. It is filled with some I love and some I like. They compliant the story and the main characters so well. I’m so glad I got to meet so many characters, Gods, pures, and half-bloods alike. Now, I cannot go without mentioning Deacon, who I wish I could carry around in my pocket. He is one character I know I will forever adore.<br /><br />The love aspect in this book is endearing. Beautiful, intense, heartfelt, and very gripping. It not only tests the characters, Aiden and Alex, but it tested me as well. I could feel the love they have for each other. And that was an amazing thing to experience.<br />I love you. I'm in love with you. Forever and ever, and all the corny things I can attach to that.<br />The book flows nicely, and the pacing was done just right. I wasn't expecting that ending for the book, but it was a ending that all the characters deserved. I LOVED it!! So much happens, so many adventures, battles, and moments that really made this a great adventure of a read. The building for the climax, though not extremely intense, still was wonderfully written. And of course  Jennifer’s writing is so addictive to me. She clearly, and vividly, paints the world, the characters, and the setting of her stories well.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I experienced so many emotions reading this book. Fear, wonder, heartbreak, joy, and pure happiness. I loved every second of it.<br /><br />It is always so bittersweet seeing a series you adore, fell in love with, and become so attached to, come to an end. But, in a way, the story isn't really over because I know I will pick this series up and read it again and again. I will once again experience the emotions, the wonder, and the love. The Covenant series is a series I will always adore, and keep close to my heart.<br /><br />Sentinel was a great ending to a wonderful series. And it was one hell of a journey! I enjoyed every second, and every emotion; I enjoyed everything about this book.<br /><br />Alex taught me everyone has true strength buried within them. Aiden showed me that love is the most powerful of emotions. And Seth showed me that anyone can be redeemed.der, and the love. The Covenant series is a series I will always adore, and keep close to my heart.<br /><br />Sentinel was a great ending to a wonderful series. And it was one hell of a journey! I enjoyed every second, and every emotion; I enjoyed everything about this book.<br /><br />Alex taught me everyone has true strength buried within them.

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|One of the absolutely best series on television.  I am experiencing withdrawal symptoms waiting for Season 4 (January, 2014).  The cast members SHINE, particularly Maggie Smith ... she is wonderful.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|After reading Sanderson's ending to The Wheel of Time series I started reading all his other books, and this one is my absolute favorite.  I've enjoyed his other books as well, he's a master at coming up with interesting magic systems and now it looks like he's setting up for his own ridiculously long (not a bad thing in my eyes) epic fantasy series.  The book is very long and comes along slowly at parts, but the characters have an interesting depth and the payoff is more than worth it.  Can't wait to read the next one.
0385366450|5.0|Just finished the unabridged version of Sycamore Row and loved every plot twist and turn.  Glad to welcome Jake, Lucien, and Harry Rex back once again.  I hope that Mr. Grisham is planning on more books in this series, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!!

B007THA4FI|4.0|I was about to give up on this book it started out so slowly. It was very frustrating - but my persistence was rewarded. The authors insight into the children's lives showed real experience with teenagers angst, and the unique way they see the world. The adults turn out to be shallow, while the kids live and learn.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun Game and very challenging!  The small boarded are pretty easy but once you get into the larger ones it gets challenging. I like that as I play it doesn't get easier.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This is probably one of the best books I have ever read. You would think that reading a teenager's diary would be predictable and boring, but that is not the case here. I'm not surprised that people have questioned the diary's authenticity. Anne is exceptionally bright (which makes you wonder how intelligent Margot is since Anne says she is the smart one) and a great writer. At times I was wondering if perhaps it was just the translators who made her writing better than it actually was. I don't think either of those are true though. You can tell by the way that she thinks that it is really her. Over the pages you can see Anne grow and mature. She is only a teenager, yet she is wise beyond her years. Despite her extraordinary situation you can see many of the struggles that are common to teenagers and all people.<br /><br />I especially liked the book because I felt like Anne shares a lot of common personality traits with me. I loved her honesty, she wasn't afraid to say it like it is or talk about things that would make some people feel uncomfortable. I feel like the way that our minds think and ruminate is something we share as well. There are also things like the love of nature that made me feel like we would have been good friends had we known each other. That is why her writing is so brilliant, she writes in her journal as if she is writing to her best friend, someone she can confide everything to, and it really leaves her mark on the pages. Her soul lives on through the profound words that she captured in her diary.<br /><br />At one point in her diary she mentions that she would like to be a writer some day, that she wants to do something that people will remember her by long after she is gone. Little did she know that her dream would come true, through an ordinary diary. Read this book! I know I will read it again.

B003XU7IFY|4.0|In this book Chomsky covers a wide variety of topics that all are related to power in some way or another. The style is interesting, it is basically a book full of transcripts from various talks he has given. Unlike a lot of books in this genre it is very easy to read and understand. He also provides a lot of citations and sources to back up his information. I learned quite a bit from this book, but at times I wished that there was interactions between Chomsky and those that may disagree with him. At one point he talks about how he doesn't want people to look to him for answers, but that is difficult to do, and in a way this book doesn't help. It seems like he is there providing the answers for you. He certainly has some good analysis, but I think we should also follow his advice and look into these things ourselves. This is certainly worth reading again.<br /><br />On a slightly unrelated note, I read this with my kindle and was kind of disappointed by the organization of the book. It didn't seem to know where the chapters started and began, which made it difficult for me to determine how much time I had left in a given chapter. However, this didn't really take away from the content.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|What a big disappointment, nothing like the first two films. This film was clearly meant for 15 year old boys with ADD,  jam packed with a disorderly compilation of unrelated action scenes one after another. It made no sense whatsoever! I had the feeling they decided to make this film because the first two made money and threw this together with all the gimmicks they could think of, absolutely awful.

You feel what he feels and what  the Jewish people went through, this is a must see film, you will never look at a Jewish person in the same way, and you will find yourself asking how can we as human beings be so utterly cruel to other human beings, it is quite a lesson in life.

0553378384|3.0|I find her analysis interesting but rather tedious!  In reading the one that pertains to my astrological positioning, it felt so negative at first as I read it in small segments.  I was inclined to feel like something of a reject!  LOL  But seriously, this author goes deep and at the same time, she seems to have to make a big distinction between the spiritual and the material as being two completely separate paths in life.  I have actually come to the conclusion, after having looked at it her way, that it's important to integrate the two together, rather than looking at the material as a culprit along the spiritual path.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Great movie, great cast. The first 30 minutes or so is the most memorable part of a movie that I remembered. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys military movies.
B00F880BWG|4.0|I'm not really a zombie movie kind of person but I am absolutely addicted to this series for some reason I still haven't figured out. I would have liked them to have varied the location a bit more. The prison is getting on my nerves and the characters remaining are getting aggravatingly weak. Even with this...I'm hopelessly addicted.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love every single one of the Hobbit movies. This one took a little bit to get to know the character Bilbo, but once I did, it was easy to enjoy!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|As I could have predicted it is not as good as Gone Girl in that it's not as well written. Despite Gone Girl's nonlinear plot it was still easy to follow. This book is easy to follow, but I was left thinking that some things were just made up on the fly. For example, it really bothered me that half-way through the book the narrator mentions casually that their home doesn't have air conditioning. Yet it is summer, she wears long sleeves, and she takes hot baths, and she just now mentioned that it was uncomfortable?!?! I was more interested in Amma and Adora. I found Richard annoying and I really was grossed out by her relationship with her boss. I don't know if we were supposed to accept that he was just concerned and loving but she doesn't come off as someone who elicits that kind of loyalty and concern. BUT, all that being said, it was a page turner and I was glad I read it. Also, it is nice to have a female character who is not consumed by her love for a dude.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|I love this movie! They don't make vampire movies like this anymore. A classic Vampire Flick. great quality on streaming! I
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book deserves five stares.  It was full of adventure and thrills.  I can't wait for the next one.  I hope a movie is made from this book and more are on the way.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game provides the player with more than enough challenge to keep her coming back again and again.  The Room stretches your powers of observation and logic to new levels.  In the moments when you stop to contemplate the next move, The Room resonates with creaking floorboards and a creepy growling voice that seems to be breathing over your shoulder.  Beautiful graphics and surprising reveals make this a truly wonderful game.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|it would be nice to be able to point it somewhere and get a pic.....as it is i have trouble putting the subject into the frame without being an acrobat.  is there a way to point it one way and look somewhere to see if subject is in frame?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this app is cool it gets harder<br />Witch I also like I think that If your bored you should play this
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|So enjoyed this game.  strategy is essential when playing and it sharpens senses.  I'm 70 years old and it is a wonderful tool to keep sharp, plus it's a lot of fun.
1118109791|5.0|Excellent book with a lot of great examples which really help you out when studying for the GMAT, since this is the only &#34;official&#34; book I totally recommend it
B007N5YIUS|4.0|loved the strategy of the game, but at times the ammo was touchy and went off before launch.  All in all it was a fun pastime.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very important and rewarding for me. I could play it all day but I run out of lives.
B009LDCXNY|3.0|Not what I was expecting from the description. Love the series so still happen to have gotten it but not for the price. Will stick to ebay.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Enjoy game, but coins are to hard to replenish.  Having to wait hours to only get 41 coins is crazy.  I get coin every 30 seconds if I am playing game.  I can not play this all day to get coins.  They want me to buy more coins.  I will not purchase coins for game where there is no reality.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love the game. graphics are great. its a fast pace exciting game. play for hours they are really funny and cute
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great product for travel. Very accurate. Would like to see voice activation. Should lower price to sell more. A must have.
B00902AKK4|2.0|I only got through part of the tutorial. It felt like I was about done with the tutorial when an acorn squashed me to death and I was sent back to the start of the tutorial. I could understand if a level did it, but the tutorial should be more forgiving than that. I didn't know acorns could kill my guy. Not worth playing in my opinion when I have to redo the tutorial. But the game looks possibly cute enough if not for that issue.
B006ZDS7CE|3.0|You should already know whether or not you like Lana Del Rey, and Amazon makes it pretty easy to form an opinion by listening to song samples. I'm kind of indifferent to her, but purchased the album because I enjoyed hearing Summertime Sadness on Top 40 radio this year. Problem? The song you hear on the radio is not the song on this album. Born To Die's version is lovely...but 80% of why I bought this is the remix version you hear on the radio, which is pretty different from this slow, dreamy song.
B00447L4JG|5.0|One of our favorite Movies!!! Shipping was as expected, on time. The movie was in great condition. We highly recommend this movie during the Halloween - Christmas season.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I won't add more comments about the music as it's already been said better than I could say it, but have you guys noticed the packaging of this release?  So not only did the band take the time and care to put the greatest material ever on this record, but the packaging of the CD is top notch in a world where cost cutting is rampant.  And has anyone mentioned the additional DVD that is included with the interviews about the making of the record as well as two  music videos?  I was blown away by this package and I will be buying extra copies to give as Christmas gifts this year.  Keep Rockin, Stryper!!!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Its a very good movie very well made really gets you into the experience what the family is going thru. Loved it
B00F2HW20M|5.0|Steve Hackett just continues to get better and better, both with his solo work and his successive revisits of old (classic) Genesis material, and this May 10th 2013 concert is amazing on many levels; musically, aurally, visually, as a performance, and as a labor of love. The 2+ discs of music (3rd disc only has about excellent 17 minutes of \\"Firth of Fifth\\" and \\"Los Endos\\" encores on it) are great with a fine song selection and appropriate sounding vocal support - a rather Gabriel-like Nad Sylvan much of the time, but also Jakko Jakszyk, Nik Kershaw, Amanda Lehmann, and John Wetton guesting on various numbers. The rest of the band is great as well (Roger King on keys, Gary O'Toole on drums and occasional vocals, Lee Pomeroy on bass and other guitars, and Rob Townsend on various instruments - horns, whistles, percussion, and keys - as well as excellent extra guitar support by Steve Rothery on \\"Lamia\\"), but it is Hackett's show after all, and he is great as a guitarist (electric and acoustic) and as host/band leader here. It is so nice to see him taking center stage in his unpretentious way, and bringing this music to the world today.<br /><br />This is a perfect concert (with nice and crisp audio and visual) - a creative set visually (lights and backdrop), with just a touch of playful showmanship (by Sylvan), but mostly just MUSIC, extremely well played and obviously appreciated! And a 27+ minute \\"Suppers Ready\\" finale, what more could you want?!<br /><br />Note - there do seem to be some production issues. As noted by another reviewer, \\"I Know What I Like\\" has a glitch on the DVD. Amazon issued a refund and replacement without question of course (which also skipped, and may explain why Amazon is so quickly out of stock as the label attempts a fix), but it is a shame for Hackett to have these issues. Anyway, although it may be worth waiting for a second pressing if you're the finicky type, this glitch does little to dampen the appreciation for this fine release. Thank you Steve.k you Steve.
B00CTT9646|3.0|The DVD is great. But I was a little disappointed with the finish ot the Limited Edition Phaser which came with the pack. The paint job could have been slicker and more refined. Reasonable quality but I would not call it &#34;Limited Edition&#34;.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|A Great rock and roll band: cool, hot, literate and real with heart & soul & \\"then some loss to even things out.\\"
1439170916|5.0|This book gave an astounding overview of cancer's history and the steps that have made to fight this disease. I would highly recommend it for anyone who desires to go into the medical field.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|British period drama at it's best, with a modern polish worthy of HD screens.  Can't wait for the next season.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is awesome, it has helped me with my homework and it made my dad happy, and the best part, it was free!!!!!!! I just wish that I had money for the full version.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I cannot believe how hooked I got with this book and the whole Silo Saga.  Howey is an amazing writer, very graphic in images as you read along.  It really sucks you in with a possible senario of the world in which this could happen.  Great reading.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I play this game all the time, and it is so easy to do. I beat it twice, and now I just go for all of the achievements so I can become bored and do something with my life. If only other was a Zelda game for Kindle Fire HD
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|The only reason I didn't give this only one star is because I didn't dislike it *so* much that I didn't finish reading it.<br /><br />Perhaps my problem was that I know too much about professional kitchens -- but I don't think so.  For example, I love Joanne Fluke's bake shop mysteries as well as Diane Mott Davidson's series about a caterer.  The thing is, they actually bothered to do research about what professional cooking is like.  The kitchens are right, the information about timing and baking schedules is right and -- perhaps my biggest issue -- the footwear is right.  No baker would come to work in heels, much less in strappy sandals with heels.  When I read that, my suspension of disbelief disappeared.  (And actually, in writing this, I'm not sure I'm willing to give this series even one star.)<br /><br />If the rest of the book -- the plot, the characters -- were better, I might be able to forgive the author's glaring lack of familiarity with her subject.  But it wasn't.  Nor was there enough book to even be called a true book -- perhaps, at best, a novella.  The only up-side of the whole reading experience was that I bought this on an extremely discounted Kindle sale.  Now I understand the discount.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book I think is wonderful. This book is very different than the movie. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy books.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|If you really can't draw (like me), then this app will works wonders on your doodles because of its amazing features and stuff.

B00E8S2JZ4|1.0|Great movie but it comes with Ultraviolet to watch digital copies.  With Ultraviolet you can't actually install the movie on your devices but you have to stream using their app and use up our precious data caps.  If you try and download with Flixster you have to install another program called Flixster app and can only watch with that app.  In addition you have to create 2 accounts with UV and Flixster to even stream all in the name of Copy protection.  An Hour later I still don't have a digital copy.  Guess What?  I can download the full Bluray ISO and import into itunes right away.  It is silly that i have to still download this movie even though I bought the Bluray with a digital copy.  It is not like copy protection actually stops anyone anyway.  Next time I will not buy the bluray if it has Ultraviolet or Flixster as the sole means of getting a digital copy.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|I got this game with my sister in mind and she loves it. There are so many different games to play in Dr. Panda's airport that your child will never get bored.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My three year old adores this game. It's fun to create crazy contraptions to accomplish the goals. definitely fun for all.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love Mahjong so i loved this game. Just a simple relaxing majong game with summer symbols. It was a great way to spend spare time.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Classic Jim Carrey and surprisingly sweet movie. This is probably the first time I've watched since it came out and I appreciate it more now. Carrey is a live action cartoon and wow, those clothes take me right back to the nineties.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|If you like subway surfers or temple run, this game is a lot similar. With its own spin on it, you run all over and try and collect bananas (instead of coins) .
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie!!! Wold watch it over and over again everyday. It would never get old. Can't wait till the next one is created!!!
B00B99KJR0|2.0|I was disappointed because on the beginning of my purchase i thought there would be a plot similar to that of the movie or maybe some extra puzzles or outside the box thinking to be necessary but this game is just like bejeweled and it was a waste. It did however go back and forth from the movie but the game has nothing to do with it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great story that keeps you addicted until the end, although I didn't love the ending... Every chapter is filled with new twists adding more suspense to the surprising turn of events.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|This game was very different than any other game, i have nothing to compare it to. However, it was fun to play and made me think very hard about my next move. I recommend this for people that have free time and don't mind thinking a little when they play games.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I almost didn't read it because of the bad reviews but I'm glad I did! Yes, I didn't like the ending. I felt like there were other ways that  there could have been a happy ending. There's enough pain and reality in the real world...we like to have our happy endings. I felt like this matched the rest of the series. Plenty of reality and heartache. Yes, it was repetitive but that was the point. With power comes corruption and they fought it the whole way and they did make a difference. I think that the same end goal could have been made, full of emotion, tension, and realism but without the depressing ending that was given. I do like the theme that ran through the last two books; the value and freedom that truth/information gives, and the damage that lies can do. I enjoyed this read...just would like an alternative ending. Read it.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I like this series but this was not one of the best. Nazis??? Give me a break. It was well written and entertaining but you need to suspend belief for the duration.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I am addicted to this game.  But apparently you have to purchase with money to continue.  What happened to free \\"apps\\".  I am with everyone else.  I would rather pay for the game upfront and play freely rather than have to pay continuously.
0525478817|5.0|This book was one of the most amazing books I have ever read and I absolutely loved it. By the time it was over it brought tears to my eyes. I fell in love with the two main characters Augustus Waters and Hazel.  Their relationship kept me interested and had me always wanting to read more. The way Hazel persevered with her cancer and never gave up was so inspiring. In the beginnng of the story Hazel was very vulnerable and was borderline line depression. She met Augustus at a Cancer support group and her life started to change.  She started to go out more just to see him. Hazel didn't have a negative look on life anymore now that she was spending her time with Augustus.  My favorite part if this story was when they took their Vacation to Amsterdam.  Hazel wasn't living like a cancer patient but instead she was living her life to the fullest.  She got to see what it was like to live without the stress of cancer. This book is something everyone young and old should all read because the lessons taught leave a message that I will never forget.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|fun. challenging not too easy. it doesn't make u buy stuff to get ahead. I have been playing it for 8 months

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|good book - well written - just not like a fav of all time or anything - enjoyed it more than i thought i would considering the topic although the story line is pretty far fetched in some areas - but that's fiction, right?

B007IXWL2C|4.0|First off let me say that I really enjoyed this series. I do have to say one bad thing about this book. I felt as I got further and further into the book that the author was trying to rush the ending. I would have loved for more details on her pregnancy. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed them! Very nice!!
B0036SUQWA|5.0|Great movie! I think the acting is phenomenal. The story is great as well. Apparently, based on a true story.
B00BRYDKM8|4.0|Very good and thorough resource for those new to public speaking!<br /><br />If you are an experienced speaker, then this book might not be for you in terms of looking for specific creative ideas and suggestions on how to add that little something extra for your TEDTalk or any other presentation you may have.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Great Movie with lots of action. Surprisingly dark and adult in subject matter (in a good way) though for a movie based on a comic book about mutants.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|It's the Beatles man! A ton of their best tunes. I bought it just for &#34;Let It Be&#34;. Such a simple tune, but such a deep message. Would have been great to come of age in their era.
B00C7607BC|5.0|I love this movie, and even though it doesn't have all the hi-tech features of the newer animated movies, it is still beautiful, with great songs and story line. Fortunately, the main feature performed flawlessly, but the bonus features were a different story. Some, I couldn't get to play at all, while others had hiccups that couldn't be cleared out. But I would have paid the price for the movie alone, and did get to enjoy some of the bonus features.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Nice. Generally uplifting tunes. Great voice. I love PHILLIP. He stayed true to his own style and deserves the win from Idol. Couldn't of happened to a nicer guy.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|Our book club book chose this book because of the high ratings. I was the first person to read the book and recommended that we choose another book to discuss. This book is self-help type book for people who are afraid to reach for their goals - nothing more. If you are a confident, goal oriented person, you don't need to waste your time reading this book.<br />The book was well written and an easy read.
0671449028|5.0|I would never have picked this book out on my own.  It was a gift.  It has become a staple in our bedtime routine for months now.  I like it because it is short and bright and probably easy for my 2yo to look at and understand what is going on.  We even use the \\"...with soap all over scrub, scrub, scrub....\\" line for bath time and hand washing. We have a few \\"pookie\\" books by Boynton and those are just as popular with my little guy.  Highly recommended!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love this show.  I heard good things about it, but put off watching it.  It's not available on Netflix but I found it on Amazon.  The writing is smart, although occassionally legally imprecise. The characters are interesting, likable and believable.  BE Careful... like all addictions, once you start it will be hard to stop.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|In the beginning, she has a very modern sound that has evolved with the times. Towards the end of the CD, her sound is your traditional Celine, which is the reason I love her music.
0811879542|5.0|My son LOVES this book!  There are not enough good things to say about, he asks to read it every night.  It really helped to teach him right/left.  He does get excited when he reads it, so maybe not the best night time book if your kids have problems going to sleep, but we read it before bed anyways, he just loves it so much.  He's 3, not sure if that helps.
B004TTMYQG|2.0|Great app but every other time I open it I need to sign in to Amazon, hence I don't use it anymore, I simply bring up the standard calender, I use a very strong password for Amazon so it's a pain even with keepass.<br />When your trying to quickly make an appointment as someone is standing there as you create the appointment and you get the dreaded pop-up that you have to log on to Amazon you look like a fool and waste people's time.
B009JVSAVM|1.0|decent deal, but only 4 of the 5  ended up working, (disc 1 and 2 in season 5 would not play. They had scratches right out of the box, PLUS there was a broken piece of plastic that fell out when I first opened the box,  making it not as decent a deal.<br />I Contacted seller, and they were not willing to do anything, but basically indicate that I might be not telling the truth about it. (They indicated the time to return was 2 weeks. . . . .I'm thinking that Only a person without any kind of life would be able to watch 5 SEASONS of DVD's in that amount of time.<br />So, I guess now, I have to re-buy Season 5, (definitely from different seller) making this a BAD deal/experience.  : (
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm glad that Kindle finally has this great game!! Since it syncs with my other devices, I can play for a while.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|Does not work properly... will freeze up then shut down. Have tried to remove then re-install and still didn't work. Unfortunately too much trouble to use.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Lots of action, good dynamic between the characters.  We enjoy the one liners thrown in from the original series.  This is a good movie.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Takes too long to connect to a video, a little cumbersome to work with and navigate the app. Decided not to use too often.
0804137501|5.0|I read \\"Remote\\" and I forced myself to stop before reading chapter 2. I HAD to buy more copies - to give to other people. I think the concepts in this book are so powerful, that most people won't understand how great this book is until they try working remotely. For those who already have some experience, it still has a lot of value pointing out how to improve communications, recruiting, and even company meetings among many other things. Any startup thinking about building a great team, should read this!. Large corporations would benefit a lot, at least trying some of the ideas in this book. My message for those who are doubting about buying this book: BUY IT!
B002CGSYNU|1.0|After going nervously weeks without a lens cap I finally found what I &#34;THOUGHT&#34; matched up with the replacement cap on Amazon.<br />All the specs matched up with the original box that I still have when I purchased the EP3! How am I suppose to know what's new & what's the old model or whatever and blah-blah-blah!?<br />Total waste of money as I shouldve gone to the original place of purchase to buy a generic cap in the first place, had I known that had generic caps. Oh well I guess I can always use it as a mini-frisbee.<br />Thank you!

1594203334|5.0|A wonderful companion book with &#34;French Kids Eat Everything&#34; on what's wrong with the American way of raising children and how the French get it right. I wish every parent was given this book the instant  they decide to children.

B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|While reading this book I kept expecting more, from the plot to the character development. Mae was so one-dimensional and hard to believe as a main character. I wanted some of the conflict in other characters' reactions to the Circle's increasing dominance over her life to get through to her but it never did.  I felt it was totally unbelievable that someone would allow their entire life to become public with no misgivings or doubts about it at all, even after it caused her to become estranged from her parents and friends. I would not recommend this book, very disappointing.
1455502758|4.0|“Mortality” is a very slim book containing the musings on an approaching death.  To the end, Christopher Hitchens remained the master polemicist.<br /><br />Throughout his life, Hitchens either enraged or engaged his readers. I was in the latter camp.  He had strong views on matters political and religious. He was never, repeat never, afraid to argue his point.  Like or hate him, the world needs more people like Christopher Hitchens.<br /><br />“Mortality” is never maudlin.  It simply consists of Hitchens’ observations about his approaching death.  He is stoic and does not fall to faith along the lines of there being no atheists in foxholes.  Indeed, in Hitchens’ own words:<br />“If I convert it’s better that a believer dies than an atheist does”.  Fighting words.<br /><br />I remember an interview with Hitchens from several years ago when asked how long he would pursue his foes.  His reply: “Until I drop”.  He was true to his word.

B003VANOFY|5.0|After looking at many options for a gaming headset I decided on this one.  It was recommended by multiple people and I'm very happy about how it's working so far.  It was a good price for wireless that actually works.  I can walk around my entire house and only loose the signal in a few places.  I assume the mic is clear as no one has commented negatively upon it and tests sound crisp.  I have noticed occasionally I can hear myself speak when using it with certain people on skype or no hotkey mode on teamspeak, but I suspect it has something to do with the person on the other end since it does not happen all the time.  It is in no way uncomfortable to wear for long gaming sessions or listening to music.  I wear glasses, so it's nice that I do not get irritated from the earphones pressing on my ears/glasses.  The sound quality is very nice.  And I really like the buttons on the earpiece for quick controls, as well as the feature that the mic auto-mutes when placed in the up position.  I have already recommended it to others!<br /><br />The only thing that I do not like is how frequently I find myself charging it, 2x a day some days.  There is a subtle pop up on your computer that warns you of the battery % when it gets low so you should never find yourself mid game and frantically trying to get the plug though.  I knew that frequently needing to charge a wireless (even when powering off when not in use) would probably be a factor in avoiding a chord this time and the notice from the software is handy, so I do not think this point knocks my rating down any.
B004XUMRBI|5.0|This is a FIRST class story, with absolutely first-rate writing and EXCELLENT chemistry between the various stars.  The ONLY dissatisfaction I have with the show was its mere 1 season run, followed by a 1 movie follow-up that had every bit as good of a cast and writing, but had a MOST unsatisfactory conclusion.  (Can't say why without spoiling it for any who haven't seen it.)  This SHOULD have been their A-list vehicle.  FOX not only COULD but SHOULD have had another Star Trek-caliber franchise on their hands but they were FAR too STUPID to grasp that.<br /><br />Aside from that, I don't know, but does ANYONE else think that spaceships should have LOCKS on the doors, or at least ones that are harder for invaders to access?  They are in hard vacuum after all!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm so glad that candy crush saga is finally on kindle fire. wonderful game,  its so fun. I just don't like the fact that you have to wait so long for more lives!!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Love Kay Scarpetta, Benton, Lucy and Marino! This series is one of the best, mystery and great characters can't be beat.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I read all kinds of books, fiction and non fiction, and this book took me by surprise. The way the author developed characters and the relationships between each was mind blowing. I would suggest this book to anyone who loves a big twist!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does what you need. Accurate, awesome and on point. It's an awesome app for everyone alike (even kids/teens). Consider adding it to your kindle.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Love these headphones. They have good sound, I can mute the TV, and turn them loud as I want. They will work for all TV programs if you run the output from the TV and not your game console.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy this game.  Happy to see it available on Kindle.  Was a quick download and it brought me to the level I was playing at on my phone.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Kept me reading all night. I didn't want to put it down. Highly recommended book to lovers of all genres.
B00BOLE7X0|4.0|Steven Spielberg directs an outstanding film staring Daniel Day-Lewis in the 2012 movie: Lincoln. The few moments of violence and cruelty involved in the Civil War are constant and I would not recommend exposing ignorant young children to this sort of topic until they understand why this is all happening. Overall, Lincoln stole my heart for the life of this selfless president who became a voice of reason and completely changed the meaning of American freedom and civil rights.<br />Daniel Day-Lewis is an incredible actor. He really became Abraham Lincoln in this film. He took into account how the president felt about everything going on his is life from the civil war, passing the amendment, and coping with the depression of the loss of a son and the possible loss of another. I loved how Lincoln was portrayed. Lewis didn't just walk around on stilts with a long beard; they took great detail in aging marks, Lincoln's fascinating height, and his grace. The visual motions of this movie made me feel like I was right there in the presence of a legend.<br />About halfway through the movie, you're in Lincoln's meeting room and he shares a story of his time as a lawyer in Illinois. He was representing an innocent woman who would be found guilty of committing a murder of self-defense against her husband. \\"I took her into a conference room and she asked me where she could get a drink of water. I said `Kentucky.'\\" This was a really intriguing quote because this is what Lincoln has always stood for: Liberty. And you see that all throughout the film. His struggle to end a war or free slaves is so moving. To see a gentle man in the mists of violence and repression moves your heart and keeps your attention throughout the movie.<br />I love how they did not create a scene where you watch Lincoln get assassinated. That really showed me that this movie was about his life and nothing else. Not his death and not his shooter. It was all about Abraham Lincoln, his family, and his decisions. The films made you watch as he went though his second term as president and had you grow close with the late president.<br />My heart was stolen from this film. Daniel Day-Lewis was phenomenal from his appearance to his emotion. His voice of reason and large heart keeps you captivated and on the edge of your seat as he speaks softly. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in historical wars and presidential history. Go see Lincoln. You'll be happy you did.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love this show!  It keeps getting better and better as the series/seasons go on.  Makes you want to be a lawyer!
B00902AKK4|3.0|This is an unique original concept game which definitely deserves attention. The developer indeed has put nice touch and made some marvelous original graphics, realistic physics and very challenging puzzles to solve. I especially love the way you can rewind your moves. The 'VHS' look when you rewind is the 'one of a kind' in any game that I have come across so far. Kudos to developer for this truly original concept. There is also a nice story-line narrated and graphics are top notch.<br /><br />Having praised so much about this game you would be wondering why only 3 stars? - Well, the main problem is the controls especially 'jump' and the directional controls that make this game frustratingly difficult to play. I really wish there was a better way to play this on a regular touchscreen based tablet or phone. The developer has included options to use game-pads which are Bluetooth based but I do not have any to try it with.<br /><br />Overall, If you are into puzzle games. This will keep you frustratingly engaged for a long time.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Good visual effects and lots of action. turn up the surround sound. I am not even a star trek fan.
B00G118LYY|3.0|This is a great game for little ones (my 3-year-old nephew played it) but the controls are not that intuitive.  His first instinct was to tilt the device to steer, but was required to touch the screen in order to go forward or in reverse.  This should be a setting that can be changed.  Other driving games will go forward with tilt controls, and touching the screen is brake, then reverse.  Having this option, plus more driver options would definitely bump up my review 2 more stars.  It is a fun and fluid driving experience with fun building options as is.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|Even though I have been in IT/IS for more then 20 years, this is the first time I've tried one of the McAfee products. I decided to try this app because it was the first one that I came across that offered security for the Kindle browser. Since McAfee has been around for ages I thought it would be worth trying. How bad could it possibly be? After all, McAfee is a fairly well known software company.<br /><br />BAD is not the right word to describe my experience! It literally brought my Kindle to its knees!<br /><br />Once installed the Silk browser took for ever to start up. If that wasn't bad enough,the time it took to load web pages took me back to &#34;prehistoric&#34; times - the days when we used dial-up modems. Once out of the browser things only got worse.<br /><br />Very often the Kindle became unresponsive, forcing me to shut it down and restart. Even a restart didn't improve the situation. There was one problem after another. The Carousel would either become very sluggish or not display items. The same happened when trying to use the Favorites function.<br /><br />Opening up apps took forever, and apps that had previously worked perfectly either crashed or froze. With the McAfee Mobile Security installed I shut down and restarted the Kindle more times in less then 2 weeks than I had in the approx. 6 months that I have had the Kindle.<br /><br />Trying to read a book or magazine became a total nightmare. Quite often you couldn't flip from one page to the next or it took forever to go the next page. You could use any of the Reader functions without being forced to shut down and restart. Even using a tool to empty the cache and free up memory didn't help.<br /><br />Whether this app even did what it was purported to do is anyone's guess. I just kept getting messages that it was working or Notifications that it had been updated.<br /><br />I was ready to call Amazon's tech support when I decided to uninstall this app and reboot the Kindle. That was the best decision I made because my Kindle was once again its usual speed demon and fully functional.<br /><br />Trying this app was the worst decision. After this experience McAfee couldn't pay me enough to try this app again, or any of their other products.<br /><br />Be smart - don't make the same mistake I did. A known brand name doesn't guarantee the products usability or efficacy.
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|Good game that keeps the attention of anyone who likes fire trucks.  The spraying animations are great and the fires look good.  The puzzles can be a bit tricky, which is good for me but limits my nephew (6-year-old) to the amount of levels he can play independently.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|This is a fun and easy game.  Easy to play when you are tired and don't want to have to keep up with a fast paced game.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|One of my favorite rappers DELIVERS on every second of this album. We see the creative, personal, and straight spitting emcee from the get-go. Well done sir. THIS is why people love your music. Total throwback moments to past Em tracks/albums (esp. MMLP1). A necessary album to have.
