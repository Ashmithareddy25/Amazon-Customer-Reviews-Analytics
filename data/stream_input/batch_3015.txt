B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Enjoy all the dozer games, and wish the others had the puzzle feature like this one, working to fill the carnival makes all the difference for fun and replay. I have finished, uninstalled and reinstalled this game 3 times, just for the fun of winning all the carnival pieces again. Please consider adding the puzzle feature to your other games, maybe with an update? Thank you
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I first started watching Star Trek in my dorm room at the University of Colorado in 1966. I have been hooked ever since. I think the newer movies have been cast excellently and this latest installment is incredibly entertaining and I enjoyed it.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|This version of Jane Eyre with Ruth Wilson & Toby Stephens has become &#34;my go to movie&#34; when I want to watch a Love Story!  Everything about if from the actors to the beautiful English countryside was impeccable! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!  The 2011 version is good, but it is to short, felt like there was not enough time to fully show the growing love being developed between Jane & Rochester
B005PK56TA|5.0|If you missed this when it originally aired, shame on you!!  However, I can't say too much because I did.  Start from the beginning to get the full effect of this marvelous series.  Each episode holds a new plot twist and once you get to the last few episodes, you will not want to stop watching.  Brilliantly filmed.  Excellently casted.  Only complaint was that I missed it the first time around on FX.
B0026PW67W|3.0|I love it but I want to display it in my cinema room and its gonna be difficult to frame and display. But I do love the detail.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After I started reading it, I figured out why everyone is so into this trilogy. I'll definitely be getting the other 2.
B008HRZ4TK|5.0|Smooth and without interruptions...not much more you could ask from an app...highly recommended for those who need an app that hides personal pictures.
B00ENBS4GO|5.0|Great series, very intense and bad that the season has ended now, wish there was more now have to find something else
0812993845|5.0|I'm a big Sophie Kinsella fan.  Her books are great for a fun, lighthearted read, and this was no exception.  I was literally laughing out loud throughout the story.  A must-read for any of her fans!
B0058DRSHW|4.0|This book outlines what successful companies have done differently than other companies to become so profitable over time.  It is a pretty long book, but if you have the time it's insightful.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Always a treat to read any book by Gladwell. He is not only a good writer  but he challenges your beliefs in a very amiable way. He starts by blowing a hole in my childhood's simplistic memory of David and Goliath - and then he  goes on and cuts the feet out from under of the &#34;troubles' in Ireland (It was all the fault of the British commander)  and  California's three strikes law.  Its a lot of fun and my only regret is that the book is too short!  You could read most of it while waiting for your flight to be called.
1476733953|5.0|As a train commuter, you know that you are really entertained when you miss your stop on your way home because you are deep in a book.  Fortunately or unfortunately for me, I was so captivated by this book that doubled my commute going straight past my stop.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is a great concept, but at the moment it is very limited as to what it can do. Great for streaming YOUTUBE and NETFLIX onto your TV, but my TV already has those functions. You can broadcast whatever is open in your PC's Chrome browser, but not if it's playing a video. You also cannot broadcast your browser pages from your phone/tablet. Great future potential, I just hope they keep updating.
B008220C38|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies ever made.  The story was slow moving and Keira Knightley was easy to hate.<br /> The earlier version is much better. Don't waste your money!!!!!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|It would be really nice if you could listen to the books you have in your kendle library without having to pay extra you can if you system on your Kindle but it can be to bulky to carry around at work.
1592289444|5.0|I read this book when I was in high school (in the 1970s).  This tale stayed with me. I still think about it every now and again. Reading The Long Walk made me want to be a better person.  I gained so much respect for these men and what they endured. When I closed the back cover, I knew that if I ever came face-to-face with any of these men, I would cringe if I didn't know I had tried my hardest in life. As well, the book led me to learn more about the time period in which it occurred, as well as the geography in which it took place. Besides all of that, it's a gripping adventure story -- a very good read.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|The book keeps you in the shadows. I would highly recommend getting this on a Kindle, where you can define words. Let's just say the book will not leave you with a feeling of ennui.
1250038820|5.0|As a New Yorker, you learn to appreciate it vibrant diaspora. There are so many moments to experience and Brandon has done a fantastic and formidable job at capturing the true essence of Humans in New York. There are so many real characters and so many moments that many can appreciate from the book. The quotations are also wonderful. I've ordered 3 copies - 1 for me and the 2 others would be doing a \\"Tpur du monde\\" by going to France and Africa. However, my co-workers took them so now, I am back online to order some more. This is a great gift for anyone. Bravo Brandon Stanton for this phenomenal collection of portraits. I am a fan!!!
0345529057|4.0|I bought this for my brother and he loved it!  Couldn't put it down.  I guess I'll have to start reading it now...

B004P1JDJO|5.0|Great inspiration for any and all leaders. Use it to inspire yourself and others. Good luck with implementing. I'm looking forward to it where I am!
B00D2PIUAM|4.0|Not the best Placebo album by any means, but not terrible.  There are a couple great tunes, some pretty good ones, and one or two awful ones.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Good read. I have read a lot Steven king, this is something he would write. Very interesting, again, a very good read, something to think.about.
B000002G0P|5.0|Great CD that few remember or even know.  Songs are unique and although each song has some cohesiveness across the disc, they are all very different.<br /><br />Really liked this and wished more people got to understand it and hear it.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It won't let me set up a new account it keeps telling my a error occurred it shouldn't have taken so long and to try back. I've tried every day for the last two weeks.. still no change and my internet connection is at full bars! Fix please!!
B002T9H2LA|5.0|In this movie, a violent chapter in our world's history is chronicled the way we wish it would have happened.
B005PK57IK|5.0|A great series that keeps you waiting for the next show.  This is a series you should not miss. Wish there were more like this one.
B002VRNR1Y|4.0|I enjoyed the film very much.  The tension mounted at a great pace.  The effects were very good.  The story was mostly faithful to the book, but I was disappointed with one part of the movie plot that differed from the original story.  The change seemed to add no real purpose to the movie with the exception of adding gratuitous violence.  This would be the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five.  I would still highly recommend it, though.  It's a wonderful thriller.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Loved it! We are big RDJR fans and Marvel. So we enjoy all of the Iron Man Movies! Recommend it!
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Classic fun movie to share with kids and drive imagination. One of those films the kids watch over and over.
B008JFUUQ2|1.0|This was recommended by a young friend. Maybe good for the young adult crowd (very young). The music was the only redemption but there wasn't enough. Otherwise, the acting and storyline were awful. Don't waste your time.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|It's a great book for all chefs and diners. Anthony knows how to make me laugh at some of the truths that does happen in the kitchen. Oh boy!
B000I55YV2|3.0|There are a lot of holes in the plot which are sort of papered over by the speed the film moves. If you don't stop to think about it too much this is a really fun film.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love games like this ,I think they're so fun to play when I want to waste time.<br />  That's why I think it should be rated 5
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|Best with 4 players. Its war with a theme and tactics. Glad I got it for may girlfriend and I
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It is an affecting game and I really do enjoy it. I sometimes feel annoyed by the respective-ness of  the game.And  I'm tired of waiting to be granted more coins so that I can play the game.

B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I really like this game it's fun but kind of challenging!!! It's look to burn time with!!!!!!!!!!!! I recommend it!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|OMIGOD!!! Or should I say demigod. Hahaha.... this book was AMAZING. I highly recommend reading it... but try not to come down with O.P.J.D. (Obsessive Percy Jackson Disorder)
B006LSZECO|2.0|I can't think of any other way to describe this book other than meh. The beginning was slow, there was a very predictable twist, and then it was all down hill from there. The ending was ridiculous. I gave it two stars because there were some parts that got interesting and I thought that maybe it would turn around. Sadly it did not. It got very predictable in part two and part three was...well...disappointing. At times it felt like I was reading the Scott Peterson story...ugh. I think is my first and last book by this author.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|I didn't realize a power trio could sound so good! Great riffs, great drum work, bass lines are bangin'! Buy it!
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Loved it!!!! Introduced it to others & they loved it too! I am 52 but my kis & others liked it too.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|wonderful as I expected<br />I'm really pleased to see my son's reaction when he received this gift<br />He is into minecraft game now<br />so this was a wonderful choice for him<br /><br />If you are looking for some present for someone who is enjoying minecraft, this would be a wonderful choice

B003O86FMW|3.0|I enjoyed Hunger Games, but I have avoiding reading Catching Fire for quite a while. The reason? The promo emphasized the love triangle in the story. Since I am not a dewy-eyed teenage girl, that scenario didn't appeal to me. But I found out the story had more to offer than just a love triangle. I did have an issue on how passive a part Katniss plays in the rebellion, but I have hope that she will be more proactive in book 3.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed going through this game.  Very thought provoking at times(low blood sugar episode)  Very even paced with puzzles and clues being solved.  The story line was interesting.  I.m still trying to decide if it was a bit thin or an after thought.  Play this game.  You will enjoy yourself immensely.
1419701533|5.0|My daughter has begun her interest in reading books on her own and this may have been the catalyst.The price is attractive as well as the accompanying box book case. would recommend for young readers.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show is genious! It is high speed adventure with an intelegence that is highly sought after. The witty banter between Sherlock and Watson intertwined with the incredibly intracate  story plot is delightful. Watch this program- you won't be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its like one swipe then I takes you to minion wonderland is awesome the after a game you cant stop
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|I love Walking Dead and have all three seasons.  I watched episode 1 when it came on TV and it was so unbearable to watch with all the insulting inane stupid commercials.  There seemed to be more commercials than show.  So I bought the season immediately and rewatched it monday night.  So great.  I rewatched all three seasons starting a couple of weeks before the fourth season started and without commercials it is such a pleasure to watch.  Have you guessed how much I hate commercials!<br /><br />This first episode was such a great beginning and there are so many story arcs that can come out of it.  It is setting the stage for this next season.  There are some weird things going on with the weird woman, Clara, dead pig, dead boy, Carol's classes, Michonne hunting the Governor, and the change in Rick and his son.  Did you notice how the walkers seem more raggedy and more desperate and what's with the bloody eyes? Thank you AMC.<br /><br />Amazon thank you for streaming this.
B006885EFE|5.0|Loved it!  The story line is one of the best ever I'm my opinion.. One of a few series that has ever sparked my interest. This is a must see
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app will show available wifi networks, SSIDs, signal strength updated in real-time, and best of all...you can flip it over to a tracker that allows you to zero in on a router. This is handy when you're in a customer's house who's a hoarder and the router is buried under trash and the customer doesn't know a router from a toaster.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Keeps me occupied and entertained while I'm waiting. Good fun game to play. Reminds of war hammer. Keep it comming
B0007939NO|5.0|He does a great job. All his pictures were good. He dances well and the story line is exciting.Good buy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If you liked Mario Bros you will love this game.  I would highly recommend it for all users new and old.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Enjoyed movie, had to get dvd. Good movie. Good to watch all the time. Angellina Jolie good actress, Did Great job.
B0061P2L5U|5.0|I was led to read this book by a reference in a New York Times article about celiac disease. The author covers the gamut of immune diseases, and finishes by developing a comprehensive insight into the toxic balances that create the most robust immune responses. He leaves the reader with the well researched conclusion that being so persnickety about sterile cleanliness inevitably leaves us with a weaker immune system than we might have by just suffering normal exposures to everyday germs and dirt.<br /><br />He describes the efforts of cases of people suffering extreme autoimmune diseases, including himself, with non-medical treatments for their conditions, including infecting themselves with intestinal helminth colonies. The results vary widely, and the risks faced are discussed from all sides.<br /><br />The research leaves me with an appreciation of the adaptive capacity of the human immune system to survive in a world of dynamically morphing microbes and viruses. A strong immune system, like a strong body that comes from lifting weights, is one that has to work actively to fend off low levels of agonists. This takes the understanding of how the body reacts to vaccines, for example, to a new, comprehensive level.<br /><br />It is a most readable and even enjoyable, book written by a journalist researcher. The insights gained for personal health are well worth the time to read it from cover to cover.
B006LEHOL2|4.0|This was such a welcome surprise. When I wasnt expecting anything great from Sinead she came back with this pretty great album. The album opens very strong with one good song after another. Sadly it loses the power after the great cover of Queen of Denmark.<br />Key tracks: Wolf is getting married and Queen of Denmark.
B00AXOPK6W|5.0|How can you go wrong with Jane Austen? I'm not a huge fan of the classics, but I do love Austen.
B00338QENI|4.0|Very interesting book. I would read this again because I loved the ideas and themes that were presented by the author
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Good writers, good actors and a good story that constantly changes. Characters come and go but always plays a vital part in the plot.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I loved this book and I loved sending it right to my iPad. I would definitely buy an ebook again!
B0035JRVBO|5.0|A wonderful, positive and uplifting movie that never gets old.  The cinematography is spectacular---it should really be viewed on as big a screen as possible.  Every time you watch it you will notice and appreciate new details carefully incorporated by the script writer.  One of the best movies ever made.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A lot of consentration is required but that's what makes this game so much fun. Try it. You will like it!
1579655327|5.0|Beautiful.  Everything you'd come to expect from Kinfolk. And the assortment of recipes is perfect. Loved the personal connection - the people behind the recipes. It feels like you've been invited into their kitchens. Well done.
B00CDXOPYE|5.0|Such a sweet movie with a great twist at the end that I never saw coming.  I love romantic suspense stories.
B00F87ZYO2|5.0|I prefer to keep all my digital purchases on the cloud, I know where they are and I never need to find a place to store them. The WD season 4 promises to be going in the direction that so many of us that attended Comic Con in San Diego had hoped and discussed over and over.  If it in fact is going where we assume it is headed from seeing the first episode of this 4th season, DELIGHT!!
B00AVTMCYW|3.0|Not bad.  Not great.  Worth watching if you have nothing better to do.  Rent don't buy.  Darker than I expected.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved the story! Could not put it down! Thanks for writing such a great easy reading enticing and sexy story!
B00E97AZZK|4.0|Entertaining and fun movie with magic and mystery.  Great cast of characters.  The end was a little weird but it worked.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This was a great sequel to the Girl with the dragon tattoo. This trilogy has been amongst my all time favorite reads.
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|Too slow for my taste.  I didn't really care for the actress that played the lead.  Started picking up towards the end.  The book was way better.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Sigur Ros.  Their music is soothing, melodic, and very powerful to me.  Valtari is one of my favorite albums of all time, and now Kveikur is no different.  Both albums are great in their own ways.  Valtari is relaxed, peaceful, and even a little calming, while Kveikur is powerful, intense, and a straight rocker.  The two albums are amazing compliments to each other.  Sigur Ros has mastered the art of creating captivating, emotional music.  Do yourself a favor and check them out!  :)
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|Tthis game is pretty cool, downloads and runs perfectly, but then becomes just buggy and hard to play. For the good side:<br />-Its has AWESOME GRAPHICS, actually, the best racing game out there.<br />-Great cars, with great tracks, very large and impossible to get bored with it.<br />-New and pretty cool modes of play, like infection mode (that I have just saw in FPS), innovation from Gameloft.<br />-The nice things that you love in games and makes you feel nice while playing, like the soundtrack or the menu.<br /><br />Now, for the bad side:<br />-It needs a lot of space. Just aceptable for the hight quality graphics.<br />-LOTS AND LOTS OF BUGS, and the principal reason why I give it 3 stars, some tracks are unplayable because of this, just screwed my perspective of the game. I guess that may run as expected on a coolest device but in my KFHD 8.9' just don't.<br />-The controls and the gameplay just ehh... sometimes it doesn't response and makes you lose the race with crashing or things like that, besides that it doesn't respects the physics rules, but who does?<br />-A money sucker, you will spend more than one buck.<br /><br />I'am a great fan of gameloft and the asphalt series are one of my favorites, so please fix it and we could be all happy. :D thanks and have a nice day.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Was as expected.  Met my expectations.  Was fairly easy to set up. I cannot think of anything else to say but I must put something down to meet the ridiculous requirement.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|Showing how the X-men got started with Magneto was OK as far as the action and development of the story but it could have done with even less mutants. . I thought the best parts were  with Jennifer Lawrence because  besides her stunning looks, her acting and story line riveted me to the movie more than the other characters.  Fassbender played a good villain in Magneto but the others were boring.<br />Just a fair movie, nice effects and worth one viewing.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Great sci-fi, which puts values of today's world's society to question. What would our cultures and nations sink to, should we face a threat of global annihilation? Would we stand united or would it increase the differences among humans?
B00471TLZS|5.0|This is such a Great movie! It is a Classic. If you haven't seen it, you need to. Best one of the series.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|The book is good, if don't get bored easily, I was in love by Netflix show and the book didn't got 50% my attention as the TV show.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I liked it and I enjoyed the boy Tom Sawyer. He had a wonderful imagination and was really reall mischievous
B003LQ3YXU|2.0|I usually like Science Fiction, but this is too cheesy. I tried to like it, I just couldn't get into it
B00000JL86|4.0|Great adaptation of a true story.my 6 yr old granddaughter reall loved it. It kept her attention and she just really enjoyed it, as did poppy and I .
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I loved this movie! I watched this movie with my 8 year old daughter and would watch it again.  We enjoyed every minute of it! Great rental and good for the whole family. Laugh out loud funny, great one liners and entertaining.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I Choose this rating simply because I love to play the game!!!<br />.and I like competition.<br />I would recommend my friends

0767827791|5.0|I just love all of William holden movies . I plan to buy them all, they are on my Christmas list
0316074314|3.0|Gushing reviews are easy to write, (so are pans), but what to say when you know that a book is well written, innovatively and creatively structured, and is destined to be loved by many, but it just didn't appeal to you? \\"The Luminaries\\" by Eleanor Catton, is such a book. Short-listed for the Booker Prize, this novel, that weighs in at over 800 pages, takes a bit of a commitment to get into and, once invested, it must \\"grab\\" you to continue. I got half-way through and then had to have a \\"talk with myself\\" about continuing. It just isn't my kind of novel and continuing was going to take too much of my precious reading time. Yet, I was far enough in to see that its innovative style of folding back in on itself will appeal to many readers. It's like a complicated pastry; the plot is kneaded and folded to produce the confection intended. This is not a novel for readers who like their plots to be linear.<br /><br />Catton's writing style is beautifully lush and vividly descriptive. Her descriptions of the myriad characters are wonderfully rendered both in the descriptions of their physical selves and of their inner selves. Catton also creates a unique and interesting setting of a New Zealand gold mining town in the mid-nineteenth century.<br /><br />I'm posting this candidly honest review to help other readers ascertain if they are the type of reader who will enjoy this unique novel, or not.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was sucked in from the first episode of Season One and never looked back. Season Three was just as good as the first two seasons. If you like period drama, this is just the thing.
B00F3YHMUE|5.0|From 1978 to 2013, INMSHO, The Last Ship is Sting's best album period.<br /><br />I have been a fan since 1979 so that opening line says a lot as I have been a Police/Sting junkie since.<br /><br />There are just too many powerful soul searching songs, the album will question your station in life, what you have spun.  It is a powerful album, musically, nothing he has released can touch that theme in such a way, it is a musical journey from modern jazz to folk to music to Sting!<br /><br />Lyrically, the album touches on life:<br /><br />1) Parent/Child relations<br />2) Spirituality<br />3) Community<br />4) Work<br />5) Mortality and Death<br /><br />If I had to list his best songs which I place on the same level or better than some of my favorite songs such as, \\"Ghost Story\\", \\"Book of My Life\\", \\"Fields of Gold\\", \\"King of Pain\\" and \\"Message in a Bottle\\", I rank the following new songs on those or a higher level....<br /><br />\\"The Last Ship\\"<br />\\"Dead Man's Boots\\"<br />\\"And Yet\\"<br />\\"August Winds\\"<br />\\"Language of Birds\\"<br />\\"The Night the Pugilist Learned How to Dance\\"<br />\\"What Have We Got?\\"<br />\\"So to Speak\\"<br /><br />All I have to say is it is brilliant music, I became a fan with \\"Walking on the Moon\\" and \\"Message\\"  and I respect those songs as much today as I did then... but I hope I have progressed since my teenage years, I have a family now and I think most Sting fans have grown or have progressed with the music and that music has helped many on this journey and this album continues on that theme, 10 years later since his last, and all I can say is there is not one bad song or B-side on this album.<br /><br />I have to say and after many listens as I don't say this easily, I think this is his best work.
B003YOZNBU|1.0|This was sooooooooooooooo bad.  I can't even verbalize how bad it was.  Megan Fox, you should have made the Transformers gig work.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I bought this CD for just one song but turns out the entire CD now holds all my favorites. KOL are the best!
B004G7UTXG|4.0|The music and scenery were beautiful.  For the most part the story was true.  The political game still goes on there.  The movie just made you think of the people who died just for the whim of governments.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|If I wanted a book heavy on history and light on character development and interaction... I would have gone to the history section.  Discovery Of Witches?? She already knew about witches so even the title didn't make sense.  I love rich scenery and history but not at the expense of the characters.  I won't even touch book two!
0670024856|5.0|10/15/2013 The Signature of All Things is a wonderful book. The third person story teller enters the realm of Alma's mind, a scientific mind, a rational mind. Alma's life-time study of mosses allows her to come up with \\"THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS,\\" that is how plants, in their almost infinite variety, survive a brutal world, changing, adapting,incorporating in their adaption all that is necessary for their survival. However, to Alma's regret, she is unable to include in her theories of \\"significance\\" how people like her adopted sister, Prudence, a truly good and unselfish person can be accounted for in a world where everything else is based on the adaptation of the strongest creatures, mostly plants, but reference is also made to animals.<br />Along with the story about Alma's mosses, and she makes truly magnificent and courageous theories about those plants, is Alma's personal story,which can appear to be very sad at times. But Alma knows how to survive. Alma misses out on certain aspects of life, but at the end of the book, she assesses her life and finds that it has been significant. Meanwhile, we, the readers, have been treated to a book full of adventure and wonderful personalities. And, we are there, in the book, at the development of Darwin's theories, and Alma's theories, though hers were unpublished.<br />The only problem I can see about this book is that IT IS VERY LONG. I wonder how the ladies in my book group would think about reading 500 pages in this book. On the other hand, The Signature of All Things has many, many wonderful points to explore in a good discussion. NanS
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Watched the first one before I watched this one to refresh my memory, since it had been a while.  This one was as good if not better.  It helps if you've seen the old Start Trek movies with William Shatner/Leonard Nimoy, et al, because there are references to them.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This book was recommended by a very good friend.  When I read the description, frankly, I wasn't so sure I was going to like it.  But I'm so happy that I followed her advice and read it.  It is a clever, charming book.  You can feel the main characters awkwardness, which to me indicates just how well-written it is.  A quick, delightful read!
B004GXZ69W|5.0|I'm a professional writer in my late 30s, and for years have used a laptop along with a simple standard mouse and touchpad. The last couple of years have brought repetitive stress-related tendon injury and degeneration in my forearms and around my elbows. My wrists and fingers too, have suffered. So I took a deep breath and shelled out for this mouse, along with a pricy ergonomic keyboard & voice-recognition software (saved money on the latter, though, by calling the company and ordering an older version).<br /><br />As it happens, the mouse arrived first. God, what a difference. And it was immediate, too. I'd gotten to the point where any amount of mousing was painful, but as soon as I switched to this mouse the pain subsided. I think having the fancy keyboard will help, too, but the mouse alone is a godsend. I haven't bothered to read the directions or program it or anything. I just plugged it in and started using it. No doubt if I explored its capabilities I'd like it even more. Should have bought one of these back in college when all the problems first began.
B000002UTY|5.0|Worth it for &#34;Who Do You Love,&#34; but much more here. Wish any bands now would play this great style.
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|Lets get right to it. Paul, your writing talent has been depleted. I don't have to go song to song and review each. If you know anything about his music, you will understand.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I found the book to be troubling and intriguing all at once.  I would recommend it to any serious church-goer and take it with a small  grain of salt; didn't we always suspect some of the points made in it, after all?  Definitely worth a read!
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Couldn't stop reading it.  I've read a lot of books in the same genre.  Max wrote this as if he was indeed rebelling stories of actual events.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My kids watch a lot of You Tube videos and now we can share it on the TV and it's simple and works great!<br />a MUST HAVE for the family!
B005LAIIGW|3.0|The setting is a visual marvel. \\"You can't beat the view,\\" veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski comments, in regards to seeing Earth from space, before disaster strikes. When it does, it comes hard and fast. A girl Mission Specialist named Ryan, the only other main character, goes flying. She begins to drift away uncontrollably, into the darkness, as the level of suspense goes into full thrust.<br /><br />It's a nightmare scenario that should've served as the gist of the plot. But it takes quite an imaginative storyteller to keep an audience engaged from there, so we're taken into more familiar cinematic territory and that aforementioned level of suspense starts to descend. In a sense, we're following the wrong character, though, for what it's worth, Sandra Bullock (still) looks sexy in spandex.<br /><br />marcellee.com
1465414444|4.0|I love this!  The artwork is beautiful (as is usual for the Blizz artists) and I'm getting insights to some of the lore that I've missed, without having to do so much homework I feel like I'm back in school.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|I have never listened to Paramore much because they fell into the category of \\"complaint rock\\" in my opinion.  There was always something about their sound that made me curious and there were a few songs that I liked - most notably \\"The Only Exception\\" - but I was never moved to buy an album.  That changed when I heard the single, \\"Still Into You\\".  It was such a happy, fun song that I couldn't help but check out the album.  When I did, I was sold.  This album is definitely a new attitude for Paramore, something they readily admit and are a little nervous about.  I am sure some of their devoted fan base will miss the old anger but I do not and I am sure many others will be pleased by the refreshingly fun feel to these tracks.  My favorite track is \\"Hate To See Your Heart Break\\" which is one of the least \\"fun\\" tracks but I just can't say enough about it.  It gently falls on your ears like soft rain at the end of a long, hot day.  It is a true breakup lullaby.  I also especially like the infectiously driving track \\"Fast In My Car\\" and the hilarious \\"(One Of Those) Crazy Girls\\" but I find the entire album well crafted and really enjoyable all the way through.  We all know how rare that is.  I personally feel this album is a candidate for the best album of the year.
0385344228|5.0|This was one of my favorite books this year!  The author truly guides you into the main character so you empathize with his struggle to protect his son and prove his innocence.  While the ending comes as a surprise, it's not a surprise if you are paying close attention to the supporting characters throughout the book.  All of the main characters are well developed and the mystery is full of suspense, with twists and turns until the very end.  The overlay of the main character being interviewed by the DA, also his former nemesis, adds an element that is perplexing and compelling throughout as you wonder who they are talking about and where this is leading.  This author is an excellent writer - I cannot wait to read other books he has written!
B004UNX1LS|3.0|it has a lot of glitches so I have to delete the app and then download it again for it to work... just a warning.:/
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I found this a very good sequel. Not quite as scary as The Shining, but I first read it as a pretty sheltered teen. I'm glad to see Danny ended up well adjusted and able to work through his scumbag era and end up with redemption on many levels.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|beat it a little too fast.took about one hour so now I'm bored...need more rooms but other than that it is a great game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can you escape is really a fun and thought provoking game.  I've gotten through the first 4 rounds and have enjoyed searching for the clues.  I like the graphics and overall feel  of the game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Really enjoyed this book: a real page-turner!  Nothing about it was common or re-hashed as far as the subject matter. I tend to read on the subway on my way to work. I'd become so engrossed in the story that I'd be annoyed once I arrived at my station -  - I wasn't ready to stop reading!
031620157X|5.0|My 10 year old daughter read it in one 9-hour sitting! She loved it so much and couldn't put down. It's not scary but a little sad in the beginning. it's age appropriate & my daughter recommends it to girls & boys who love adventure and comedy.<br />Summery: The kids travel to the land of fairy tales, they have to find certain objects to make the wishing Spell so that they can go back home. For example they get a riddle and they need to decipher it to know which object they need- like Cinderella's slipper, then they go on an adventure to get the objects. It's a long but exciting story. READ IT!
B0094LNMGU|5.0|What an original idea for a remake of a classic flik. I recommend viewing many times to catch all the different nuamces.
B005SEKMH4|5.0|I already recomended this book to 4 friends...<br />As I wrote all topics are very clear.. even for someone whose english level is not native...
B0079UVRNI|5.0|Gold truly makes a difference for this James Taylor classic gold record. The sound quality was clear, sharp, and made a pleasant listening experience.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I love mysteries, and this is my favorite!  I love trying to figure out &#34;who dun nit?&#34;, and I was shocked--and a little creeped out.  Clues are provided for the very observant, but even if you don't get them, it's still a good read!
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Bought my first pair which lasted about 6 months and then they stopped working. I contacted customer support and spent about a month in correspondence, then they had me ship the headset to them which was 20 dollars out of my pocket but I was sent a brand new pair so it seemed worth it. Until those ones stopped working at around the same 6 month mark. Of course at that point my warranty was up and I got a very pleasant letter from Turtle Beach telling me I'm shit out of luck. Hopefully Logitech will appreciate my business a bit more.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Very fast streaming, fast downloads, and the best part is you can download the audio, which is good if your hiking or when your driving!

B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Best game ever!  I really enjoy playing solitaire with this hellishly funny gopher.  This a perfect game for everyone in the family.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I have never played this kind of game before so I thought I would try it. I was not disappointed, it was a lot of fun. I only played the easier levels and managed to figure them out without to much trouble. I had the free app. so I was disappointed when I ran out of levels. I played this on a Kindle Fire and it worked fine.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Waited 8 years for this and was not disappointed. Glad Earth ,Wind and Fire are back. Love this album! Great !
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game has me hooked. I don't usually write reviews, but it's required to play the last picture! Spent hours just today.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book yet!!!!!!!!<br />The most amazing book i have ever seen. Heard fourth book came out. I hope the series go on!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Just after downloading and opening the app it ask for your birth date so it can tailor the game to your age. Don't like this feature as I would play the game but downloaded for entertaining my nephew when I babysit. How can he play if it tailors the game to my age??<br /><br />The graphics are nice, the minions look exactly like the originals from the movie. Gru even makes an appearance when you start the game to announce the challenge. It allows you to choose and customize which minion you'd like to play as with clothing/accessory options. If you do the customization be aware that this app has in-app purchasing.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Nice graphics and playability.  Fairly realistic.  Wish that it had more ways to upgrade that didn't include in app purchases.  My son enjoys it as well.  Can't wait for more...

B006GWO5NE|5.0|My granddaughter had a problem charging her Kindle.  The problem turned out to be the rapid charger which was not making good contact.  We replaced the rapid charger with an Amazon Kindle 9W PowerFast Adapter along with new cable (just in case).  Turns out it was the charger and we did not need to get the cable but decided to keep it anyway since it never hurts to have an extra especially with children.  I have been extremely happy with everything that I have gotten from Amazon and I must say that your Customer Service Department is exceptional; everyone that I have had any dealings with has been helpful, polite and personable which is most gratifying since I enjoy talking to someone who has a sense of humor whatever the situation..............laughter is always the best medicine and it usually gets me the best results.  yaya

B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|Yeah the dudes are getting older, but Eddie Vedder, Mike McCready, Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, and Matt Cameron are still really great musicians willing to expand their music pallets. Of course some of the songs off the new record Lightning Bolt are going to be a bit soft for some, but, think about it this way: The same group that put out Ten have had 20+ years to grow and evolve as musicians. They're not the disenfranchised youth anymore so it should go without question that the album is going to sound much different than anything else that they have put out earlier in their careers.<br /><br />Some of the songs such as \\"Mind Your Manners\\" have a driving bass element from Ament that is akin to his playing in his other side project RNDM. Furthermore, Matt Cameron just participated on a new Soundgarden album recently, but he's never had a problem separating the style of play that he has for each band, but I feel like he used a lot of his good fills for the SG album and not here for PJ. Stone does what Stone does best. Would really like to see a double solo from him and McCready sometime, but I don't think that will happen any time soon. Eddie will be Eddie, as he always has been. His vocals are tight and sound as should and lyrically he is as intriguing as ever. Check out Pendulum and Infallible as examples.<br /><br />Here's a track-by-track break down from my first couple of spins from the album:<br /><br />\\"Getaway\\" feels like a radio-rock tune talking about criticism. I feel like this could have been the closing track of the album with as much negative press they might receive from the record, as a giant middle finger saying, \\"Hey, we're going to write and record the music we want to write and record, so piss off.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mind Your Manners\\" would have been a track on Vitalogy had it been written during the nineties. It has some attitude but I feel it was written and recorded to appease some of those who didn't want to give up grunge-era PJ. Its good, and EV has an edge to his voice that has been missing from some of the previous PJ releases.<br /><br />\\"My Father's Son\\" leads off with fantastic Jeff Ament bass work that I feel we don't get to hear very much. Musically, this is a good, but I am not crazy about the vocals on the track.<br /><br />\\"Sirens\\" definitely feels like a ballad, but I like it. Its a departure from much of what we've heard from PJ. It isn't \\"Last Kiss\\" (thank god) and EV's voice is great on the track. The introduction of the song might irk some but it's one that quickly picks up steam throughout the track.<br /><br />The title track \\"Lightning Bolt,\\" sounds like something that would have been on Backspacer. Those who know me know I'm not the biggest Backspacer fan. The album was a little too optimistic for my tastes but given the time frame and political circumstances of the release (2009) it is understandable.<br /><br />\\"Infallible\\" sounds like the band was doing some experimenting with different soundscapes. It's different and clever. I dig it.<br /><br />\\"Pendulum\\" is my favorite track on the album. For some of you, it might be your least favorite. Once you listen to the whole thing, you'll know why. Indescribable in my mind. It's the Present Tense of Lightning Bolt.<br /><br />\\"Swallowed Whole\\" is good. I was taken aback from the acoustics used on the latter part of the album, but the sonic transition is good. More from Ament's bass on this one too.<br /><br />\\"Let The Records Play\\" reminds me of a track that would have been coming out of late 50s early 60s rock and roll, and the title is aptly named. This reminds me of Johnny Guitar, and is one of the more \\"funner\\" tunes of recent Pearl Jam memory. Very Backspacer esque.<br /><br />\\"Sleeping By Myself\\" is a very sad one and a track that you'd listen to on repeat after being cheated on. This originally appears on Eddie's Ukulele album and in all honesty I feel that is the better version.<br /><br />\\"Yellow Moon\\" has an interesting intro that reminds me musically of the intro of Alice in Chains \\"Sludge Factory\\" during their MTV unplugged set. There is some organ on this too, which was caught me off guard, but I really liked it. McCready jams on this a little bit and his solos are perfectly placed on the track - this song would have been great on the Into The Wild soundtrack that Eddie did a few years ago.<br /><br />Future Days\\" also features piano, which is something that older fans might not have expected from PJ, but it is a welcome album closer. I imagine this one, as with most Pearl Jam tunes, will be much more enjoyable live than in studio.<br /><br />If this album wasn't a Pearl Jam record it would probably receive a much better grade from media at-large, if of course, it was given the time of day (it's damn hard to get an album heard by mainstream media that isn't pushed by a label). But Pearl Jam doesn't exist to appease the mainstream media and that's a joy that a lot of us fans take solace in.<br />The album is worth listening to and owning and I look forward to seeing them play these songs live for years to come.<br />Find more reviews for all things Rock, Indie, and Electronic at audiohammock.comeminds me musically of the intro of Alice in Chains \\"Sludge Factory\\" during their MTV unplugged set.

B008JFUO4U|2.0|I bought this movie expecting it to be good considering the actors involved, alas it failed to impress me. Every \\"plot twist\\" I called before it was revealed, and I'm not the type of person that is able to do that very often (I didn't figure out the twist in \\"The Sixth Sense\\" until that was revealed). Now in no way do I fault the actors for this, I think they did the best they could for the script that was handed to them. The visuals in this movie were BY FAR the best part, they were amazing. However it doesn't quite make up for the lack of depth in the story for some very important parts of the movie and for the tedious manner in which they showed other less important parts.<br /><br />I'm still trying to decide if I keep this movie or give it to someone that is only interested in how visually stunning the movie was...
0307271609|4.0|Empress Dowager Cixi has been vilified, demonized and blamed for so many of China's problems that one would assume that she was an absolute monster. In recent years there has been a questioning of the vicious propaganda used against her and there has been a growing faction of scholars that see the good that came from her rule along with the bad.<br /><br />The author of this excellent book very obviously does not think Cixi is a monster and uses historical research and documentation to try to prove it. Well written, albeit more dry than poetic, this book reads smoothly and flows well. The author does a good job of setting the scene, of explaining nuances to life in China and, more specifically, life among the Chinese royals. Cixi's life and her strength of character are absolutely fascinating as we follow her in her triumphs and abysmal defeats. The inclusion of black and white photographs of Cixi and her court make this a vivid glimpse into her life. If you love reading about history (think David McCullough) then this book is for you!<br /><br />All that being said, Chang is obviously a scholar who appreciates the changes that the Western word brought to and, some might say, forced onto China. The tactics used by the British and the way the Chinese were treated is something that no historian can spin to seem like a warm, fuzzy, 'this-was-for-their-own-good' action. Chang's response to British interference is lukewarm but by no means condemning toward the British. There is an attempt to justify most of the British actions and, when their actions are indefensible, the author states the facts and moves on. This might be off putting to those of us who grew up in countries that are still recovering from British Colonial Rule in the Far East. Of course, there are great things that came from the British to China and India but the political and military tactics used in both countries were shameful.<br /><br />Chang is obviously someone who appreciates Cixi and her role in opening up China to the modern world and all her attempts to change her country for the better. It is pretty obvious that the Dowager Empress was a powerful and ruthless woman when need be and the author does gloss over these things as just something any ruler would have done. The author is probably right but the end result is that the book seems so heavily in Cixi's favor that I was left wondering what ugly truths had been left out of the book.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book but I found myself hesitant to trust the authors appraisal of Cixi as a person. Many statements about her motivations and her ideas were not backed up by documents but by interpretation on the part of the author. In the end, the book was a well written explanation of the massive influence Cixi's work had upon Modern China. It is an enlightening read for anyone interested in the time period and in how the events taking place in the Western world affected the development of China today.opening up China to the modern world and all her attempts to change her country for the better.

B00FPH6M82|1.0|bad acting, bad story and bad production value. Acting and story are very subjective, so as long as the movie, especially a sci-fi movie, has good production value it would probably, well maybe, get a 3 star from me. In this movie, there were different times when the green screen effect was so obvious I couldn't think of anything else at the time. It didn't help that they were trying to use some weird accent and I really did not like the story at all.<br /><br />For the most part, I like Will Smith. just not in this
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I like the game, but it won't install on my kindle. It says I need to free up space, when I got rid of most of my apps

B004LROUNG|5.0|Although I had read several of his early books, I hadn't read any Grisham for a number of years.  When did he get so funny?  The Litigators was a great satire on the workings of the legal system--from the fat cat big firm to the lowly ambulance chasers.  Contained lots of insight as well as laughs.  Have recommended it to other former Grisham fans.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've had Swiftkey for over two years now, and it's been my primary keyboard from day one. I've gone through three phones now (Thunderbolt, Rezound, currently on HTC One) and despite the advances in both stock and other 3rd party keyboards - including Google making the official Android keyboard available - I still find myself switching back to Swiftkey after briefly experimenting with the others.<br /><br />Choosing a keyboard really depends on each user's unique preferences and needs. For me, here are the reasons why I keep coming back:<br /><br />1. level of customization.<br />Swiftkey exposes a lot of features that you can't really tweak on other keyboards. One of my favorite is the long-keypress duration. I find that most other keyboards take too long to activate the long-keypress. On Swiftkey, I can set it to as low as I like - I decided on 189ms (0.189 s) as the sweet spot. You can go as low as 100ms to 1600ms (1.6s). This feature alone really sped up my typing.<br /><br />2. keyboard layout.<br />I like a single tap takes you to an alternate keyboard with the numbers arranged in the 3x3 keypad layout. It really speeds up inputting numbers instead of hunting for numbers in a single row format. Also, all the usual punctuation marks are there as well.<br /><br />On the primary keyboard, there's a dedicated key for smileys. Single tap gives you the default happy smiley. Long press gives you a list of other smiles. Very efficient!<br /><br />3. Gestures.<br />The keyboard supports gestures that are very useful. A swipe anywhere on the keyboard from right to left deletes the last word. It's SO much faster than actually tapping and holding down the backspace key. This feature along with the ability to adjust long-keypress delay is what got me hooked on Swiftkey.<br /><br />Also, a swipe downward anywhere on the keyboard hides the keyboard. Very handy when you need to see more of the screen. Pressing back key sometimes exits you out of the app too. This is a surefire way, works every time.<br /><br />4. Solid word predictions<br />The keyboard learns from your input history and gives you predictions on what you might want to type next. I don't use this feature as much since I am more of a rapid typer. The prediction is good most of times, and at times you can even type out whole sentences from the predictions alone.<br /><br />Now, there are still room for improvement. I wish there's a way to assign or remap some of the keys. For example, the period key on the main keyboard shows frequently used punctuation marks (!?) when long-pressed. But the motion triggers Google Now fairly often on my HTC One, because it's so close to the Home key and the slightly swipe up (you have to long-press then move up to select the desired punctuation mark) is similar to the trigger for Google Now. If I can remap the key (I use the question mark probably 90% of the time), then this problem won't exist.<br /><br />Swiftkey recently incorporated the \\"Flow\\" input method, which is basically the Swype keyboard. I haven't used this feature much because it disables the gestures, a necessary move since there's no way to distinguish between a delete and a genuine swype.<br /><br />Overall, I see myself continuing to use Swiftkey for the foreseeable future!<br /><br />P.S. Swiftkey developer, if you're reading this please consider my suggestion for the remap function. That's really the only complaint I have so far.way, works every time.<br /><br />4.

Swiftkey developer, if you're reading this please consider my suggestion for the remap function. That's really the only complaint I have so far.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I love this app and use it quite a bit. Whenever the grandkids sleep over, I use this to check on them at night.  It's great for traveling when you're in an unfamiliar room and you need to get up at night and not disturb anyone else.
0399159347|2.0|I bought this based on the many positive reviews. It was just not my cup of tea -- which doesn't make it a bad book.  The chatty tone made me crazy....like talking to someone who cannot stay on point and veers off in too many directions. I get it, just did not care for that style. I was expecting a deeper exploration of infidelity, betrayal and marital discord but the treatment of these issues was superficial and not particularly revealing or thought provoking.  I had to force myself to continue reading it but all in all, it was not totally unbearable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Gives a clear portrayal of how men ran the world and women knew their place and the changes that occur to change things. The differences between classes as far as the wealthy and the working class. The fight to liberate Ireland. It's all very well portrayed in this series. Very enjoyable and eye opening. Can't wait for season 4.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Excelente para compartir en familila ! one of the best movies I have seen to share time with family, my children love it.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Even as a ever-so-creepy, slighty skanky shady character, I don't think I've loved McConaughey as much since he was known as Jake Brigance.  Husband and I both loved this surprisingly great movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Although this was a well written book and a one that kept me turning the pages, I would not recommend it because it was so depressing. Every character in the book was depressing and I I felt terrible after reading this book. I would much rather read something that makes me feel uplifted in the end.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|Loved this movie and really enjoyed showing to my kids. They thought it was hysterical. Glad they never did a sequel.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|Perhaps not Brandon's best novel, but certainly an enjoyable read non the less. I found some clunky leaps of logic and the characters weren't as fleshed out as I am used to with his novels, but the story line kept me engaged non the less and it was an enjoyable read. I would have given this 3 and a half stars if I could, but three will have to suffice.  I tend to hold up Brandon's work against his other works, so it is a tough standard to live up to, in my opinion. So three and a half stars that I do give is against his other works, if I were to rate it against other authors, it may even be a four.

B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Amazing album, most of the songs showcase her vocals and they are about relationships, relating to her last boyfriend Liam, they arent much party crazy songs like everyone expected, the old miley vibe is still strongly in this album. My Darlin is one of my favorites that feature future, im glas Miley took a new direction featuring artist, she is growing and getting better and better, her best album to me, I can dance to songs like SMS that grew on me, and Love Money Party, and also think of my boyfriend listening to Adore you. Good Job miley 5 stars
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Exceptional device with more functionality every month. Google is slowly making it more possible to live a standing life. For this I thank them.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|This book may not be for everyone.  I am a student on finances and wealth, so I found the information contained to be very accurate and intriguing.  You can see the case studies all around you once you get in to this book.  Millionaires (long term) are not who you think they are.  They are not the Kardashians and the Rhiannas of the world.  These people will blow through their money before they can retire.  Hard work and dedication are always the key to success.  There is no way around it, and the research contained in this book proves that out.  I feel sorry for people who live off of their parent's success.  I would read it again, and I do recommend it to people who have a desire to know the real secret to success.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was so pleased to read Doctor Sleep. It was compelling all throughout and did not drag as often as King's books can when he gets in \\"describo-mode.\\" His characterization was great--Abra popped off the pages. I do wish we'd seen more of Abra's parents, given they were thrust into Abra's shining head-first. But then again, if King had done that, I'd probably be complaining that it should have been edited down.<br /><br />I loved this effort. Keep it up, Stephen King!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I will be honest, when I first started this book I wasn't sure I would like it or not. In the end I thought it was a beautiful story of a dog´s love for his family. Stein was very creative in drafting a story in the viewpoint of a dog. So often we hear of man's love for his dog, but never the other way around. About halfway through the story it was almost impossible for me to put it down. A beautiful story that I recommend anyone to read!
B00FN811SY|5.0|What a tremendous gift from God.  I know the work was done by men/women but I feel it was directed by holy spirit.  It is so much easier to understand.  I also love the little extras included in the book to make research easier.  Thanks so very much.

6305718954|2.0|The Plot<br /><br />  This movie revolves around the discovery of the Gospel of Thomas in 1945. The Vatican assigned three men to translate it. When it was discovered that the message of the book would undermine the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, the project was aborted. Two of the men refused to give it up and were excommunicated; the third became a Vatican bureaucrat.<br />  The movie opens at the death of one of the two men in San Paulo, Brazil. Although he had died, a statute of the Virgin Mary was bleeding in the sanctuary where he had served as priest (not a Roman Catholic parish). A Vatican investigator discovered it and learned it was human blood. While his investigation is ongoing, a woman traveling in Brazil buys the rosary of the dead priest in an open market. She mails it to her daughter in America, along with other souvenirs. Almost immediately the daughter, who does not believe in God, begins to have unusual experiences.<br />  Although she is immoral, she begins to experience bleeding in her wrists, which later include bleeding on her feet, as well. This phenomenon creates enough publicity that the Vatican sends the same investigator. He initially concludes that it cannot be a legitimate case of stigmata, because this phenomenon always happens to devout people. However, over the course of time he sees enough that it makes a believer out of him.<br />  The girl has experiences which seem more like cases of possession. A male voice speaks through her in another language and she writes on the wall in a form of Aramaic. The investigator sends pictures of all this to the Vatican. The message is from the Gospel of Thomas.<br />  Ultimately, the Roman Catholic Church tries to kill the girl, but the investigator rescues her. He returns back to the Brazilian church and discovers a translated copy of the Gospel of Thomas hidden in the church by the old priest before he died. The movie ends with a very obvious attempt to connect the girl to St Francis of Assisi. Then text appears on the screen informing the viewer that the Gospel of Thomas was discovered in 1945 and that the Vatican had declared it to be heresy. It was intended to raise questions in the viewers mind concerning the motives of the Roman Catholic Church in banning the Gospel of Thomas.<br /><br />The Message<br /><br />  The message of the film is that the messenger is not important, only the message. Although the girl uses profanity, attempts to seduce the priest, and does not believe in God, her message is that the Gospel of Thomas is authentic. The reason we know her message is true is because of the stigmata associated with her. Underlying all this is the current mind set which encourages spirituality, but not through organized religion.<br />  Since the purpose of the movie is to draw attention to the Gospel of Thomas, we must examine the message of that book. Why would Hollywood be so interested in promoting this book? The liberal Jesus Seminar treats it as the fifth gospel. This movie portrays it as the only gospel Jesus wrote and as more accurate than the other accounts. Ironically, a generation which has little knowledge of the four gospels may get excited about this new \\"gospel.\\"<br />  Liberal scholars show great excitement over this discovery for the following reasons:<br />  1. Their faith in the Bible, and specifically in the four gospels, has been destroyed through higher criticism -- especially source criticism, form criticism, and redaction criticism. In the movie, one Vatican authority explained, \\"We're all blind men in a dark cave looking for a candle which was lit 2000 year ago.\\" In other words, the information in the Bible cannot be trusted to be accurate. But the priest begins praying again after being convinced of the authenticity of the Gospel of Thomas. He admitted he had not prayed for a long time. The message is clear. We can believe the Gospel of Thomas, even if we cannot accept the Bible.<br />  2. They tend to believe that the New Testament canon of Scripture is not closed, but that God will continue to give new revelation.<br />  3. This belief in an open canon is sometimes based upon a misunderstanding of progressive revelation. While God did reveal himself progressively, the canon is closed because the faith was once for all delivered to the saints (Jude 3). There were no more apostles by AD 100, since an apostle had to be an eyewitness to Jesus Christ. Therefore the office of an apostle terminated along with the revelatory gift through which the Holy Spirit inspired the apostles to write the Word of God. The Church never accepted apocraphical [secret] or pseudepigraphal [falsely ascribed] books because the messenger and the message are important. A book written under a false name, usually an apostle's name to give it apostolic authority, could not be from God because it is based upon deception. There were no serious attempts to add books to the canon until the Roman Catholic Council of Trent in 1546, which had its own ulterior motives. They added the apocraphical books at the Council of Trent in 1546 because they needed some basis for their teaching on purgatory. They added 13 books which fit between the Old and New Testament. However, there are about 50 gospels which are falsely ascribed to an apostle; The Gospel of Thomas would be one of this 50.<br />  The Gospel of Thomas was not written by the apostle Thomas, but is dated about AD 140. But part of the theme of the movie is that the messenger is not important. In other words, it is not important how this book got here; just accept it. Ironically, it has not been subjected to the same criticism that the Bible has received.<br />  Jesus did not write The Gospel of Thomas, since he left this world in AD 30. Jesus did not write anything, but he is the Living Word of God. Everything in the written Word of God points to him. The genre of a \\"gospel\\" is defined as an eyewitness narrative written so that the reader would believe on Jesus Christ. Actually, the Gospel of Thomas cannot be called a \\"gospel\\" because it contains no narrative. It contains 114 parables, proverbs and other saying attributed to Jesus. While it contains some saying which are also found in other gospels, it does not call Jesus \\"Christ,\\" \\"Lord,\\" or \\"Savior.\\" It does not mention his death or his resurrection. The book is considered to be gnostic literature.<br />  While it would be good news if more information about Jesus had been discovered, we would expect any legitimate source to correspond, and not contradict what we have already been told. It would also be very important to establish who the author was. Was he an eyewitness or were these oral traditions passed on for generations and therefore subject to distortion?<br />  But the question must also be raised, why was this information withheld from Christians for 1800 years? And why is it now coming forth? The doctrine of progressive revelation would explain why those before Christ did not have a complete understanding of the Messiah, but since our faith under the new covenant is specifically in the person and work of Jesus Christ, why would vital information be withheld after his advent? It reminds me of an unknown will suddenly produced at the time of an estate settlement.<br />  In an age where skepticism has destroyed faith in the Jesus Christ who was revealed in the Bible, the Gospel of Thomas fits well with the modern mind set. Jesus was a teacher; nothing more. The one quote from the Gospel of Thomas that was repeated several times throughout the movie was, \\"The kingdom of God is within you and among you.\\" Another translation puts it, \\"The kingdom is inside of you and it is outside of you.\\" This statement could be interpreted to mean that all we have to do is recognize the kingdom. In other words, salvation is enlightenment, which is a gnostic concept. The so-called \\"new age\\" teaching is actually a recycling of ancient gnosticism.<br />Luke 17:21 makes a statement which sounds similar. \\"The kingdom of God is within you.\\" It has been debated whether should be translated \\"within\\" or \\"among.\\" The emphasis is not that the kingdom is essentially inward, but that the kingdom is among them in the person of the king. Since Jesus was speaking to unbelieving Pharisees, the kingdom could not have been within them. Insight concerning the kingdom is not based on observation (v 20) or speculation, but is based on the presence of Christ. The kingdom may not be spectacular, but its influence is visible.<br />The interpretation given throughout the movie is that spirituality is a personal matter, not organized religion. But the kingdom of God is not within all humanity. Only those who are born again are in the kingdom of God (John 3:5).<br /><br />What about the stigmata?<br /><br />  The authentication of the message in the movie is the stigmata. This word is used in Galatians 6:17 where Paul says he bears in his body the marks [stigmata] of Jesus. This is the only place this word is used in Scripture. Does it mean that Paul bore the nail prints, foot prints, and wound in his side, just like Christ? Or is Paul making a comparison between the sufferings of Christ and his own sufferings as an apostle for Christ? Although Paul had a thorn in the flesh (2 Cor 12:7) and did endure physical affliction (2 Cor 11:24-27), there is no record that he actually received the same wounds as did Christ.<br />  There is no record that anyone did until the case of Francis of Assisi in the 13th century. McClintock and Strong, writing in their Cyclopedia between 1867-1887 concluded that cases of stigmatization have occurred, yet rarely outside the Roman Catholic Church. It is a stroke of genius that the screen writers use a Roman Catholic phenomenon to discredit the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. Yet their previous movie credits include predominately horror and occult-type films. This hardly qualifies them as theologians. Their concept of God seems to include a mixture of both good and evil. The unnecessary violence in this film earned it an \\"R rating.<br />  In this discussion it must be emphasized that the five wounds received by Christ in his passion were substitutionary. He suffered for us. In no sense can it be suggested that anyone, including Francis of Assisi, suffered on our behalf. At best, the stigmata only witness to the unique suffering of Christ. I think stigmatization tends to occur among Roman Catholic mystics because of their emphasis on his passion. The Catholic crucifix portrays Christ on the cross, but he is no longer suffering on a cross. He is reigning on a throne. Therefore, our identity with him is better portrayed as communion with him through prayer.<br />  I am also concerned that the stigmata becomes an apologetic for the faith. Charismatics, with their emphasis on signs and wonders, also use physical manifestations as proof of spiritual realities. But the evidence of the Holy Spirit is holy living and the greatest witness to the atoning work of Christ is a transformed character, not some bleeding palm.<br />  And yet this brings us to the greatest weakness of the film. The screen writers use the historical phenomenon of stigmata as a basis for this fictional account and the purpose of this fictional account is to prove the validity of the Gospel of Thomas. The phenomenon of stigmata and the authenticity of the Gospel of Thomas are two unrelated subjects which are only brought together in this film. Even if we accept that the phenomenon of stigmata has occurred, we have not proven anything about the Gospel of Thomas.<br /><br />The dilemma of half truths<br /><br />  As a Protestant I do not accept the papacy nor the exclusive claim of authority made by the Roman Catholic Church. However, I can accept such Catholic mystics as Francis of Assisi as true followers of Christ. Their devotion does not validate the papal system, however.<br />  But the message of the film seems to advocatea personal spirituality that is not connected organizationally. This is a false dilemma. My faith need not either be reduced to the institution of Roman Catholicism or personal mysticism. The means of grace includes participation in a local assembly of Christian believers.<br />  While the message is more important than the messenger, again this is a half truth. It does matter how the message arrived and through what channels it came. It does seem, however, in the movie that the girl is transformed into a saint through the process of bearing the message. There is an element of truth here. Handling the Word of God should transform the messenger. Yet she never repents of her sin, renounces her atheism, nor confesses faith in Jesus Christ.<br />  Again, while this movie acknowledges the existence of God, he is a capricious god who can inflict pain because he is god. Nothing of his goodness, his grace, nor his love comes through.<br />  A fourth dilemma is that while the Gospel of Thomas does verify the historicity of Jesus Christ, it redefines him as just a man. Ironically, many who are the most open to a new revelation from God seem to have rejected the established revelation of Scripture. According to 2 Thess 2:9-12 they are wide open to deception.<br />  Therefore I do not accept either the authority of the Roman Catholic Church or the authenticity of the Gospel of Thomas. While the movie is actually a search for spiritual reality, it only gives two options -- the institutionalism of Roman Catholicism or the mysticism of The Gospel of Thomas.<br />  Other options in the search for spirituality is a return to the tradition of the Orthodox Church, which split from Rome in AD 1054. My opinion is that they are as corrupt as Rome, but their saints are also worth reading. John Wesley reprinted 50 volumes of these saints and mystics called The Christian Library. He included both Catholic and Orthodox writers.<br />  A fourth option, which I am more interested in, is the movement led by Thomas Oden to discover the consensus of Christian thought for the first 500 years. Oden is producing the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture in 27 volumes. He would not advocate adding new books to the biblical canon, but would make available the earliest Christian interpretations on the Bible. He has also produced a 3-volume theology based upon what the early Church taught. He and I would both conclude, I think, that historic Methodism was a revival of apostolic Christianity.<br />  A spiritual revival is coming, but it must be a balance between the emotional, the intellectual, and the ethical. Most movements only have part of the equation. It must transform the head, the heart, and the hands. We must be scholars, mystics, and activists.nt which sounds similar. \\"The kingdom of God is within you.\\" It has been debated whether should be translated \\"within\\" or \\"among.\\" The emphasis is not that the kingdom is essentially inward, but that the kingdom is among them in the person of the king.

B00102FELM|5.0|These guys just plain out rock and this dvd, is great, puts you right there in the middle of all of it and makes you want to get your guitar, real or air, out and start playing along and throwing shapes. Buy this, turn it up, and just let it all go. Scorpians are a good time whether you are at home or in the middle of the crowd, actually there!
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Really fun game.  Love the graphics.  It is very challenging and I would recommend that you download it.  Worth the price.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book. It has such great values and lessons to teach kids and adults. I will recommend it to everyone.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|this book is awesome!! i don'think some other books bet this one which is very funny!! also my favorite character of always was Greg Heffley!! also…<br />  -thanks mom for buying me this book!!
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|This movie stays pretty true to the book. I relate because sometimes my dad would make me stay for family TV time. I have a policy of never doing that to my kids now, thanks to this movie!<br /><br />As a parent, I don't like how it becomes ok to be malicious to parents/principal who are &#34;the bad guys&#34; in this show. There are better ways to work with adults who are not good. So if you're picky about such things, that my make you uncomfortable too.<br /><br />Other than those issues, it is a cute show suitable I'd say for ages 5/6 on up. Little kids seem to get more scared.
B0030Y11XS|1.0|Michael Moore's purpose was to advocate revolution which would overthrow capitalism and replace it with socialism. The most frustrating aspect of the DVD was that he never defined either capitalism or socialism. Capitalism was accused of taking advantage of misfortune. Capitalists were called vultures and capitalism was labeled a radical evil. It was implied that socialism was the solution to the problem.<br /><br />But rather than presenting a logical explanation of why capitalism was inherently evil and why socialism was inherently good, Moore focused on personal cases of individuals who were evicted from their homes. While he presented several scenarios which were designed to create sympathy for the victim, we never really were told what had transpired. I do not doubt that in at least some instances the banks or companies were wrong, but it does not logically follow that because of particular cases of abuse that the entire capitalistic system is the problem. Moore employed a technique called guilt by association. There was not necessary a logical connection between the specific cases he was presenting and the case he was attempting to make against capitalism.<br /><br />It is interesting that the movie opened with an attempt to compare Rome to the U. S. However, the Roman empire was a dictatorship. As long as I have lived I have heard preachers talk about why Rome fell and use that as a warning that America, too, could fall. They gave such reasons as free bread and circuses, high taxation and immorality, but never before had I heard that it fell because it was capitalistic. In fact, it was not.<br /><br />All of the ancient world empires were dictatorships in which the king, pharaoh, or caesar claimed to be god. They were wealthy at the expense of their subjects and there was not a middle class. At a later point in history kings appealed to divine authority for their legitimacy. This argument was called the divine right of kings, meaning that it is God's will for you to obey me. Finally, we had an atheistic world empire called communism in which the state was god.<br /><br />However, we also see in history the magna carta and later the social contract. This concept is based on the biblical idea of covenants in which the subjects must agree to the terms under which they are governed. Thus the highest authority in the U. S. is the constitution. The point of a constitution is limited government. The government only has the right to exercise authority in areas where that is conceded by the people.<br /><br />Moore's reference to our constitution was very disappointing. He asks a guard where in the constitution capitalism was prescribed and not getting a satisfactory answer implied that it is not in the constitution. He picks up three phrases, &#34;we the people,&#34; &#34;welfare,&#34; and &#34;union&#34; to imply that socialism is prescribed. This argument would not convince anyone who is beyond grade school. &#34;We the people&#34; actually refers to the consent of the governed to grant the government certain limited power. &#34;To promote the general welfare&#34; does not prescribe a welfare state, but actually means that individual citizens collectively surrender certain freedom for the common good. &#34;A more perfect union&#34; does not refer to labor unions, but to a collective agreement.<br /><br />Here I have to digress to say that the use of the term &#34;more perfect&#34; is highly irregular. If something is perfect, how can it become more perfect? Actually we are still trying to perfect our union. That means our government is not perfect and we are still working at it. And so it is legitimate to have these kinds of civil discourses.<br /><br />But before we continue we have to define some terms. So what is capitalism? Capitalism is a free market economy in which the government does not interfere with buying and selling. The old term was laissez faire, a French term which means literally &#34;let it be.&#34; In practice it means that transactions between private parties are free from state intervention, including restrictive regulations, taxes, tariffs and enforced monopolies. It is the belief that the market forces of supply and demand will work things out.<br /><br />In 2003 while in Nigeria there was unrest in the streets because petro was too high. A general strike was planned. And so the government stepped in an determined the price of petro. Did that solve the problem? No, although petro was reasonably priced you could not find a station which was open. The owners determined to close their stations rather than sell at a loss. And so the government backed down and the stations reopened.<br /><br />The alternative is for a special interest group to appeal to the government for protection or privilege. When the government begins to interfere with market forces they tend to make things worse. If it sides with the workers against the owners, the owners will shut down because the playing field is not level. If it sides with business and banks against the workers, you have corporate greed.<br /><br />And here is where I want to give Moore his due. The best part of the movie was his documentation of what happened with the recent bailout. Moore blamed both sides - a Republican president and a Democratic congress. However, his conclusion was wrong. This was not free-market capitalism at work - it was in fact socialism. Socialism is when the government takes charge of certain sectors of the economy.<br /><br />Here I need to comment on a couple of coops that Moore featured. I like the coop model of ownership and management, but I would not regard it as socialism because it is not government control or manipulation of market forces. However, I find it interesting that Moore advocates the coop saying that it has proven itself to be lucrative. But that is an appeal to capitalism! In a sense when I buy stock in a company that also allows me a share in the profits. Profit sharing is not a unique concept. Even Walmart offers that to their employees.<br /><br />It seems to me that when you come to the economy you either have to leave it alone or control it all. Socialism is kind of a half-way house to communism. Communism is where the government controls all aspects of life. There is no middle class in communism. Everyone shares the wealth - but there is no wealth unless you are a bureaucrat. In other words, everyone is equal but some of us are more equal than others.<br /><br />Throughout history no attempt to implement communism has succeeded. You know enough about hippy communes to verify that. There is no incentive to work when you do not keep the rewards of you labor. Yes, I believe in helping the helpless but I believe that should be voluntary and not a compulsory redistribution of wealth under the authority of a government bureaucratic system. No one has my best interests at heart better than I do. All I ask from my government is to be left alone. My faith is in a big God, not big government.<br /><br />And so capitalism provides freedom but there is also risk. Socialism provides security, but at the expense of freedom. I was interested that Moore was enamored with Roosevelt's second bill of rights. According to Roosevelt I have the right to a good paying job, a house, an education, and health care. But who will administer these &#34;rights&#34;? Government interference has driven up the price of housing, education, and health care.<br /><br />What if the government guarantees me a good paying job making widgets, but there is no longer any demand for widgets? The socialistic model says the government should subsidize our widget plant. But when you subsidize something for which there is no market you only compound the problem. Look at the recent example with the Volt car, a glorified golf cart. The Obama administration used our tax dollars to bail out GM and they created a car which no one wants. Under a capitalistic system it is no one's business what I drive. Under a socialistic government, they make Volts and under communism no one has a car unless they are a government leader.<br /><br />In the olden days, when people lost their job they often found a different line of work. I would not even think of asking the government to guarantee my job. I believe in self-reliance and a work ethic. That coupled with a free market means that I just need to discover what there is a market for. No need to subsidize the making of buggy whips when you can get a job at the automobile factory.<br /><br />I would assert that the U. S. has not operated on a truly free market economy since the days of Roosevelt. Roosevelt was influence by the economic theory of John Maynard Keynes. Keynes was a socialist who said you can stimulate the economy if the government will spend money fast enough. From the days of Roosevelt forward both parties have operated under Keynesian economics. The conservatives just did not spend it as fast. In 1971, Nixon - a Republican, said &#34;we are all Keynesians now.&#34; In early American history some presidential campaigns were based on a &#34;hard currency,&#34; meaning that debt or credit was illegal. This would prohibit fractional reserve banking in which a bank only retains a small percentage of its assets.<br /><br />The immorality of Keynesian economics is that it is based on easy credit. The recent banking scandals prove the bankruptcy of Keynesian economics in selling bad debt and getting to government to guarantee it. While Moore touted the superiority of the European socialism, what we are seeing right now, especially in Greece, is the collapse of their economy. The Obama administration recently used our tax money to bail out the European banks. When you have more takers than givers, any system will collapse. We may not be far behind.<br /><br />And so I agree that we need a revolution. But I would advocate overthowing our existing socialism and returning to capitalism. I further would charge Moore with hypocrisy. He himself is a capitalist who is worth $50 million. But socialists always want to use my money to fix the problem. If he is so committed to socialism, he could start by distributing some of his wealth.<br /><br />According to Moore, Jimmy Carter tried to warn us. But Carter was an inept president who got us into a recession. According to Moore, Ronald Reagan was the problem. I believe firmly that Reagan was the greatest president of my lifetime and that Roosevelt was the one who got us into the problem.<br /><br />According to Moore, Obama was elected to effect change and his election is the beginning of a revolution. But Moore also said that Timothy Geithner had failed at everything he had attempted. But Obama appointed him as Secretary of the Treasury! I think Obama has been a disappointment even to his supporters. Now as he seeks re-election he is making high-dollar speeches to the wealthy 1% while the occupy wall-street movement is trying to implement Moore's vision for a revolution.<br /><br />I was very disappointed when Bush bailed out the banks. Bush ran as a conservative, but remember we have not have a truly free market president for a hundred years. I think he should have let the banks deal with their own problem. If they are true capitalists, let them risk their own money without using taxpayers money as their safety net.<br /><br />And I am not opposed to evicted homeowners moving back into their homes as squatters. I think that high interest is immoral and in the case that Moore documented, if they had paid their mortgage for 22 years they had probably paid the bank twice what the house was worth already.<br /><br />I think Moore is misguided to encourage class warfare. I think everyone pays too much in taxes. I am not envious of anyone's wealth. I want everyone to prosper. I am not in favor of rationing the pieces of the pie, I am in favor of having a bigger pie. I think Moore is naive in his understand of socialism. Yethe ended the movie with L' Internationale, the anthem of international socialism.<br /><br />Then he ended with Merle Haggard singing a song that implied that Jesus was killed for attacking capitalism or at least the establishment. Jesus died on the cross to atone for our sins, but I would agree that he did offend the establishment. Throughout the movie Moore appealed to Jesus in a very selective way. Essentially Moore employed liberation theology. When communism found it hard to make inroads into South America, because it was strongly Roman Catholic and they were atheistic, they developed liberation theology which basically said that Jesus was a revolutionary like all of the other Marxists. Of course this is just propaganda.<br /><br />I think Moore's whole movie is basically a propaganda piece designed to create an uninformed reaction to capitalism and a revolution that will lead to something no one has really thought through. And how can we have a civil discourse if their leader is a sheepdog named Shelby?<br /><br />Remember that all progress requires change, but not all change is progress. I share the occupy wall street frustration with the bank bailouts, but I just don't see that camping out in the city park will change what needs changing. We are going to have to educate ourselves about how the economy works and then hold our leaders accountable. We need less government interference. We are going to have to get out of debt, take charge of our own future, and not depend upon anyone else to take care of us. The price of cradle to grave security is the loss of freedom and I am unwilling to give it up. If we do they will end up using us to take care of themselves.<br /><br />A much better approach to economics is John Wesley's sermon &#34;The Use of Money.&#34; In it he advocates three points:<br /><br />• Gain all you can - this is the principle of industry or capitalism<br />• Save all you can - this is the principle of economy or stewardship<br />• Give all you can - this is the principle of charity or compassionate capitalismess what I drive.

B00EYKRI1Q|5.0|This is a good compilation, remastered very well, and a good start for anyone looking to get into the Clash. I would highly recommend this. I got it because it was a good compilation and sometimes I am not in the humour to listen to listen to an whole album and I just want to skip around. So buy this if you want to check out the Clash, or have just discovered them, it's worth the whole 5 bucks for an Mp3.
B00EW7AHJG|4.0|This is one of those movies that you could see over and over again very convenient using Amazon prime<br />George
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Really well designed app for youtube videos. Nice and clear videos and excellent fit for Kindle Fire HD. Highly recommend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book! It is very well written. I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this book.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Breathtaking visual effects.  This ins't just a good action film based on a comic, it is a good movie in general.  Some enthusiasts may get upset about the details in parrallel with the comic, but this is a film that anyone can enjoy without knowing the background of Iron Man.<br /><br />Exceptional cast = exceptional movie. A+
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book will make you realize what is important in life. You have to really think about what the text is saying but once you do, it makes sense. This book is amazing and I will read multiple times. You can't just take this book lightly to understand it, it requires thinking and rereading but in the end it's very rewarding. This is one of the best books I've ever read.
B0076XDGZ0|4.0|Considering who all is involved with this band, I was expecting a bit better, especially after some of the reviews of this album. This is good, and worth the cheap price especially if you're a fan of the players involved; Having said that, I can't say it's a buy or die kind of deal. Use your own discretion, scan through it first before you decide.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great acting, great storylines, can't wait till following week to see next episode.I see this show going on for at least 10 seasons or more.Keep it up!!
B0019IB0II|5.0|Was very good I enjoyed the book about how she got through the stroke. It brought a smile to my face talking about how she was treated .
0399255370|5.0|A very clever book - a nice combination of child and adult humor. Probably best for 4 to 8 years
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|To me, this is the best rap album of the year. The Evian Christ track \\"I'm In It\\" is a highlight, as is the HudMo track \\"Blood on the Leaves\\". The production is amazing. It is so rich and textured that it makes everything else sound flat.<br /><br />Kanye's raps are amazing. He is not technically gifted, but I am always interested in what he is saying. Other rappers (Jay-Z, ASAP Rocky, and countless others) usually don't say anything interesting, but Kanye's gift is being provocative and insane<br /><br />I never disliked this album, but it did take a while to grow on me. If you don't like it, I suggest skipping the first four tracks. \\"Bound2\\" and \\"Hold My Liquor\\" are pretty accessible anchors -and from there, you might start exploring some of the other tracks.
B000IMVMGQ|5.0|I love this film...spectacular!!! Some of my favorite actors that make this film. You can feel the history & drama!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best books I've read on a long long time! I don't even like science fiction but this book was spellbinding. I instantly felt like I knew the characters and the suspense and intrigue were inescapable. It's made that much better by Hugh Howey's story- self published on amazon?! Awesome.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Child strike again! Love their clear, precise writing. Stories just keep you reading on forever.I have a goal to not miss a single one of their books.
B00F0AAC26|5.0|My favorite thing about Elvis Costello is that he has never stopped experimenting and stretching, and this album fits that bill once again.  His plaintive voice and incredible lyrics (one of the great songwriters of the last 35 years) combine so well with the musical talents of The Roots that this is a no-lose album for fans of either Elvis or The Roots.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|and these books are very readable and quite involved.  I read the 1st one last year, and then the 2nd in July, and decided that I couldn't wait to find the 3rd in Library and as I am sure that I will reread this series decided to download to Kindle.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Perfect for meaning, synonyms not only for me, but when working with my 8 year old granddaughter in reading stories, homework, etc.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Very unique style of writing,just reading this autobiography was not only awesome but it also sent great visuals in my mind as I read each page.
B004HV54TU|3.0|I LOVed this mouse. After suffering for years with forearm aches and shoulder pain, I finally found a mouse that was comfortable to use and absolutely ergonomic. I was thrilled with it. However, recently the cursor started freezing and disappearing. Then there were long periods when I couldn't scroll or click on pages. I noticed these coincided with the light-up Evoluent logo dimming or flickering or going out. But I was in denial. I tried plugging it into alternate ports. I waited. Tonight, the Evoluent light went out for good. It died. Mouse lasted just 18 months. Sadly, not a sign of good quality as far as I'm concerned. Still, if I can't find another mouse of similar design, I  might buy another one. It's just that comfortable to use.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read The Shining in preparation for the new book Dr. Sleep.  I'm a big fan of Stephen King but I'd never read The Shining.  The movie is one of my favorites and I assumed the book was pretty much the same.  I was surprised by how different the book is from the movie.  I really enjoy watching the movie and although the book was not exactly like the movie it was a great read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun mindlessly entertaining game. It is responsive by touching the cards, they do not have to be dragged to the appropriate spot.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love this author's style of story telling about serious subjects while still interlacing a sense of humor and shaping her characters as multi- dimensional, real life people. Will recommend it to all my friends and family as a must read. Have become a Liane Moriarty fan after reading this story and What Alice Forgot. Looking forward to reading her other novels.
B00E7SFAAG|3.0|Like the title says the game is really adictive and fun but have a lot of crashes and it get slow sometimes.<br />Have an LG Optimus L9
B009OYSFDM|5.0|If you watched Smallvile you would have grown to love Jason Hartley who played green arrow, but this Arrow is nothing like that and in fact the main actor does a lot of his own stunts.  This is a great storyline with good actors and special effects.  Season 2 just started (Oct 2013) so hurry up and watch this!
B00FEN1C50|1.0|I wasn't able to get more than 10 minutes into the movie without it locking up and forcing me to reboot my PS3.  Netflix, Hulu and Pandor all worked fine so the issue was on Amazon's end.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Fun and easy read. Lots of insights in a unique format. Great change of pace from most non-fiction books. Loved it!
B004OYCUWE|5.0|Love, love, love this album! Still stands up well today, probably more so then its follow up Controversy. Prince knows how to jam and push buttons!
B005HSL626|2.0|Glitches on my kindle fire hd and stops responding. Also, the permissions are a little ridiculous for this game. Otherwise it's ok at best
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game And say that it's the best game ever is you can play it offline, it dose not burn battery fast and it's just a really good game t was free @ the app store.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is a blast, I spend a lot of time playing and have made many friends! The rooms have items that you can collect for prizes and that makes it even more fun. PLAYING BINGO IS GOOD CLEAN FUN!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Good story line, original and creative. Characters very believable including the depiction of Atlanta. Story kept you guessing on who the killer was. The conclusion was written well.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A scary and intense follow up on the life of Danny Torrence. The Shining is one of my favorite King novels and this sequel does not disappoint!
B004OYCV2I|5.0|Great album-funk and the Purple One at his finest! Let's Work an awesome dance track! Controversy and Sexuality pure excellence. Some of the songs are dated, but still a great listen! I must be honest when I bought this back when I was a kid, I was mortified of the poster that came with the vinyl. Which led me to be ashamed of purchasing this album. I secretly listened to it but threw away the poster! Glad to see it is now out on 180 gram vinyl and that silly poster is included!! Go figure.
B009NY43NY|5.0|What can I say? Sookie is definitely one of my favorite fictional characters. She is real and I can relate to her character on some level. I was so sad when I found out there would be no more Sookie Stackhouse books. I am still searching for another great series to read.<br />I was happy that a lot of loose ends were tied up neatly, and that Sookie was able to get a happy ending.<br /><br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />If you do not want to read spoilers or anything about the ending, then do not continue reading this.<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />Okay, with that said, I think most fans have come down too hard on this book and Charlaine Harris. I loved Eric. I still do, but I was happy for Sookie when she chose someone else. From Book 1, Sookie expresses at one time or another that she wants a normal life. We can see this when she thinks about how Bill will never have breakfast with her, or be with her during the day. She was saddened by that thought. Just because she loved Eric, doesn't mean those feelings faded out. That was one of the main things she liked about Quinn.<br />Sam was her friend. He stayed her friend through everything. When she needed help, he was there. He listened when she needed to talk. He helped to protect her when she needed it. I am happy she realized she loved Sam, because it was pretty obvious he loved her.<br />Eric and her had no real future. If she had continued with Eric, they probably would have been together 10 years, tops. She would've been older, and I doubt he would have wanted her sexually anymore by then. And what about children? She couldn't have them with him. She would have ended up alone, and that is not where I wanted to see Sookie end up. Eric chose what was best for him, like he has done his whole life. Yes, he loved Sookie, but she was just a phase of his thousands of years of existence. He will get bored with the vamp queen eventually. Sookie can have a real lifewith Sam.<br />Thank you Charlaine Harris for not ruining Sookie for me. I do not know what I would have done if Sookie was stupid enough to be Eric's mistress, or worse, his vamp-child.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Simply put, \\"The Paradigm Shift\\" is a modern rock masterpiece. It's Korn's hardest album in years, but it also manages to be more melodic and diverse than previous efforts, meaning that the album will please not only the die hard fans of Korn's early work, but any fan of modern rock.<br /><br />\\"Prey for Me\\" is a crushing intro, an absolutely brutal tune with a catchy chorus. \\"Love and Meth\\" is an intense and emotional second track, one of the best on the album. \\"Spike in my Veins\\" is one of Korn's hardest tracks ever, and still catchy. It's impossible to sit still while listening to these songs!!<br /><br />\\"Never Never\\" is the album's first single, and it's the only track reminiscent of the previous effort, \\"The Path of Totality.\\" It's a great track regardless. \\"Punishment Time\\" is more of a slow burn, but it hits heavy too at times, and the band's vocals and harmonies are right on. The deluxe edition has two additional tracks, \\"I Wish I wasn't Born Today\\" which is okay, and \\"Tell Me What You Want\\" which is outstanding.<br /><br />All in all, Korn returns with not only a solid effort to please their fans, but an overall great rock album by any standard. For the first time, the band shows the promise to not only grow older gracefully, but the ability to reinvent themselves by doing what they do best, which is make music on their own terms. So rarely does a band make an album this great so far along into their careers.
B002VECM4A|4.0|this movie had me in tears and really feeling like i was there with the main character. this is not a movie that i would want my kids to watch because of the scenes. it's a very heart felt movie that will have you cheering in the end.
0307341577|4.0|I liked this better than Gone Girl in terms of the characters and the need to find out what was going on. The style of the novel, using a different point of view in different chapters and only getting little glimpses was very effective in obscuring the truth. The reader was genuinely able to feel like a solver, or even Libby, just trying to uncover the details of that faithful night.<br /><br />I realize that Gillian Flynn's characters tend to irritate me and in gone girl i almost hated both main characters. This isn't a bad thing, I don't like them because they're never shining examples of human beings. They're flawed, many times beyond redemption. I think that's a bit refreshing. In this story a lot of the characters are young, damaged and/or desperate, so I found I had sympathy for some of them and I cared about what happened.<br /><br />*******(Not spoiler but gives an idea, so spoilerish)******<br /><br />I'm still not sure i like the final reveal. I'm ok with the motivations etc. I just feel a little cheated because of the left field kind of blindsided feel I got with one of the final chapters. But it did feel nice when all the little pieces finally clicked into place. It was like being in a dark room, lighting tiny candle by tiny candle until finally you were able to see the whole room.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this one.
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|It's just a great show!  Great chemistry between all of the cast.  Fun to watch!  I would recommend it for a nice, refreshing and sometimes humorous show to watch!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|excellent movie,, bit of humor, lots of action, kept my attention till the end. would recommend it to anyone would watch it again to see if i missed anything.,
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This great album is less than an hour, but a good &#34;get up and go&#34; type folk. Good party folk music.
B0060ANZ2Y|5.0|EWF never disappoints; this is music to move your soul to love, joy, kindness and of course, gratitude.<br /><br />Buy this music, listen to this music and share this music with all generations, please!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I like this show because the characters display a great work, the drama is ok, but the fabulous way the good wife handles her private life
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's really fun though the graphics and controls are a little different.<br />It's hilarious and can make any one laugh.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It is very awesome l love this app use it almost every single day so cool love the mountain song  great!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I have to say that I knew what was coming because I h a d started to read the sequel first but it was still shocking at the end to find out what had really happened to everyone. Read this and think about the hole in the ozone layer, global warming, the energy crisis, pollution from billions of automobiles and coal fired power plants, and imagine what all this is doing to us and our planet. Think about it.
B007DIQC90|5.0|These great folk artists are at the start of a great career. I'm sure they will go far. check out &#34;Dirty Paws&#34; for sure!
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|I love this game it reminds me of fight night round 3 a lil bit its fun looks good and plays good well worth 99cents you have to get ti's game
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|I play this a lot, and it is fun .It has very cool neon colors, I also like how you can change the colors. I wish that it had a two player version though, so my sister and<br />I or my friends  can play together. It is also challenging, even the easy version. Try playing it in a dark room, if you think you'd like that kind of thing.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|One of my favorite movies from my childhood. I received it on time, the DVD worked, and I was satisfied with my purchase.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have not had it long but so far it is really cool. It did take a little bit to get it synced up but that was not bad and it needs more apps like amazon or crakle.
B00E3QJ7FG|1.0|(Review is for the Blu-ray, not the movie which is a classic)<br /><br />Please do not make the mistake I did and give Universal money for this insult to this great 80's movie.<br /><br />I had assumed they were doing something special with it as they hadn't released it years earlier as most of the studio cash grabs did where they just released their DVD scans at the higher resolution.  I was wrong sadly as this has to be from the very old DVD scan they did.  Universal put more money into the package than they did the movie as the image is full of digital macroblocking, smearing and other issues.  I originally thought I had put in the DVD instead of the Blu-ray until I remembered it didn't come with one..<br /><br />Very, very disappointing that Universal wouldn't take the time to do a new scan using current technology and treat this with the respect like a large number of other 80's movies have received.  This is sadly just blatant consumer rip-off.

B00BT70J0Y|5.0|Fritz Reiner is the darling of used record dealers.<br />Audiophiles pay astronomical prices for his RCA &#34;plum label&#34; and &#34;shaded dog&#34; LP pressings.<br /><br />[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]<br /><br />Chicago's Orchestra Hall was the venue Mercury Records used for a highly praised series of &#34;Living Presence&#34; LPs, 1951-1953, conducted by Raphael Kubelik: [[ASIN:B000A5DLPQ Kubelik Conducts]]<br />The ultimate in orchestral sound during the monaural era. Orchestra Hall also proved to be the ideal location for RCA's &#34;Living Stereo&#34; LP recordings wth Fritz Reiner, produced between 1954 and 1963.<br />A better recording studio than concert hall - the room actually sounded better empty. Produced by Richard Mohr and John Pfeiffer, engineer Lewis Layton.<br />After Reiner's retirement, Orchestra Hall was remodeled with disastrous results, which effectively sabotaged the tenure of his successor Jean Martinon.<br />Decca tried a number of different recording venues for Georg Solti, but none could match the old sound of Orchestra Hall.<br /><br />Fritz Reiner was always a conductor I respected more than loved, but respect can take you a long way.<br />He had the strangest conducting technique I've ever seen.<br />Captured on DVD: [[ASIN:B000274TNA Chicago Symphony Orchestra Historic Telecasts 1953-1954: Fritz Reiner]] - and - [[ASIN:B00009UVXE Chicago Symphony Orchestra Historic Telecasts: Reiner/Hindemith/Stokowski]]<br />He held a small baton waist-high, and moved it maybe 6 inches (15 centimeters) in any direction; a perpetual scowl on his face.<br />Otto Klemperer conducted with a perpetual scowl on his face, but he couldn't help it.<br />Surgery to remove a brain tumor left him partially paralyzed for the last 30 years of his life.<br />Fritz Reiner was a mean old man.<br />He scowled and meant it.<br /><br />Unlike most conductors, Fritz Reiner wasn't interested in leaving posterity with &#34;Complete&#34; editions of the symphonic repertoire. He recorded only those works that appealed to him: 6 Beethoven symphonies, 4 Mozart symphonies, 3 Haydn symphonies, 2 symphonies each by Brahms and Schubert, and a single symphony each from Dvorak, Tchaikovsky and Mahler.<br />He made a specialty of 20th Century orchestral showpieces: Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra (a work he commissioned), Prokofiev's Alexander Nevsky (sung in English), and eight LPs of Richard Strauss (a composer with whom he was closely associated in the 19teens (?).<br /><br />With the advent of stereo, RCA thought of Reiner and Chicago as the Ideal Concerto Accompanists for their biggest stars:<br />Arthur Rubinstein in Brahms and Rachmaninov; Jascha Heifetz in Brahms and Tchaikovsky.<br />But Reiner's abrasive personality got in the way, and after some especially unpleasant sessions, Rubinstein was unwilling to record with him again.<br />Despite all the tension, or perhaps because of it, the Rubinstein records (Brahms, Rachmaninov) are among the truly great recordings of the century.<br />Heifetz recorded the Sibelius Concerto with Reiner's assistant Walter Hendl, but that was due to Reiner's health issues.<br /><br />Reiner had a much better working relationship with younger, less established musicians: soprano Leontyne Price, pianists Byron Janis and Van Cliburn.<br />Maybe they were too intimidated to cross him. Wonderful performances nonetheless.<br /><br />An exception to this pattern was was the great Russian pianist Emil Gilels who collaborated happily with Reiner in a 1955 recording of the Tchaikovsky Concerto.<br />Gilels was the first Soviet pianist to record with an American orchestra. A Major Cultural Event.<br />Reiner was on his best behavior. Perhaps he wanted to show off his new orchestra.<br />This was the Chicago Symphony's first &#34;best seller&#34; on the record charts (for three years - until Van Cliburn displaced it).<br />When Gilels returned in 1958 to record the Brahms Second Concerto, Reiner had reverted to his old abrasive self.<br />No matter - this recording is also treasurable.<br /><br />Reiner mellowed a great deal following a 1960 heart attack. The &#34;Scene by the Brook&#34; in Beethoven's &#34;Pastoral&#34; Symphony (CD 59) is improbably tender and moving.<br /><br />Conclusion:  Wonderful recordings by a great conductor - terrible person - with a great orchestra in remarkable sound.<br /><br />REMASTERINGS:<br />Other than &#34;Every recording in this new 63-CD set comes from the best re-mastered source&#34;, Sony is a bit coy about the sources used, but I was able to identify three sources:<br /><br />1) &#34;Living Stereo CDs&#34; - Half the contents of this box. RCA introduced these audiophile CDs in 1993.<br />They actually used vacuum tubes in the earliest stage of the re-mastering process.<br />A big improvement over earlier &#34;Red Seal&#34;, &#34;Gold Seal&#34; and &#34;Silver Seal&#34; CD incarnations.<br />Beginning in 2004, most of Reiner's &#34;Living Stereo&#34; CDs were re-mastered as state-of-the art 24-bit SACDs.<br />These were &#34;hybrid&#34; SACDs: in addition to the SACD layer (for which you need an SACD player), they have a standard CD layer.<br />Note: The CDs in this box are 24-bit CDs, not SACDs, which means that the sound will not be as good as SACD, though this is the best these recordings have sounded on CD.<br />But I think I'll keep my SACDs. *<br /><br />2) Japanese XRCDs - Hiromuchi Takiguchi is identified as the tape mastering engineer for 12 titles in this collection. These are the hyper-expensive XRCDs, imported from Japan:<br />- Beethoven Symphonies 6,7, Fidelio Overture ---- Brahms Piano Concerto 2 (Emil Gilels)<br />- Liszt Mephisto Waltz ---- Mozart Divertimento, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik ---- Prokofiev Lt.Kije<br />- Strauss Also Sprach Zarathustra (1962) ---- Stravinsky Song of the Nightingale ---- Tchaikovsky Symphony 6, 1812 Overture.<br />All but the Beethoven 6, Brahms and Mozart were previously issued as &#34;Living Stereo&#34; CDs.<br />Sony chose XRCD over &#34;Living Stereo&#34;.<br />XRCDs have greater clarity, but the &#34;Living Stereo&#34; sound is warmer. At my age, I prefer warmth to clarity.<br /><br />3) New 24-bit DSD re-masterings - A third of the recordings in this box have not been on CD since the 1980's.<br />Andreas K. Meyer and Jeanne Montalvo are the tape mastering engineers responsible for the new 24-bit DSD re-masterings. This box would a great bargain for the sake of those 32 titles alone:<br />- Bach: Piano Concerto 5 (Andre Tchaikovsky)<br />- Beethoven: Symphonies 1,3,9 ---- Berlioz: Les nuits d'&eacute;t&eacute; (Leontyne Price)  ---- Brahms Symphony 3, Tragic Overture **<br />- Debussy: Ib&eacute;ria ---- Haydn: Symphonies 88,95,101  ---- Mendelssohn Hebrides Overture<br />- Mozart: Symphonies 36,39,40,41, Don Giovanni Overture, Piano Concerto 25 (Andre Tchaikovsky)<br />- Ravel: Alborada del gracioso, Valses nobles et sentimentales  ----  Rossini: 6 Overtures ----- Schubert Symphonies 5,8<br />- J. Strauss: 2 Waltzes (Artist's Life, Mein Lebenslauf ist Lieb' und Lust) ---- Tchaikovsky: Nutcracker highlights<br />These would benefit from a bass boost - but its a clean bass, so they can take it without distortion.<br /><br />Rule of thumb: If the tape transfer is the work of Hiromuchi Takiguchi, its an XRCD. If its the work of Andreas K. Meyer or Jeanne Montalvo, its a new 24-bit DSD re-mastering. Any other tape transfer engineer, its a &#34;Living Stereo&#34; re-master.<br /><br />A MYSTERY:<br />Though RCA recorded Reiner in stereo from his first Chicago session, six later sessions were issued in mono only:<br />Beethoven's Eroica, Mozart Symphonies 36, 39, 40, Divertimento K.334 and Eine Kleine Nachtmusik K.525.<br />It looks like the 1954-55 Mozart recordings will always be mono (aside from Symphony 41, which is excellent stereo).<br /><br />But there is a mystery about theEroica - On page 52 of the book:<br />&#34;Note: LM-1899 was recorded in stereo but has never been released on LP in this format. First stereo release on CD JMCXR-0019 in Japan.&#34;<br />I believe that is an XRCD catalog number, so I was expecting to hear the XRCD stereo Eroica.<br />Instead it is newly transfered in mono by Andreas K. Meyer & Jeanne Montalvo in 2013.<br /><br />Several correspondents have pointed out that JMCXR-0019 is in fact the XRCD catalog number for the stereo Eroica recorded by Munch and the Boston Symphony in 1957.<br /><br />A correspondent informs me that a light on his CD player indicates that the Eroica is stereo. My lying ears disagree.<br />I went back and re-listened on headphones. It is mono with a little added reverberation. Perhaps this is confusing the electronics in his CD player.<br />Using headphones, I compared the Eroica (CD 5) recorded December 4, 1954, with Don Juan (CD 4) recorded two days later.<br />The difference is night and day.<br />A wide, detailed stereo image for Don Juan versus an orchestra squeezed into the middle of my brain for the Eroica (it sounds better over speakers).<br />Starting to look like Reiner never recorded the Eroica in stereo.  Bummer.<br /><br />[see the comment dated January 13, 2014 for a breakdown of Reiner's early recording sessions.]<br /><br />POINTS OF INTEREST:<br /><br />- This set includes five Reiner /Chicago recordings never before on CD, outside of Japan:<br />1) Bach Keyboard Concerto 5 in F minor, BWV 1056 - Andre Tchaikovsky, piano<br />2) Mozart Piano Concerto 25 in C, K.503 - Andre Tchaikovsky, piano<br />3) Rolf Liebermann: Concerto for Jazz Band and Orchestra, &#34;Long Hairs, Hepcats - Dig that crazy Combo!&#34; (RCA publicity).<br />4) &#34;The Star-Spangled Banner&#34; - apparently intended for use in schools and at sporting events.<br />5) &#34;Fritz Reiner discusses Beethoven's 7th Symphony&#34; (59 seconds) - RCA radio promo for the LP recording.<br /><br />- Pianist Andre Tchaikovsky (no relation) is soloist in the Bach/Mozart Concertos.<br />Not one of the great pianists, but his memory lives on.<br />After retiring from music, he began a new career as a Shakespearian actor:<br />Probably the greatest Yorick of our time.<br />He left his fortune to the Royal Shakespeare Company on condition that they use his skull in future productions of Hamlet.<br />Look up &#34;Yorick&#34; on Wikipedia for a picture of an actor holding Andre Tchaikovsky's skull .............

B00138KE5Y|5.0|I grew up listening to Barbra Streisand.  Her voice is instantly recognizable and so beautiful!  This album does not disappoint.  All of your favorite songs that Barbra sand with other artists. You remember &#34;Guilty&#34;, with Barry Gibb?  Yes, that's on here.  &#34;You Don't Bring Me Flowers&#34;, with Neil Diamond?  It's on here, too.<br /><br />Just buy it...if you love Babs, you'll love this.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|so much fun that headphones can produce, and not awaken the Fam with my poor Metallica renditions @ 5AM.  amazing little piece of technology. I am going to get another, the AC30 is next. delivered earlier than promised, new in box/ atomic strength blister pack, perfect in every way as advertised!!!!  FUN!!!! PS one bummer the included battery was not up to duracell type performance and died after a couple hours. the duracell I replaced it with is over 15 hours and going strong. so this item is not raping batteries just the one is that was included.
B00FGM0IEU|4.0|I love watching historic accounts of notable subject matter from the past.  For some reason I'm just drawn into documentaries, narratives and key figure interviews from people that were first hand witnesses to key events in the history of mankind.  Muscle Shoals fits into this category wonderfully.  It is an amazing account of the history of a significant recording studio that played a huge part in the development and production of American Music culture.<br /><br />I would have willingly given a rating of 5-Stars for this gem of a production, but I'm selfish.  I wanted more and did not want it to end.  The cinematography was beautiful.  The stories that were told made me feel like I was there.  The still photographs from the past were like looking through an old family album eliciting both joyful and sad memories from the past.  One of my favorite  things about Muscle Shoals was hearing first hand stories from the artists that were there.  Wilson Picket and Keith Richards made me laugh out loud.  The recounting of Aretha Franklin's first session at the studio and the build up to the first song she recorded there, had me totally mesmerized.  The description of Etta James' persona, her strong will and the explosive talent she possessed were wonderfully described.  Then of course there were the Swampers an unlikely group of caucasian country boys that grooved on more popular recordings than you could even imagine.  Who knew?<br /><br />I would definitely recommend a viewing or the purchase of this wonderful production to anyone who enjoys history, music or just the triumph of the human spirit through daunting challenges.  Muscle Shoals is more than just a history lesson, it is a story of artistically gifted people discovering who they are and what they were created to do.  It is a story of striving for excellence in an imperfect world and sharing the successes and disappointments that make up the journey of our lives.<br /><br />I had always wanted be a session musician, like the guys in the Swampers.  My own successes and disappointments led me in different directions.  Muscle Shoals gave me a glimpse into a world that has always held a special place in my heart, which is music recording and performance.<br /><br />Watch this and be surprisingly drawn into Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  Sweet Home Alabama!an, like the guys in the Swampers.  My own successes and disappointments led me in different directions.  Muscle Shoals gave me a glimpse into a world that has always held a special place in my heart, which is music recording and performance.<br /><br />Watch this and be surprisingly drawn into Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  Sweet Home Alabama!

B00DL47RQ2|5.0|One can take and savor the brilliant, angry \\"Blue Jasmine\\" at different levels.<br /><br />As you will read many places, it's a brilliantly acted character study of Jasmine French (Cate Blanchett), one of two adopted sisters who left college before completing her anthropology degree to marry Hal Francis (Alec Baldwin), a man clearly destined for big things. As Hal's wife, Jasmine enjoys luxury homes in Manhattan and Southampton, extravagant jewelry, designer clothes, lovely vacations and the prestige that comes with being a leading hostess and fundraiser for various New York charities. She plays the part to perfection with her cultured voice and manners and subtle but exquisite taste while turning a willfully blind eye to anything that might be unsavory about Hal, whether it's his business practices or his philandering. When Hal goes to prison after it turns out his wealth is built entirely on scams, Jasmine loses everything, even her son Danny whose bitterness at his father's downfall drives him to drop out of Harvard and disappear. Carrying a Louis Vuitton suitcase and the clothes on her back, Jasmine flies to San Francisco to join her sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) and try to build a new life for herself. Ginger lacks Jasmine's ethereal looks and chameleon-like adaptability and has settled for a life Jasmine looks down on, working as a clerk in a Mission District grocery store, bringing up two boys from her first marriage (which failed after Ginger and her first husband lost all their money in one of Hal's scams) and dating the volatile but passionate auto mechanic Chili (Bobby Cannavale). The narrative shifts in time from Jasmine's haphazard present-day efforts to start over in San Francisco and the upheaval she causes in Ginger's life to flashbacks of her life with Hal and the events that lead to his downfall, but never confuses the viewer. Jasmine, who has no practical skills other than being a rich man's wife--the woman cannot even operate a computer--tries tomaintain a tether to sanity, sort of, while chasing Xanax with vodka. But having been cast completely adrift from the only adult world she has ever known, she is truly lost at sea.<br /><br />There is humor to be found in \\"Blue Jasmine,\\" but it's bitter humor. I suspect that's because Jasmine is at another level a metaphor for what's going on in the United States. As Jasmine and Hal cavalierly push Ginger and her first husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay in a surprisingly adept turn) out of the way when they visit New York  and then cost them their shot into the middle class, wealthy capitalists whose fortunes are built not on manufacturing goods or providing services but moving money around and sending jobs offshore are breaching their part of the social contract. The middle class continues to shrink, and the gap between extreme wealth and barely surviving grows ever wider. The wealthy may throw money at \\"the losers\\" in the form of charity or grants to charter schools, but damned if they'll pay their share of taxes or concern themselves with decent wages. And, putting aside the question of whether Jasmine deserves her fate, in showing Jasmine's efforts to work and go to school to \\"make something of herself\\" after the complete wreck of her world, the movie shows those whose purchase is steadily weakening or those who never had a purchase in the first place blaming themselves for failing in a system that is stacked against them. I don't think it was a scenic accident that much of the movie is set in San Francisco, a city where high-tech wealth is notoriously pushing middle class and working families out of the way.<br /><br />It hurts to watch \\"Blue Jasmine.\\" I think that's the idea.

But after giving the Walking Dead a chance and watching the first couple episodes, I quickly realized that I was missing out. This show is much more than a zombie story--in fact at points that senario is like a gory backdrop for the real story. Sure there are lots of scenes with half-dead &#34;walkers&#34; chasing the living, but even those are pretty well done. It's suspenseful, dramatic, well writen, and somehow beautiful. In my opinion the Walking Dead might be the best human condition story I have seen on tv. Despite the story revolving around death (or the undead), it has a lot to say about life and how we live.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I bought this case a few weeks ago and I love it! I don't understand the complaint others have written about not being able to charge while the case it closed. I'm not sure how they put it on, but I can charge mine with the case closed and it works great! My only complaint is that when the Kindle is resting on the case (like it shows in the foreground of the picture) it has a tendency to slide down instead of staying upright. However, this really isn't a huge negative and the case otherwise works great!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Another good read.  Along with Sharp objects.  No spoiler alerts, so yes, I do recommend this book.  but you have to read both
B00127RAJY|5.0|this is perfect for days when its too rainy or cold to go out and walk or whatever you do.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|The story was rather bizarre and I really couldn't relate to any other characters or the plot.  Then I found out that this was a series!  Thought I could finish the book, but when I realized there would be more books, and that I really didn't like it, I just deleted it from my Kindle.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|After reading The Circle, the very concept of sharing my thoughts with you is frightening, but not sharing would be wrong.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Absolutely her best album ever! Can't stop listening to it! She is my favorite entertainer! No one puts on a show like Pink!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I liked the books, but the story lines keep ending in the middle of a paragraph and theres no way of finding out when the next one will come out...Finished the 3rd book and now waiting for the 4th cause it ended in the middle of a paragraph.  HATE THAT...says...coming soon
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I recommend this CD to the world. Every song on the CD is great and nice music to listen anytime. If you are a R&B lover of music I suggest this CD.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Love her voice, deep sooo many octaves she can hit.<br />I'm not going to say she can replace Mariah Carey, but it's pretty close.<br />Some of the songs have that vintage 90s feel, but it's awesome still. The melodies, lyrics, and her voice is just so great! =) ;p
B000WMEAKC|4.0|I loved the CD which I ordered along with others but all the cases broke into two pieces when I opened them.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Okay...not any better than the 1st version with Stallone.  It was a lot more bloody than the last one for sure.
B00BNPUA5Q|5.0|The launcher is getting better and better with each update.  Looking forward to the improvements the dev team has in store for us
B00005A1PR|5.0|I love India and her music is great.  I needed to go old school and listen to good music from back in the day. Love it.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|a very good book. I can't wait to read the next book .This book was one I've ever read. thanks.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google has been my favorite search engine forever.  Very glad I can get it on my new Kindle Fire HD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You run and get bananas and dodge obsticals in four places from Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 and fight villains at the end of each run and get power up during run. You also can upgrade them they include the freeze ray,  banana vacume and the flufy unicorn.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|A super listening experience.  A great recording quality. Hours of easy listening entertainment. I rate it great!!!! I will buy more form them.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book does a wonderful job of putting you in the lives of its characters. Makes you really look at life an a variety of different ways. Just an overall great book.
B004SBX112|3.0|The game is fun but I haven't used it much so I can't give too much information about it for now.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie was very close to the book. There were only a few things that were dramatically different and a few important things that were omitted. It was over all a wonderful adaptation of a great book.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|a few hours of enjoyment watching this with my husband,  got it because the man in the story was very much like my husband
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|Did not like this book at all. Didn't finish. Waste of my time!. Do not recommend this author or any further of her books.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I watched the movie &#34;Searching For Sugarman&#34; and learned about this artist and two of the albums that he recoerded.  I wish he would finish his third album!  I love learning about, and listening to music from, artists from my home state of Michigan,  Rodriguez still lives in Detroit and is in his seventies.  I was born in Detroit.  I wish he would perform some concerts in different Michigan locations.  It is such a shame his art was not given proper promotion and recognition in the United States.  The enthusiasm of the South African people ignited my passion for this brillant artist!
B0094K1MH2|3.0|However, for a PG movie, it is far too violent. Despite the inspiring storyline; I'd have trouble allowing a young child to view it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really love to read. This book was great. Super easy to obtain if you own a kindle as I do. It's an easy read with great characters. Remember, reading is fundamental!
0143036424|5.0|Had a need for such an item, meets the need of what I purchased it for and will enoy it.
B007UQRW62|5.0|Gene Kelly is outstanding in this movie. The dance numbers are brilliant. Would be almost impossible to come up with a better musical.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Glad I didn't have to wait week after week! LOVE Lost!!!! Marathoning all 6 seasons! Very interesting and intense TV series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's fun and its good that it gets faster and faster during the game so it gets more challenging and every time it goes some where new there's New characters and boards.
B000002WYT|4.0|I believe that Crash was the first DM tune that I had experienced and from that moment on, I was hooked. The excellent phrasing, driving (at times) musicianship and nice rough vocals mesh nicely. Lots of tunes with a nice mixture of themes awaits the listener. Enjoy!
B00632HWOG|2.0|This app freezes on my kindle fire and won't refresh messages. I always have to delete the app and install it again to get it to go again. It does this every two weeks. I have installed this app 10 or more times. It would be helpful if Yahoo would work on this issue and correct the problem.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|A great box set which gives good value for money. Not to mention one of the great old time movies.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|I have been following Brandon's blog for months now, he truley has made me cry, laugh and really stop to think. He is inspiring, talented, creative and thought provoking. I was so excited to hear he was releasing a book of his HONY work!!! I will be giving this as a gift to more than one person. The intimate faces he puts to the melting pot of faces in NY is amazing, I just can't gush and say enough.<br /><br />Thank you Brandon for sharing your beautiful creative art with all of us!
B003WKOTXE|3.0|I purchased this for my son and his wife.  They really enjoyed it.  It worked for a while but then they did not need the info any longer.  They still use a few of the tricks.  I wish I could have rented it but that was not an option.  I would not pay the $10 for it in a store.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Overall it is a good idea for a great game. Looking forward to playing again in the future. The Walking Dead tonight at midnight last year and I just wanted to let you know.
0544002318|1.0|I really tried to get through this, putting it down three times and picking it up again, hoping it would actually get better, but the whole book was about poor, poor Scott and how his family was soo poor, yet had money for him to live in the dorms at a very expensive private college, for him to go out East to a ski camp, to go out to eat as a family, but not as much as poor little Scott would have liked.  It is sad his mother had MS, but the whole premise of the book is that poor Scott had such a hard life, and we are reminded of this repeatedly.  Scott's life really wasn't that tough.  Perhaps it was tough compared to Paris Hilton, but there are a LOT of kids that had much tougher lives.  His self pity apparently made him an ultra runner.  Perhaps it did, but his self pity is completely misplaced.
0307949486|5.0|This is the beginning of a great trilogy.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has to kill time because it''s hard to put it down.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's fun at first, but it get's annoying just figuring out what you can use/click on once the puzzles get more complicated. I got it cause it was the Free App of the Day a while back, but I would never pay money for it.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is the greatest Civil War movie, bar none!  This character-driven telling of the bloodiest three days of American history should be part of any history teacher's lexicon. It makes names like Robert E. Lee and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain into real people, not just historical figures. If your heart isn't stirred by the defense of Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, you're already dead!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Was such a wonderful read and Adam Makos did a fantastic job writng the book along side Franz and Charlie...
B0028MBKVG|4.0|For the most part, the book was very entertaining.  there was a section that went on and on about barefoot running that could have been shortened by 75% and still expressed the author's belief that barefoot running is what we all should be doing, but other than the part, entertaining.<br /><br />The author is also a bit full of himself, essentially stating that the two greatest people in running are he and Scott Jurek, but that aside, still entertaining (although the other characters in the book may disagree with his illustration of them).  interestingly, two of the people who wrote about, including Scott Jurek, have written books that contradict this author's portrayal of events so keep that in mind and read as entertainment, not reality.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The only thing I can say about the end of this Trilogy is that you are left wondering what comes of Lisbeth after the story ends.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it was amazing and terrible to live life through the main character's eyes, to see a perspective that most modern civilized people couldn't dream of, to see the transformation of a man into an animal and back to a man... Great book, period.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Such a classic.  I bought my Bluray player waiting for this to come out.  Finally, when it did, I wasn't disappointed!  Amazing restoration and conversion to Bluray. Truly Epic!
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|A disappointment. Maybe the bar had been set too high? Found it hard to finish where I could not put the early ones down.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I've tried several of the jigsaw apps in this is, by far, the best. It offers the most variety in both subject matter and difficulty. The number of choices in the original download is really fair, and if you would like more variety, you may download many more free puzzles, plus an option to buy others. Each package contains from about 5 to 20 pictures from extremely beautiful photographs. You get to preview each package before you buy, so there are no bad surprises. This is my favorite of all I've tried!
B000X2H8G4|5.0|From the first use, this product has made a huge difference in our ability to communicate. We would definitely recommend.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I have rarely read a book this good. I will miss reading it each day. I hope I don't have to wait too long for the next one.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun time killer  Decent exercise for your brain....and hey, its free!  Can't go wrong with that.  Bout all there is to say I guess
B00594XOZU|1.0|Will not let me sign on using my tablet or phone. It just says its taking longer than expected and try again in a bit. I try again and same result. Please fix.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|If you are trying to get a full language course, spend the few bucks and get one of the other language apps.  If you want to relearn French (like I am) or if you are interested in French and want to get quick (albeit basic) results fast, this is the perfect app.  They have a few languages, but I hope they expand to offer more languages - I even looked for a paid app and was disappointed to discover there is not one.<br /><br />The format is challenging and lets you build on things learned in previous lessons.  It is free, and I am still in the early lessons, so I believe it does not advance to a very high level.  (That is another reason I really hope there is a paid version at some point - please, please, please!)  However, if you retake the lessons, they are actually presented in a slightly different order and changed around a bit, so it feels like a new lesson.  Happy learning!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read the Shining as a teen and was worried Dr. Sleep wouldn't measure up to the original. Boy was I wrong!! It's every bit as good and in some ways even better.<br />If you enjoyed The Shining, do yourself a favor and get this novel NOW!
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Pros:  It has better noise canceling properties than the Jabra Freeway, - when we had the Jabra Freeway it hada lot of stutter when canceling the outside nose and my car has a lot of wind noise so this worked &#34;Great&#34;.  The ease of removal via visor mount to a Magnet &#34;nice Idea&#34;!  Can hear the people in the rear of the car when on the phone for group conversations.<br /><br />Cons: The quality of your side of the conversation is like using your phones speakerphone, The buttons are hard to push while your driving and if you push to hard it will fall of the magnet into your lap while driving &#34;did this several times already&#34;.<br /><br />Overall- Not bad however I I went with the one below for ease of use and overall greatness!<br /><br />I finally ordered the BlueAnt SENSE Bluetooth Speakerphone here on Amazon That rocks in every department!
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Read a whole lot of reviews and no one mentions the 3d. This is the best of the Disney animated movies converted to 3d so far. It is truly amazing at times, it even has a few times where something sticks out of the screen and the depth is always wonderful. I only noticed two scenes (and they last only a second or two) where the new 3d angles don't match up. The effects are far better then those of the Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. Without a doubt this is the best the Little Mermaid has ever looked or sounded. While I like the movie a whole lot, I do question the story at times. It seems to be saying that it's ok to break the rules and if you're caught, ok to run away from home and break even more rules....but maybe I'm looking at it to seriously.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I got the package a day later then what they said it would get it, but it was nicely packaged, everything was perfectly wrapped and the DVD quality is great! I know own all 8 seasons and paid a lot less then I would have if I bought it some where else!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I will get right to the point.  This is a great album full of great songs.  It's probably not going to make new McCartney fans, but if you already like his music you will be blown away.  Save Us is a classic and would be a huge hit if Paul was still popular.
B00FJTYDKK|2.0|This movie is funny in a cute way, and well made. Sadly, the message it sends to women and girls of all ages is that men and boys - no matter how thick-headed they may be - are the only ones who can come up with a new idea or a solution to a problem. Even when the survival of your own kind is at stake. Further, it paints women as driven mostly by primal hungers whose capacity to judge is always swayed by emotional and sexual attraction. Oh, and that no matter what they should be supportive of whatever ideas the men or boys around them have, however hair-brained. God this is getting old. Parents, please think twice about letting this candy-coated bit of gender programming into your son's and daughter's world view and self-image.
B00F35BV64|5.0|We have enjoyed Star Trek for many years.  The movie fit right in with the others.  Any fan would notice that the scene of Captain Kirk  going into the radiation area was a repeat of Dr. Spock's death in another movie, but it was still a great movie.
B004YCKJSS|4.0|So true to people getting ready for their class reunion -- good twist at the end. Natalie Portman stole the show.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|I just received this CD a few days ago and nothing else has been in the CD player. Tremonti has expanded his riffs and solos to show his true excellence as a rock guitar master. He also sings lead in one of the tunes. It goes without saying, his band mates are superb.<br /><br />This is easily my favorite Alter Bridge recording!
B004XIVQ7Q|3.0|This is the least favourite of Rutherfurd's book so far. It's much slower and there is a lot of confusion between characters of different time periods because of minimal character development.
0439023521|5.0|great book. brand new. arrived on time. I decided to read the rest of the serious and see the movies. I am now letting family borrow them :)
0307950689|3.0|Unlike most of the previous commentators, I do not think this book is that bad. After all, just like the harshest of critiques here, I read it till the end, whereas truly bad books in my interpretation of the aesthetics of literacy are the ones you toss aside way before the last page. True, the characters are bland and one dimensional and the progress of the plot is either obviously predictable or over-the-top ridiculous (and nothing in between). However, it is engaging and entertaining in its own unique and quirky way and it definitely has the page turning &#34;what will happen next?&#34; effect, which Mr. Brown is so good at. In this sense, this work is not different than his other books and reading it is an enjoyable way to kill time while learning a tidbit of meaningless historical facts. The only major difference is the loss of originality and the strong smell of formulaic recycling.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game is fun and challenges your mind.  Easy to use and a great way to pass time.  When I am tired from the days work this game is fun and a great way to relax from the days work.
B00EBJ624O|5.0|So many music lovers had a sense of reserve when the young Gustavo Dudamel appeared on the scene complete with his choreographic podium manners and wild hair flying. And then came Yuja Wang who could be a fashion model and took advantage of her appearance by donning outfits so short and brilliantly colored that the staid members of the audience were hesitant to listen closely. Well, all that has now become pass&eacute; and both Wang and Dudamel are well established not only as accomplished, gifted musicians, but artists who know how to go to the soul of music.<br /><br />In both of the concerti here the unity of focus is strong, the pianist and conductor in complete agreement with phrasing and dynamics. And now, after several years working with Dudamel the Simon Bolivar Orchestra of Venezuela has grown (and matured!) as an ensemble and give solid sounding support.<br /><br />Yuja Wang is simply spectacular in her approach to both these works: other strong reviewers here on this page agree. Hearing this recording is very like being in the concert hall when Wang and Dudamel collaborate with the LA Phil. These are recoded from live performances at El Centro de Acci&oacute;n Social por la M&uacute;sica in Caracas, Venezuela and the sound is solid. That same aura of magic pours forth. These performances are both outstanding. To say more is redundant. Grady Harp, October 13
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Great read with the appropriate level of detail, practical examples and theory. Especially love the additional reading and resources listed at the end. All this great info makes it hard to JFDI though...
B0017XD3OY|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! It's probably not good for young ones who scare easily though. I would recommend renting this.
B006TZGVZS|5.0|I have read this book several years ago and I decided to buy it again and re-read it. The book is about Life's Greatest Lesson and I have read preachers talk about it at some of the funerals, so I have decided to read it once again, since I am older and more mature than the first time that I read it. I want to see if I get more out of the book, than the first time. It is a must read book. It is great!!
B005OL9EEI|5.0|This turned out to be a Awesome movie. Was a bit different than I remember from the series but Still Great.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Brilliant drawing program. The only reason I did not give it five stars, is because of two things, it is too easy to delete, then it leaves a unnamed folder on the desktop. It has no child proof lock.
B000B8IA2G|3.0|I love the series, a must for any stargate fan. I had a issue with disc 4, it would not play at all so I had to send the whole thing back for an exchange. The only other issue I had is there is no scene selection in Season 1, which thankfully was corrected in the next seasons.
142312166X|5.0|He loves this book series.. has them all .. He loves them and cant wait till next one comes out..
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I don't really make a lot of book suggestions, but this one is incredible. A lot of shocking details about life in unimaginably difficult conditions, by people who escaped it. I highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really entertaining, challenging and addictive game. Great graphics and sound effects. I've spent hours playing. Just a great game. Totally recommended.
B00A2H9PLG|2.0|I confess I was debating two or three stars. Two won. Mainly, as although the story is good, it is not theres. The principal difference is that we have this crazy right-wing military-industrial  plot to kill the President and nuke Iran. The only thing that can stop them is a failure on a tour in the Whitehouse.<br /><br />On the pro side, the action scenes are really good as are some of the visuals.<br /><br />Would I see it again, NO? Would I recommend it, well Die Hard is better, but it is watchable?
B000RW3YYA|4.0|There is some tiling in some of the episodes, nothing too significant except for \\"McKay and Mrs. Miller\\" which was pretty bad. Other than those minor quality issues I love the Stargate Atlantis series. What would they do without Rodney--Dave Hewlett is great in the role.
B008OW1SAC|5.0|Great lyrics, great music, and probably one of the greatest and most unique bands in a long time. Can't stop listening...
B00FPGV3RS|3.0|I Would have expected an ok kind of comedy movie, but this was rather boring, I didn't have to endure it or anything but I'd say if you are looking for a way to kill 90 minutes of your day this is an ok solution, If you are looking for a good laugh hmmm this title falls a bit short.
0761158820|5.0|I got this for myself (usingmyboyfriendsaccount) and Its absolutely amazing. They might be a bit silly for adults who like to papercraft but I think that adds to the fun! :D
B000WGWQG8|5.0|All Americans should watch this. Full of historical events. My friend and I stayed up and watched every episode. We could not stop. The price that has been paid for our nation should never be forgotten.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Okay if your reading this just download the game it's amazing I'm not sure why but it's so addicting<br />I love it
1616615362|5.0|I don't always make good connections with my sons but when we play this game we always have fun. plus this piece rocks, mines, forward and rear firing arch, it's the Slave 1... whats not to love
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|This book should be required reading for all students in school and college. They need to know how little their government agencies value their lives or the lives of civilians the world over. They need to know that agencies like the Strategic Air Command were run by \\"little Hitlers\\", with big egos... who were more interested in a show of \\"strength and credibility\\" than in safety and lives. They need to know that these egomaniacs were willing to \\"sacrifice\\" American cities if necessary. Americans need to know that the \\"cold war\\" was just like George Carlin used to say, \\"a big dick waving contest\\". They need to know that it could have been stopped many times but the psychotics in charge had too much power and control. They need to know just how many accidents did happen and how many close calls there were and how the truth was always covered up. Heavy reading... but people need to know!
B00915G6MG|5.0|I, personally, am not very interested in NCIS, but my mom is, and she loved this product! It came on time, was in excellent condition, and has provided hours and hours of entertainment for my mom.  She absolutely loves NCIS season 10 and would recommend it for anyone who is in love with NCIS.  This is a great continuation of the NCIS series.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Who doesn't love to play solitaire? I like this spider solitaire game and it works well on my Kindle Fire.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|For an app it has amazing graphics ,nice variety of prey and firearms and it's pretty fun<br />But I don't like how much some of the guns cost and that the suppressor was taken off
B005LAJ1PE|4.0|Great Shoe creepy and disturbing just waht horror fans need in a series . If your sick of all the drama vampire shows this is a breath of fresh air , just wish season 1 had been longer , not much replay value but a great season non the less .
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|great graphics, great addition to the temple run family<br />having the different worlds is good for changing up the pace.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|i loved it!!! I don't at all regret purchasing this product, and I look forward to using it over and over and over again.
B007S7L3XQ|1.0|I have to admit I'm doing something I criticize others for doing all the time. However, since this is not available in the U.S., or at least not anymore. I'll tell you what Wikipedia says about the book:<br />\\"In 2011 he was the author of the 200 empty page book 'What every man thinks about apart from sex'\\"<br /><br />I wanted to find out about this author because he was promoting his new book on a respected web site, and I'd never heard of him. When I found out his first \\"invention\\" was the \\"Control-A-Woman remote control\\", I was not at all impressed. He's also written \\"50 shades of Gray\\" which has 50 pages of different shades of grey. He also changed his name to \\"God\\", which was later overturned. And on and on...<br /><br />If you see his books or products, unless you're buying a gag gift, or you think they're funny, steer clear.<br /><br />Sorry for standing on my soap box, but IMO I find it offensive!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Pretty good. I like playing this game usually on a daily basis. You should try it and see for yourself.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Touching and sincere. Love is raw and real. It is not confined to gender, age or cognitive ability, it just is.
B004V6BQ3O|4.0|This is definitely worth it for the price and for video recording with high quality sound. Gives a very natural sound and definitely beats the built in mic. Recommend it for anyone starting out, and looking to make higher quality videos.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|BTR's first album, BTR was typical boyband. Elevate, their second album was more techno-dance music. This album is totally different from the rest and is just as good, maybe even better than their other ones! They've shown that they're growing up, but aren't pulling a Miley Cyrus.
B005PK553C|5.0|This is a great show.  Each season is a different, self-contained storyline.  Season 1 is a great haunted house story with great actors and lots of twists and turns.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|These are but five Kindle highlights from Wuthering Heights. I love the fact that readers can now share their favorite parts of this classic novel with other Kindle readers. It's like a virtual book club!<br /><br />\\"A perfect misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.\\"<br /><br />\\" `Wuthering' being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.\\"<br /><br />\\"He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.\\"<br /><br />\\"He'll love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again.\\"<br /><br />\\"He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours.\\"<br /><br />What's your favorite Wuthering Heights highlight? Also recently read [[ASIN:B008PD0IHY Firsts In Fiction: First Line Hooks, Hints & Help - Novel Writing With Excellence (Education & Reference for Writing & Publishing Fiction)]]. Wonder what the author of that writing book would think of Wuthering Heights and its opening paragraph.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I was already beyond excited when season 3 came out so naturally when I saw this I had to order it . And I m sure glad I did it came and I couldn't believe how huge it was and well protected Amazon shipped it . Great product
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing<br />It's so awesome lalaa a cool book is never cooler than this mocking jay or bird district 13 cool
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This didn't do what I wanted it to do, totally disappointed with this piece of equipment, not sure of the hype.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|omg I cant believe this is it true is that u scribblenauts? Omfg ITS REALLY HERE FINALLY. Anyone who thinks this is crap can go and play thus game some more.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|\\"People see what they want to and make assumptions based on what they expect.\\" - Chapter 17.<br /><br />Lots of memorable lines in this one, a well crafted book. It's obvious Mira Lyn Kelly  has studied the craft of writing. Kelly is an exceptionally talented author who writes funny dialogue. Makes me wonder if she read [[ASIN:B008PD0IHY Firsts In Fiction: First Line Hooks, Hints & Help - Novel Writing With Excellence (Education & Reference for Writing & Publishing Fiction)]] before working on her novel. She's that good.
B001EJGQTU|5.0|A well-rounded piece with a perspective from a gentleman who was in a well-qualified position!  Mr. McNamara had an extremely difficult assignment.
B00EQF2EIG|2.0|It's not badly done, but this movie is not good enough to justify yet another filmed version of Much Ado about Nothing. It's hard to beat the excellent Kenneth Branagh version of 1993, but even without comparing with it this version is lacking. With the honorably exception of Amy Acker, who plays an excellent Beatrice, most of the other actors are between fair to inadequate. Particularly unconvincing are Nathan Fillion (Dogberry), Clark Gregg (Leonato), Reed Diamond (a very poor Don Pedro), Frank Klanz as Claudio and Jillian Morgese as Hero. The consequence of the mostly poor casting is that there are absolutely no chemistry between Hero and Claudio, and both the comic as well the dramatic scenes fall mostly flat and it is very hard to feel moved by them. To complete a very brief review of the main actors, Alexis Denisof is fair as Benedick and Spencer Treat Clark (he was the boy Lucius in Gladiator, 14 years younger) is not bad as Borachio.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Excellent work by an amazing writer, John Green. Not as good as &#34;Looking For Alaska&#34; but still worthy of all 5 stars.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I don't usually get into hidden object games but for some reason I decided to play it to see what it was all about and found that I am really liking it a lot. Really kills time.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I love that I can now see what others think of Twain's words. Makes me feel like I'm part of a virtual book club. Here are the top five (as of today) Tom Sawyer highlights.<br /><br />He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it--namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. - highlighted 1306 times<br /><br />Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it. - highlighted 862 times<br /><br />He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well though-- and loathed him. - highlighted 561 times<br /><br />THROUGH them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \\"style,\\" not service-- she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. him. - highlighted 594 times<br /><br />Like many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning.  - highlighted 469 times<br /><br />Reading great literature and studying books like [[ASIN:B008PD0IHY Firsts In Fiction: First Line Hooks, Hints & Help - Novel Writing With Excellence (Education & Reference for Writing & Publishing Fiction)]] make my students better writers.

031624662X|5.0|Wow, wow, wow. Immensely imaginative and compellingly readable, with gender-play worthy of Samuel R. Delany but in a lower but all-pervasive key. The story begins in medias res, the reader has to jump in and hang on as it is told in two time lines which eventually come together. The first of a projected trilogy, but it stands on its own, don't fear that it will leave you hanging at the end.
0316228583|1.0|Originally published under a pseudonym, The Casual Vacancy got the response it deserved. No sale. Then J.K. decided to fess up and her loyal readers flocked to the bookstores. It is a good thing I read it as a library book or I would have wanted my money back! My daughter bought the book on tape and didn't finish it.<br /><br />Why is it when an actor or writer does something spectacular they get afraid of typecasting and go out of their way to do something to undermine their accomplishment? I was offended by the book, plain and simple. If she wanted to prove she could get down in the muck, ok. Proven.<br /><br />If J.K. is reading this I want to tell her that Harry Potter wasn't a just a series of children's books that made you a lot of money. The stories changed my life in many ways, and I'm not alone. Harry Potter was an entire world you created, which means brilliance is in you. That world drew in people by the millions or billions, who wanted to live in that world, who spent many years reading the books, listening to the books on tape and waiting for the movies, and want MORE. One of these days quiddich will be an Olympic event. You just wait. But heck, we adults can't even buy T-shirts because they are geared to children-for the most part. You think children are the ones spending all that money?<br /><br />If you don't have any ideas there are or were thousands of fan fiction stories going wasting that I'd have bought as books if possible.<br /><br />Yes, we have Harry Potter world in Florida and, soon in California YEA. Doesn't that tell you something? It isn't enough to say ok, what's next? There are thousands of stories that could be spun off and made into movies-let a whole new crowd of actors become living legends. Look at the fan base of Serenity, Star Wars, Twin Peaks and Somewhere in Time. Fans refuse to let those worlds die. We looked to you for something magnificent. But no. We got The Casual Vacancy. Please. You can do better.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Overall, the story line was okay, but it doesn't give enough details. And, the romance was too sappy. Sorry, but that's what I think.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Whenever I need a lift - be it fatigue or sadness - this show makes me smile, fun for all
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The acting, dialogue and story lines are all excellent. I look forward to watch the rest of the 4 seasons.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|The recordings from Europe '72 contain many of my favorite Grateful Dead \\"live\\" recording. This one has more great live recordings from 1972. This lineup of the Greatful Dead with Keith and Donna Godchaux is my favorite. Having the DVD along with the CD's just makes this even better. Seeing that lineup from that era is truly vintage Dead material.
B0094K1K42|1.0|It was Awful!! Wasted 2 hours of my life. Would not recommend to anyone. It was terrible. Don't waste your time.
B005HEPN06|4.0|This series is the only one - after the original - that's worth your time. If you know Kirk's crew, you'll feel at home with this one too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got this free app as I like playing the game at the arcade.  It turns out to be more fun than the real thing.  Very addictive and a great way to pass the time and relax.  I now have it on my Kindle & phone!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addictive and fun!  I don't usually get into games, but the Minions have me hooked.  The play is fast!  The minion is adorable.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I love Dan Brown's style!  Great book. I become so attached to his characters that I find myself thinking about them like they are real people. Looking forward to starting Inferno soon.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I didn't see it in the theater... but, instead waited to watch it on the 60\\" super HD at home.  It's really better than theater if you ask me.  Anywho.  This was a great reinterpretation of the classic Wrath of Khan.  Really great effects, good action, great one liners and some pretty emotional stuff at the end.  What a twist.  Didn't know who Cumberbatch was before this, he did a great job.  However, Pike will be missed from future Star Trek movies.  JJ Abrams has done a pretty good job, even if he did blow up Vulcan.  Cameo by Nimoy was great, again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At times this book reminded me of Clan of the Cavebear which is one of my all-time favorite books. katniss and Ayla have very similar thoughts and philosophies though Hunger Games was a faster and less technical read.  I look forward to reading the next books in this series.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  I love the new Star Trek movies.  I really enjoyed it and it was received really quickly.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|This app is good, but sometimes (only once in a while) when you try to bid on something, it gets stuck in a feedback loop of some kind and will not place your bid.  It just cycles and never resolves itself.  Other than that, it has been pretty great.  It's cool to be able to do Ebay on the go.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Although I enjoy facebook, I would have no problem giving it up to protect children from the inherent danger it possesses, particularly with young and older teens. There is far too much inappropriate and dangerous material available to them through this social media.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I am a long time fan of Supernatural, and have now brought my collection up to date with &#34;season 8&#34;. I am unable to watch the episodes when they appear on TV, and have had to rely on TNT to watch each season as a rerun. I waited a long tome for season 8 to come to video, and now I am fully up to date with the Winchester brothers. Since season 9 has just begun, ghuess I'll have another long wait to see what happens next.<br /><br />Owning my own copy of the complete set, means I can watch any season, any time now. It's the only way to enjoy the show.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|super catchy song it is very cute and I am just in love with the app I definatly recommend it
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great game Easy to understand what is going on. Enjoyable way to pass the time.  The task are easily completed. The only con is the way they always want you to post to facebook.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Great movie, I can watch it over & over again.  Love to watch it during bad weather. No problems with the quality of the product.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Nothing clever like in the first two.  Tried way too hard for the jokes.  Really really really lame and contrived.
0761163808|5.0|Excellent book with very interesting facts about each animal.  The pictures move like the real animals move.  All ages would enjoy this book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Find myself wasting more time than I should with this game. It can be frustrating that you earn diamonds which are essential so slowly but I continue to find myself<br />playing! Lol
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time. I hate that the next books aren't going to be released until next year but I think they'll be worth the wait.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down. The fantasy world that I got lost in was amazing, but I was upset with Anastasia's character because she had the constitution of a wet noodle.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|this is one of my favorite games for my kindle fire. its fun and I haven't had any glitches. I can't wait to get the next chapter.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I really enjoyed reading the book. It was just as close to a page turner as it could get for me. I was even telling hubby about the story as I read it because it has lots of twists and turns.<br />Then...<br />the ending comes and it falls as flat as a pancake.<br /><br />It pretty much ruined the book for me. I can't say it's a book I recommend anymore.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|I've had this app for several months now. Have not used it too much until recently. If you want to use word, .  It doesn't work its best. But, I can't complain too much. I'm pleased with it because I can download most documents and see them with no problem. I download documents and pdfs all the the time since I started college. It's a bit tricky to figure out but not too difficult. Over all its satisfactory.. nothing amazing. But it does well enough for my needs.
B009R9WAZ8|4.0|I may be one of the only people who preferred Rihanna when she first started out (less dance-y), but I like Unapologetic well enough.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|its fun but can get a little repetitive. its great to kill time though. there a few monkeys you might get stuck on but after a few upgrades there easy to take out. the great thing though. this game is not full of adds, pop ups, and you do not need to purchase anything with real cash to get through the game. great for all ages. :-)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Although the start was slow and could  even be considered mundane when the story really begins you are unable to put it down. Thought provoking, intense and written in a way that  keeps the reader riveted and putting themselves into the lives of each character, connecting with them and actually understanding their unusual and often unacceptable behavior.
B007SVPZMW|5.0|This is such a cute game! It's perfect for passing the time away, and it's actually pretty easy to win, even on the lowest setting. On that note, it might not be all that great for stopping super computers from starting a nuclear war. (If you haven't watched War Games, you probably won't get this one.)<br /><br />Seriously, though, for a Tic-Tac-Toe game, this is just cool, hands down. Here's my take on its features:<br /><br />1) Playability - 5/5 - This game has two ways to play - two player or against the computer. The A.I. levels are pretty accurate; level 1 will let you win almost all the time, level 2 is pretty balanced, and level 3 will almost always end in a draw. It's possible to win on each level, which is encouraging. Two player mode also runs smoothly and is great if you ever get bored playing against the computer.<br /><br />2) Graphics/Animation - 5/5 - The graphics are very smooth and clean. I like the different themes, especially the Christmas theme with the cute little penguin. The animations in the Christmas and Cartoon themes are a bit longer than I'd like, but they're fun and entertaining to watch.<br /><br />3) Music - 5/5 - I enjoy the variety of music that this game has. It's not my favorite, but it keeps the game interesting rather than looping through the same music over and over again.<br /><br />Other good things to note:<br />- No excessive permissions.<br />- Exits cleanly, meaning the back button is not disabled.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a very simple and fun game for everyone to enjoy. It's very appropriate for the holiday season coming up (even though we're not past Halloween yet). Highly recommended for you and your children if you have any. Not so much for your deranged super computer.<br /><br />- Sam
B0052SF6CM|4.0|You, sir, are wonderful. This cd kept me going (and my son from crying) during a cross-country road trip. Will definitely look into whatever you have next in store.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I bought this game a long time ago and it is the best game of my life!in 2013,<br />I bought the 2nd version of angry birds star wars and I think it is definitely cool!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Not just a dream, but a world created of fae, nightmares, lies, truths, and wonder, Karen Marie Monings' series of five Fever novels culminated in the most recent entry, Shadowfever.<br /><br />Beginning where Dreamfever ended, Mac finds herself alone with death. Her journey in this book takes us through unrelenting darkness, sadness, anger, revenge, and despair. The author has already has offered the greatest spoiler on her website with the first two chapters where Mac discovers the identity of the beast she killed. The beast that she feared yet trusted - and which protected her. 'Nuff said?<br /><br />Moning never does anything by halves, and trust me, this book is worth reading and re-reading. Actually not just reading but luxuriously enjoying. This world of a Fae-soaked Dublin, a world of grey - no longer black and white - is one to be savored slowly.  And at the conclusion we discover who and what Mac really is. Finally.<br /><br />Humanity is celebrated even among those who are not human, by the understanding and acceptance of the most human of qualities - honest mistakes.<br /><br />The best news that I can share is at the end - where it is indicated that there are more novels signed for this series. So the story of Mac and her Fever world does not end, but will continue to evolve.<br /><br />NB Please, please, please read these books in sequence - Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever, Dreamfever, and Shadowfever. Each one leads to the next and while you might find one out of sequence interesting, now that all five are available it is truly an extraordinary and perfect time to read all five. You will be enchanted. And don't stop there, do check out Moning's Highlander series. The characters of the MacKelters now are entwined in the Fever series and these are fabulous books as well. For more on Moning's works, see Amazon.<br /><br />Moning has extraordinary gift to create alternative worlds that envelop us, seduce us, and in time ravish us.

B004SKHJF2|5.0|Ideal for not mother tongue to understand text of foreign songs.<br /><br />Excellent Karaoke feature.<br /><br />Shoud be perfect if it would work also with headphones...
B008K9SG9K|3.0|I bought because I really loved Radioactive. I usually have a three song rule for cd purchases. I have to have heard three songs before buying the whole album. This is a prime example of why I should have stuck to that rule. It seemed like a bunch of different bands wrote songs and compiled them together. There was no uniformity for me. I kept thinking &#34;is this the same band?&#34; Not for me.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Adventure, intrigue, mystery, love, comedy...all you could want in one movie !!  Just went out to see RED 2 and enjoyed that movie just as much as the first !!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Much better than previous DH RELOADED. better graphics, more time spent on a hunt and more weapon choices. I'm enjoying it so far
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Love the movie, the quality was great, no issues streaming. recommend this to everyone, if you are into Gods and giants this is the movie for you.
B0095EMOTM|4.0|My son hates the car but loves music, so we've been blowing through cds to keep him occupied. He loves David Guetta now. :)
B00EO4SBSG|2.0|This album is very, very mediocre. It  sounds nothing like past albums have, the only thing that sounds about the same is some of the guitar riffs. Overall, Im pretty bummed with it :/
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was a great and allowed me to escape momentarily.  I fell in love with all of the characters and didn't want it to end...and thankfully, there is a sequel coming out in January of 2014!
B00594XOZU|4.0|This app usually works!<br />Don't get confused. I contacted Amazon and they said the app was clutching and they'll fix it as soon as possible. Other from that it's a very useful app.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|I watched the movie some time after buying this cd (silly me), but I liked it. I think it would have been nice if the songs were extended to full length though. They're just as short as they were in the movie.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Quite possibly the best movie of the 1980's. If you haven't seen it, watch it right now because it is awesome.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Yes! It consumes a lot of battery, but that is not a problem of the LCD, its a problem of the battery. It is normal that the battery life gets reduced if you add an LCD screen. It´s a great product
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I updated this and it deleted everything from my island(s):( and I was on level 20 ! Now I'm on level 7 because of the stupid update DO NOT UPDATE
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|No joke, this is the only cd that kept my toddler (16m) from crying in the car. He HATES car rides. He always screams like the car is murdering him. But when I turn this on, he settles. He's almost always conked out by track three. Thank you, Bruno Mars :)
B0026P3G12|5.0|Im happy thet found here keep going Girl sing your heart out, she has such a talent and  seem's a wonderful lady
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|It is a great product. I used it on my last scuba diving trip to Mahahual, México (btw... great place also) and the improvement on my pictures was amazing. It really help to reduce the blue or green colour of the water and highlight coral reefs brightness. Considering the price, I would say it is a most!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Sometimes it is quite nice to play a game as simple as this.  As hard as life is, this game is pleasing to me.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I don't think I've ever pressed &#34;skip&#34; while listening to this cd. My kiddo and I have little dance parties with MGMT almost everyday. We love it.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|One of the best. Gritty, and real. Great singing and acting. Watch it today. No Day but Today. My daughter watches it all the time.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Of all the apps to keep your phone or tablet clean and running smoothly this is by far the best.
B006INDMEE|5.0|Such a great movie...simply put! The acting is on par and the plot is better than anything in recent box office...def worth a watch! :)
B0035JNTA6|5.0|It was fun to watch and it was easy to rent. I would watch it again in a heart beat.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Loved it when it came out. Love it now. A timeless classic that captures the hearts of everyone. A must watch.
0547569653|4.0|Scott's race stories are pretty awesome. I was little sad that we never really heard him talk about races that he didn't win. I think it's always fascinating to hear the life story behind great athletes and get a chance to see in side their head and heart a little bit. I also love his love affair with food, although I'm not going to give up meat anytime soon. It does encourage me to eat closer to nature.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|More of a coming of age movie for Jaden than a true Will Smith film.  It was OK, but would not see it again.
072325804X|5.0|Great set. A little heavier than I expected, but it is a hardbook set. Beautiful baby shower gift. :) Highly recommend!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I usually dont get addicted to games but then I found this one... I LOVE MINIONS!!!! Though I dont understand why they like bananas so much. But regardless, this game is epic.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Already several years old, this is a fabulous recording which you'll enjoy again & again. There isn't a weak track on it. The harmonies are beautiful, production flawless & Mark Knopfler's guitar work is subtle yet profound.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Required reading for late boomers/gen x, gamers, and anyone who loves a good story.<br /><br />I remember more of my coming of age than I thought!
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|My 10 yr old son loves this DVD and has wanted it so long!  He's now watched this a number of times.  Great price.  Thank you so much.

B00847KFDS|5.0|I've been a John Fogerty fan since first seeing him perform live with CCR as a 14 year old in high school!  These songs are old favorites, brought to new life with the addition of new musicians performing alongside John himself.  Fun!
B003LSTK8G|5.0|The Big Short is a readable discussion of the causes of the 2008 financial crisis from the perspectives of several hedge managers.  They investigated the situation and realized the subprime mortgage business was corrupted by concealing the risk in mis-rated bonds which were then subdivided into credit default swaps.

B008JFUO72|5.0|The last two in this series have been great so I gave this a good rating because I know it will be fantastic too.
B000ICXQXI|3.0|The lack of blood is weak. I know it was a rating thing, but I'm still dinging it. I like that he killed off the lead so early. Definitely something out of the norm.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|This was ordered for my granddaughter because she loves Johnny Depp.  She really wanted it so she could watch it over and over
B000HF0KXU|5.0|Few women pull off sensual like Berry.  I thought the movie fun and amusing.  It could have used a good make out session with Hugh and Berry though.
B008L34P2C|4.0|I was not able to watch this since the DVD would not work. I know I will love the movie once I have a good DVD.
0142418471|1.0|John Green’s writing style is always shown in ALL of his novels. Same attack, same momentum, same catch. But among all his novels (except Let It Snow, I haven’t read that one yet), this is a bit of a disappointment for me. I skipped some of the parts since I found it a bit non-sense. Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars are way too better than this one.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I really wanted the reviews of the movie to just be hype from people that wanted to hate the movie for their own petty reasons, but they were right, it is nigh unwatchable.<br /><br />The issues start almost as soon as the movie does, the accent (I hope it was an accent) that Jaden Smith was using made him sound like a young child that is still working on their pronunciation.  It may be cute from a 4 year old, but for a supposed professional actor I think not.<br /><br />There are also more plot holes than the wrecked spaceship ended up with, such as....<br />1. Even though seats on the ship were full on take off, they were completely empty except for the young Smith during the crash, where were these people and why weren't they strapped into what ended up being the safest part of the ship?<br />2. Our decendants obviously master spaceflight but have lost the ability to use projectile weapons.  Not a single ranged weapon to be seen anywhere, and oh wouldn't it have been fantastic to have a rifle or two in the emergency kits.<br />3. Did I say kits?  I'm wondering why there weren't more than one set of breathing aids available for the young Smith to take with him on his journey, and why not take one of the masks that seemed to work so wonderfully before the breathing aids were introduced.  Oddly enough though the breathing aids were all over the wrecked tail section of the craft.<br /><br />There were many many more issues with the story, but I don't believe that anyone needs to dig very deep to see that this is a horribly flawed production that would have done better with different actors, a different writer, and almost any other director.  I hate to pick on the movie because I was actually looking forward to it, though if I had noticed that it was one of M. Night Shyamalan's I might have been a bit more hesitant to pick the movie up.
B00EQF2EIG|4.0|Get through the first third of the movie as the story tightens up. If you do not like the bard then steer clear otherwise it is one of the better modern interpretations I have seen in awhile.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Jack's getting a bit older, but nothing if not a little smarter as well.  This is where he shines like a diamond - the bad guy is smart, with an airtight plan that nobody suspects.  Jack hates a mystery, and has a need to answer questions that no-one else has thought to ask; the results are pure Reacher.  A worthwhile addition to the collection!
1401312853|4.0|Finally, I breathed a sigh of relief when I came across this. A decent, short and very simple book on learning the valuable lesson of how to not take things for granted and how to live and make the most out of what you have, including time.
B004GFN11A|4.0|Simple, easy-to-use interface that let's me do all the common tasks I need to keep my blog active. Excellent for checking stats and notifications. The reader seems pretty good too.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Entertaining from beginning to end with a lot to offer.  If you enjoyed The Illusionist and The Prestige you should definitely like this movie.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|spoiler alert!<br />they go for a ride on a merry-go-round.<br /><br />kinda fun until then.  could have used an ending. entertaining-ish.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I was so disappointed that I didn't get to see this on the big screen but it was worth it to purchase the dvd.
014241493X|3.0|Average. Not so good, not so bad either. Just like what I’ve mentioned before on David Levithan’s Every You, Every Me book, I’m not really into the emo teenage i-feel-kinda-lost-leave-me-alone-mid-life-crisis-depressed-depressed-depressed drama. I just can’t put my finger as to why these kinds of stories are “in” and “appealing” to the young adult crowd nowadays. It’s depressing and non-sense.
B00EJOCB4G|4.0|This was a big hit with my eight yesr olds.  Not too many pieces to be overwhelmed.  The project pieces are quite small, however, and do require a bit of dexterity.  This is a great project for children and grownups to make together!
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|This is a great album and shows the awesome ability for both groups coming together and making something special.<br />enjoy
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|If you like playing games were you earn and buy stuff to level up or gain money this is a game for you . This is a game for people who like dinosaurs too.
1476712042|5.0|I’m a sucker for good love stories. The moment I started this, I wasn’t able to put this down! A beautiful love story of two people meant to be together amidst the heart breaking issues and indifferences they had to face. This really blew me away. I practically fell in love with Travis.
B003FXCSNQ|2.0|It took a long time before the action started, and climaxed to quickly. It was essentially over before it began.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Read this book on the beach and loved every minute of it.  Wonderful characters and a very relatable story.  I think most moms would love this book.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Talk about a high, this is it! Could not put this book down. I read this book in less than a day. That's with doing wash, cleaning and cooking. Very creative and I like how the story was told through a guy's point of view. Drew sucked me in right from the beginning, he's a trip. Have to love him! Note, I am not giving up anything. Great read, highly recommended.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Awesome game, with great graphics. Interesting story and lots of challenging puzzles. Worth the money for the full game. Big Fish does it again!
B005CAPS0K|4.0|This movie was very nicely thought out.  I watched it to see if I would like it, because Insidious 2 is coming out.  I would have to say it is a new way to think about outer body experiences.  I liked it very much and will definitely be seeing the second.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This show continues to impress me as the seasons continue...very excited about what is to come in season four and beyond!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Way deeper. Grateful to my daughter who recommended I read it. A wonderful account of a seeker's journey. I found it inspiring, funny, comforting and encouraging.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|At first I thought this book was not going to have much depth to it but about halfway in, I had a very different opinion.  The last 5 pages or so really showed me what an intelligent and insightful writer did this book.  I can't imagine anyone not being touched on some level by this writing.  I plan to read all of Liane's books.
B00FPH6M82|4.0|I heard so many bad reviews of this movie, so my expectations were low.  I was pleasantly surprised by the acting and story line.  Good amount of action and cool to see what this writer/director thought the world might be like in 1,000 years
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|J.J. Abrams continues to present a Star Trek that fans of the classic will love while enticing new viewers to join the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Great movie!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|When I first purchases my Kindle Fire HD I was able to use the shutter camera.  It no longer seems to be on my kindle.  We downloaded this file explorer and still no luck.  From reading reviews online it is obvious I'm not the only one who is having this problem.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It does all that it promises very well without any issues. Love the fact you can get Netflix, etc.. up and running very quickly. And only for $35. Great little product
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome.  I have a great time playing it.  I would get it if I were u.<br /><br />I love it.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|The century trilogy is one ambitious project. Now that I just finished reading all three I decided to review them all.  FALL OF GIANTS: Enthralling story. As a history buff I enjoyed how his seemingly ordinary characters participated in some of the most notable events of The Great Word. Romance is always a part of Follett's novel and they are not absent here either. Love, betrayal, false love and even wrong love all take place both here and across the length of the trilogy. This book is my favourite though, the only one I could find myself reading again.  The depiction of wars across Europe and the emerging power of the United States are all wonderfully told.   WINTER OF THE WORLD: We meet the second generation of the five families that we first met in the previous novel. This book centers around World War II. The behind the scenes of the Nazi are some of the best in the novel. We also see a change in the way war is fought with the advent of new technology. The only down side on this book is the attack on Peal Harbour scene that feels as a lecture more than novel.   EDGE OF ETERNITY: The story is well written and focus on the Cold War and starts at the building of the Berlin Wall and ends when it is tear down. However, this one feels a bit more predictable, maybe because more recent history is closer to my memory. The other issue I take with this entry is that the 60's take about 3/4's of the book and then we are breezed through the 70's. Come on, Watergate and the Bee Gees are not the only things redeemable from that period!  The 80's go even faster with barely a couple of chapters tying all the knots toward a well remembered ending.   And that's it. 3 books that are one get one review!
B00BHWG1OO|5.0|Although this only came out recently, I would consider this a necessity in everyone's collection.<br /><br />Many may not realize the impact that Mr. Toussaint has had on the world. As a producer and songwriter, he has worked with legends like Irma Thomas, Ernie K-Doe, Lee Dorsey, Elvis Costello, and Dr. John. Not to mention that his songs have been covered by the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. He is truly a legend.<br /><br />The album is a live album that Mr. Toussaint recorded in New York City in 2009 and features him alone on his piano as he runs through many of the classics of his career and even throws in some other gems. Toussaint's performance is brilliant and he truly gracious when he performs. The performance even features some new songs.<br /><br />It would be difficult to pick what the highlight of this album are but two tracks that stand out are the &#34;Certain Girl&#34; Medley<br />and the 13 minute long version of &#34;Southern Nights&#34;. I would highly recommend picking this album up.<br /><br />It should be noted that the deluxe edition CD/DVD version is well worth the extra few dollars. The DVD features a different performance in New York City from the same period and features a slightly different set list. Both shows are equally good. The DVD also features some bonus features including a brilliant interview with Mr. Toussaint that is both entertaining and insightful.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I use it all the time. Simple application for simple edits! I recommend this program to any looking for quick edit on simple pictures!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|the game is fun to play. the only problem I have is lack of energy. wish it didn't have to be like that..
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Loved it !! Must watch....kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole movie......great movie...take the time to see it
B00C061I3K|5.0|Another great album by Daft Punk. Still not as good as Discovery, but I would consider it one of their best.
B0038P59A0|4.0|I liked the movie very much. Holmes purists may find that Holmes is more crazy than the books show him. If I was casting the roles of Holmes and Watson I would have reversed the actors. Jude Law looks more like what Holmes should look to me.
0307592731|5.0|I read a copy of this book from the library.  Loved it so much I purchased it and had it signed when the author came to our town. What a fantastic writer!!
0066620996|5.0|I wish I would have picked up and read this book sooner.  Amazingly simple, but obviously effective actions to bring any company or business from Good to Great.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Great sound even using the aux headphone input. USB input the sound is even better!<br />Sound compares favorably to more expensive non-portable headphone amps I have owned or listened to.<br />Great build quality.<br />The on/off switch works differently from most devices, a quick press turns it on, so use the &#34;hold&#34; switch if you don't want it to turn on accidentally.<br />Battery life is very good. Hard to compare as this is the only battery powered headphone amp I own.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Killing Floor by  Lee Child is the first Jack Reacher book.  It is a fun light read with a good amount of action and suspense.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Advertising for Google Chromecast is misleading.  It is very limited in what you can watch on your TV usinf the device: Netflix, Google movies and You Tube only.
0977326403|5.0|Great information - probably not critical to read for social sectors as Good to Great could be applied, but still good.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  I can watch it anytime and I don't have to watch commercials.  I like the extras also.
0812550706|5.0|It feels a bit silly writing a review for a product with 5,000 reviews already, but I just have to say I picked this up for some ez reading after seeing the movie preview, and I was a little worried I was too-old for this kid stuff, but it's a great breezy read - I didn't stop til late in the night when I finished it. Super relaxing. So yeah, apparently fun for mostly-grown-ups as well as kids!
1451626096|5.0|Most women dreamed of marring for love. The White Princess, Elizabeth, wished to be like her mother, who married King Edward for love. But she married to King Henry VII, Mama's Boy. She hated Henry, who had killed her first love. Still she married him to full fill her duty as a Princess of York, and she tried to be a good wife, especially after their children were born. I don't know much about fiction and non-fiction, but I am a passionate fan of Philippa  Gregory. I admire her imagination and ability to write tender passage. I always enjoy her books. Thank you, Philippa, you are my Drama Queen!
B00FFEM0W2|5.0|This continues the Season two cliffhanger and starts epic style episodes that center around one theme. Check it out, it's good
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|Great movie. The case looks cool and the inside is even better. The bluray copy is totally worth it. Must buy.
B0092D1V5Y|3.0|to all the people complaining that the app does not work if the explaination there a word in there and is the word &quot;PRETEND&quot;!!!!!!!! UH HELLOOOOOO it does not really hack in to wifi signals uh that's against the law hellooo get a clue people
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded the game twice with no success. I would suggest that other users  don't waste your time of you can't load it the first time.
0007107927|1.0|I read this for my Management class at school and was underwhelmed. Not just with the book but with the idea that there is any &#34;right&#34; way to manage people. Assuming that any strategy will work in any situation is foolish and believing that manipulating people and leading them are the same is folly.
034580404X|2.0|This first book was not nearly as good as anticipated, or advertised. It was definatly written for a woman to read.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|My grandson loves this game on line he also loves Legos and requested this set for Christmas he will be happy to see it
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This i an amazing app. It could not be better, this is probably my new addiction. The questions are great they are not to hard and not to cold.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the best unit, not just for the money, but period. I have had rokus, logitech revue, WD Live, etc. and this is my go-to because the interface is your phone, tablet, and laptop-all of which you understand and like (otherwise you wouldn't have them!). No more nonintuitive menus, clunky remotes, or unresponsive buttons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-interface is your chosen device rather than having another darn remote<br />-small, compact size means I can finally put TVs in my kitchen and bathroom where there is no room for a roku or similar. I can have just the TV hanging on the wall without a bunch of junk<br />-fast, responsive, and easy to set up<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Netflix does not auto-play, but I assume they will fix it<br />-Still requires USB power since HDMI does not supply power.<br />-You're in google prison, but you probably are anyway.<br />-Limited cell phone support. Pretty much only netflix, google movies, etc.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I liked the fact that the book wasn't a typical romance novel,  but there were a lot of French phrases and that was frustrating. However,  I learned a few phrases in the process!
B00915G6MG|5.0|Bought for my sister who loves NCIS she even named her dog Gibbs she watches it all day when it is a marathon this will give her an option to watch it whenever she wants
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I never considered the life after the Overlook for poor Danny T. A great glimpse further into a uniquely gifted, but commonly burdened character. I also enjoyed the quick pace the story progressed at. Not always the case with King.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|So far this has been a fun game...I hope it actually is free and won't end after 4 levels! However it's fun so far!!!!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Awesome book!  It kept me on the edge until the main end...and I wanted more.  The next two books are very good too.
B00AM2DL2U|5.0|Even if you haven't read/heard of the novel, this movie is really worth seeing.<br />The story is great, the actors are very believable, and coming from that part of the country it was like being home again.<br />Make the time to watch this one!
B000EHQTZO|5.0|The 8th Wonder Of The World. Currently filming a documentary all about the big guy, so can't have enough copies of this!
B001AMWTAG|5.0|I purchased this to complete my Volbeat Collection. It's not my favorite, Guitars Gangsters and Cadillac Blood or Live from Beyond Hell hold that spot but this is a good early work. I enjoy it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so adorable! Super fun! Lots of quests and rewards! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes who likes fun story apps with daily tasks and fun games! The ponies are so cute and the games you play with them to unlock new items are a lot of fun!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I wish we could give out half stars, because this movie really only deserves 3.5, not 4, so there you go.<br />Coming as a life-long Trekker, I was very excited for the '09 movie, and this one as well. Yes, I saw it 3 times (it's a birthday thing with friends and family), and in the theater it was great...to a point.<br /><br />I think you can tell that it's Trek-Lite, and while not a bad thing, it's not a good, sustainable thing either. This isn't to pan the acting, writing, directing for what it is...but it could be so much more. There's some solid work in this movie, and good ideas that needed to be pushed out of the darkness and into the light.<br /><br />Even with 5-15 more minutes of exposition/back story/character conversations you could have had a better movie with more of a substantive punch to it. If the story was about family, loyalty, sacrifice, etc. it doesn't go far enough on its own without rehashing what's been done.<br /><br />Watch and enjoy for what it is, but it's not Star Trek II...it's the 2nd reboot movie.
0802473156|5.0|This book was recommended to me from several sources - friends, family and councilor.  The concept of the 5 Love Languages is easy to understand and caused multiple &#34;aha&#34; moments for me.  Once you have read and understand the love languages you will be amazed what can happen when you exercise and use them.  Even better if your partner participates!  I also use these love languages with my kids and the difference in their temperament and behavior when their love languages are met is incredible.  This is hands down the best relationship book I have read - and I have read a lot of them.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|different from his other books.  Characters aware well defined and very interesting .  looking forward to another book by this author.
B00FPH6M82|1.0|Will Smiths son sounded like Abe From Odd World Odessy game. Great concept in a movie but no action more like fall asleep movie. I rented this crap and my Amazon experience was horrible. The movie Lagged on and on
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This movie expects, even requires, you to take your time in viewing it.<br />You may not instantly get it, and that's ok. If you just let the events wash over you, and especially if you take the time to watch the extras, you'll understand why movies this complex don't get made today...too many people want bosoms, explosions, quips, and more explosions.<br />If you're willing to take a few moments to think about what you're experiencing, it's very worth it.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This fast-paced, funny film kept my wife and I and our two young boys (3 and 6) very entertained.  We've been talking about it for several days now.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|I love being able to check my gmail on my kindle. It saves me from being on my desk top. I can relax in my easy chair and check my email. It's pretty cool.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Bought this for my grandson. He was thrilled to get it. He said it was the best present he got all day.
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|Some Last Global Anthemic  Shout-Outs OR sum \\"One, two three FAWH!\\"...?<br /><br />This is a SOLID album by MACCA! 3 stars out of four! Very funny line in the last song.<br /><br />Revolver-y sounds color one track big time. One sentimental number-that is also a cool point of view. Should I make you guess if there are any surprises near the end of the record? There is-but what? Keep reading and keep listening.<br /><br />I liberated a copy of Paul's new album titled \\"New\\" ('cause it's \\"NEW\\"-get it?) from a local big box store before it was released tomorrow.  I will only make two Beatle references and one Wings comparisons, ok? I saw Paul for the first time this summer (Im 34 so I hadn't waited THAT long, but I've been aware and into his stuff since I was in pre-school hearing \\"The Girl is Mine\\" on my mom's radio as she put on her make-up in the early morning.<br /><br />There are some funky credits such as iPad Tabora App (George bite's tongue from heaven) and \\"programming\\"-as a musician that plays an instrument, that is 'scary stuff, scary stuff, man.'<br /><br />Mark Ronson is a producer on several numbers, but fear not these tunes are not full of anything you might have as preconceived about his style. It's Paul's music. He usually runs a tight ship, eh? Giles Martin, Paul Epworth and Ethan Johns also get producer credits<br /> Ok, after 2 listens, the songs:<br />1 Save Us-Co-written with Paul  Epworth, this is what Pual or John would call a Potboiler! A driving rocker to kick off the record and comes in under 3 minutes. Simple instrumentation with Paul on bass, guitar and vocals and Paul E. on drums.  A 6 out of 10 (of course, graded on the slightly adjusted Paul McCartney Composition Curve. You remember this one after 3 listens.<br />2 Alligator-Could easily be a single. Paul employs his trusty road band line-up we've all come to know and enjoy. Abe, Wix, Rusty and Brian on their usual instruments. Paul plays: Guitar, bass, glockenspiel, percussion, synth, celeste, and play-me-a-songbook. Whatever that is. The lyrics are cool-\\"like maybe his take on the whole Facebook and Twittisphere. Some very spacey middle eights. Nice uptempo mix of acoustic based pop, with some rock weaving in and out. Mark Ronson produced this one.<br />3 On My Way to Work-First someone is musically credited with the performing of \\"programming.\\" That's a first for me. Sounds similar to recent new material. Midtempo-focused on the Liverpool working class hero's view of life and love. Produced by Giles Martin, son of, well you know...<br />4 Queenie Eye-Could rest Easily on \\"McCartney\\".  The title references a game that the young lads would play as young kids in the 50s. A fun romp. Cool, memorable melody, nice upbeat tempo with change and P on Moog, Mellotron, lap steel, bass etc.  \\"O-U-T spells out!\\" We all love that nugget from X-mas time is Here Again!<br />5 Early Days-\\"walking the city streets with two guitars across our backs...\\" Sentimental  journey completely him and John walking 'round Liverpool and maybe taking a bus to learn that coveted B7 chord. He is saying that he owns these early days. It's beautiful in its message. Consider that the Beatles are probably going to be recorded in history as the greatest musical bird ever to fly. And those guys did it. Holy crap! Emotional singin-this one is just a lyrics song. He could just read this to the tune of Old McDonald and the words are the deal.<br />6 New-is cool, produced by Ronson, with a cool little refrain at the end.<br />7 Appreciate-sounds like it could get slapped onto Revolver. The intro has some nicely effects laden vocal with some backwards guitar that oh, makes me think immediately of the vibe from Revolver. The lyrics. This is where Paul and producer Martin mine the fabric that makes up the finest Beatle album of all time. Mantra-style lyrics and some dischordant harmony vocals. Great song, great vocals and Revolver style instrumentation-fuzz, backwards, fades and all of that good stuff. The touring band does the yeoman work on this track too.<br />8 Everybody Out There-a good vibes song. Poppy, uptempo with a cool acoustic intro lick and blusey fills. Time signature chopping in the pre-chorus and some great lines about \\"therefore but the grace of God go you and I...\\" and a forcefull \\"HEY!\\" to grab YOUR attention. He is leveling with his audience. Good song. Lots of instrumentation with strings involved.<br />9 Hosanna-A good mellow song with some good bass (imagine that). A guy IS credited with playing the iPad Tambora app, though. Hey, it's a new ballgame. George might have cringed a bit at that.<br />10 I Can Bet-A nice poppy and hooky song that recalls \\"Flaming Pie\\" (the song). This one draws a Wings comparison too, because of its two bar \\"Jet\\"-like moog synth solo. Another \\"Programming\\" credit.<br />11 Looking at Her-Paul's take on \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" for his obligatory ode to his current love.  Innovative<br />12 Road-a bit o' filler...13 Turned Out-sounds a bit like \\"Biker Like an Icon\\" with some well placed slide guitar and a very \\"Pet Sounds-ish\\" bridge<br />14 Get Me Out of Here-Some Funny lines...some tongue-in-cheek stuff...Paul plays 'tubular bells' I NEED MORE TUBULAR BELLS! GOTTA HAVE EM! says THE REAL Bruce Davidson<br /><br />Thanks for a new album Paul-I love you man.ood stuff. The touring band does the yeoman work on this track too.<br />8 Everybody Out There-a good vibes song. Poppy, uptempo with a cool acoustic intro lick and blusey fills.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love the fact that I can see what's going on in Facebook without having to get on my desk top. My kindle is very convent. I recommend the kindle to everyone. Great product, Great price.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The plot of the show is interesting you learn a little bit a about politics and how lawyers work. I like the caracters.
B00F52YOPA|2.0|After you complete the room there isn't any more rooms ! You just go through the puzzle over and over or your start over and redo the room. Also the some of the puzzles are so dark you have a hard time seeing what is there.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|I haven't read the book, but ever since I saw the trailer for the movie, I've been impatient to see it! It's.. wow.. aliens are more humane than us, humans. Good thing that more people see us as brutal, cruel creatures, an infection tot his world. Maybe something will eventually change. I liked the utopia where finally our planet and everything on it has reached peace. I also loved how those aliens were depicted, loving, gentle creatures that look nothing like animals or human-like creatures, yet they are everything great that we (generally) are not. I just loved them so much! It may sound like nothing specially exciting, but when you see it, you'll probably like it. Amazing movie!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Cut the Rope is a fun game. I can spend allot of time playing this game. The time gets aways from you.
B002M9WW30|5.0|This set is awesome.  I introduced my kids to the world of Rocky and they love it.  Watching with on BluRay really does put you right in the ring.  A great way to watch a classic!
0316219266|4.0|So, I just finished reading \\"The Everything Store\\" by Brad Stone.<br /><br />I am not a fan of elaborate and long-winded reviews about whether a book is worth reading or not.<br /><br />I'll make it easy for you - this one is.  It's a good read as a business book, as a tech book, and it is helpful if you're interested in Seattle history.<br /><br />I'll go into more detail below if you're reading what the \\"self absorbed internet troll\\" Robby Delaware thinks.*<br /><br />If you're like most people who peruse reviews, I hope this helps.  I was contemplating writing a too-cool-for-school review that mentioned the time I thought I ran into Bezos in Ballard on the sidewalk in back of the BofA building.  But I didn't.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Now for some of my self absorbed ramblings.  This isn't what I liked about the book, more about what I found surprising.  The author himself acknowledges that this is one of the first complete histories of the company, and I would wager that there will be an afterword to future releases of this book.<br /><br />I've been looking forward to the release this book for some time.  I downloaded it as soon as it was released for Kindle.<br /><br />I began reading this book in a sort of unusual way.  I began reading it by kind of keeping a mental checklist in my own mind.  I was curious if the author, who has covered Amazon for a long time, would omit certain things. The book is clearly biased towards Amazon and Bezos - which isn't surprising and doesn't diminish the appeal of the book.  Still, I couldn't help but think that portions of the book were clearly written by someone who wasn't familiar with Seattle culture and by someone who didn't quite view events the same way that many other people did.<br /><br />I took notes while reading the book, and here's a list of things that I found surprising about the book while I was reading it:<br /><br />I was very surprised that a number of relatively small controversies since 2008 didn't make it into this book.  I believe that the absence of these stories is unfortunate, and won't help those seeking a full understanding of the company.<br /><br />Amazon, since the rise of social media, has become the source of a number of controversies that I like to call \\"Twitter worthy.\\"  Many of you may recall stories like Amazon Japan selling whale meat, or a pedophile self-publishing an e-book how-to guide, or the remote removal of Orwell books from Kindle readers for DRM reasons, or the deranking of Gay and Lesbian literature.<br /><br />While these stories in an of themselves aren't the kind of stories that are likely to make it on the front page of a newspaper like the Wall Street Journal, these stories will be remembered.  One of the only times I ever saw a DRM issue discussed on television was a segment I watched on a cable news show in 2009 about the kid in Minnesota whose Orwell books (and notes) were remotely removed.<br /><br />Why are these stories important, and why do they matter for Amazon?  It's simple, because Amazon has grown so large and so global, obscure controversies become easier to understand and even easier to pin on a single retailer.  Plus, you've got to feed the twitter beast.<br /><br />Remember the gay/lesbian deranking scandal in 2009?  Didn't a hacker do it?  Didn't the hacker claim that pulling the urls of gay/lesbian themed books was very easy, and that used an automated script to flag each one as adult?  Didn't the hacker claim that he did it for very specific political reasons, and that if you're going to do something like that for political reasons - it's only natural to target Amazon?<br /><br />You see what I'm getting at.  There's always been little stories like this - but in an age of twitter and Drudge the smallest story about a holocaust themed board game that one, solitary, third party seller offered can blow up in a spectacular manner.<br /><br />That was the controversies - I was also a little dismayed by how little space was given to Amazon's overall role in the life of Seattle, and I was shocked by how little of a role the Nisqually earthquake played in the narrative of the story.<br /><br />Why is the Nisqually earthquake important?  Well, first off, the book claims the earthquake measure 6.9 on the richter scale.  I don't believe that's correct - it measured 6.8.  Why quibble over something so minor?  I believe, strongly, that when future writers look back at the history of Seattle and Amazon's role in city life, the Ash Wednesday earthquake will play a much larger role than anyone who didn't experience it can imagine.<br /><br />That earthquake, which wasn't even that large, trashed a lot of Seattle's commercial real estate.  It wasn't just Amazon's PacMed building - there are still boarded up buildings in the city of Seattle today.  It is my belief that Paul Allen's South Lake Union project (which had been resounding defeated by Seattle voters during the \\"commons\\" debate years earlier) would not have proceeded if it had not been for that earthquake.  Which company has dived head first into the transformation of South Lake Union?  You guessed it, Amazon.<br /><br />I used to hanging out in the late 90s in South Lake Union.  You know who occupied South Lake Union in the late 90s?  Dudes who lived in vans, that's who. I went back to that same exact area in 2011 and the place was virtually unrecognizable.<br /><br />This isn't Apple building a UFO shaped HQ in a California suburb that already resembles a golf course combined with the set of \\"Logan's Run.\\"  The project to transform South Lake Union is like Robert Moses on ten lattes - a massive transformation of an urban environment - with Amazon at the center.<br /><br />I could go on about this.  About how the book neglected to mention the 1999 WTO conference, when newspaper columnists berated that the \\"black clad\\" protestors were \\"raging against the dot-coms in their own backyard as much as they were against global trade.\\"<br /><br />Or I could mention the recent Seattle Times series from the Blethen family that snootily noted that Bezos is the least engaged civic leader in a city that hosts the majority of America's richest people.  But, I won't.  You get the picture.  I don't think the book covered Amazon's tangled relationship with the city that well.<br /><br />Two other small points - and then I'll stop yakking.<br /><br />The book mentioned Pelago (where I spent seven months as a contract tester) as having been engaged in a mobile search project.  I don't think that description is entirely correct.  Yes, search was important, and yes, i'd heard that somehow people had or hadn't been asked by Google to come aboard.<br /><br />Still, I remember being told (even as a lowly contract tester) several times - \\"you might have heard this start-up is about location, email notifications, and tying coupons and deals together.  It's not about that.  You're not getting it.\\"<br /><br />What's the old saying that was used during the Clinton impeachment trial?  \\"When they say it's not about the sex, it's about the sex!\\"<br /><br />Pelago might had a lot of energy focused on mobile search - but it was basically an attempt to be a location-based Groupon before Groupon.  It's infrastructure fit so well with what Groupon wanted to do that it (surprise!) folded into Groupon.<br /><br />Why did the book make so little mention of the relationship between Groupon and Amazon?  Seattle tech blogs like GeekWire are regularly filled with stories of Groupon poaching Amazon executives.  Both the rise of Groupon and their quirky and endearing first CEO wouldn't have been possible without Amazon and the existence of Bezos.  Wall Street wouldn't have allowed it.<br /><br />One final point before I get off my soapbox.  The very end of the book mentions a woman who worked for seven months at Amazon trying to get the company to embrace social media more broadly.  Talk about understatement of the year.<br /><br />I've beencontinually amazed at the haphazard and lazy approach of both Amazon and Apple to social shopping.  If Bezos isn't a big fan of music (grabbing assorted cds off a shelf without even looking to see what they are) I'm going to guess he doesn't use or see much need in using social media for shopping - which is a shame, since the Kindle is such a perfect platform for doing this.<br /><br />The @Author program was a great idea - but with zero follow up.  The twitter feed hasn't been updated since February.<br /><br />The purchase of Goodreads looks like buying your way out of the problem.<br /><br />Anyways, I could write more.  Amazon's a fascinating company, that I have a variety of opinions about.  Purchase this book.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />*You have to refer to yourself in the third person to be truly self absorbed.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|Outstanding - item has all of the characteristics of a well thought out product. My complements to the producer of it.
B004P02OJ6|5.0|This is an incredible moving & action movie- not easy to hold both of these qualities in this genre. It has an original storyline, with a rich tapestry of moods, characters, surprises, suspense, and action, and occasional, very necessary comic-relief. Fairly believable plot. Casting was perfect, and acting without flaw, so far as I could see.
B0007VZ9DU|5.0|One of the best mobster movies out there and on DVD it's clear, sharp and nothing left to the imagination. Sit back, grab a drink, popcorn cause for the next 2 plus hours you'll be stuck cheering for the bad guys in Casino.
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|My first exposure to Benedict Cumberbatch, and not the last for a long time to come, I'm sure.  I've seen few love stories that match the complexities of this one.  Timing on the wife's part couldn't have been worse.  She had a good thing and she lost out in the end.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This was a good rendition of the look, mood and feeling of the day.  Even if you are a Lincoln historian and find it lacking there (I did not), it is almost as good as being there with the sets so realistic.  The low light that seems natural is the way it was.  As much as I have read about Lincoln, this movie gave me a real feeling for the man and the time.
B004LWZW2E|3.0|Insidious was a good movie, but The Conjuring was so much better!!! Be sure to watch The Conjuring and you'll see what I mean.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I would recommend Grain Brain to anyone who wants to be up-to-date in the field of nutrition. Dr. Perlmutter uses information about nutritional research, which he concisely explains to the laymen. Not only does he explain nutrition and the body's reaction to it, but he  also explains what we know about its effects on the brain.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|NOT as in real life, the good guys won here!  Although is it not historically correct, it does convey the hopelessness of slavery.  This is a good place to feel the kind of justice that is rare in today's world.  It is violent and gory. I usually don't care for this level however, it is necessary to get the correct reaction.  If you are looking for an accurate historical story line this is not a movie for you.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Great book! Funny, sweet and tugs at the heart strings. If you're an animal lover, this is the book for you!
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|An excellent start to the new trilogy, the film is visually beautiful, brilliantly cast and fantastically entertaining even after multiple viewings. I can't wait to see the next two films.

B00F35B8F8|5.0|For me it was another good Trekkie movie. I loved the first series with William Shattner but Chris Pine is the better actor and face it todays CGI make everything more believable.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|You can stop reading endless books on spirituality now. Gary has done all the hard work for you. You'll need nothing more.
B0036EDVS0|2.0|It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I don't think I'll ever seek it out for a second viewing. Some of the special effects are pretty cheesy, even for 1999. The real disappointment, though, is that it's a watered-down Tim Burton. There were really only two or three moments when the Tim Burton charm came through -- otherwise the rest of the film was pretty forgettable.

0786838655|5.0|The book, The Lightning Thief, by Rick Rirodan, is a story about an eleven year old boy named Percy. On Percy's first day of summer, he discovered something was different about him.  The fact that he did not know his dad and that he had dyslexia, all began to make sense to him. He was a half blood.  A half blood is half human and half greek god (in this case). When Percy figures out the truth about himself, his mother quickly rushes him off to Camp Half Blood. Camp Half Blood is a camp shielded from the outside world to keep half bloods safe from the creatures who want to kill them, and it prepares them to fight and go on quest for the Greek gods. At camp, Percy learns that he is the son of Poseidon and that something is terribly wrong in the god's world. Zeus's lightning bolt has been stolen and he claims that Poseidon has taken it.  If it is not returned by midsummers eve there will be a war that will end the human race. Percy and his new best friends, Annabeth and Grover, have been assigned to this quest. They must find and return the lighting bolt to Zeus. Will they return it in time?  Do they save the human race?<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about mythical creatures and greek gods. The book is full of attention grabbing action that makes it difficult to put down between chapters. The story is a quick read, 375 pages and the first in a series of five books written by Rick Rirodan. The Lightning Thief is a must read for all children.  It will make your mind wander with great creative and magical ideas.  I personally give this book 5.0 out of 5.0 stars and encourage all readers to read the entire series.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I enjoyed this book, the way it was written made you feel like you were right there. It appeared to be realistic the way it would actually be in prison. I have no reference to that other than what I read so I assume it's what goes on in prison. My only objective was near the ending it kind of lost my interest with some of the dialogue, it was to dragged out,before it got to the court proceedings. Then it was over just like that. However I enjoyed the book. I also enjoyed very much the episodes of this book on Netflex. Can't wait until the second season of the episodes.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|A modern review of the opportunities that make successes.  Some, the common person can use influence to improve life, some will just be nice to observe in others.

B00007GZR5|4.0|One of the better - and more overlooked - performances by Robin WIlliams in this film depicting a man's literally going to hell and back to save his soulmate.<br /><br />Quirky in spots, the plot is saved by interesting (and at times rather imaginative) visuals. However, the sub-plots and flashback sequences may make this hard to understand if you're not completely following everything.<br /><br />If you're looking for another &#34;Patch Adams&#34; or &#34;Good Morning Vietnam&#34;, best to pass this one up. However, it's a movie that stands on the merits of an interesting (and possibly controversial) story line that will leave you thinking in the end.
B0060CRM6M|5.0|I got this movie for my grandson to watch he loves it he watches it over and over I love it

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing.It's really cool,you can do all sorts of stuff like what you do in real life. You have a lot of inventory,alot of space to build awesome things, and unlimited worlds. You can name the world's anything you want. You can dig underground tunnels,caves,anything you desire.

You got swords,bow/arrow,pick axe, tnt, and slot of other things.and guess what? it also has survivalcraft,in survivalcraft,you have to gather resources, find food,survive mobs,threats,and animals that will hurt you. You have a lot of lives,but if you die you have to respawn.on creative nothing can hurt you.and there is alot of other things you can do in both. Buy this game,you will be happy.
B00ESNE696|2.0|I used to like this series - with a few reservations - but sometimes the plots are just a ridiculous excuse to make the lawyers look good.<br />This episode just jumped the shark imho
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Great entertainment, sweet story, Casters story line is very intriguing. Right after the movie I ordered the book series for my 15 year old, and for me, for Christmas.
1594202273|5.0|I can't wait to begin reading this book.  Unbelievable secrets kept by the government and we do not know what's next.
B000VDUWMC|3.0|This book has a good premise, poses an interesting question, and the author has some interesting answers. The writing style is very plodding and repetitious.  I am positive the tour guides who quoted it in Peru had never finished it, and I bet most Amazon customers who bought it never read it all the way through.
B0031ESW8O|4.0|This book is a great example of Victorian literature. Particularly revealing are the attitudes towards women and the mentally ill during that period.

B00AEBB8H4|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies of all time. i decided i wanted it in the best quality possible and available to me to watch whenever i wanted, so i got the blu-ray. i'm very glad i did, i love it.<br /><br />the packaging is simple, not anything extra or any frills. the same with the options on the disc. this is fine by me, the movie is the only thing i'm interested in. i'm so very happy to have this with me.

B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  (I will say that my girlfriend did not particularly.)  I thought the plot was original and interesting, and the &#34;twists&#34; in the plot were entertaining.  It's not going to win &#34;Best Picture&#34;, but it's a fun, lightweight, and thoroughly entertaining movie.  I understand a sequel is in the works, which should prove even more interesting.  Only think I thought was a bit weak was the ending....it did resolve the plot threads, but it was a bit anti-climatic.
B003L0VJF6|5.0|Heifetz always wanted the piano as his primary instrument but never succeeded in playing it in a concert (as far as I know). Here we have this fantastic young woman who has achieved what Heifetz couldn't. She is an marvelous fiddler capable of the most sensitive shadings and fierce attacks. And (for me) miraculus mirabili she's a powerhouse pianist. This is a dvd to treasure.
B005GIS23I|4.0|As close encounters go this one was hilarious.  As a vice laden little buddy comedy this movie was much better than &#34;Ted&#34;.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|By far one of the best seasons of Supernatural, lovely packaging, and great quality. My mom loves it and has been wanting to have hard copies of the series for a while now, so these have been a wonderful gift for her

B00F91RYL8|3.0|Mildly entertaining in an exaggerated, beyond credible way.  A zombie infestation drops upon the world like an unexpected thunderstorm. Brad Pitt stows his family aboard an aircraft carrier and flies off, first to South Korea, then Israel, then after a plane crash somewhere else. Details are unimportant. Brad figures it out and, due to his prowess and the script, saves the world. A touching family reunion follows. It's like eating junk food, momentarily satisfying then you wish you hadn't.
B009O07NMA|4.0|First off I like this album it should be a five. My issue was and is that tracks 1 and 2 don't play, tracks 3-11 work fine.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I think the plot thickens as each new character is presented.  I was so excited when the new male heir was born, but was so upset with the wreck in the last episode!
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|The acting was sub par but that is what you get with Woody. The specialeffects were a little too unbelievable and the ending was un imaginative.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|An oldly but a great movie. Spirituality meets science. Jodie Foster is so brave, a great role model for women! Worth watching AGAIN!
B004UID2LC|5.0|works great. really am impressed with quality of video and sound on my kindle fire plus free is always welcome.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I like this tv show because it sort of takes me away to another time and space for a while - alway from the troubles of my everyday life.
B000002J0N|3.0|In reading through the reviews, it's obviously a matter of taste which songs people connect with.  I find some of the music on this album stiff  or bland.  But my taste runs more towards the more spontaneous sound of the early albums of CSN & CSNY.<br /><br />That said, there are some real winners here:<br />See the Changes - stands with their best work<br />Shadow Captain<br />Fair Game<br />Dark Star<br />Just a Song Before I Go<br /><br />Some OK songs:<br />I Give you the Give Blind - kinda generic rock<br />In My Dreams - This one is sneaking up on me, nice instrumentation and harmonies, maybe will love it in time.<br />Carried Away - wistful melody<br /><br />Lesser lights:<br />Anything at All- decent background vocals, no melody<br />Cathedral & Cold Rain - dreadful, stiff, unmusical prose readings<br />Run from the Tears - not awful, but corny guitar riffs
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that it's a very nice game. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.so I think you should get it.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|I love how real this book is! Piper made me feel as though I were there in that prison too and reminded me that I am no better than any of the women in the book. We are all human and make mistakes...this book drove that home quite well!
B002WY65VU|5.0|Funny and entertaining. Bill Murray is amazing. Great for a gift, but you might not watch it more than twice.

B00EO10M54|5.0|So, the world is talking about Miley Cyrus right now, so why shouldn't I?  My wife would probably prefer that I don't, since she kind of hates Cyrus and her degrading antics, but at the end of the day this girl is on fire right now so I can't resist.<br /><br />Many have been balking about Cyrus's more resent appearances, picking apart everything she says, attacking her on public forums (celebrities, or former celebrities, trying to latch onto her fame by writing open letters to her criticizing her flagrant `exposure'), talking about her VMA performance as if she were infecting the audience with disease.  She's become the `go-to' for every entertainment newscast, every radio station and every internet forum.  Since she released her drug addled music video for `We Can't Stop', it appears that the world has been hesitant to embrace her new image and have been intent on tarnishing her image by nitpicking her every move.<br /><br />Apparently, this girl is Hitler.<br /><br />I have to say this; Miley Cyrus knows what she is doing.  The world, love or hate, can't stop thinking about her, and at the end of the day, that sells records.  But really, what is a girl to do?  You grow up Disney, you live in the shadow of your parent's success and are constantly being linked to him and even criticized for the relation.  You want to shake this good girl image because you can't stay `Hannah Montana' forever.  If you do, you'll fall into obscurity.  You are too old to continue doing the show and snagging new fans, and your fan base is getting older and is going to find you pathetic before long.  Then you look at your former Disney girls like Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato.  Lovato has a hit show and has branched out to an older crowd thanks to her personal connection to them through her own struggles and rehab.  She's become a spokesperson of sorts.  You can't do that.  Gomez has reached a bigger audience thanks to her acting, and her recent edgy film `Spring Breakers' certainly played a big hand in her album sales.<br /><br />But you want more.  You have the Hollywood boyfriend and the money to go along with it, but you want to be KNOWN.<br /><br />The problem is that no matter how much talent you have (and this girl has TALENT), no one takes you seriously as you are.  No one cares.  That is where her current outlandish behavior pays off.  Up until she became a sex vixen, no one cared about this girl.  We all knew who she was, but no one over fifteen was going to buy her album, no matter how good her song on the radio was.  She could have released this very album and the sales would have been moderate at best and even the reviews wouldn't have encouraged the masses to take a bite.  Cyrus was VERY smart in jumping right out of the box and saying LOOK AT ME!<br /><br />We're looking.<br /><br />Besides, she prepared us for the drugs, sex and language in store for us.  Believe me, the first time you hear Cyrus drop the F-bomb is a different feeling than the twentieth time, but had she not given us all a taste of her newfound confidence and complete `exposure', it may have been uncomfortable to listen to.  She fits this new edgy persona like a glove (or I should say that it fits her) and this album, and her image, go hand in hand.<br /><br />When I say that this album is brilliant, I mean it.  I've been getting banged for an entire week, and I can't stop!<br /><br />`Bangerz', the album, is a wide range of wonderful.  From ballads to up tempo club heavy tracks, the album blends so many influences to the right amount to give us exactly what we want.  `Adore You' is the perfect introduction to the album, layering her mature vocals over a very laid back and sultry track.  Right from the start, Miley is telling us that she has grown up, but that this album isn't entirely about shaking her tail-feather.<br /><br />From there, Cyrus takes us to the club with her infectious `We Can't Stop', followed by the even more infectious `SMS (Bangerz)', which features Britney Spears.  I seriously have been singing this particular song for a week.  At random I find myself saying \\"effing Bangerz\\" and I couldn't be more happy about it.  The song is flirty, fun and riffs old school hip hop influences magically with Cyrus giving us her variation of rapping, and she sells it.  She struts her stuff rather well.  `4x4' is a brilliant way to fuse her club sound with her country roots, giving us a line dance on speed with a chant worthy chorus (you just WANT to sing along) and fun lyrics.<br /><br />And then she SLAYS us with two of the most beautifully composed ballads I've heard in a long time.  I've personally been in awe of the power of `Wrecking Ball' for a month now.  The song sends shivers down my spine, with beautifully time lyrics and a powerful chorus that commands.  What I didn't expect was the brilliant `My Darlin', which precedes it.  Enlisting Future to help her out, Cyrus paints a bleak picture of her fallen relationship (one can only assume she's talking about her fallout with Liam Hemsworth) and she adds so many layers to her new image and sound.  She falls into the island influences beautifully, developing a darker version of a Marley sound.  That chorus is killer.<br /><br />`Love Money Party' draws us right back into the party scene, with Cyrus rapping over bass heavy beats and running out of breath (in a good way) on that crazy chorus.  #GETITRIGHT leaves the club, or at least the part of the club where people are taking off their clothes, and gives us to a more sophisticated up tempo jam that flaunts her stellar vocals and gives homage to the jazzy funk of the 60's.<br /><br />Then she hits `Drive' and brings back the devastating with a ballad that crashes down on us with a chorus that gives me chills.  The way her voice pierces with every stab of her tongue, calling out Liam and serving up scorned realness.  She turns that scorned persona on its head with her soulful track `FU', a song that feels so grand in its delivery, almost serving up Broadway comparisons, and her vocals are tremendous here, especially in that chorus where she runs the gamut with her range, showing so much maturity in her voice yet remaining very fresh and young in her lyrical content.<br /><br />`Do My Thang' is the only point in the album where I'm a little apathetic.  The track is perfectly fine, but it feels `less than' the rest of the album, coming across like Britney Spears filler with edgier lyrics, but I'll give it that bass drop at the end of the last \\"Ima do my thang\\" because it's pretty cool.<br /><br />The album picks up with `Maybe Your Right', a track that pulls in the reigns and gives her a very straightforward country/pop sound and will attract the fans she already has, while showing a maturity and growth that feels more comfortable in mainstream/contemporary pop.  It's also a great way to wind down an album that prides itself on being brash.  Then she closes her album with `Someone Else', which takes a similar approach but without the country origins.  This is straight up pop, but with a reservation that isn't found on her more outlandish offerings.  It closes the album giving us the new Miley without the offensiveness and lets us all know that this girl can give us everything, and she truly has over the thirteen tracks we just witnessed.<br /><br />But wait, it's not over yet.<br /><br />Nope, if you got your hands on the Deluxe Album (I hope you have), then you are in for a treat.<br /><br />`Rooting for My Baby' has so much old soul it may take the listener by surprise.  If you told me that this was originally recorded by someone like Etta James, I'd believe you, it has that much languid beauty to it.  Miley's vocals are also very mature here.  She sounds like a girl twice her age, and I don't mean that in any degrading way.  She carries each note with a delicacy that defies her age and shows a control that most girls that young don't know.  `On My Own' is straight up 90's pop amazingness and gives me Michael Jackson chills and may be the best thing Miley has ever done.  With a rock edge and purely infectious vibe, I can't help but absolutely LOVE this song.  Then the album officially closes with the Ludacris laced club track, `Hands in the Air'.  It is a more restrained club track, made for the grind, and it works.  Miley owns it and Ludacris makes the most of his presence, and the mild musicality shifts are effective and give this a memorable feeling.<br /><br />My hands are up and all over this album!<br /><br />So there we have it, my complete breakdown of this album (I haven't done a review like this for an album in a while).  Say what you will about Miley's image now, but this girl is one smart cookie.  She knows how to sell herself, and she has given us exactly what we wanted.  She has hooked the world and the best thing about it is that she has actually delivered a brilliant album.  Had she not gotten our attention, can we really say we would have picked up the album?  Had we thought she was going to give us another `Party in the USA' would we have rushed out to snatch that plastic off `Bangerz'?  I don't think so; but girl cuts her hair, twirks some midgets and flashes a nipple and we flock like seagulls to the most surprisingly rewarding album of the year.delivery, almost serving up Broadway comparisons, and her vocals are tremendous here, especially in that chorus where she runs the gamut with her range, showing so much maturity in her voice yet remaining very fresh and young in her lyrical content.<br /><br />`Do My Thang' is the only point in the album where I'm a little apathetic.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Ok, so this is a tough one to write about, let's see if I can get my point across.<br />Over the many books I've read or tried to read this past few years, Neil's novel was the only one that made me understand full the concept \\"being the devil's lawyer\\", that I'll have to be to write this little review. Usually I like or dislike a book, the reasons variety, it can be the type of storyline or simple bad writing, among other things, but that's not the case here and despite the high rate this was not one of my favorite book of all times, not even the last couple of weeks, it's not that I don't like adventure theme or children point of view, I really do, for instance Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder hook me up from beginning to end, but I'm not sure I could give my hearth to Neil's story, but even thought I couldn't submerge in his fiction world and fantasies, always out of reach from me, I can't denied the absolutely amazing details and descriptions, and his ability to show the emotion of a little boy in a scary scenario. So The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a definitely must read, if not for the story, or for the adventure of an amazing child, then for the pure magic that is Neil Gaiman's writing.
B005SAV9SO|3.0|I loved Cameron Diaz acting in this movie. She did a great job. Funny, easy going movie nice for a relaxing evening.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is fun and improves your drawing skills. And it is ageless so adults and kids can both. Enjoy playing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game and it does not take long to download.If you are a fan of Temple Run then you will love this.I do.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game to play and keep. Challenged.  Always co.ing fast at you and keeps you on you toes, maybe feet as well.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This movie has everything!  Great story, good life lessons, humor and love.  My son and giggled and belly laughed and even sniffles during the sad parts.  I will buy as soon as the price comes down.
0375869026|5.0|And a well written story that describes life in the 5th grade this book will inspire  Have shared it with family.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|I just want to say that this book has encouraged me to forgive everything and everyone with even more intensity and more energy than before. Gary's books and the course in miracles book have changed my view of life in a major way. Ever since I was a child of 6 or 7 years old, I had a feeling that I didn't belong here on earth, much like a inner feeling of sensing being out of place somehow. Of course as young child of that age I didn't know what to do or who to ask. I read a lot but not much made sense.  With time the feeling faded and I forgot all about it until I came across the Course in Miracles book and the inner feeling came roaring back to the surface. Gary's books have answered some many questions for me and has given me a new purpose in this lifetime: to follow the road of forgiveness back home. Thank you Gary for helping me get back home to where I really belong.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It seems like Grisham's earlier novels, were packed cover to cover with action and the &#34;I can't wait to turn the page for more.&#34; The Rackateer started off great then bogged down. Actually I skipped several chapters, Then the action picked up to the end. Good reading but watch out for the bog.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|super great app! easy to use and very entertaining! fun for both kids and adults!the graphics are real good. cant wait to play more!
B004GJDQT8|3.0|with this app it makes it a very fast  way to look up things you might want to get so you can shop faster. :)

B00FPH3YQA|3.0|I was disappointed, this movies was so not as good as the first 2. Way to much about Mr. Cho.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun game helpful hints.  The game is very,very, very quick to learn and play. Photo gallery is nice add-on. I amdone
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use mine all the time you can do just about everything and the buttons are easy to see. (very useful)
B000IDEORY|5.0|I have seen Dirty Dancing many times and each time I enjoy it more and more.  Classic, great, great movie!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wonderful telling of Danny Torrence in his later years! As always King grabs you and keeps you involved until the very last page. I highly recommend this read.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|I had bought this sonic screwdriver with the impression that it would be the same make as the Doctor's, but when I opened the packaging, I discovered that all this is good for is writing and shining. I tried unlocking doors, but it didn't work. Maybe I'm just using it wrong. If anyone knows how I can do the same things as the Doctor, please let me know!
B000PMG16U|5.0|Neat art on the case and the insert. I already owned IV V and VI in similar packaging and the two look great together on the shelf. All the movies play well and have cool menus. I caught myself watching the menu for almost ten minutes the other day. Overall great set for a Star Wars fan. Cheaper to buy these versions than the six film set too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I literally couldn't put it down. And I'm not the reading type! It was required for my class and it was the first form of homework I've enjoyed:)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great idea. Beautiful item.<br />Not play my local hard drive multimedia from PC. Maybe late???<br />thanks<br />Istv&aacute;n from Hungary.<br />.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a great idea and is still coming along.  You can watch essentially any video off chrome on your TV, which is the major benefit for me. And also its very small size. The only issue I have is that it lags/stalls.  not sure if thats my problem or the hardware.  for 35$, its worth it.
B003H6KRIE|4.0|Great price for all three Bourne movies. Nothing special though. Often a trilogy pack will come with extra incentives such as bonus features collectors books etc. but none of that here. If you already own one or two and are wanting to complete your trilogy I recommend buying individually.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep continues to keep me spellbound. I rank it with my top 5 favorite King books. And it clears up remaining questions. A must read.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|It does a good job doing what is it suppose too do. i would say I got a good value for what  I paid for.
0345509617|5.0|Where do i star with this book, it's the best film  of so far out of the earl 3 movies,with great infomation on how each scene was directed,wirten
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I now have 6 seasons of big bang, can not wait for season 7<br />The next series should have Penny and Leonard in a permant relationship, I hope.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Great movie!<br /><br />If you are an Arnold fan you will love this movie. This movie puts his dynamic personality on full display.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Great quality CD. Satisfied customer here.
B0064W667Y|4.0|The art style holds an excellent noir theme that appealed to me as one who enjoys a good sleuth in any genre. The language and conversations feel authentic to the environment and I was left with no doubt that a cursed shape-shifting wolf would be conversing with one of the three 'little' pigs.<br /><br />After completing the novel, it was unsure whether I was expected to have been able to solve the crime myself ahead of time, or just be along-for-the-ride. The way the exposition was included before the final chapter, I felt that I should be able to solve the case myself were I to be more familiar with the world of these Fables. It was a frustrating moment that detracted slightly from the finale as my mind raced to see if I could determine the ending before Bigby.<br /><br />While I wasn't able to solve the mystery myself, the story played out perfectly and left me wanting to explore  Fabletown more. I will definitely be exploring additional volumes of this wonderful world Bill Willingham has created.
B0063IH60K|3.0|More confusing. Then playing in real life. But a good way to pass time just make sure u really know how to play the game ! Not a good way to learn
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show has been so much fun to watch.  I love the different take on the traditional fairy tales, and that it has remained fairly safe for family audiences.
6305428042|5.0|Works great. No complaint.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This is one of those shows where you start off not knowing what you're getting into, because by the time you end up done with the first sitting, it's Tuesday, and you started watching Wednesday.
0756603749|4.0|Nice tidy little book with good picture. Bought it for husband but he has never even opened then front cover
B006M4F67A|5.0|I find this very enjoyable. I forget all problems and just work my mind. It is like a physical workout.
B003JTHRQO|5.0|This book revealed truths about my life of which I was currently unaware. I highly recommend every single reads this book no matter what life stage you are walking. You may hear the five love languages and think you know what yours is, as I did before reading this book, but you may be mistaken as I also discovered upon finishing the book. It's a quick easy read that when put into practice really does enhance your relationships with others.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|ive played this game on my phone and I want it on my kindle and I literally removed everything so I can play it... and it says still to much memory WTF!!!!
0143113100|3.0|Bought for my husband but he never read it, not a topic I'm interested in so I can't provide a comment as such. Lent it to a friend who was interested in it.
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|Pretty much the worst installment in the series, and that's saying something when you look at 2. Nothing new in this movie, other than long shots of each room that last for almost five minutes, followed by the occasional noise or door being opened. Seriously, what do they expect us to do when they write that? \\"This s***'ll scare the S*** out of them. I'm gonna make the door open.\\" And then we as the audience go \\"Oh God, do you see that? The goddamn door is OPENING!!\\"? Yeah, it was scary in the first movie because nobody ever made a first person haunting movie, but use it over and over and eventually we'll just laugh at it. Speaking of laughing, I feel bad for saying it, but I laughed when Katie snapped Ben's neck. I don't know why. I also laughed when the mom was thrown around the living room. It was just stupid. Not to mention the cult thing at the end. I mean, in 3 when they had the group of old ladies it was scary, but hundreds of people crowded in a backyard? That's pushing it. And they never did explain the group, which still bothers me. Anyway! Long story short, s***ty movie.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I'm just starting out playing, and I've experienced some game crashes, unfortunately. But overall the game doesn't seem too bad.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is not a work of literary fiction, but it is a darn good read.  A guilty pleasure with a wicked twist.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered this for my dad because he likes showing everyone videos and pictures he finds around the web. The great thing about this is that now we don't have to walk over to his laptop or have him take it to the diner table.<br /><br />It works great and anything to everything shows from the laptop to the tv. He only had it for a day and already knows how to use it like a pro.<br /><br />It's very easy to set up with very little time.<br /><br />I can stream flash videos from Newgrounds with little to no lag.<br /><br />I will be buying another one soon for my self and as a gift to a friends & family for their birthdays.
1558908382|5.0|Cusack is a favorite in our household, and this is classic. Moderately paced, acceptable for the kids, and not stupid-funny, it is a good way to break the Netflix/Hulu+ routine!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I did not like the story.  The whole plot was ridiculous, the characters were completely unlikeable and unbelievable.  I wasted my time  reading this trashy novel.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|This was perfect for my needs. I'd def buy another one if I needed it, but I'd def recommend this.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Yes this one more of my favorite sites. I go to it often, and with the holidays come up I suspect I'll be frequenting even more.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This is definitely an impressive addition to the Star Trek family that is so much better on a monster TV in 3D! The quality is fantastic; my husband and I now buy the good new movies in 3D and watch them on our 60&#34; plasma instead of going to the theater for the one-stop same price ... But for this one we had to do both!<br /><br />Don't skimp - for extra few bucks, the 3D is pristine!
B0065AVS0K|4.0|Good acting, but Bruce Willis is getting old. Wouldn't recommend it to kids. The black and white film noir look is great.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|wow!!<br />this thing is amazing and I haven't even begun to truly push it<br /><br />I build my new machine and this is prob the best APU for the price and needs.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I never viewed YouTube much till i got my Kindle. This one of the greatest features included with Kindle. I've spent many happy hours on YouTube and am looking for many more even happier hours. Tank You Kindle.
B001OKGV6W|5.0|This movie is so beautiful. Jodie Foster played a very strong, dedicated female lead and I love her character. Carl tried to paint a very interesting angle between science and religions, I can understand why some bigots might take offense on this subject. It is very sad if indeed we are the only race in this cosmos, it will be such a waste of this endless universe and its beautiful physics.<br /><br />2 take away from this movie:<br />- Science is so beautiful, there are many trying to better humanity, but there are also many bigots.<br />- ACIDs are bad.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I only rate games that are very good and this one definitely is very enjoyable.<br />Worth the money and good graphics
B00ADQPB50|5.0|This is one of the best series on televison.  A guy at work got me hooked on this show, and I love it,  I'm watching Season 3, and hope the Series continue.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the game, very fun but addicting...lol I have only gone to play bingo once, was boring. This has been lots better! Have fun!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The best ww2 game in the market you can get the best guns that really sound the greatest and it seams the attachments are amazing
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Love it! But I'm almost upset that I watched them all in 3 days, because now there aren't any left :(<br />Wish they'd continue the story
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|What a voice - one of the rare young singers to really send shivers down one's spine. She has the qualities of some of the greats. Cecile McLorin Salvant will have to work hard to beat this one.
B000VUDSH6|5.0|This movie in my opinion is a must have. When I first got it however I almost returned it because I had to read the English sub titles. I took a chance and watched anyways. If you are a Jackie fan then you will seriously not mind. This movie made me laugh and made me cry. Yes, a Jackie Chan movie that will make you cry. Love, Love, Love this movie!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|IT was going to be the first time i really read a day<br />Kayla you are the best at mate
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|After Cher famously declared that \\"this is so farewell\\" during her 2003 Farewell Tour, she is back with Closer To The Truth. Filled with club bangers and haunting ballads, I believe this is one of her greatest albums ever.<br /><br />Vocally, she is unbelievable scaling a new peak in songs such as Red. Pride, one of the bonus tracks would be a massive hit if it's released. It's very catchy and uplifting -<br /><br />We got Pride<br />We own we own the night<br />We are we are the light<br />This is once in your life<br /><br />And Sirens is a totally emo ballad -<br /><br />When your heart is on the run<br />When the chains have come undone<br />I will always be the one<br />to carry you home<br /><br />Cher is styled simply, using soft focus photography to create that dreamy, misty look like Believe's cover.<br /><br />I strongly recommend the EU deluxe/Target edition - comes with 17 tracks. Four bonus and 2 totally fab remixes of Woman's World.<br /><br />This is bloody fantastic! Welcome back CHER!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Really loved this book. Fabulous story.<br />Will look for more books by this offer.<br />will recommend to friends and family
B008EKON56|4.0|Work properly on my iPod Classic. Just a little bit expansive but the product is exactly what I want after all.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book, while very well written gives such a tender look into the resilience of a battered spirit to rise above horrors at such a tender age, and emerge not wanting to give harm to anyone or anything is truly remarkable
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is the third Baldacci book I've read or heard (two were audio CDs), plus watching King&Maxwell on TV.  I liked The Innocent best, mainly due to the human touch that Julie brings as a street tough kid way mature beyond her 14 years. Will Robie also has a strong human side. Baldacci has spun a fabulous story here and I can't wait to start reading The Hit.
B000003CKH|5.0|I mean, what else can I there to say. Their lyrics are raucously unique and the beats are so defined. In other words, I could hear a CAKE beat and know it was them in five seconds. I'm only reviewing this album because I know it the best, but everything they have come out with get's listened to by yours truly.<br /><br />Reluctantly crouched, at the starting line. Engines pumping, and thumping in time. If your going to make music, go the distance and do something worthwhile. If your actually going to buy music and not pirate it, don't waste your money buy CAKE. If your not sure which album to buy, here is an idea. Put all the album names in a hat, grab one at random and buy it. CAKE doesn't put out Budweiser music. Samuel Adams on every CD.<br /><br />Even though I have listened to this album the most I'm not even sure it's my favorite. So hard to choose. Whatever you choose, you are right.
0802473156|5.0|I apply my learning from this book to every relationship I encounter.  It makes loving purposefully, so much easier and practical.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|This was a good value for the the money spent.  I used this to extend a webcam, and it worked flawlessly.  I had used a Logitech C310 camera.  Signal was clear, sharp, no electrical interference, no signal degradation.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This story was definitely a hard one to put down at night and before work. Stephen King continues to shine!
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I have inherited a perhaps s thousand slides and so far this product has been wonderful. I have only just begun the scanning process but it seems to be working. The directions are confusing though.
140006922X|4.0|Reza Aslan challenges our previous notions on Jesus the man.  I recommend this work, especially as a book study for serious and open-minded religious thinkers.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I bought this in order to stream a memorial service over the Internet.  It worked perfectly.  I think my only complaint would be that there's no gain control on the 2-track input (which is common on this design of mixer anyways)- it's almost like the signal is being attenuated by the mixer.  But as a USB audio input to my laptop (with a microphone, a line in from the mixer into the 2-track input), it worked perfectly.  I really like the fact that it requires no external power supply- it's powered by 5 volt USB bus power.  I imagine that if you had a USB power source (like a charger) that had a higher capacity that computer USB (which is limited by spec to 500mA), you;d get more headroom on the preamps.
B00FJG7KGM|4.0|Unvarnished sounds like a blast from the past, really a raw debut album instead of something from an artist with almost thirty years under her belt.  Not that it ain't great and fun to listen to, but... raw.<br /><br />Joan's vox are a little raspy at this point, but that's ok; adds an extra dose of emotion to the songs, especially since they're all about someone whose led a far from perfect life.  The old skool stuff does shine though- lots of handclaps, basic but catchy riffs, and a steady, classic drumming sound and style all make it sound a blast from the past- with an emphasis on blast.<br /><br />The only real drawback here are all the pronoun neutral songs; only once does Jett slip in that she's referring to another woman.  You'd think in this day and age, we- and she- would be past all that by now.  Maybe not, but the subtext in the songs remains fairly obvious.<br /><br />Any Weather is a good way to kick things off; like I said, the handclaps, background shouts (Hey! Yeah!) sound just like classic 80s bare bones rock.  Make It Back is another throwback, with some Jerry Lee Lewis-ish piano banging underneath.  Bad as We Can Be sounds kinda like album filler, but the opening riffs are great- reminds me of the opening to Talk Dirty To Me by Poison.  Unvarnished closes out with four live recordings, including a slamming version of Hate Myself For Loving You!<br /><br />Unvarnished is a nice return to form for JJ- a stripped down, back to basics session cd. Go get it.
B00006AW63|1.0|Apparently it can't be played on DVD. It can be played on your computer only a limited amount of times if you change the region from 1 to 2 in the united states.  When I complained to seller I was told that was in the small print.  Not worth the aggravation to deal with these people.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|For fans of the TV series, this gives a deeper view of this mysterious world.  A must read for saga fans.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was my first intro to the Jack Reacher series, and I definitely liked it. I will read some more.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|I'm a casual Pearl Jam fan; I know and like their hits.  If this album is anything like their previous releases, I'll freely admit I've been missing out.<br /><br />Eddie Vedder's voice is still strong and recognizable and he gives it a full workout on the cd.  McCready plays hard and loose, fast and fun. Cameron's drumming is what makes it for me- drummers are often overlooked in bands, but he's pretty hard to ignore here.<br /><br />If the first two tracks- Getaway and Mind Your Manners- don't get your blood pumping, they've got a spot as an extra for you on Walking Dead this year.  They completely rock out with My Father's Son, despite it being about the child of a psychopath worried about following in Dad's footsteps.  The lyrics, well... until now I thought only Roger Waters could make songs about mental instability palatable.  Yep, it's Pearl Jam alright.<br /><br />Infallible will definitely remind you of the rhythms of their classic, 'Alive', when it reaches the bridge.  And that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />Let The Records Play, about an old rocker losing himself in the musical glory of his youth, finds the boys really hitting their stride.  It's a jam all the way through, especially the guitar solo.  The last three tracks switch into ballad mode with Sleeping By Myself, Yellow Moon and Future Days, but the slower tempos won't disappoint in the least.<br /><br />Lightning Bolt is charged with energy; the fellas were clearly having a good time putting it together and it shows.  You're really gonna dig this one.
B0009X7664|5.0|Love to have a copy of this movie, but the amazing Gregory Peck bonus CD was great.  Everyone who is a fan of Gregory Peck should own a copy of this classic.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Really funny I would gladly watch this movie again, I can't wait till it comes out on DVD, very excited :)
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Haven't finished this one as yet. As I haven't finished this book as yeat (as a matter of face, have barely started it), so  can't give much of an opinion on it.  It seem quite interesting and well written at this point.
B00F1RR3Y8|4.0|My Granddaughter got this.  She loves it.  She plays it everytime I'm with her.<br />Its a good game for kids
B00459GJUM|5.0|I love the edgier state of the show. Great effects and story lines! Excellent science fiction!!!! Wish they would do a movie to finish it up!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Don't like this app and so I use the Silk browser on my Kindle to get to Facebook the old fashioned way.  This app always opens up on a odd page and I haven't been able to figure out how to get to my home page - no icon at the top for that.  I don't use it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|So much fascinating about this pioneer, responsible for Alternating Currrent, Radio, Radar and a host of other inventions that changed the world a must read for those who are sure that Thomas Zedison was the only genius (Tesla worked for him!)
076115728X|5.0|An excellent choice to give to my daughter to use in the classroom. Oops happen at any and all stages of life in and outside of the classroom. This book's message relays that oops(es) are imminent and your reaction/action can make them beautiful. BEAUTIFUL OOPS! is well-designed. You'll want to turn the pages front to back and back to front again and again.
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|I love the edgier state of the show. Great effects and story lines! Excellent science fiction!!!! Four more words geez!
B002RI9M2U|4.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is a book about the suicide of a young high school girl names Hannah Baker, who recorded her reasons for committing the act on several old tapes. After her death, she sends the tapes to those she claims played a part in her decision. One of those involved is the main character, Clay, who listens to the tapes and adds his own thoughts to the narration.<br /><br />To start off, I really liked the concept the book was based upon. It was unique and I was definitely interested to hear all of the reasons for her death. I enjoyed how things played out for the main character and I agreed with a lot of Clay's input while he listens to the tapes. I also liked how the narrative makes it clear that the final decision was hers and that some of the blame she places on others is not entirely fair.<br /><br />Other than three events in the narration, though, there aren't really a lot of big reasons for why Hannah does what she does in the end. I guess I was expecting something a bit more traumatic, as many of the things that happened seem like the typical high school fare. However, I can also appreciate the perspective that it wasn't one big thing that culminated in her decision, but several little things that added up. It's also a good reminder that the way we treat other people matters.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the story. I would recommend reading it as it was a quick read with a unique way of delving into a sensitive subject matter.
1408803011|5.0|I love this book. I can't wait for the movie to come out. J.K Rowling is one of the best writers ever.
0812548094|5.0|Was as listed. Good book dark at times but a fun ride and a fast read.good book book good happy
0062238868|2.0|This book arrived bent nearly in half.  I have not read it and am returning it.  It was shipped with other items and was not in good shape when it arrived.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|4-4.5 stars<br /><br />This was a very good story. I've never read the book before (although of course I've seen the movie many times) and Im very happy I did. It's mostly the same story from the movie but there are definite differences. I really enjoyed it and am glad I decided to try it out. I'd recommend this as a great read for those that enjoyed the movie or just enjoy a good tale of a little girl trying to get home and has an adventure along the way and makes some good friends. :D<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook version that was narrated by Ann Hathaway. She did a great job and I really liked the voices she did for this. I think her narration helped make the story even better.
B0053ZOQMK|4.0|Nice story and fun caracters. Not all dialogs are easy for kids, especially for those who are not familiar with western movies.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|THIS IS SO FUN. I REALLY ENJOY THE CHALLENGE IT BRINGS. IT HAS ME USING MY BRAIN UNLIKE I USUALLY DO.
B003O86FBS|5.0|I could not put the book down .<br />The writer has a very talented way of using words and creating suspense
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I found myself laughing out loud as I read this book. Would love to read more by this author. A very easy read.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|This cd is excellent!  The lyrics are always twisting and turning; having you wonder what she will say next and what she means exactly.  Lorde has a beautiful sometimes dark soulful sexy tone to her vocals; really love the way she sings!  This is a really gifted sixteen year old girl!!  It's a really cool mix of wild and fascinating songs brought even more intense by the vocal delivery.  Listen by the tennis court OR ANYWHERE YOU WANT! I LOVE the very first song; it's my favorite but they are all great and my sixteen year old song, Adrien and ten year old daughter Sierra request this cd on the ride to school!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series is fascinating... I fell in love with these characters and the concept kept me thinking for days. Read it!
B0042JTAI8|5.0|very talented writer<br />I enjoyed this book so much. I re- read many pragraphs over and over . Wonderfully talented writer
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Nice story, good action scenes but the last moments  could have been better, more believable. Jack Reacher aint super man
B001KQEE0U|5.0|This is probably my 5th time buying this album. Got to have this in my collection. Old school classic for real.
0345803485|5.0|What can I say about this book???? I've read all of them. I was a little disappointed in the ending of the last book, but overall I give it A+ A+ A+ A+ A+
B00CXQL828|5.0|Probably going to echo a lot of what the 5 & 4 star folks had to say, but this CD is great.  'I'm No Angel' is stuck in my head about 1/2 the time.  You can tell some actual song writing went into this because the tracks sound different, there aren't many that \\"sound the same\\" as is the case with a lot of music these days.  At first it sounded like Chris Cornell singing, nope, that'd be Richie Kotzen.  This lineup, in my opinion, is really great and if you love rock music, you'll love this as well.
B007SVPZMW|4.0|Pros:<br /><br />Beautiful visuals, audio, and classic gameplay<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />No gameplay variants<br />Once the AI stopped responding<br /><br />Fix the cons for a perfect 5/5.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I know that most folks bash Apple products, but Apple TV blows this thing away. Just the fact that this has to be used with a computer or other hand held device is a deal breaker for me. I would much rather spend the extra $63 dollars for an Apple TV with a remote, which is much easier to setup and more intuitive than Google Chromcast. Plus you can use Apple TV with Hulu plus, without having your laptop turned on. Spend the extra money for an Apple TV, you will be much happier!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Kept my interest. Definitely worth a read. Leaves you with some serious questions about your own relationships and their limits.
0345529057|1.0|I'm sorry I started it. Three aspects: Narrative, descriptions, plot complexity. The narrative is great. Good in the first book, great in the second, third and fourth. Descriptions are awful and never stop being awful. They kick you right out of the story into wondering if they should have paid an actual editor. The plot is hopelessly aimless. Of, yes, we all can see that there are promises of convergence sometime before either I or Martin dies, but Martin can only start plots, he cannot finish them. A feast for crows is essentially aimless, adding new characters and fleshing out minor ones for another thousand pages. Martin is 65, it takes him 5 years at least to finish a novel, and he has at least three more to go to finish the story. He won't finish it. Firefly and Deadwood all rolled up into one!<br /><br />I'm at 4000 pages, and another character that I like is killed. Nothing good ever happens in these books, bad to worse, bad to worse. There is much talk of his brilliant first-person narration and that is so. But his descriptions belong in a Bulwyr-Lytton contest. Do I need to know that he had bread and butter and raisins, with fish soup, followed by lamb with mint sauce, oh wait I forgot the rest of the menu, need to know that! Clothing, banners and food. WAYYY too much clothing, banners and food. Did I mention that I'm 4000 pages in and nothing good ever happens?<br /><br />After this dreck, snuff porn will seem appealing.<br /><br />I will read whatever he manages to finish before he dies, I'm invested in it by now. If you haven't been hooked, don't waste your time with this.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Does this album sound EXACTLY like Ten? No. Does it sound EXACTLY like Vitalogy? No. Should it have to? OF COURSE NOT. Isn't part of what's so great about Pearl Jam their ability to adapt, and change their sound? I dare you to find any two Pearl Jam albums that sound exactly like each other. Yet people ALWAYS complain about how the new album isn't the same as before, but NONE of them are exactly the same; each album brings something new to the table and it's almost always good. This is a band of gifted musicians, and it would be a waste of their talent to just make clones of all their previous work. This album contains so much passion, so much anger, and so much sadness in its twelve songs it's incredible. From the rage in \\"Mind Your Manners\\" and \\"My Father's Son\\" to the sadness in \\"Pendulum\\" and \\"Sirens\\" this album has so much raw emotion the disc practically bleeds. Although some tracks are certainly better than others there isn't a bad song on the whole album. So before you log onto Amazon and crucify them for not remaking Vitalogy or Ten, give the album another couple listens, trust me, it's worth it.
B000BKJ78K|5.0|I was so excited to find this set at a good price. Starwars, Whats not to be stoked about? Its the greatest most epic series of all time!!!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|For someone who didn't know anything about this movie or the book it's based on, this movie drags a bit. It seems to take too long for anything significant to develop and when it does it's over. Brad Pitt does an excellent job but the scenes are too CGI for me. Zombies that work together to climb a 80 ft wall is too computer rich in my opinion. Less CG and more real people is needed.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Awesome, just awesome! Definitely a must watch! The only issue is there are too few episodes in a season, it's a little disappointing...
B005LAIIGW|5.0|Gravity - at first you feel the peace and the serenity and you wish you were up there. No noise, drifting and free. Detached from the earth and all its earthbound problems it is just you and the endlessness of space. A little later the serenity and peace give way to a cold and forsaken place far away from any other being and the 3D experience on a huge IMAX screen make you feel lost and desperate and you want to scream and panic with Sandra Bullock but you know that no one hears you. It all felt so real: the tumbling around, every drop from her tears floating right at the audience, every piece of debris flying at you, the speed of it all and the millions of stars surrounding you with no orientation about what is up or down. This was so real, so captivating - we went twice and the second time was even better. The first time you are just taken away to and it felt like I held my breath for the duration of the movie. The second time I realized much more details in George Clooney's character and his heroism and the complexity of their relationship and how he saved her even in spirit. Loved this movie, love IMAX which makes this experience so real it feels not like watching it - it feels like experiencing it.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|With their 10th studio album, the band has displayed their widest range of vast musical talents.  While a track by track review might make for intrigue to hardcore fan, a casual buyer would appreciate the depth and musical variety an album like this offers.<br /><br />Having joined the band circa 1998, Matt Cameron's drumming virtuoso presence is felt most on this album.  While Vedder's voice, McCready's jams, Gossard's rhythm and blues, and Ament's base strumming hold significant value, this album is Matt Cameron's.<br /><br />On an album like this, you'll hear punk in the first 2 tracks, soft somber ballad like music in the fourth, and last, and everything in between in the middle from blues to pop to grunge, it is one of the better albums you will have the privilege of engaging in.<br /><br />I strongly recommend it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a nice game, simple but fun in its own way. Family enjoys it, so I can't complain. The upgrades and new vehicles give the game a bit of depth so you don't get bored by the repetitive nature of the general concept.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Best thing I have ever read.  I was completely engaged from the start of book and totally adopting my better eating program.  Good bye wheat, hello better health.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|I managed to get a copy of this book in the UK when it was long-listed for the Man Booker prize. I loved every single page of it. Catton pulls off a literary fiction masterpiece, with elements of a page-turning mystery and character development unparalleled amongst her peers. I can't think of any other recent  writer that has developed 15+ major characters well enough for me to keep track of them without copious notes.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|If I had to guess I'd say this book was either written by someone other than John Grisham or that he had a contract to write a 350 page book and ended it abruptly when he got to 356 pages.  The plot was moving along at a pretty good pace although clearly stretching reality at some points but when Max flew from San Juan to Atlanta I lost a lot of respect for the plot and John Grisham.  First of all, Puerto Ricans are US citizens...they don't go through customs on flights to the US.  It's the same as a flight from Baltimore to St. Louis.  Secondly, I've been in the international arrival area in the Atlanta airport.  Who's he kidding with suggesting that Max sought a specific \\"line\\" in which to clear passport control?  That area is massive and there are big burly men \\"directing\\" you to a specific agent.  To think one has the ability to shop around for one type of agent is ridiculous.  There's probably no easier way to attract attention than to do a dumb stunt like that.  But, since flights from San Juan land in the domestic arrivals area, this whole scenario was unnecessary anyhow.  Will I read another Grisham novel?  Hard to say...this one was a real letdown.
B0041C1ZXE|5.0|Tame Impala is definitely one of my favorite bands. This album is just such a jam. 10/10 would play again.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|The only thing I've been able to print is the test page.  Every time I try to print I get either of these 2 messages: 1. File is too big to print for PrintBot Free (same message for 1 page as was for 4 pages); or, 2. You've exceeded the number of prints available for PrintBot Free.  I guess the test print counts toward your available print jobs (I did 2).  I know the developers would rather you buy the app, but why bother to offer a free version if it doesn't work.
8866135887|5.0|I've used this to keep track of painting jobs, doctors appointments, and school schedules. Holds lots of info for such a small book!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is so addicting. not the hardest game ever but keeps you playing for hours. beware. I am obssessed now.
B00AEFXVW0|5.0|Eurotrip is a great comedy for anyone who likes classic comedy that has no restrictions on the content or language!
B0083B3KOQ|4.0|using a kindle fire, it is difficult to read epubs. this easily converts them so I can read them through the kindle. It would be nice if you could set default file types, and queue multiple files for conversion.
B001BANK32|5.0|It has been many years since I've read this book, but with it being October, I wanted to read a creepy, Halloweenish kind of book. Once again I am reminded of what an amazing author Stephen King is! Wow! I had forgotten so many little things in this book, and I am so glad I re-read it. Now that I have Danny fresh in my mind, I can start Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />Wahoo! Keep them coming Mr. King.
B00908DDZM|5.0|We totally love this cd. Listen to it in the car and on our laptop every day. Super awesome songs.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Monster movies have reached a new high. While there have been some recent quality giant monster movies like Monsters and Cloverfield, this is the new Gold Standard, IMO. I won't give away the plot but the story combines elements of of Transformers, Godzilla and tag team wrestling. The special effects are incredible. The acting is great, and the story works and its one of the few movies I've seen that lives up to the trailers.
B000001EGA|4.0|This is a kind of offbeat record.  Think it's a bit of an autobiographical trip down memory.  A good deal of fun.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|OK, you don't need me to recap the storyline, or the fact that J. J. Abrams has rebooted the eternal Star Trek franchise into a new timeline with a cast that more (Carl Urban as Bones McCoy) or less (Simon Pegg as Scotty) mirrors the original crew. But I can happily add that this edition not only met the high standard for action that the first installment did, it added a depth of emotion that both surprised and delighted me. How often do you see the male leads exhibit real emotion in an action movie? The mix of serious discussions and amusing banter was just right for my taste, and while the plot wasn't novel, the story moved along at a good clip, providing entertainment if not surprises. This, clearly, is one for my library.
B00EEL0LGY|5.0|After playing with the earlier version of this I'm quote happy with number two. Its a lot more interesting with multiple stunts. Haven't tried multi player yet.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is a fun game that is a little challenging - but not so much as to be difficult for younger kids.  It is a game that can be enjoyed by kids and parents.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|An interesting look into a man specially trained to kill in the service of his country. Also some interesting notes from the wife he left behind when he went to war.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Iron Man is a big action franchise, sure, with lots of super-suits, explosions, ultra-powerful villains, and everything else you'd expect. That's all great, fun to watch, interesting to look at. But what really makes this movie for me is the moments of character interaction: Tony blows off a standard-pitiful plea from Harley (the little kid who's helping him rebuild his suit and his confidence), saying he knows the kid's cold &#34;because we have a connection&#34; and driving away--and Harley shrugs, smiles, and says it was worth a shot, completely unfazed. And then comes home later to find his garage outfitted with everything a preteen boy could dream of, snark included. And I love Jarvis. Yeah, I'll be watching this one more than once.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Uno is a pretty fun game to play and I enjoy being able to connect with my friends and family so we can play with each other. The only problem is sometimes the game just crashes and you for fit the game and lose coins and sometimes it even goes real slow but that may depend on the device your playing on but that's all. Besides that its fun and good to play.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This is a good cable if you need a replacement for your kindle.  The only issue I have is that the cable has to be in the right position or it will not charge (it has to be somewhat &#34;propped up&#34;), but I think that may be a problem with the Kindle Fire itself and not the cable.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|It's good to see King back at his best, a great follow up from the Shining,could not put the book down. Had veered away from reading his short stories and series stuff. You have me back as a fan, keep them coming !!!
0064409422|5.0|Our 10 year old granddaughter has read this book twice and is on her third go. She loves it so much she's wishing for the whole set for Christmas. Too bad Amazon doesn't have a partner in the US to purchase the set through. They are all out of the UK. I did find them on Overstock however. Excited to see the sparkle in her eye on Christmas Day!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love this show. It is funny, Castle is easy on the eyes. And I think the story line is great.  There is not much decent to watch on TV any more, but I would recommend this show.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My whole family (parents & kids) have fun with this game.  It can be challenging at times and really makes you think.  Love it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|All I can say is that this is such an amazing app ! You can personalize every thing and have it just the way you want it ...Whatever you like it's on here....You won't regret downloading it -!!!You will be addicted !!!
B00ENYCQX8|4.0|The Kindle app that was installed by Samsung works great with books<br />purchased from Amazon (only). I tried EpubReader, BookReader Free,<br />neither had a simple way to bookmark the book being read. BookViser<br />works very well with either formats.
155890641X|5.0|Now I liked this one., in time my granddaughter will love it too.  She is only 3 but should be into the princess's soon.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I GREW UP WATCHING THIS STUFF BACK IN THE 60'S AND DREAMING OF SPACE AND A BRIGHT FUTURE.  HOW WRONG EVERYTHING HAS BEEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.  THIS FORWARD THINKING SHOW SAW CELL PHONES, LASER BEAM WEAPONS AND SPACE COWBOYS!!<br /><br />YOU CAN NEVER GET TIRED OF WATCHING CLASSIC TREK.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is actually pretty fun, but survival craft is much better. For one thing, survival craft is half the price. Eight bucks for a game is just to much. Here you have  only a few species of animals, limited block choice, and STILL i just cant figure out what I'm supposed to do with string.  So, this game is fine, but survival craft is soooooooo much more for your buck.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|This is the best toy my kid jumps around and watches the bird and frog with delight. Love love love it
B009RX7WTI|5.0|Now this series I really like., I had to have the ninth season to keep my collection up to date.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|The book was really good. Would have liked a little bit more sword fighting, though.  But all are good characters. Leo was a bit layed back.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|my grandson loves it. He is three and can operate it by himself. Many different levels that can keep him interested for at least an hour.
B002VXGW2E|5.0|I watched hundreds of Julias' TV shows and now get to relive all of that thru Meryl Streep's reenactments...she is Julia in this movie!<br />Thank you!
B000I186FW|1.0|This movie was bad on too many levels. I'll try to briefly highlight them below:<br /><br />1. Sound Quality. It was not an error of the movie itself, but rather, you can hardly hear the \\"V\\" character talking at many points in the movie. He talks so quickly and at such a low tone, you can barely hear what's going on. His personality is corny.<br /><br />2. Story line. The story line was confusing and even contradictory at times. For example, one man is gay, yet he cherishes a copy of the Koran in his secret chamber. Do people not realize the Koran condemns homosexuality? Why would a homosexual ever value the Koran? It makes no sense.<br /><br />Plus, this movie gets overly dramatic at points when it is not necessary, and the plot drags and gets off track too many times. It tries to be dramatic and make you relate with the character's problems, but totally falls short at doing this.<br /><br />3. Forces the gay agenda down your throat. I didn't see anything in the reviews that this movie would be basically pushing the gay agenda down my throat, but of course it did that too. Why? I have no idea, as it seemed like someone just threw that part in the movie at the last minute to get your sympathy and the support of the gay crowd. It failed at both counts.<br /><br />4. Not family friendly. I wouldn't dare watch a movie like this with children. It is definitely not a \\"superhero\\" type movie, like the trailer painted it. This is NOT like Batman or Spiderman. Families beware.<br /><br />5. Encourages government rebellion. I'm no fan of the government, and personally think our current government is wicked. However, this movie should not really be encouraging violence and anarchy against the government. It does just that unfortunately.<br /><br />Overall this was a huge waste of time and money. It was the worst few dollars I've ever spent in my life, and I wish I could get those 2 hours of my life back.
B00005A46T|3.0|bought this in my metal days, just now reviewing. always was a slipknot fan. pretty decent cd. just sits in my old cd case now.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|Love this game. Easy to use. Lots of educational learning experiences. My three year old grandson and my six year old granddaughter love it.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|This is a great app. I love the animation and the accuracy. I look forward to recommending this app to friends. Thanks.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Quite useful for taking notes. Not good for sharing large files. Expensive to upgrade. Would try a bit longer<br /><br />Used for a project remodelling
B001QE9WEO|2.0|Obviously Return of the Living Dead 4 and 5 were made to make this movie feel better.<br />After the fantastic horror-comedy that was the original &#34;Return of the Living Dead&#34;, this one takes an agonizing, eye-poking turn.<br />Special effects remain roughly the same...maybe even marginally improved.  But this doesn't stop every other bit of direction...from acting, scripting and plotting--anything interpersonal...completely non-enjoyable.
B0091QS88K|2.0|I find it very hard to use. The free addition only cooks two items. If it cooks more I can't figure it out. If I bought the complete full version, I hope it would be as good as the Dr. Panda's other games.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|Will Smith usually is one of my favorite actors but in this flick it comes across a bit slow and except for his son there isn't much action.<br />I thought this was suppose to be an action film but Will sits in the crashed space ship directing his son where to go. If I had to choose this film again I probably would not have rented it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|An on the edge of your seat read with twists and turns every time you turn around. Can't wait to start the next book
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Can't say I like either character in this book.  Fighting college students and immature lead characters not my cup of tea.  I won't finish the series at this point.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is easy to play, yet challenges my mind enough to keep me sharp. Great puzzle solving and it's fun!
1490313370|5.0|James shares some thought provoking personal experiences mixed in with very practical advice about how to choose yourself.  It's not often that entrepreneurs are so candid about their successes as well as their failures.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great box set, pick it up. For the price it was a steal $19.97. You cannot go wrong with this purchase
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I was looking forward to this game - the reviews looked promising. Unfortunately, the app doesn't load at all on my Nexus 4. :-(
0345511468|5.0|i would recommend to all my starwars buds  including non starwars fan the details were great and the picts were kool
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful. It just gets better and better!  The acting and story are superb. I can't wait for season 4 to begin!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have had a hard time with some of the books on the law of attraction, not being the &#34;warm fuzzies&#34; type of person.  I am part artist, part scientist in my approach to life.  I am a natural born sceptic, relying on my own experience to validate claims made by others.  The very first experiment blew me away!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I have enjoyed every one of the Jack Reacher books.  I'll keep going till I've read them all.  If you like books with interesting characters these are for you.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game is great but it could be a lil larger hard to see all of the tiny things also when u hide some things behind things hard to recognize what they are
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Not much in the way of plot (of course) but very badass, gory, and adds to the thought that justice always prevails, no matter the odds.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|All in all a pretty good app.vThis is a great game for kids especially. As an adult I got bored with it after awhile. My kids enjoy it. The games are short so they don't get to the point of playing for hours. I would recommend.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Is very fun, but I've noticed that it is not multi-touch..which means that It is hard to get past some levels. Otherwise, very good and VERY fun haha
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|You know something is wrong, but you don't know what.  Then you figure out what, but you don't know how. Lots of delightful twists and turns. Great cinematography and effects. Good acting. Enjoyable right through to the last scene.<br /><br />Several scenes pay homage to other Sci-fi Classics, but I will let you figure those out for yourself.
B00B52F278|1.0|What can I say without giving anything away? If you saw Vengeance, then you know it was TOTALLY unrealistic and beyond the bounds of believability to think the chicks back then where these fearsome fighters going up against Rome's best warriors!!!! I mean, really! The only thing I liked about vengeance is that Spartacus' rat-faced love-interest got killed!!! Yeah SPOILER ALERT!!!  But now we have even MORE testing of credibility when we're asked to believe that Navea.....the 90lb sopping-wet, sniveling slave girl (who isn't even the original Navea), is now a fearsome gladiatrix (yeah right) slaying mountains of well-trained, STRONG, muscle-bound Roman soldiers???? C'mon people....give me a freaking break!! It was bad enough in Vengeance when she killed Ashur....ASHUR.....A FREAKING FULL-FLEDGED GLADIATOR who not four episode earlier had beaten three Roman Soldiers....and now this???? This chick RUINS the show!!!!  In the first episode of this last season (thankfully), I counted no less than six Eagles they had captured from the Romans. Are you freaking KIDDING ME?!?!?! Jesus Christ....what the hell were the producers thinking?! I SO wanted Navea to die off earlier, and save me the aggravation of always having to yell &#34;BS&#34; at the TV when she would beat 2, 3, 5, 7 MEN...all warriors! But hey...at least she had an annoying screech when she'd cut them down!! Ugh, what a COLOSSAL disappointment!!!  And what's with Crassus and his wife? They're spitting images of Glaber and Illythia! Honestly....the ONLY one who added some interest to the show was the guy that played a Gaius Julius (a young Julius Caesar).  Except for Crixus and Gannicus, all the main characters are dead or have left the show....so enjoy the 10 episode slog through a non-stop blood- and sex-filled show that's trying it's best to compensate for the loss of Whitfield at the cost of having a good cast and believable performance!!! Ugh!! Damn you lymphoma!!!!!!!
B0035HKWM6|5.0|For me most Jim Carrey movies lose their luster after seeing them a few times but after watching &#34;The Mask&#34; again I thought it better than before.  The movie streams flawlessly and sound as well.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I always loved this series and was thrilled to be able to see it again.  Thanks to Amazon for offering such a wide selection of shows.
159562015X|3.0|I found the survey interesting. It would have been much more helpful if it related my strengths to how I could work with people with other strengths.<br /><br />I ordered a copy for three other people. Two of the people could no access the strength finder by using the code in their books. What should they do to access the finder? You do not have an email contact on your website, or a phone number. the works so I could not get help from your company.
B001EBWING|5.0|Technically the picture streamed clearly and the sound flawless.  And thank goodness they didn't kill the movie by colorizing it.  The nuances of black and white comes across so well I can't imagine the horror of changing it into color.  Never gets old.  Great movie.
B00CTT9646|4.0|I bought this movie mainly for the phaser and the blu-ray disc.  I saw the movie and thought it would be great for my collection and it looks great on the new television.<br />  Now for those who are complaining about the extras I guess maybe I should look at those things but never felt that they add much to the experience. I thought having the alternate universe helped get over the slight differences in charactors without rewriting everything completely. It's not the perfect solution but it keeps the movie and actors from mimicing the original cast which would have been laughable. The tie in to the Wrath of Khan was not the strongest and the ending was a little weak but, it brought life to the movie that fits the time we live in now. As a small child it was easier for us to be distracted by Star Trek's simple special effects and we accepted those weaknesses. I do believe if they could have had access to the computers we have now they would have taken advantage of them and incorporated CGI into the TV series and more into the movies. Let's face it the original Kirk had a flip phone!!!!. Think of what we have now for phones....touch screens on everything... so why would the new bridge look like the old one. The phaser was just icing on the cake.
B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|The scenery in this movie is absolutely stunning! Beautifully filmed. The music is beautiful as well. But the story and the acting was even better than all of that! I loved every minute of it!
B001AQIYJC|3.0|My wife likes the movie and not to be sexist but every woman I've ever asked loves this movie.  Technically okay but for me it doesn't get past okay regardless of how many times I've watched it.
0399255370|4.0|I've had my eye on The Day the Crayons Quit for a while now. You know those books that keep popping up everywhere you look, and each time you see them they still manage to look interesting? Well, I figured it was about time to pick this one up. And my local library just happened to have a copy. (Hooray!) Here's the premise: Duncan's crayons have gone on strike. They have some issues with the way he's been using them (or, in pink's case, not using them) and are withholding their services until he finds a way to meet all of their demands. What are their complaints? Well, red is feeling a little overworked, yellow and orange both insist on being the only color for the sun, and black finds it unfair that he does all of the outlining but never gets to be a featured color. How will Duncan resolve all of this (and so much more)?<br /><br />This book is adorable: fun, crayony illustrations and laugh-out-loud text. I read it aloud to my husband, and we both got a kick out of it. Plus, Duncan's solution is creative and just-right. This book is too old for my 16-month-old and seems more fit for a child in preschool or kindergarten. It's definitely worth reading, and probably even buying. I think it would make a great gift.
0060930349|4.0|Paul Johnson writes pleasantly. The problem is that his data is incorrect in too many cases. and Writes a partialized story where all Republican presidents are good and Democrats are bad. Johnson belongs to the extreme right and almost destroy a work that could have been masterful. The best thing about the book is biographies of people. It is a story of people. It also describes, comment and opinion. Not is an academic history. Are comments to the story, but the text is good.
B001E6X4W0|3.0|Technology-wise it streamed well, good color and sound.  I'm not sure what I thought when I saw it in the theater when it first came out but this time it was just okay.
1592536913|4.0|It is a pretty good book other than I wish each photo had an individual detailed description. Overall Love for the book though.
B003G4W49C|4.0|The only reason I purchased this book is because in my youth I'd read Card`s work. While my memory isn't what it used to be I knew in a primal sense I'd enjoyed it. His style is simple and he never sacrifices clarity for richness, enjoyability for complexity.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|The story is great. I have spent hours playing this. Some of it needs money but it's fun without paying. Everyone should check this out. I'm even downloading the older one because it's so good.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|Love This Tour. MDNA is my Second Favorite Madonna Tour.<br />Very Theatrical, Very Sexy, Very Controversial, and Tons of fun.<br />Honestly, not a fan of the editing on this DVD - which is disappointing.<br />I had Front Row at the very tip of the Triangle, and was Front and Center inside the Golden Triangle Twice. Again, this DVD does not do this tour any justice. The intensity, the details, the energy, the way Madonna works her tail off, her sexy dancers, the works. You just don't see it unfortunately - But totally worth buying and seeing.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is mostly a hunt object game, but it is relaxing and I get to play it when I have even a little time. The only issue I have is the pictures are a little hard to see,  I would prefer a sharper picture.
B00FSBW2L6|4.0|This is the third book in The Three Nations Trilogy. The story is about the Hinterberger family who own and run a farm and restaurant, named The Black Eagle Inn. Anna has been running it with an iron fist for most of her life however not having been blessed with children, she is constantly weighing up her nephews and nieces as potential heirs. It soon is clear that the choice lies between two of her nephews, Markus and Lukas. Unfortunately her best laid plans are ruined by the one she loves most.<br /><br />I actually found this book quite sad. It wasn't sad in that it made me cry - it didn't. It was more in that you were sad that so many of the characters were blinded by their greed and that when things fell apart they were too proud to forgive.<br /><br />The story was well written and there was a lot of development in the characters. My attention was caught from the beginning and the outcome of the story was quite unknown to me until the very end - i didn't find it predictable at all.<br /><br />I found the tone to be a little different compared to the first two books, The Luck of the Weissensteiners and Sebastian. They were more historical fiction whereas this was more of a family saga simply set in the past. There was a lot more actual politics in this book as well compared to the other two. The other two were political in the sense that they involved the war and all the politics surrounding that however this book had a lot of politics to do with area of Germany where the story was based. I actually found in a section towards the end of the book that it was a bit too political - i felt like i was being too heavily persuaded in certain views and opinions.<br /><br />I also just wanted to say that i really appreciated one of Christoph's notes at the end. The book had a lot of negative religious content and this is what he wrote - \\"Equally, the book is by no means intended to offend religiously devoted readers. Religion is not at all meant to be criticised, only misuse of it for other purposes.\\"<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to those who like family saga and also historical fiction although it's not technically in that genre.<br /><br />This review is based on a digital ARC provided by the author.isuse of it for other purposes.\\"<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to those who like family saga and also historical fiction although it's not technically in that genre.<br /><br />This review is based on a digital ARC provided by the author.

B00C1CO0XS|4.0|I am in love with George Benson and I like Nat King Cole. In this tribute George sounds too much like Nat and not enough like himself. It would have been better if he put more of his own soul into each track and not tried to sound exactly like his hero. There was not enough of the unique talent that puts George into a class of his own as not just another pretty voice.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Great fun, humor and lots of special effects, great acting, writers did a bang up job, (no pun intended); definitely one for my collection!!!

B00FPH3YQA|3.0|This seemed like a cliff hanger more than an ending.  The second part of the series was better than the third.
B00FPGV3RS|3.0|Had some good moments but was slow in many other areas.  I would wait for it to come to Amazon Prime.

After all, the free trial I downloaded from the play store worked fine and I didn't have any problems. I received a refund after the rep had me reinstall the app and it didn't fix it. I don't know what the deal is, but this app isn't by the original vendor (Gamehouse).
B002M9WW30|5.0|It's the collection that I've waited 7 years for.  The first and sixth movies are the perfect bookends to a saga that has its ups and downs.
B00E7SXPVW|5.0|I'm going to start this off by saying I'm incredibly biased about this album. I  was born in 1990, and somehow,  by magic or fate,  went  fifteen entire years,  until 2005,  without the slightest bit of knowledge of who  nirvana were. (I was musically sheltered by my mother,  who listened only to oldies  and classical) sure,  I'dheard teen spirit  and lithium on the radio in that time,  but I'd never thought to ask the name of the band; I never cared.  until  the summer of 2005,  when I found this gem hiding in my father's cd  collection ( technically, I found it in the literal garbage he kept under his bed).  I consider myself lucky,  since I think there's no better she to discover nirvana  than 15.<br /><br />I found it,  and thought I had something special,  made just for me. I thought that I found something new, which I was determined to introduce my friends,  neigh,  the world to...  this is really embarrassing to admit,  given that this is an album  from one of the biggest bands of all time,  but my point is  that even without that context (I can't even describe how devastated I  was  when I  learned  Kurt Cobain  was  dead),  without even knowing who I was listening to,  this album blew my mind,  and changed my life.<br /><br /> now that story time's outta the way,  onto the review of the remaster...  I'm happy to say,  this is not nevermind. nevermind  it's old.  it sounds old.  there's no denying,  that album was made in the 90s.  the sound,  the production,  everything  about it reveals it's wrinkles.  it really needed a remaster,  and boy was that remaster...  disappointing.  no nuances were revealed;  if anything they were diminished,  hidden behind a wall of sound which was amped up to 11  for no reason  at all. a  remaster should not be louder,  it should be clearer.<br /><br /> my fear  was that they were going to do the same thing to in utero. I really didn't think this needed a remaster,  even. 20  years later,  this album sounds more fresh than some music that was made a  year ago. the last thing my life needed was some  record company exec bastardizing  one of the greatest things that had ever happened to me.<br /><br /> I'm happy to say the opposite occurred here from what happened with nevermind.  listening to the original side by side,  some sounds were actually  muffled,  just  shuttle bit ( not enough to take anything away)  in order to reveal little bits and pieces of sound I never knew existed ( even after hundreds of play throughs).  it's not louder,  it's clearer.  the original still sounds good after 20  years,  but this version  well still sounds great in a  hundred years.<br /><br /> top that of with the remastered  b-sides.  I already had mv  and I  hate myself,  but the versions I had...  left something to be  desired ( the version I  had of I  hate myself  and want to die,  which i'd  downloaded off of MySpace  in 2006,  sounded like an 8  track being played through a telephone).  it's nice to have em  both crystal clear for once.  once again, mv  has sent chills to my spine.  and the alt mixes  of  heart-shaped  box,  all apologies  and pennyroyal  tea are a real great listen.  heading what those songs could've been can make one really appreciate what they are.<br /><br /> disc 2  does the albini  mixes.  the differences a are both minute  and striking at the same time.  hardcore fans,  such as myself,  are sure to gobble up every removed  over dubbing,  every added piece of feedback  and studio noise,  while casual fans probably won't notice much of a difference. I love it,  because it sounds like nirvana were just playing the songs,  like they weren't in the studio;  like they were just playing a private,  intimate  concert for anyone willing to listen.  I'm sure some people will hate the removal of gloss from this already rough album.  still,  the extra lack of polish  adds an extra dimension  which allows one to experience this album like new  all over again,  and the extra feedback  mixed with the lack of over dubbing  probably makes this version of all apologies the most haunting available.<br /><br /> then there's the rio  demos... I  liven em, but  gonna leave them alone.  it's not required  listening,  but it's a nice extra.<br /><br /> To conclude, I am grateful for this release.  it added to the album,  painting a clearer picture of this rough masterpiece,  unlike it's predecessors  remaster.  the fact that some of the sounds were turned down rather than up really show the care  that was put into this,  adding yet more years  to this timeless masterpiece.  it brings instant happiness,  reigniteing  the dark,  yet whimsical wonder I had when I first experienced this music.  yet it also brings instant sorrow,  since there's nothing left to look forward to in the world of nirvana.  all I can do now is look back in awe. ( this cd was purchased in physical form  from a major retailer;  it was not downloaded or purchased via  Amazon) 5/5

B002P5XXR0|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie so listening to the music especially with my eyes closed brings me back to the beautiful scenes in nature and the grace in which the Nav'i move.  I am not a fan of war and the music captures conflict well however in all, James Horner has done it again and created music to reflect the energy of a film in an amazing way. He also did the score for Titanic.  He and James Cameron make good partners!

B00DW1WR14|5.0|I love Pearl Jam. I have since they first hit the scene, and I've been lucky enough to see them live seven times over the past twenty years. I'm way too biased to even pretend I can give you an objective view, but I can offer up the following observations of &#34;Lightning Bolt&#34;:<br /><br />• The music on this album covers more range than I think I've ever heard from them. From their grungy roots to their emotional ballads to their experiments with jangly blues, new wave and psychedelia, everything is here.<br /><br />• At the same time, there is a cohesiveness to this album that I can't really recall on any Pearl Jam album since No Code. Whenever I start listening, I feel compelled to listen to the whole thing. That did not happen with Backspacer or the Avocado album. I think part of it is lyric-based. Everything on this album seems thematically connected, as there is an ever-present tension between inner emptiness and soul satisfaction. There is no Johnny Guitar or George Bush monologue to contend with. The stories that are told are more first-person and feel less contrived.<br /><br />• Ed is unafraid to let you into his heart, and that is a double-edged sword. If you buy into it and take his lyrics seriously, you will be richly rewarded. The band clearly is &#34;all in&#34; on Ed's style of songwriting at this point, and helps ensure that lyrics like the following, from &#34;Sirens,&#34; pack the necessary emotional punch:<br /><br />&#34;It's a fragile thing / This life we lead / If I think too much / I can get over- / whelmed by the grace / By which we live our lives / With death over our shoulders&#34;<br /><br />If you aren't looking for your heart strings to be pulled, and you have had a problem with Ed's soft side in the past, then that issue will likely come up again for you in spades with this album. On the other hand, you'll probably still dig the way he wails on songs like &#34;Infallible&#34; and &#34;Swallowed Whole,&#34; and &#34;Mind YourManners&#34; and &#34;Let the Records Play&#34; will probably appeal to the pit mosher and barn stomper in you.<br /><br />• There is a &#34;somber hopeful&#34; paradox that absolutely enthralls me. It goes hand in hand with what seems to be a new emphasis on setting the mood. After front-loading the album with three pretty straightforward songs of angst, Pearl Jam really starts revealing that mood at the song &#34;Sirens&#34;, which combines the dark imagery of ambulance sirens with transcendent lyrics of love. The music finds a way to echo this, which to me is somewhat of a revelation on this record. The new concert opener, &#34;Pendulum&#34; is also dark and beautiful. &#34;Swallowed Whole&#34; is an anthemic uplifting tune that has an unexpected, navel-gazing Pink Floyd keyboard drop in the middle. &#34;Yellow Moon&#34; has the kind of splintering tension that harkens back to &#34;Release&#34;. And while I originally thought &#34;Future Days&#34; was overly sappy, the dark church organ that booms during the &#34;I believe&#34; lyric keeps the tension tight in that song as well.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is one of Pearl Jam's finest works, exploring new ground while deftly weaving together the skills the band has acquired over the years. All the songs feel fresh and beg to be played live, and in my opinion, there isn't any &#34;filler&#34;, which cannot be said about every album by this band. Bravo!

B00DW1WR14|4.0|Even when Pearl Jam is down, they're never out.  The former grunge ragers saw their star dimming after a string of middling releases culminating in the early 2000s, but have been the beneficiaries of a full blown renaissance following the release of their 2006 self-titled album. In an age where many bands today rely on heavy helpings of studio trickery, Pearl Jam presents one of the most convincing arguments for pure guitar rock. For the most part, Lightning Bolt sticks to the blueprint established on 2009's Backspacer and the self-titled, but throws minor curveballs here and there.<br /><br />The lyrical topics sees Vedder keying in on questions of religion vs. science, God, nature, and his own mortality. Ravishing opener \\"Getaway\\" tackles these issues head on, with Vedder seemingly turning his back on religion as he declares that you sometimes must put faith in no faith. Jeff Ament's bass often finds itself buried under layers of guitars, but here it gets plenty of breathing room and provides the backbone for one of the album's crunchiest and most melodic rockers. \\"Mind Your Manners,\\" meanwhile, is a callback to the band's early grunge days with its blistering, grimy guitar and punk rock influence. With speed an intensity rivaling that of \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" from 1994's Vitalogy, it's sure to be a favorite with the headbangers.<br /><br />The concept of self-examination is another of Lightning Bolt's defining themes, and nowhere does this come across greater than on the striking ballad \\"Sirens.\\" This piece is custom designed to tug on your heartstrings, as Vedder reflects on his own mortality while hearing police sirens blare through the street late at night and ponders the ramifications of leaving his family behind. At times he raises into near falsetto, and sounds as though he's about to get teary eyed himself as he sings of dancing with laughter with the ever after. The theme of death and tombstones crop up more than once on Lightning Bolt, but never is theconcept painted in more dynamic brushstrokes than what we see here.<br /><br />Yet with all this discussion of Vedder, it's easy to get away from the varied instrumentation that makes up Lightning Bolt's colorful patchwork. Guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard are once again in fine form. The title track features some of the band's tightest and most focused playing to date, presenting a passionate, stripped down, and immediate approach as waves of churning riffs and solos cascade out of your earbuds. \\"Mind Your Manners,\\" meanwhile, features a bridge that cuts through the muck and grime to deliver a sky high stanza, before giving way into a methodical and highly calculated solo.<br /><br />There are also some great moments of experimentation to be found dotting the album's second half. There is an ever so minor southwestern vibe that creeps up here and there, but is most pronounced on \\"Let the Records Play,\\" a grooving tune packed with smoky blues solos and a beat that could have been ripped directly from a ZZ Top song. It's not tough to imagine this playing at some backwater blues club frequented by the likes of Quentin Tarantino. Elsewhere, \\"Pendulum\\" develops at a slow, mellow pace and transfixes the listener's attention with a stunning sense of hypnotism. But it dissipates as quickly as it appeared, leaving you with a feeling of coldness and desolation.<br /><br />For all intents and purposes, Pearl Jam's 10th studio album is a fine achievement. The biggest drawback is that it often finds the band retreading similar musical territory they've been over numerous times. \\"Sleeping By Myself\\" and \\"Future Days,\\" aren't necessarily complaint worthy, but it sounds like the same type of low energy terrain we've covered before. It's good question as to whether the band will opt for a change of pace from here, but it's a question they can afford to put off for an album or two. Pearl Jam is still continuing to put out more than a handful of thought provoking hits, andthat should be more than enough for fans at the moment.

B00BB3UYS8|5.0|A wonderful coming of age story written beautifully by Mr Legg. I find the best stories to read are the ones that come from within and Mr Legg has reached into his heart and brought back several hundred pages of thrilling and pure (may I please use this word again?) story. And as a lover of excellent covers, Outview's reminds me somewhat of a keyhole. This is rather appropriate as the cover is the front door to any book and behind this one is a whole new world. Enter it. Get lost in its rather brilliant (here's that word again and for very good reason) story. Above all else, enjoy <3

Hopefully he will like it a great deal better than I do!

B00E5Q9VSW|3.0|A few years ago the Russian virtuoso Vadim Repin recorded the Brahms concerto with Chailly and the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and the hitch was with the orchestral part, where the conducting was correct but without warmth or passion and the orchestra - rebuilding under Chailly after decades of mediocrity in East Germany - was good but nothing more. Now the Greek virtuoso Leonidas Kavakos works under the same handicap. The timings have changed a bit, becoming slower in the first movement but faster in the finale. But what's missing can be heard by turning to Renaud Capucon's ravishing account with the vienna Phil. under Daniel Harding, where the essence is high romanticism all but drips form the score, and the orchestra sounds perfectly attuned to Brhams's idiom.<br /><br />To rise to such a high level, Kavakos would have to have something unusual or personal to say. Capucon made you feel that he believed in every bar of the music, which is absolutely demanded in a work this familiar. The soloist must breathe new life into it. In concert Kavakos gives off the same impression; he's a naturally warm, communicative performer, so it must be Chailly's coldness holding him back. The first movement is not memorable, but things improve in the Adagio, where Kavakos's playing is sweet and serenade-like rather than poignant and elegiac. Here the naturalness of his style speaks for itself; there's not a whiff of exaggerated feeling. He's quick and direct in the gypsy-flavored finale, leaving off the customary emphatic strokes that most soloists interject. But the unintended result, I'm afraid, is that the music sounds too offhand - we are meant to be dazzled, after all. Chailly is routine in both movements.<br /><br />Even though we live in a time of declining classical record sales, most of the big-name violinists have recorded the Brahms Cto., and I've listened and thought about the versions from Znaider, Tetzlaff, Repin, Capucon, and now Kavakos. I admire them all as musicians, but the cold-blooded side of me awards the palm, hands down to Lisa Batiashvili, a phenomenal player whose recording (on DG) leaps off the page with astonishing vibrancy; she is aided by remarkable conducting from Christian Thielemann leading the gorgeousu-sounding Dresden Staatskapelle.  I'd have to go back to Kremer/Bernstein, Oistrakh/Klemperer, and Heifetz/Reiner to find suitably remarkable rivals where the symphonic side of the Brahms concerto is rendered as magnificently as the solo part.<br /><br />The unusual fillers are the most welcome aspect of Kavakos's recording. Bartok'stwo Rhapsodies take a cue from the gypsy flavor of the finale of the Brahms. These are pieces that should strike directly to the emotional core, as they do when played by Bartok himself accompanying Josef Szigeti.  the other way to get the most out of them is in the ripe orchestral arrangements that are more commonly heard than the rather spare piano original - Stern and Bernstein give a big-hearted, throbbing account. Here, Kavakos and Nagy sound a bit sweet and tame, de-emphasizing the percussive, biting aspect of the writing.  They aren't very gutsy in the four Hungarian Dances of Brahms, delivered in the usual Joachim arrangements.<br /><br />Clearly Kavakos is following his instincts throughout, since everything is naturally musical, without showiness or exaggeration.  In that vein, he's very expert, but I'm not sure it's where the music really wants to go.  Gypsy and gentleman aren't two words that generally go together.the cold-blooded side of me awards the palm, hands down to Lisa Batiashvili, a phenomenal player whose recording (on DG) leaps off the page with astonishing vibrancy; she is aided by remarkable conducting from Christian Thielemann leading the gorgeousu-sounding Dresden Staatskapelle.

B0067TQQI8|5.0|Worked great until the connections/wires stopped working and broke off within the battery itself. Worked great for about 2 months. Great for people who like to travel a lot.<br /><br />A few days after my review, the company contacted me and replaced my unit with a new one, no questions asked. I wasn't planning on a replacement since the product was fairly cheap, but all I can say is that they have great customer service and they work hard to keep buyers happy!
0316074314|1.0|This book is full of the same pseudo-literary posturing that made The Rehearsal so painful.  I have a theory that the raving critics found it incomprehensible, so pretended to love it, just as they would have swooned over the invisible raiment made for the Emperor.  If you loved Catton's first book, rejoice - this one is much longer.  If, on the other hand, you're easily annoyed by pretentious twaddle and opaque plot, RUN!

This is an action movie, with some hard hitting scenes (literally). I'm sure some real events were elaborated on, for a touch of reality, but as a whole, I don't believe this ever happened.<br />It does lend a self supporting guy some ideas if America were ever invaded however!

B00EUS9JF0|3.0|Everything expressed here is under \\"IMHO\\" condition. So, please, try to be open-minded. If you still think that \\"Caesar's wife\\" cannot be under suspicion, let's just agree to disagree.  It's been more than 5 years since Paul's last album was released. So, I've been waiting for this one anxiously. Although I couldn't help but worry about the state of his voice: as has recently become evident (during the Jubilee concert alone), he is not being in his best vocal form nowadays. When \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" came out, I bought it, listened to it and was immediately struck by how weak and old his voice sounded. I was not too eager to get on the bandwagon of those, who cried out that his voice was shot. I simply shrugged the worries of, having thought that it had to do with the genre untypical for him. But wait a minute, he has been writing and singing some immaculate \\"Granny\\" music for years. After several listens, I realized: I wish he'd done this project earlier... sometime in the 80s and 90s. It would have made sense at any point of his career, because he has been clearly showing affection for Tin Pan Alley since 1963 (yes, I am referring to his brilliant cover of \\"Till There Was You\\"). The record would have turned out much better, had he done it, when the voice was stronger. Then came the Nirvana re-union, where he sounded really confident, so my hopes were high again.    When I heard the \\"NEW\\" single, I was quite cheered up. I like the song and expected the album to be as good as \\"Memory Almost Full\\" in all aspects. Alas, having listened to the album for the first time, I was very much disappointed. I was in such disbelief that I decided to listen to the album for the second time, thinking I might have been in the wrong mood or something. While I liked and appreciated the songs better, I am still disappointed with the album. Why? As much as it hurts me to say this but... Paul McCartney completely lost his Beatle voice. There is hardly any semblance to it left.  Some people, even at a rather respectable age still have their voices intact: Jon Anderson and Tom Jones come immediately to mind. Paul, to my deepest regret, lost what used to be one of the most and yet most powerful voices in the history of world music. I know, I know... age is to blame for that. I am just amazed, why so many people fail to see this and all the critics. They destroyed him for Ram but praise him for this record? This is most confounding. Anyway, let's try to go track by track.    Save Us - the riff for some reason reminded of Wings. And immediately... vocals. His voice is hidden behind several filters and backing vocals. The riff is rather obnoxious... Keep on sending your love - is the best melodic moment in the song. I really don't understand why this one is the opening track instead of a much nicer \\"New\\", which would have been in tradition to the previous albums: just remember how many times Paul opened the album with the eponymous song.    Alligator - a much better track. The vocals... alas, they don't get any better. The falsetto part makes me cringe as well as some \\"modern\\" tricks, which sound dated for some reason, as if this part came from the 80s. Had the song been sung by somebody else, it would have been a nice little track since in terms of production, melody and hooks it's very much appealing to me.    On My Way To Work - a! The vocals are slightly better. Although this vibrato, which recently appeared in his voice is still there. Nice start to a cheery tune.  Interesting instrumental break, slightly seemed similar to Blur... I don't know, this instrumental break/riff sounds like something Albarn would do either in a late Blur or Gorillaz album... which is not a bad thing! In any case, the riff does surprise as it comes out of nowhere and is completely different mood-wise from the rest of the song.    Queenie Eye - the opening of this track is some of the most beautiful chords I have ever heard. My favourite moment of the album. This mellotrone opening could fit perfectly into any classical prog-rock album. Then the track takes a completely different direction, turning into a cheery pop tune. It is interesting in terms of melody and the chorus is also lovely. OUT Spells out reminded me of Christmas Time is Here Again. One of the more enjoyable tracks on the record. Although it also suffers from a falsetto interlude, which also possesses the typical muffled interlude, like they do in pop songs (all instrumentation is muted and muffled before coming back with gusto).    Early Days - Paul showcases his loveliest acoustic side again. Jesus... his voice sounds so old and tired. I almost cried listening to this. Not because the song touched me, but because I was imagining how the 5-6 year younger McCartney at least could sing it, and it just broke my heart. He goes again into falsetto.... Oh my.  The lyrics are nice though: autobiographic nature of them makes the song special. The song is beautiful if not sung by McCartney of today. The ooh-ooh chorus is reminiscent of \\"Mother's Nature Son\\", but only this time he simply cannot technically pull it off.    New - I liked it the first time I heard it on Paul's YouTube channel. A really nice track. Nice to see harpsichord back. It is both happy and sad. Classic McCartney - perhaps the best track on the album. Problems with voice are slightly less heard here thanks to dense production. Even the falsettos do not sound as bad.  The \\"I never know, what I can be, what I could do\\" reminded me of some song from a classic Disney cartoon... yes, it reminded me of Mrs. Potts' song from the sequence, when Beauty and the Beast play snowballs. Seems like the melodic line is rather similar. Very nice Brian Wilson tribute at the reprise of the song.    Appreciate - ah... Paul is trying to sound modern again. This sounds as awkward as \\"Ou Est Le Soleil\\". \\"Appreciate\\" refrain is strange and does not sound good in my opinion, makes the song repetitive. Again, the song itself is nice, but Paul trying to sound contemporary has just never worked for me. The best job he's ever done with trying to sound modern is just fooling around in the studio without any agenda in mind for McCartney II - such tracks like \\"Secret Friend\\" did sound contemporary and not forced. The best part of the song is the solo perchance played on that cigar box guitar of his... alas, it fades very quickly when the solo kicks in.    Everybody Out There - it is for some reason very similar to \\"Save Us\\". An average Wings song from 1976-1978 at best. The obvious sing-a-long part is just embarrassing. I can hear some slight similarity to \\"Young Boy\\". \\"Grace of God... and I\\" descending chorus is the best thing in the song. Sounds like a classic Paul melody right there albeit for a fraction of a second. And Paul pulls off polyphony quite nicely.    Hosanna - a great song, classic Paul, which means interesting melody and nice chord sequences. The vocals however... *sigh*... breaks my heart. He sounds so sad, as if he is about to cry because of that damned vibrato, which does not do him any favors. Sometimes he sounds like he is about to cry and I am sure the effect is unintentional. Love the closing instrumental fragment with the looped backwards riff.    I can Bet - intro reminds me of \\"Run, Run, Run\\" by The Who. Then kicks in a very nice classic Paul song. Very catchy and upbeat. Vocals are slightly masked by the filters, which make him sounds like Lennon on \\"Free as a Bird\\" demo with added reverb. Great solo in the middle too! One of the higher points of the album. Again, a very nice instrumental exit from the song.    Looking At Her - rather dated beat is what catches the eye... like a sore spot. I so wish Paul would stop trying sounding contemporary. A simple real beat by a real drummer and two guitars and a bass would have done the song more justice, which synths and electronic beats cannot do, making the sound of the song rather vulgar and \\"cheap\\" in my opinion. Melodically,the song is really good.    Road - brooding intro, nice piano driven riff after the chorus part. Paul vocally does sound better here, good enough not to spoil the musical experience... or am I just subconsciously trying to distance myself vehemently from the realization that Paul has lost his voice?    Turned Out - ah, I have high expectations for the bonuses. It is a known fact that sometimes Paul relegates some truly nice gems to B-sides/bonus tracks. This is no exception. Nice energetic intro, rather confident vocals and it's catchy too. I would make a substitution with this instead of either Save Us or Everybody Out There. Love the chorus. Could not get it out of my head. This track is surely one of the stronger cuts.    Get Me Out Of Here - okay, scratch \\"New\\". This! is my favourite track on the  entire album. Paul sings in such a way that his voice does not sound weak. Although the track does not have anything to do with BOTR song, it is still lovely. Great chords. It's simple and may sound like a pedestrian blues song, but I love it for some reason. \\"oh boy\\" sung in choir harks back to Travelling Willburys. I would not mind even if the song lasted longer. I truly enjoyed this song and it made me grin.    Scared - a nice piano ballad, which ends the album on a rather solemn note. One of the most sincere tracks on the album. Obviously, a love song inspired by his latest, thank God, happy relationship.    You've noticed perhaps, how many times I used a \\"classic Paul\\" expression. This is not coincidental: the five year break did him really a favour. The previous break from the solo career gave us \\"Flaming Pie\\", an album, which trumps many albums from the 80s or late 70s. The songs, vocals aside, are really good, make no mistake! Paul-composer has still got in him, beyond any doubt. His singing abilities have really suffered lately for whatever reason. Had he tried doing something, which would not demand a Beatle style vocal (like on \\"Get Me Out of Here\\") he wouldhave sounded much better. But since he is trying to sing like he used to for his entire life, he sounds just awful. It is just heart-breaking to hear his voice not spared by time. For some reason, it was very difficult to accept and I still can't. It just goes to show how soon wonderful things can happen... and if Paul's singing can cause such depressing thoughts in myself, a 22 year old, that is just sad. I had the same impression while listening to Sting's latest album, but since I care for Sting less, the effect was slightly less. Here, it is heart-wrenching. He can still write great songs, play like a virtuoso on multiple instrument, but! His voice is shot and this ruins the whole experience of the album for me. I was so bummed out that I quickly put \\"Chaos and Creation\\" afterwards and I was right: his voice sounds aged there, but he can still pull every vocal passage seemingly effortlessly. I remember MAF being slightly worse in this aspect, but still very much bearable. On \\"NEW\\", however, his voice has surely reached its nadir.    But hey, don't take me for my word. Who knows, maybe some of you might like his aged version. And every song on the album, but two, is wonderful, even when Paul is trying too hard to sound modern/contemporary. If not for his awfully shot voice, I would rank this record as highly as \\"Flaming Pie\\". With such a voice, or rather lack thereof, \\"NEW\\" is as good as \\"Dark Horse\\", when one is to take the vocal component into consideration. So... three stars: one for still exceptional composing skills, second one for \\"Get Me Out of Here\\" alone, and the third one... for old times' sake.  I still love Paul very much. He has done so much before he was 30, that he could release utter s*** for the rest of his life and still remain a legend. I am just happy to walk the Earth, while Paul McCartney is still creating new music. Definitely give the album a listen, but beware that it might disappoint considerably, like it did to me. As God is my witness... I really wanted to like this album... oh well, okay.

B00DW1WR14|5.0|Starting with a comment about production in no way diminishes the excellence of PJ's song craft on Lighting Bolt.  In these days when a &#34;good&#34; rock record has become synonymous with over-compression, O'Brien has helped PJ balance excellent songwriting with a truly organic sound.  Comparisons with the warm yet edgy sound of vinyl are hard to ignore here.  Close your eyes and turn your back on your CD player and you'll hear an analogue, not digital, disc.  If there's a band that can get the most out of O'Brien, it's Pearl Jam.  So throw away your surround sound, find a pair of stereo speakers, turn up the volume, and plant your head between them.  Play Lightning Bolt loud and let it strike.  Preferably again, again and again.  As far as the songs themselves, there is not a clunker in the bunch.  PJ is in fine form throughout.  Beginning with Getaway and culminating with Future Days, they've given it their all.  And it pays off in spades.  So far, nothing in 2013 even comes close.  So give it a listen.  You deserve it!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I thought the movie to be average. There were a couple of good startling moments, but not enough to really 'wow' me. It was way to fast-paced, so therefore, it was difficult to appreciate the concept. I say this movie ranks o.k. I expected much more.
B003ZJ70W4|1.0|I was really disappointed in this movie; it was pretty ridiculous and shallow, and quite frankly rather offensive. The portrayal of the Middle East was incredibly out of touch with reality and only showed the extravagance and privilege of the wealthiest people. Of course, that lifestyle comes at the expense of the rest of the population as well as many immigrant workers who make that lifestyle possible.<br />The ignorance of Carrie and the girls was pretty appalling, and their lack of respect for Arab customs was offensive. They embodied all American stereotypes and their behavior was the perfect example of why we are seen as obnoxious and ignorant in other countries. Who goes to the market in a giant, ridiculous purple skirt and a tight shirt with the Dior logo? Amazingly oblivious. And I understand Samantha was having a rough time, but that is never an excuse to be as offensive and careless of the beliefs and social rules of the country SHE is a guest in, no matter how backwards she finds their customs.<br />I seriously do not understand why they made this movies; are they really THAT blind and ignorant to think their behavior was in any way appropriate? Not to mention the storyline was s***ty and there was no plot. Basically the superficial problems of the super wealthy. And the humor was stupid and gross; some of the jokes and puns were literally cringe-worthy. Ugh. The first movie was so much better.<br />DO NOT waste any money on this movie, you will regret it and wish you could go back in time and not rent it. So unfortunate. I expected more from these actresses, especially Sarah Jessica Parker who is supposedly socially aware. This movie shows otherwise.
B00EY8ARYS|3.0|I don't honestly think that we can blame Joss Whedon personally for any of the problems that might exist with &#34;Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D&#34;. This show bares the obvious trauma of a series that was &#34;grafted&#34; from a successful film enterprise into an attempted television series. And in that regard, Mr. Whedon was likely a short order cook taking direction from network and studio superiors. The show's concept is most clearly taken from the successful film outing &#34;Marvel's The Avengers&#34; (2012). The sheer number of superhero players in a 2-3 hour film enable you to concentrate on spectacle and interaction between the team members, and the audience was more than eager for that interaction between well known heroes like Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, and of course recognized newcomers from the pre-existing solo films like agent Coulson and Nick Fury.  So . . . the team film could get away with the fact that the plot and action didn't permit much interaction with non-superhero types, whether they be family or significant loved ones.  NOW -- think about a team series that has to go the distance of 51 minutes a week for a 23-24 episode television series. Also,  &#34;Marvel's Agents of Shield&#34; is using the familiarity of Coulson and Fury to try to help us accept new recruits to S.H.I.E.L.D.  It's not that the characters aren't likeable, but they range from a couple of nerdy type scientists to ex-military characters who have trouble connecting outside of ops assignments.  So, for the broadcast hour we have interactions in the first three episodes that are primarily between superheroes and super-villains, pretty much like in the comic books. The first episode was more promising in which ordinary people were being transformed into superheroes to satisfy some villain's agenda - but since then, it's seemed like were dealing almost exclusively with the mile-high frequent flyers. &#34;Marvel's Agents of Shield&#34; may get better, but it's got a long road tohoe compared to CW's Arrow which tries to bring out more of the earthly struggle between being a superhero, balancing that life with the lives of family, and bringing us through personal as well as urban or global conflict.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|If you read the brief summary and think it sounds like fun, you'll likely like the book. It is well written, fun and has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing, and smart enough not to make you feel insulted. Great holiday thriller.
B005FRF6PC|4.0|I liked this book and I would recommend it for the casual Tennis or Sports Fan.  Good autobiography about Rafa Nadal, his life, his tennis, his family, etc. He leads you on a journey about how he started with the game of tennis, how his Uncle pushed him to the limits to get him to where he is right now.  He stresses how his family and having everything in order are so important to him.  I have always liked Rafa as a tennis player and as a person, he is a very down to earth individual, never likes to be in the limelight, a very graceful winner, does not show-boat.  Wins with class, thats why I hope he breaks Roger Federer's Record for most grand slams of all time.  I recommend this book if you want to learn more about Rafa, his life, his growing up, what drives him, what motivates him, etc.

B000NY12LO|5.0|Nineteen Minutes is a well written book with strong character development.  It deals with more than just a school shooting.  The story centers around the lives of people who were affected by the shooting, including the shooter himself, and how his family deals with the fact that their son killed ten people.  As I was reading the book, and I realized what Peter (the shooter) went through as the victim of constant bullying, I did understand what lead to his action, even though it cannot be condoned.  As a mother who also lost a son, I truly felt for Lacy, Peter's mother.  I could identify with her, her pain, and her constant hope for her son.<br /><br />This book really makes you think about your children and it makes you vow to yourself to get to know them better and take the extra time with them.<br /><br />Even though the story goes from person to person several times in each chapter, and from past to present, it actually works and it is still easy to follow.  This is the third book I have read by Jodi Picoult and I am always impressed at what an amazing author she is and how deeply she delves into her characters and into the subject of her books.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as one that will definitely keep your interest as it confronts a sensitive topic that, unfortunately, is all too real.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I watched all ten episodes of this while traveling on a recent trip. Couldn't get enough! I'm just bummed to find out that season two doesn't release until April 2014.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Saw the movie before I read the first book, book, like in a majority of cases, is better. Plot in catching fire and mocking jay take chapters upon chapters to develop and story ends abruptly. Easy to follow story line, easy and entertaining read.
0770437400|5.0|This book is readable even by people who don't like zombie books. The format is supposed interviews of several dozen people chronicling the zombie wars. Each of the folks interviewed are believable in their role in the world, and the voice in which the author portrays them. One thing that is very difficult is to portray different fictional people as different people. Many authors simply put a different skin on themselves. Here every character has his/her own voice. Every character is believable both in the situations they are in, their resolution (or not) and their reactions.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the zombie genre, but can recognize good writing when I see it. One piece of good advice to aspiring writers is to read good writing. If you want an example of good writing you can do no better than this book.
0385523394|4.0|I ordered this book after watching the Netflix original series, which is a hilarious show, I can't wait for another season. While this book has some funny moments, it really is a sobering account of what happens to women who are lost in the American justice system, and America's &#34;War on Drugs&#34;. While I won't make this a soapbox to stand on, but there is a reason that America has the most crowded prisons on the planet. This book really just gets to the core about life decisions and how they affect not only you but your family and people who care about you. It probably won't be what you expect if you have seen the Netflix series first, but is still a very good read.
0307476464|2.0|On my scale, one star means I couldn't even finish it, two means I finished it but had to decide every time I picked it up whether or not to continue. Three is passable, say, for a new writer gaining experience.<br /><br />At its core, this book was a very imaginative tale. A girl somehow jumps to an alternate world, almost, but not quite the same as the one she (and you and I) was born in, figures it out, and (spoiler alert) finds her lost love and comes back to her own world time-line. On the way she runs into little people (not human little people but more like pixies that may or may not be malevolent), a religious cult out to get her, dodges a very resourceful and tenacious private eye, and finds out she's the second woman in history to get pregnant through immaculate conception. If someone, say Cole's notes, were to shorten this book to about a third of its length it would be a very interesting read. (Ironically, one of the main characters, Tengo, edits an unreadable manuscript, and keeping the author's voice makes it a best seller. This book very badly needed a Tengo to edit it.)<br /><br />Specific complaints:<br /><br />1. deus ex machnia all over the place. This book is in the general genre of an every-man put into a dangerous and potentially deadly situation, and using only his average ingenuity overcomes the bad guy and saves his life, all without the help of the author. In this book the author manipulates events by bringing in experts to save the character at moments crucial to the plot.<br /><br />2. Unbelievable uber-assassin-body-guard-good-guy. Think: James Bond. Ian Flemming didn't say \\"James Bond is a super-spy\\", he put Bond in tough situations, and by the way Bond gets out of them we conclude for ourselves that Bond is a super-spy. In this book, the author simply had this uber-assassin-body-guard-good-guy say \\"I'm an uber-assassin-body-guard-good-guy.\\" Lame.<br /><br />3. The dumbest uber-assassin-body-guard-good-guy I've every seen in a serious book. This guy is supposed to be super smart, and yet he lets a total amateur put herself in a dangerous situation, a situation that could have deadly consequences for the girl, for himself and his employer, and just says \\"OK.\\" Totally unbelievable for the character.<br /><br />4. Wasting my time on trivial explanations. Good writing either makes unusual situations usual, or makes usual situations unusual. Here the author spends pages and pages making usual situations mind-numbingly boring--and then repeats himself. Example: detailed descriptions going on for several pages of one of the characters making dinner. At first I thought there must be a key to understanding the character and read it carefully. Then the author did it again--and again--and again. Sometimes not about cooking, but all pointless time-wasters. By the end of the book I was just skipping them and as it turned out, they didn't contain any clues.<br /><br />5. All the characters were the same, just with different skins. A good writer has a voice for different characters, and each character will act and think differently in safe and dangerous situations. In this book all the characters, from hero to villain, and regardless of the situations, were incarnations of Aunt Bee sitting in her armchair knitting.<br /><br />If you're a real fan of the author, go ahead, but if not, buy something else.

B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Besides the &#34;Beach Boys&#34; The Eagles have to be right up there as being The Best American Band Vocals and songwriting!  This Blu Ray has it all from the begining to the break up, then the reunion then the break off Don Felder era...which I just dont understand!  I think Don Felder was a great asset to The Eagles and Glenn was foolish not to work somthing out with him.  Anyway, Randy Meisner footage and Bernie Leadon another AMAZING Guitar player this DVD has great old footage and interviews that are ver clear!  Now Joe Walsh, he is a true asset as well and such a great guitar player and singer too!  He tells great stories as well!  Glenn Frey seems to be the hardest to get along with but &#34;he is actually I think my favorite EAGLE because of his attitude and outspokenness.  Don Henley is definetely a great singer and very underated drummer!  Don has an AMAZING Voice!  Get this, you will not be disappointed!

0375842209|5.0|I went back and forth between a four and five star rating for this book. Star ratings are just so inadequate. You cannot convey the value of a book through a 1 to 5 rating.<br /><br />This book had quite a few flaws for me. It tried very hard in places to be something it wasn't. Efforts were made for presenting flowery prose that didn't quite get there. But the ideas of this book... they are rumbling. Not just new or original, but profound. This is a book to challenge preconceived ideas from youth. I am so jealous of Zusak's storytelling capability. While the language might not be there for me, andhis structure a little confusing at times—he knows how to spin a tale and conjure character. Five stars are given for making me think.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thought it was well written and I became invested in the characters early on which is fun. I liked how the author wove together the lives of the three main characters. I would recommend it!
B005SAP45I|1.0|Cars 1 was was fun and lighthearted; it was free of an agenda.  Cars 2 was all about evil oil companies and bad guy cars who fight the use of Allinol, an alternative fuel source.  The ringleader of the bad guy cars disguises himself as a respected all-electric car when he's really an evil oil burning car, and leader of the &#34;lemons&#34;, a group of old oil and gas burning cars.  It's environmental and political indoctrination of our kids disguised as a family fun movie.  It's innocent enough that those who complain may be considered conspiracy theorists, but it certainly has the ability to plant a seed in kids' minds that oil burning cars are bad and we need alternatives.<br />In my opinion, the writers and producers could have come up with another light and breezy fun movie without an agenda, but they used the popularity of Cars 1 to send a message to unsuspecting kids and their parents to forward the environmental/global warming agenda.  Be forewarned that there is more to this movie than just a fun movie for your children.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This is a really good read and a great book for young people.  It's hard to find something about the book that I didn't like.  It has won several awards and rightly so!  It's an easy read for middle school-aged students.  It is very approachable, and not heavy-handed or preachy with the subject matter.<br /><br />The main character is August, a boy who has always been home-schooled but who enters school in the fifth grade.  While that would be enough of a meaty plot, August has severe facial deformities due to a genetic condition.  Some description of this is given but, August, like the rest of us, seems to be his own worst critic.<br /><br />The book is told from alternating points of view and this makes the story so much richer.  (Dear teachers, this would be a great point-of-view lesson having certain groups read only one character.)  I though Auggie's sister's (Vi's) chapters were the most powerful, but I really loved how all the different character's point of views painted a whole picture of August and his situation.  I love that Palacio didn't pity her character or cut him any breaks.  The brutality of the story made it seem more fair.<br /><br />It is a book for either a boy or girl of any age.  It has a universal appeal even though it's a situation not many can connect with, at least not initially The story shows the very best of childhood innocence and forgiveness.  This story is also about the important topics of bullying and being a true friend, but also about acceptance, kindness and humanity.  It's about looking beyond our own concept of outward beauty to see the true beauty within.

That being said, it all works out a bit too prettily or maudlin, whichever way  you'd prefer to se it.the ending is a bit too pat and the sophistication in the plot is minimized.

1400052181|4.0|The story of the famous HeLa cell line, grown from Henrietta Lacks's cancer cells, is fascinating and rather surreal. How odd and bizarre that the same aggressive, dangerous cancer cells that killed Lacks at just 31 later went on to play such an important and vital role in medical research. The author explains in quite a bit of detail the medical significance of the HeLa line. I found this part of the book intriguing, but not emotionally stirring.<br /><br />But the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family? That was a more interesting tale, to me, than HeLa itself, and a highly disturbing one. As other reviewers have pointed out, the story of Henrietta and her family is in large part the story of poverty, racism, and the sad lack of opportunity that so many face in this supposed land of opportunity. To read of Henrietta herself: essentially orphaned at four years old, brought up in former slave quarters in the most primitive conditions, sexually exploited by her first cousin at 13, having her first child at 14, marrying that first cousin, enduring poverty and lack of consistent medical care, dying at 31 and leaving her own children to be essentially orphaned in turn? It's frankly a devastating story, however high-spirited and vivacious Henrietta evidently was in life.<br /><br />And then to read of her surviving children, whose present-day lives are also marred by poverty, ill health, lack of education, inadequate health care, and in some cases crime, is sad. When the author introduces us to the Lacks family, it is hard reading at first. Henrietta's children seem beset with hostility, superstition, suspicion of the larger society and the healthcare system in particular, anger, greed, and, most of all, a shocking level of ignorance. They hold any number of bizarre beliefs about HeLa--e.g., that Henrietta herself is somehow alive still, that her clones are walking the streets of London, that research done on the cells posthumously somehow physically hurt Henrietta herself.<br /><br />But as you go further, you realize the Lackses aren't stupid; they're just terribly misinformed and undereducated. Many of them don't even know what a cell is, much less DNA. When the author and a sympathetic researcher take the time to bring two of Henrietta's children to a laboratory  and actually show them HeLa cells under a microscope and in lab refrigerators and in clinical photographs and explain about the cells, the Lackses really begin to understand HeLa for the first time. Why didn't anyone take the time to really explain to them before?<br /><br />And toward the end of the book, you realize the Lackses' general suspicions of society and the healthcare system are not, in fact, founded on nothing. First, there is the issue of Henrietta's cancer cells being taken without full informed consent. This, while not right by today's standards, at least didn't physically harm anyone. But the healthcare system and society failed the Lacks family terribly in 1955, when Henrietta's oldest daughter Elsie died around age 16 at the Hospital for the Negro Insane in Crownsville, MD. It is likely that Elsie died from poor treatment, horrible unsanitary conditions, and, worst of all, painful experiments that were very likely performed on her and other patients at the hospital. So the Lackses' oldest daughter probably died directly from the negligence of the medical system.<br /><br />Elsie's story was the most profoundly moving part of this book. The tragedy of her short life and death disturbed me deeply. Elsie was committed to the hospital around age 11 with an unclear diagnosis. No one knows exactly what was wrong with her. Her death certificate says she had cerebral palsy. The family only recalls that she could not speak, was never toilet trained, and had seizures. But she could walk and run, and she knew who her mother was (and possibly others too). To think of this beautiful and helpless child being separated from her mother, probably her only source of comfort/safety, and being placed in an institution where she was hideously mistreated, shakes your faith in humanity and your assumptions that the Lacks family faced anything like the safety and opportunities that most of us expect in this country.<br /><br />This book raises important questions. It's very much worth reading. I give it four stars, instead of five, mainly because I found the author's presence in the book a little offputting. I don't know if there's any other way she could have told the story, but still I wish she could have minimized her own role in the events.

I'll deal with it in standard definition on the old edition of the dvd ANYDAY before I support the butchered one.  Same thing with Star Wars, I'm sticking to my worn VHS tapes until they GET IT RIGHT and give the people WHAT THEY WANT.  They need to put out a 2nd blu-ray of the ORIGINAL Warriors film and a special feature for that should be an apology to the fans for the 1st blu-ray release.

030789701X|5.0|Skyrim introduced me to the Xbox. Can you believe that? I am a 57-year-old man in a professional job that takes a LOT of time and results in a lot of stress to dissipate. For Christmas 2011, my wife and son gave me an Xbox. It was my first console since a Colecovision in the mid-80s. I received Skyrim with the console and used my Christmas 2011 vacation to set up the box and began playing...for 14 months!! Truly, I didn't unwrap the other games (Arkham Asylum, Gears of War, Call of Duty) for more than a year. Since then, I've played the DLC Bethseda added and decided to come back to Skyrim for one good, long run before the new hardware is delivered in November and Elder Scrolls Online is released. This guide is fantastic. It is the gold standard. Publishers and their editors should use it as a reference when developing all other guides. It is as complete as one could want, easy to traverse, AND--best of all--it has an INDEX. Two, in fact. A general index and a quest index. Skyrim is the biggest and best open-world game available at the moment. It deserves a guide of matching quality and this is it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I had wanted to see it & I watched it over the weekend<br />Just keep in mind that you need to plan to have 2 1/2 Hours<br />of free time to watch it.Thought it was great.
B007SVPZMW|4.0|Here we go. As simple as the game itself. Nice time passer alone or with a friend. Look forward to more themes and music. Good job.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|It's a very fun game. The guys talking makes u really feel like ur playing golf instead of Solitaire it's hilarious. However a but difficult but entertaining.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|First off the sound and song selection is incredible. I put the dvd in the player and it was like going into a time machine back to 1972 hanging and partying with all the Deadheads. This is not a grainy film but rather seems like home video footage that is clear as day. Lots of thoughts run thru your mind watching this, all these freaks are now 70 something years old and they're probably not running around naked and tripping on LSD anymore. Get it today!!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The Intrigue never stops- no character is safe. Awesome series- as good as &#34;The Wheel of Time&#34; series. Gonna start book four now!!!
B00EUS9IBU|5.0|I'm allowing my excitement to push my star-rating up to five stars. (I'm going more with the &#34;I love it&#34; aspect than the &#34;classic&#34; designation.) After McCartney's last album, Kisses on the Bottom, I remarked in a review that it was basically to be seen as a diversion, a pleasant set of songs that he wanted to record but not a major statement. I hoped he would return the next time out with a rock/pop album that would pick up where Memory Almost Full left off. — Boy did he ever!<br /><br />From the opening notes of &#34;Save Us,&#34; McCartney once again shows the world that whether he's 21, 31, or 71, he can still rock out with the best of them. His energy level, songwriting skills, and musicianship remain incredible after all these years. &#34;Alligator&#34; has the kind of crazy Wings-style lyrics I've grown to appreciate over the yeas, but there's more depth in them now. The weight of history informs his lyrics in a powerful way. &#34;New&#34; (the song) sounds like the kind of music the Beatles may have made had they continued their legendary run.<br /><br />McCartney knows how to make modern music while reflecting back on his near-mythic past. If he goes back to the well a bit frequently, I can certainly forgive that. I can only imagine what it must be like to have lived a life such as his. I'm sure it would take more than one lifetime to fully come to terms with what he's seen and accomplished.<br /><br />Like Memory Almost Full, this is a great, modern McCartney album. He has plenty of producers on hand to give it a 2013 feel, but it's McCartney all the way. Great songs with strong melodies and lyrics; there isn't a bad song in the bunch. This is the last phase of McCartney's career, but he still sounds fresh and alive and, amazingly (as the title suggests) new. This is an album to cherish.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The Good Wife Alicia demonstrates how patient stoicism can be entertaining and ultimate successful, and a far better alternative than violent speech or actions.  It's a great law and order piece whose characters use their wits in socially affirming ways.
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|The Woman in Black stars Daniel Radcliffe (handling his own pretty well in his first post-Harry Potter role) as Arthur Kipps, a struggling lawyer in the United Kingdom's Edwardian era who lost his beloved wife during childbirth and has never quite gotten over it. Arthur is on the verge of being fired by his law firm but is given one last chance to keep his job. The assignment should be simple enough - just travel to far-away and remote Eel Marsh and handle the estate of its recently deceased owner. However, as you might expect, not long after Arthur arrives at the home, he starts hearing things, inanimate objects inexplicably start coming to life inside the house, and he sees a creepy woman in black roaming around the grounds. Oh, and did I mention that the children in the nearby town also start dying all around him at an alarming rate and it may be at the hands of the ghostly woman in black?<br /><br />It is very rare for modern mainstream horror movies to depict children dying or being murdered, and I applaud The Woman in Black for being so bold as to kill off young kids in some interesting and horrific ways. I cherish the 1980 classic The Children so much because it is one of the only horror movies I know of that goes balls to the wall and kills several little children in some of the goriest and most humorous ways imaginable. Don't worry, though, unlike the children in The Woman in Black, the kids in The Children were monstrous zombies and they had it coming. But I digress.<br /><br />Hardcore horror movie fans such as myself will not find The Woman in Black scary at all, but young teenagers and fans of Daniel Radcliff's Harry Potter may be sufficiently creeped out and find themselves jumping at a few points during this movie when the obligatory and garden variety non-threatening things such as birds, dogs, or townsmen jump out at our main character and make noise at the most inopportune moments. The theater my husband and I saw this movie in was packed to the gills with young kids and teenagers and I had to endure countless screams and awkward laughs during the \\"scary\\" parts of this movie.<br /><br />Hardcore horror movie fans will find a few things to enjoy in this movie, though. The film looks amazing and is beautifully shot, and the opening scene, involving a group of young girls who suddenly jump out of their attic window and plummet to their death, is haunting. The marsh, the woman in black, and the ghosts of her deceased victims also provide for a nice and eerie ambiance. It seems like more than a few movies released over the last year have employed a haunted house theme and the use of ghostly old women with evil intentions. Insidious did it flawlessly, while The Inn Keepers failed miserably. The Woman in Black, however, does a decent job in presenting a scary and ominous woman in black.<br /><br />You'll also love the wealthy landowner named Sam Daily (played by Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) and his eccentric and possessed wife (played by Janet McTeer) who befriend Arthur and inform him of the history of the town and the woman in black. There is one particular scene where Arthur has dinner with Mr. and Ms. Daily and learns of their son's tragic death that is both terrifying and hilarious at the same time, and I would have liked to have seen a lot more of this couple. I also would have liked it if the movie went on about 10 minutes longer than it did so we could have seen what became of the couple and their son who was taken from them too soon. I genuinely liked these people and would have liked for them to have found some closure or been reunited with the ghost of their long lost son. The movie would have been better if it had a little bit less of a confused Arthur walking up and down long hallways with a candle and a little bit more of the Daily family.<br /><br />This movie definitely isn't even close to perfect, and there are a few holes in the plot (e.g., Arthur's sidekick dog initially barks loudly at a few unseen ghosts in the house, but then completely disappears when the shit really starts to hit the fan, only to miraculously reappear in Arthur's car when it is time to flee the scene). However, overall The Woman in Black is a beautifully shot and well-acted little haunted house movie.he house, but then completely disappears when the shit really starts to hit the fan, only to miraculously reappear in Arthur's car when it is time to flee the scene).

B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is addicting.  Keep picking it up to play.  Some levels are a challenge to get through.  Really fun game.
B003XRELGQ|3.0|I...just don't even know what to say. It's insane. It's nuts. And I think, if you're the type that liked Findley's &#34;Not Wanted on the Voyage&#34;, you'll like this.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great DVD as the classic series continues. I can hardly wait until the next one comes out. Gene Roddenberry's idea grows and grows.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This twilight fanfic is awesome.... There are so many things like twilight as you read the book over and over.
B00CISAPJS|5.0|This is a very good version of Jack and the bean stalk.. full of action, special effects and a happy ending. I am very happy with my purchase.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|A must see for Mercury/Queen fans. Their appearance at Live Aid Is awesome. I read Queen went on just before the Rolling Stones ans totally stole their thunder. Mercury, as always, has this massive stadium in the palm of his hands. Such a brilliant talent and performer. He had a lot of fun. So did the crowd.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|As I like super heroes, fight movies, I really liked this movie that has a lot of action and special effects. I love &#34;The Rock&#34; anyway..
B0007PALZ2|5.0|But, what puts this movie over the top is the incredibly, brilliant performance by Bruce Willis.  He makes the movie. So very impressive.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I've read several other Jack Reacher novels, so was eager to read the first. It's got lots of the good elements of the later novels, but unfortunately has too many plot issues to be satisfying. The details of the story just didn't hold up for me, and at one point there were two major glitches in the plot that were so jarring I almost put the book down. There were enough plot problems--details that simply were not credible--to represent a major distraction for me. I like other elements a lot, and Child has certainly cleaned up his act in later books, so it was still interesting to read this first effort. The introduction by the author is very interesting as well for fans of his other books, so probably worth the discounted price (for the e-book) for that alone.
B000IHY9UW|5.0|A very early work in his career. He does all of the singing. Yes, his own voice. Not only his voice is spot on but he transformed himself into Jim Morrison. Must be seen to be believed. Meg Ryan was very good, also. The special features are as good as the Kilmer performance. I loved this movie. The music is, of course,  great, but the acting is magnificent. The special features are truly Special--Especially if you are a Doors/Morrison fan. A must see for Doors fans.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is wonderful. Sometime I can't wait for the week to end to get to the next tournment. I do wish that you did not have to go though facebook. I have noticed this week that there has been some pausing in my game not sure what that is from, other than that it is great!
B00BRUPICM|5.0|I loved everything about this book.  Only short actor I know is Danny DeVito, so I imagined a younger version of him as Alex.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Angry birds in space is a little more difficult than the other a.b. that I've played but I really enjoyed it.
B00CJ1PXNW|5.0|If I could make an analogy to describe this album I'd say it's like Ian Astbury from The Cult jamming with Carlos Santana, contemplating Black Sabbath.  This is the kind of pure, hard-driving rock you just wanna crank up on your car stereo and take a road-trip.  :o)
B007N85POS|5.0|I am so addicted to Angry Birds I can't get enough. The differnet levels provide hours of enjoyment and fun.
1250030951|5.0|Have you ever been obsessed with a book or TV series? Rainbow Rowell understands. Thus she gives us Cath, an eighteen-year-old girl who is deeply involved in the Simon Snow fandom. The fictional Simon Snow series is an amusing homage to Harry Potter. Potter fans will recognize the jokes, but Rowell is smart enough not to recreate it character-for-character. Cath struggles with her first year of college and a twin sister who suddenly wants independence. Rowell isn't afraid to show her characters in all their nerdy and awkward moments. Her honesty will resonate with readers.<br /><br />I especially recommend this book if you were once (or continue to be) involved in an online fan community. Cath will become your spirit animal.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Fun for all ages!! Will be buying several copies for Christmas gifts this year as well as one for myself! Super cute, very funny! Could watch over and over again
1250012570|5.0|Rainbow Rowell has already joined the ranks of my favorite young adult writers working today, alongside heavyweights like John Green and Sarah Dessen. This book is about retro cool misfits Eleanor and Park, who struggle with first love and family life in 1986 Omaha. Rowell is an author with the ability to make the reader care deeply about her characters. I defy you not to fall in love with Eleanor and Park.
B00C1BV9Z6|1.0|Given that I rented it for my 6-year-old, was a bad choice. too violent and had to turn it off after about 20 minutes once it got to the rain scene inside the Park. I remembered it from my childhood, but forgot the details :( I'd say better for older children/pre-teens.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My son, along with many of his other 2 - 4 year old friends, love Sofia...the movie is adorable and my son sings along to all the songs. DVD came on time and in perfect condition
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show brings back all the memories of childhood fairytales.  You dont realize that you forgot about that character or story until you see it pop up here.
0670033375|3.0|great information but not good to read for entertainment. Its a reference book more than a novel. Still, I loved reading about some intricate ties I had never though to bring together when considering the current state of American policies.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|Hemingway has written it all. So much care and detail in the narrative that never once interferes with the oft told badly story of the never ending line of humans drawn to war.
1250038820|5.0|The book is beautiful.  Stanton has a natural talent in photography and it shines through on every page.  It's great to read, flip through, or even display as a coffee table book.
B000IVW25M|5.0|Our  four year old grand daughter really enjoyed this CD, and so did we.  We have played it quite a few times already.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very good price<br />Can't wait until more things work with it<br />Love putting stuff on the tv<br />Waiting for iTunes hope that works soon
B0013ND30M|5.0|Our four year old grand daughter loves this cd.  I can't tell you how many times we have viewed it already.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|My granddaughter will love this for her upcoming birthday, it will be such a wonderful suprise for her 5th birthday.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I haven't had a book surprise me in a long time like this one. Very entertaining&heart warming.<br />Definately would read it over&over again
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Thank you Very nice ItemS!!
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|This is my new favorite Studio Ghibli film. I have most of the films and I love them all but this one was amazing. The plot was great and it was a very touching film. If you liked Whisper of the Heart then you will love his movie.
B00C2FFJFM|4.0|She's going to be a really talented star if she keeps the right people working with her. Has a couple ok songs on it but over all she has a beautiful pleasant voice...
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works well. Great for travelling or whenever a portable alarm clock is needed. Application coordinates well with the Weather Live applicatlion.
B006XBSAP2|4.0|good CD.. She has talent. Will say after hearing Prism of a friends, this one is way better.  If I'd have any say I'd just wait for a Greatest hits CD of hers and save myself from all the other Yuk songs that she has on each CD though.......
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is fun because you can free roam and you get to be any shark anytime as long as you unlock it. Overall it's a good game
B00DQVST76|5.0|I am not giving it 5 stars just because it is Madonna. I am giving it 5 stars because it deserve it! It is a lot of work and talent that only Madonna, and her team, can put together for us: fans and not so fans.<br />I agree that it may seem to be over edited, but as a whole, it is the package you really want. The sound is good, although, I agree it seems odd to begin with, but it is very good.<br />I understand the problem with the blue ray, but the DVD is good.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this,because I thought I could stream pictures and videos from my phone to the tv using this device; WRONG!! If you need apps and you have an older tv, then this device might be for you. However, I have a smart tv with preloaded apps so I didn't need this particular feature. Once I found out that I couldn't stream video and picture content, I returned it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Full of jokes and action  and great guns and flying ships.I think it was a great idea to put all the superheros in one movie.
0719079276|4.0|I got this book for my graduate school Literary Theory class. Each theory gets it's own chapter, and I find Barry's writing to be very down-to-earth and easy to comprehend (especially compared to Eagleton).<br /><br />If you need this for a textbook, don't fret - this is a really good book!  If you need a guide through literary theory or a resource for writing an essay or analyzing literature, I highly recommend Beginning Theory. It's just a good guide to have on hand if you are in the field of literature, literary theory, or English.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Loved this book.  Little slow at times, but overall it was captivating. Stop making me type so much please amazon.
