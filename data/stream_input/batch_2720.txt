B004J4WLB4|5.0|Diffenbaugh brought to this beautiful story the art of relating messages and emotions through flowers.  Thanks to the author for her careful research, I'm guessing readers will more carefully choose the flowers they next send to a friend or loved one!  Enjoy this book!
B002ZG9774|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies, i never get tired of watching this movie. i  would definitely recommend to my friends and family.

B00006IM9Q|5.0|Off the bat, this is less a review of this Greatest Hits compilation as it is my review of one of the least appreciated bands of the late 70's and early 80's, and in my opinion, one of the most maligned bands coming out of the NYC punk scene.  But the only way I can relate my opinions on this is to present to you a &#34;personal&#34; reason why I think this under appreciation and at times hostility has come to be identified with this band.<br /><br />As a young boy growing up in LA, and at an age where male libido was beginning to rear its ugly head, I saw Blondie's Heart of Glass video.  Nothing really made sense to me at the time about the context....the 70's disco stage set mixed with New Wave, DEVO type haircuts, and the pulsing disco meets pop synthesizers that formed the backbone of the song.  The only thing that made utter sense, a clear vision, was the image of Debbie Harry, in all her blond backlit glory.  She was a stunning vision.  Cheekbones that never stopped, prancing in her one strapped potato sack mini dress, and glossy lips meant more for licking than kissing.  There has yet to be any female front man that has been able to take the mantel away from DH in the hot, beautiful, dangerous, mysterious, comical, ingenue, Barbie-on-speed, effortlessly cool, and extremely and genuinely talented singer songwriter category.  No one, not Madonna, not Beyonce, not Lady Gaga....no one.  They may skirt along the periphery, but Debbie is spot on.<br /><br />And that's the problem.<br /><br />It's Debbie's own eretheral presence that has placed the bulls-eye of criticism on this band's back.  It's not her fault.  It's not the band's fault.  I won't even blame the record labels that sold and marketed DH's face, body and image as the chief selling tool for the band's early success.  What, are you stupid?  Look at her fool!  You'd be crazy not to use the tools at your disposal.<br /><br />But does that translate to talentless which was the moniker often thrown at themstarting from the CBGB days until implosion in the 80's?  No.  Hogwash.  Not in the least.  Quite the opposite.  Blondie was, is and remains the most diversely talented, relentlessly innovative, and commercially successful band coming out of the fetid interiors of CBGB.  Don't believe me?  Wanna bet?<br /><br />Listen to the songs on this Greatest Hits album on total random playback.  On one track you will hear the innocent '50's Doo-Wap stylings of Deni...with the marching drumbeat of punk sensibilities.  On another you jump to urban funk with mystical overtones and a game-changing rap (more on that later) in Rapture.  Yet on another you can almost feel the sunshine on the reggae infused Tide is High.  Skip a few songs later and you are returned to 70's going on '80's Armani with Call Me.  Revisit the '60's innocence with Sunday Girl.  Go on a paranoid run (punk meets cocaine) in Atomic.  One of my favorites in Dreamin.....a hard driving drumbeat as punk as you can get lifted by a voice filled with both longing and ceaseless commitment.  Pop at it's finest.  The anthemic quality of Union City Blue makes you feel like your flying above the urban decay of Eastern Jersey....like the singer trying to escape a life too real to bear.<br /><br />Find any punk band that could cover those musical stylings so effortlessly, so successfully.  I can only think of the Talking Heads as being in that same category or better, but they had a harder intellectual bent.  Their feets were planted more squarely uptown than the bohemian lower east.<br /><br />But there comes that word again....the &#34;integrity&#34; word....that seems to get all CBGB punk snobs' knickers in a bunch whenever they see DH dancing in that potato sack dress.<br /><br />My advice.  Get over it.  Just because you could pound out 7 songs in a speed induced 10 minutes doesn't mean you're more talented.  It doesn't mean you have more integrity.  It just means you are on more speed.  I could never understand the animosity.  I could never understand the jealousy...oh actually I can understand that.  Being able to get yourself out of the squalor, which was what the lower East Side was, based on your talent, songwriting, singing, and yes, looks doesn't make you a sell out.  It makes you a band that tried hard, very hard, to improve at each gig, that cared about its product, and wasn't afraid to incorporate what they heard around them to create or infuse new sounds.<br /><br />I'm not leveling this at only the punk rock scene hierarchy.  The hip hop scene also bears some responsibility.  I'm not going to say here that Rapture was the first rap or hip hop song.  It wasn't.  What it was, undeniably, was the 1st time something called rap was incorporated into a mass commercial hit song by a band that was undeniably on the top of the world stage and undeniably white.  In other words, it introduced rap as a real musical genre that the masses could &#34;get&#34; and enjoy and opened the doors to greater recognition for and by now hip hop establishment players as Fab 5 Freddy and Grandmaster Flash.  Of course this doesn't matter.  This rap wasn't a rap...it wasn't good rap....it doesn't make sense....the list grows.  Why the hate?  Why the disrespect?  I don't get it.<br /><br />Why doesn't the Pretenders get this kind of animosity for turning pop?  Why doesn't Crissy Hines get flack for singing I Got You Babe with UB40?  Did Macolm McLaren sell out for trying out a Buffalo Gal or two?  Is Vivian Westfield personna non grata?<br /><br />CBGB and the early punk scene was great because it allowed the outliers in society, the people who liked the MC5 and Iggy Pop rather than the Turtles, an avenue to play in front of live people, even if you stank and couldn't play a lick, and hone your skills.  Trial by fire, learning on the job.  You got instant feedback.  You could express ideas and move them forward.  It wasn't meant to be an ossified cavern where ideas came to die within its feces stinking walls.<br /><br />The children of this scene moved on and did just that, at least the ones that wanted to get better, and worked hard for their success.  Don't hate them because they are beautiful.  And Blondie was beautiful indeed, one of the best bands of that scene.<br /><br />The album is great.  It has all the essentials.  Better chronological layout would be better, but that is a small quibble.  I don't get the reviews about altering the sound balances.  It happens when songs are remastered, but greatest hit compilations are not for the rabid fans.  Those already have all the separate albums.  This is for the new or the very old looking to revisit the long and beautiful past.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Based on my previous purchases, this book continued to pop up as something I should read via a number of emails from Amazon. I put it off for a few months until I ran out of my favorites and decided to give it a try. I normally don't read female authors and I need to reevaluate why that is. This book is &#34;amazing&#34; ! It starts off very descriptive and dreamy and easy to read but you get a sense that things could turn strange at any moment. Well, it sure does. This book continues to pick up steam with each page and ended up requiring me to set aside most of a Sunday to finish it as I could not put it down. This book is quite frightening to read and really makes you think. The ending was a bit unexpected and I am not sure how I feel about it but, I thoroughly enjoyed it and will probably now add Gillian Flynn to my list of authors to read.
0451147960|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book which was quite complicated with its many characters and various plot threads. You have to pay attention and a certain amount of concentration helped. Perhaps that is why the book did not appeal to a number of readers. In addition, it was a rather biting commentary on the art world of London of the 1980's which was great fun.
B00AKGG6XY|5.0|One of my favorite movies growing up. A lot of movies have tried to mimic this, like Hunger Games, Gamer and what not.
B003KJF2WE|5.0|Not a bad version based off of the comic book. Great special effects and a fun watch. It could have been done in so many different ways with so many different actors and actresses, but that can be said with any and all movies.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An unbelievable story about the human spirit. The meeting between the two pilots lasted only a few minutes, but it changed the rest of their lives.
B002APU580|5.0|Over time, I have purchased 3 copies of the DVD.  In our family it is the ultimate movie and love story.  Jane Austen's sense of love, family and the times is perfectly reproduced by Keira and Matthew.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Don't expect too much, except for preggo/baby humor. This movie won't change your life in the grand scheme of things. It will, however, remind you that parenting is a crazy, wild ride, and that you're not the only one on this path!
B000MF4O82|5.0|great movie! lots of mindless destruction! not hard to follow the story line. just an easy watch or entertainment. some over acting, but it was made in 1997!
0553062182|5.0|Still working through this one. It's well put together with exercises that are probing and thought provoking. It's comforting to know there are others like you and helps put things in perspective.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have found the combination of sounds that are best for me.  I listen to it when I am reading and every night when I'm going to sleep.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|still cant believe they wont just take new pictures of the boys it looks like season 4 sam..! do they think the fans are stupid?
B002KGEORM|5.0|They have great cliffhangers.  It is so addicting!!  It is becoming a bit of an obsession for my husband and I to watch every episode.  Love it!
B005ZUR724|5.0|It is a great game kind of reminds me of world of warcraft. fun questing with a hero of your choice.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Good series def worth watching. I couldn't stop once I finally decided to watch. Good story line lots of excitement amazing acting
B006AZZPCM|3.0|The app works but so many ad's pop up and lately videos freeze. I wish they just had regular YOU TUBE
B00821PCJS|5.0|Loved this new scifi show.  Can't wait to see more!  Great to have both seasons 1 and 2 on amazon prime!
B001KL0WJW|4.0|Very gripping movie of gangs in NY. It's a bit dated now, but still very entertaining. Definitely worth the time.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Very fun game but they need to make it easier to get more blue chips! I hate waiting....or at the very least allow you to earn more blue chips when u actually get a bingo instead of less than what u bought in with!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I always loved the movie Hook, with Robin Williams. So in turn I always loved the original Peter Pan movie. Like all classic Disney movies, the pace is considerably faster than movies today, but I like it this way. The sound and picture quality is superb considering it came out in 1953.
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's writing is beautiful and the story inspiring..This is a book that could well be read more than once.
B00BATWJFE|5.0|A really nice read.  I imagined Sheldon's voice from the Big Bang Theory as the narrator/main character.  Very entertaining.  Highly recommend it.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|To keep it short, Teen Beach Movie is a DCOM that definitely meets expectations for everyone! :) The acting is believable and good, (which is a huge deal for newer DCOM's!) and the music and dancing is so fun to watch and dance along to! People of all ages will enjoy this movie, especially people who are old enough to remember Annette Funicello, who this movie is actually dedicated to! It's a refreshing new concept that comes off brilliantly on the screen. There is no DCOM that has been like it in quality or story to date and I am so excited to see what other sequels they may come up with for it! Watch this movie on Disney Channel or buy it first, you won't be disappointed, whether you're 11, 11 in your heart but a little older on the outside, or just plain old!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very stimulating! Made me think outside of the box. My daughter and I loved helping each other. Can't wait for more levels!
B00DHNB5CY|5.0|I remember watching the original and covering my eyes and jumping because my friend was screaming on top of her lungs. I was excited to see the remake and I still was jumping and covering my eyes! great scary movie. the remake was good
B009KY5OGC|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone interested in the history of the American west. Brown explains, in detail, how American Indians were exploited, subjugated and even massacred.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Micheal keaton's performance is superb, so is winona ryder<br />The ohare family, not to mention the lil demons, n ghosts that male up the film<br />Get this movie cuz ur a big keaton fan, that's what I did, n u should too<br />Beetlejuice!

B00CBKLO52|4.0|very well organized it use to be a program called clearview I have it on my computer I got all the planes free don't half to pay for them
B00003CXS4|4.0|Snatch is one of those films perhaps best described as a delicious romp that boasts a marvelous ensemble of quirky and endearing (sometimes in an ambivalent way) characters. Indeed, the characters are the big plus, for the plot -- while it has its moments -- is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is. In fact, the climax of the picture is, in terms of storytelling, not inventive at all. Still, those character portrayals are marvelous, the dialogue snappy and witty, and the editing first-rate. This is a caper film that certainly keeps moving in (almost) all the right ways. Recommended.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|This movie was okay.  At first I was excited to be able to see it as I had wanted to see it in the theaters, but never got the chance.  I'm glad I didn't at this point.  I didn't mind paying $4.99 to see it on Amazon, but don't think I would have liked to pay over $20.
1449305172|5.0|Stunning book. Sufficiently short so as not to be overwhelming, prescriptive at just the right level to be incredibly helpful. If you are wondering how to put into action everything you've learnt about Lean philosophy, you need this.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|What else can I say. MMy 4 tear old Great grand daughter loves it. It entertains her for a long while<br /><br />\
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome puzzle game. You won't be disappointed. Wearing headphones on my Fire added to the experience with the background music. Looking forward to the sequel.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I wasn't sure I even wanted to see this movie, but after watching it I was glad I did.  This turned out to be a very funny and heartwarming movie.  I would recommend it.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The first part of the book is pretty slow, but then Part 2 things begin to get interesting, as Amy's mind begins to work.  Part 3 you think is going to be it.....but IT never comes.  I was extremely let down with the ending.  What a waste of my finger swiping... I like it dark and twisted as much as the next person, but this turned into a very anticlimactic ending.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game! Very challenging and tricky but fun. Would be great to have hints added. Hope more levels are added soon!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Of corse this book is written in a different voice than the first book. The first book is Ender's voice, the voice of a genius child. This book is a completely different story, and  Ender isa main character, among others. This is a great book, interesting, philosophical, thought provoking.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Love this!  I love Mahjong and this version is great many tile formats but simply Mahjong.  One  of the best I have found.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My son loves this & it kept him occupied & entertained for several hours through a vast number of levels. The graphics are clever & cute. Any Star Wars and/or Angry Birds fan is sure to enjoy.
B0010HA68I|4.0|bought this for a guided hike in Yosemite.  it worked great, just a little trouble getting the camera off when I needed to remove my pack but it got easier as I got used to the buckles.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Some of the humor was telegraphed, knowing what was coming or at least an idea of what was next.  I'm a Streisand fan so it was still entertaining.  No surprises here, a Jewish mother smothering her son with the love she wants...worthy of a look-see...
B00BU18U82|5.0|Best game ever!! I'm so in love with this game. I spend all my time on it!!!! This is the only game I play
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|My kindle devise does not support the game. I should have read the reviews before downloading.  Glad it was free & could be deleted easily.
B0086700CM|5.0|it works for my kindle,my family loves it,I love it,its intertaning to me,temple run is AMAZING!!!!! :) and its free:D
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I really had no expectations, which is the best way to watch any movie.  But I was very entertained....and even cried a little.  I might be too old...but I think I am a Katy Perry fan!  I even went back and watched parts of it again!
1594204217|5.0|Loved this book! I only wish the author included some of the other recipes he discussed in the book...they all sounded delicious!
B006699DDE|5.0|Awesome story.  If you've never read it, it's a quick read and a true classic.  On to his next one.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I watched this movie with my children and we really enjoyed it. I was very funny and entertaining. A.great movie for the whole family!
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|i wanted the game and not the guide. i can't find the game for my hd fire kindle. don't want
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I cannot stop reading these books. I am addicted to these characters. DB has me hooked. What a great adventure.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman Begins is a great movie and story!  Christian Bale did a superb job playing the role.  Loved the supporting cast and the music was perfect!
141659521X|3.0|I actually bought this book the day I learned Vince Flynn had passed away. The book flows well but is not especially well written and Mitch seems to have added an element of bitterness that is not endearing. I will miss Vince that is for sure, I hope he knew the Savior and is resting happily in Heaven.
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|Everything we expected. Have to watch it 2or 3 times to catch all the nuances. Will be nice to see it again come winter.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Burned through every one of them in days.  I know its meant for a younger read but damn that was a good book
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It is poorly written.  There is not enough subject and too much explicit sex.  It gets rather boring and I skip over many pages.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Once you start, you can't stop.  Addictive should come with a warning.  Good addition to the Temple Run. ****** addictive
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|takes too much time to get to actual game. Never got to it. Might be my Kindle! But removed this App. My 4yr old would never get through all the screens.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|was hooked on one song and ended up loving the whole album.  Totally worth the buy and cant beat the price
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love to watch this show. It takes me to another place and time. Once you watch one you have to see them all.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|Requires to much brain power.  Have to play it when no Grand-kids are around.  Fun to compete against the Grand-kids on though (they just can't be in the room while you are trying to play it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have heard others talk about this series and was reluctant to read it, boy, was I wrong......An attention grabber from the first page!
B00448SE4S|3.0|maybe its michael cera overload or just me but it was fine but nothing amazing for me.  Not saying it was bad, just saying nyahhh.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|Angelina Jolie plays a victim turn badass realy well. I won't say any more but if your into hard action spy movies you'll like this one.
B000FC146C|5.0|Excellent writing and story-line.  I would really recommend this book to adults. It would be too difficult to read for someone under 16.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first book, Hunger Games, was good and I could not wait to start Catching Fire. Amazing storyline that kept me enthralled!
B008B68IEA|3.0|Present for my niece so I have no real opinion on it other than to get this off my review list.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great for every day use. Love it. Easy to use and for those of us with vision problems the large sized keyboard is wonderful.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This is a wonderful book and an easy read.  I would recommend it for anyone 16 years of age and older.
B004QQWA84|5.0|GREAT OCCULT METAL FROM SWEDEN FOR FANS OF GHOST AND MERCYIFUL FATE..A MUST HAVE FOR BLACK METAL FANS OF ALL AGES
1419702238|3.0|Present for my nephew so I have no real opinion on it other than to get this off my review list.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great program! Watching on Amazon was fabulous-no commercials and the ability to watch multiple episodes whenever, is really nice. All caught up and ready for the next season.
B00B78AIV0|5.0|This is the second novel I've read by this amazing Nigerian writer, and it was as glorious as the first.  The theme is familiar -- a young girl comes of age, stubbornly clings to a love of her father although he is an abusive brute, and falls deeply in love with a man who can never be hers.  However, the texture of the novel is purely Nigerian.  Adichie makes the reader see the landscape, hear the dialect, and feel the winds, rain, temperature -- even the potholes in the road.  The coming-of-age saga is only a part of the narrative's extensive sweep, which draws in the effects of political repression, the clash between Western and traditional African religion, the oppression of women, and the horrors of family violence perpetrated by an autocratic father with no attempts by other family members to stop it -- because they would become the next target.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Great Movie<br />Everybody we have shown it to loved it and is moved by it.  Bought two of them so far
0810983915|3.0|Present for my nephew so I have no real opinion on it other than to get this off my review list.
B00DHNJGCU|1.0|It has been a long time since I have actually thought that I just watched a truly horrible movie. I wanted to like this movie, I liked the trailer.... I just found it to be insufficient even as a smash-em-up fight flick.
B005L193RO|5.0|Full of practical advice that we can use immediately. The writer writes with humor. Good value for money.ice with a scientific base.
B0009VSB06|5.0|Works very well, found lots of nuts, bolts and metal in my yard.  Still need to take a trip to the beach!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Burned through every one of them in days.  I know its meant for a younger read but damn that was a good book
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read it in less that 2 days and the detail was great. This book was for a summer reading project.
1490313370|5.0|Riveting...many ideas for living a better life. Many books of this sort are written without practicality in mind. James wrote this with the average person in mind...the average person looking for extraordinary results that is.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|My daughter read the entire twilight series in a few weeks.  She could not put these books down.  They were definitely worth reading.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Burned through every one of them in days.  I know its meant for a younger read but damn that was a good book
B008133MDK|5.0|sums it up - i think that at first when you look at sherlock - he's the bad guy, but dude he's amazing and i love the way they break up how he figures things out!
0345529057|5.0|This is a great deal! They are very well printed and the box they came in is pretty nice. Besides, the books are great! Recommended.
1781162646|4.0|I know this book is being touted as the fifties, hard boiled, pulp fiction, and it falls wayyyyyy short.  I love Stephen King and this is a nice story with a climax and ending you would expect.  It is interesting and is a nice story, but in a softer, more thoughtful way.  Buy it because it's Stephen King, but don't be surprised because there are none.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|The kids seemed to enjoy the movie, but I thought it was very slow.  It has some funny moments, but it's one of those movies you would only care to see once.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|didn't expect it to be funny, but it was and hilariously so. probs watch it again! can't wait for the sequel! :D
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I wish they would not have discontinued this series.  It was really good and intriguing, maybe they could start up again
0062060554|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 18. The book gets a bit graphic at times when the character recalls some of her sexual fantasies. The book itself was great, and built up to a great plot twist. The only bad thing I would say is that it got a bit long, but there are so many crucial details to the story that you can't just skim.
1781162646|5.0|This was the third recent Steven King book I have read and it is the best of all.  Simply a great story about people woven in the print of a crime novel. You will cheer. You will cry. You are going to wish you spent a summer working at Joyland!  Don't deprive yourself of the treat that is this book.
B002SS8S7E|4.0|Some how I never saw this before the Dark Knight....explains a lot , streamed well with no buffering on roku 2.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|The grandkids just recieved it in the mail and love it. The two year old kept asking who'sat? who'sat? My daughter says it's great, Thank you for the fast service.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|After seeing the whole season I would say &#34;4 Days out&#34; amazed me. This is yet another season on a steamroller ride of the greatest series on TV. Enjoy!
B00947N6D8|5.0|I saw it at the movies and thought it was such a great movie I wanted to buy it and got a great price
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Brilliant, insightful, and cleverly written. This book cut to the quick like no other book I've read. Even months after I finished it, I continue to see life through the antifragile lens. Things in this world are not as they seem.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I never usually watch English films, but everyone was talking about Downton Abbey. I decided to try it.  I watched all 3 seasons in less than a week. This is one of the best series I've ever watched. Loved it!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I was looking for a period drama to watch between seasons of Downton Abbey.  I realize this is 4 or 5 years old but I just discovered it and literally watched all 4 seasons in a few days.  Nothing too dramatic happens but the characters are so appealing and the way it portrays life and relationships in the 1880s really made me reflect on my lifestyle today...thoroughly recommend this.
B000V4NX04|5.0|As a recommendation by a friend, I decided to watch this movie. While I had an idea of how this movie would start and where it could go, I did not really know how it would end. But it was very good, and I was surprised by the ending. It showed the hope that, we are all humans and capable of change, despite orders given. But it is such an amazing idea to sacrifice your life/career for the sake of another human being. Without asking for anything else back. Heroes of the past!<br /><br />Also, I cannot keep from making an analogy of the \\"big brother\\" concept to today's world, where before it might have been the state police and political party versus today, when it is all the technology we have and all the information it captures and provides.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter loves this app and so do I. It is great for killing time in the car. A great app.
B00CWVFZ8W|4.0|Good movie, very different from book though. Missing Marian the librarian & it was weird that they combined Amma and Marian into one character. If you can set those things aside it was an entertaining movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I don't have a lot of time to watch tv, so when I want to watch something, I want to be engaged and entertained.  This series does this and so much more.  Be prepared......It is addictive!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game rocks it take a lot of thought but you will figure it out eventually<br /><br />Can you escape really rocks and it's like a puzzle and I love puzzles
B00AREIAI8|4.0|awesome<br /> hey anybody reading this this is a great game u can put your horse in races  feed him train etc. its very cool get it:-)
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I love the series and this is the best. No so many extras than the first but it is perfect.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I keep me reading at the edge of my seat. At times make cry but at the end is good that everything turns good. It is funny how sometimes we imagine things or people we love help us in our lives... Love the book
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it makes me wanna keep playing as if I were in a arcade and I just wanna keep going and going. till I run out of coins and then I get mad n wait for more coins to come so I can do it all over again
0684857219|5.0|Love this damn book.... read it cover to cover twice already, helps me big time in the gym......put on a couple of inches in size doing the phase I workout
B004132I20|5.0|It is great to have this series finally on BluRay. Here in Mexico some lame distributor brought it in DVD in horrible quality and without the extras. The horror. But this one is PERFECT.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I am a romantic. I thought this movie was great! I recommend it for all ages. Very easy to follow
B005HCI72O|5.0|I am really enjoying the Outlander Series. Brianna goes in search of her time-travelling mother, 200 years in the past and across the Atlantic! Roger follows her but true love never runs smooth and he faces great peril in his quest to find her.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|OMG! I have been playing this app for a couple of years now on my different devices and I love it!<br /><br />definitely get this app if u don't already have it!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|It was a good movie, but it could have been much better. There are so many good arcade games that I feel like they didn't use all of their available resources. Occasionally there was a reference to some nostalgia, but I felt like it wasn't done enough. 10 minutes going thru different games that we all love and the other hour and a half stuck in a racing game. Could have been so much more.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I saw it again with my family so we can go see Red 2. I love this movie! Recommend for all ages
B005D4YOJ6|4.0|Sandal is very comfortable. Fits well and looks good. Recommended by a friend to me and I endorse it without reservations.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|The dialogue was good and the story flowed nicely. I liked the story of their friendship and it was very uplifting for the audience to see.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|I found this book difficult to get into.  With this said I couldn't get through the end of the book without bawling..  This was a beautiful story!
B000QFW7UA|5.0|Already knew the movie, loved it since the first time I watched it. 25th Anniversary Edition is incledible and a &#34;must-have&#34; for all Gonnies fans.
B0035JNTA6|5.0|Everyone in this hits a home run - Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson do their thing as usual, Will Ferrell is great, but everyone else keeps up with his scene-chewing for once, and the cameos all seem perfectly natural in this world.
B00B2QA646|5.0|i love the costumes and jude law. The cinematography was very alluring. I also liked cara delevigne's cameo :) beautiful
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Room is a good read from a different perspective.  Narrated from a young boys point of view is very different from the norm.  Very interesting.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best tv shows I have seen in a while. The time setting and location make this a perfect show to express the 1920s.
B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|I like vampire movies so I really liked this, it's a very well done thriller, very modern and well acted and 3d, it gives something extra.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen. I love having it on DVD for future watching. It's a great movie!
B00821OX98|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE:D watched all the episodes from season 1. Now moving on to the next season for more 8D
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I carry two cell phones at work - I use my voyager continually and this makes it so easy to charge my ear piece while driving to work.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I can't get enough of this album. It had been quite a few years in the coming is well worth the wait.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is awesome to be able to free stream Downton Abbey on Amazon Prime!! I am completely hooked and thanks to Prime, I can watch it anytime I want.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I know this has been so popular and I have to admit I haven't read it all (didn't even get to the steamy bits) but it was so hard to read such drivel, I gave up. I'm not sure how old ET James is but she write like a 15 year old schoolgirl. Maybe that's what she wanted, but I don't like it. Sorry.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Until they manage to get another Die Hard closer to feeling like Die Hard, Red could be the next best thing - amazing ensemble cast with Malkovich brilliant as always and Helen Mirren worth watching the whole movie for especially when she has a gun in her hand - just a lot of silly popcorn enduced fun... looking forward to the sequal which has just come out.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicting, fun game for all. Set aside about 3 hours every day if you can.<br />These little yellow fellows are so adorable and unpredictable. The game<br />is quite a challenge, and you'll get many chuckles out of playing. If this<br />was on Facebook, &#34;Like&#34; it for sure!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I thank Mr. Kyle for his service and was shocked at his untimely death. The book was just OK. As Mr. Kyle used the best tools to accomplish his missions, he probably should have used a ghost for his memoir. He had an incredible story to tell and didn't do it justice by trying to write it himself.
B008133MDK|5.0|I enjoyed this season more than the first.  I think having the Adler and Moriarty characters make things more interesting.  It's definitely a series I'll need to watch again, as I probably missed a few things the first time around.<br /><br />Also, I actually like the fact that each episode is a mini movie in it's own.  Really allows the cast/production to flush out details and develop the plot/characters more.<br /><br />I don't this type of series is for anyone though.  If you're into some mystery, deep characters, a little bit of intellectual engagement, and don't need there to be gratuitous romance, then this series is for you.<br /><br />Oh and hello; Benedict Cumberbatch?  Delicious. #keepinitreal (:
B009JVSAVM|5.0|The service was excellent. Received the product earlier than expected. The Big Bang Theory program is awesome. I am being successful in persuading other family members to get &#34;hooked&#34; on it. It is hilarious!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I had already read the book(s) but I really wanted to see the movie and I loved it, it all seemed real, good acting in the movie by all.
1781162646|5.0|100 times better than the Colorado kid!  Fast read with a great plot.  Obviously at the length there isn't as much character development as other great King works, but still fantastic.
0345803507|3.0|It was okay, not well written , too much sex for someone that don't know what their private parts are called.
B0041D843M|5.0|I have meant to read this book many years ago but just never did. Wow what a mistake that was. I have learned so much about food and what it can and cannot do for one's health and wellbeing. I want to thrive in my senior years and I will make some changes in my eating habits in order to do that.I recommend this book to everyone.
B001LM1456|5.0|I like action movies with marvel comics. I like movies that have adventure. This was a good movie. Do you have Man of Steel
B00BETX5PS|5.0|What can I say? Daniel Craig is an amazing actor, and fits the Bond profile perfectly. The movie was packed full of action, it was thrilling, and it even turned emotional at times. In my opinion, this is the perfect Bond movie.
030758836X|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read in a very long time. I'm a writer myself, and have been disappointed by much that I've read lately. This book hooked me from Page One and didn't let up until the very end. I highly recommend it for anyone who loves great fiction mixed with a healthy dose of mystery.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Full of action.  I liked it because it was based on a true story.  If you don't like mobster movies take a pass on this movie.
0062082353|5.0|I haven't had the time to read the book yet but I have heard from others that it is really good.
0785814531|5.0|This thick, full, hardcover book is available at a great price. If you enjoy Edgar Allan Poe's beautiful work then you won't be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is very fun and entertaining to play this game its not hard when u start altho uh i think they should make hints for it
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Pretty spooky movie, alot of blood and guts, great story, and a lot of evil and of course the evil is always in the basement, loved it 5 stars!!
B009ZQJVAK|3.0|We recently saw Kinky Boots on Broadway and wanted to check out the movie when we returned home.  Much of the dialog and story were the same, but the Broadway production gives a substantially better presentation.
B00CMQX84A|4.0|My kids (ages 8 & 10) were excited to watch this due to the Disney hype, and hubby and I were just expecting to tolerate it.  Thankfully, we were wrong!  This is a fun little romp, with nods to \\"classics\\" like Grease, West Side Story, Beach Blanket Bingo and other like movies.  The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and will definitely make you laugh... now if only I could get \\"Can't Stop Singing\\" out of my head!  Yes, you can tell the kids are lip-syncing, but that was to be expected.  The sets, costuming, and choreography were pretty well done for a TV movie.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|I bought this movie because I knew it was good, and also I wanted to see the alternate ending. The alternate ending is odd. Still well worth the investment
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a smart, funny, and addicting tv show about a group of 'space cowboys'. It's all about the characters and their interactions, as well as by the seat of their pants getting off each planet or moon before trouble crashlands them.  As everyone else says, it was a gross crime that Fox canceled this shiny diamond.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|Great book- funny and educational! I read this while traveling to Gaborone, Botswana, and that's the setting for this series of novels, so it was especially interesting. I'm hooked now and I'm reading the third novel in the series!
B00AW57L96|2.0|I haven't finished this book but have found it hard to get into maybe I will give it another go.
B0018BB20W|5.0|you know the original album, so I will go straight to the bonus tracks: love and beauty is a nice tune that captures the moodies in transition to their classic sound. all the alternates are good, no muffed takes. there is a decent rendition of don't let me be misunderstood from a BBC session. the remaining tracks are disposable. update : what version does Sharon (July 24 , 2013)have? mine is from 2008 and is not as she describes.
0451196716|5.0|Read this book over my vacation time and it was definitely worth the read. Kept you going right to the end!
B0028ER4QY|5.0|I think most people reading this know about the album itself.If you do NOT own it in any form,I would start with the remastered cd. However,for even the casual Doors fan,it fun to break out the record player and put this on.It sounds incredible on almost anything and is very sturdy compared to most vinyl due to it's extra thickness.I will say if you can still find it cheap,I would get it fast.They are all out of print and going fast but so worth it.I have already gotten a few others bit would like to get all the Doors studio ones this way if I still can.for those who don't know the album,It is one of their best and it went all the way to number one.Most one my favorite Doors songs are on here,my favorite sone period is here,'Spanish Caravan,&#34; and it is my favorite album of all time.There are many hits and Doors favorites on here for all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book! It's a super easy read and I couldn't put it down. I just finished this so I haven't had a chance to think about the ending but it felt a little cut off. I would still recommend this to anyone who wants to read a great  book with twists and turns that they will never see coming!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|DEFINITELY A GOOD GAME!<br />I am enjoying this game and not too kiddie.<br />Able to use the tools and no hiccups yet.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I really like this game..  you have the chance to build your city but to also fight against eachother.plus you can fight and also get revenge against the person that just got you...
B005H9B2CE|5.0|be prepared for a wild ride! with some very sexy characters! it has great acting and a great story line!
B00957T6X6|4.0|like most other &#34;fantasy&#34; books, this is relaxing because it is dramatic but not tied into anything current or &#34;real world&#34; so it is not stressful. I mainly got this because I was enjoying the HBO series, and although the series tweaks details and timelines, it is forgivable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I recommend that you play this app. It's an awesome and fun game for the kids and adults.playing this game is cool and addicting like crazy seriously
B0067R0APK|4.0|Very easy to use and navigate ability to read and keep up with other locations. I do recommend it to everyone
B00797MB0O|2.0|in a word: awkward! i think if you go in thinking this is a comedy then you will hate it. it's definitely not a comedy. it's more of a metaphorical movie~ this chick (charlize theron) is basically a crazy alcoholic and everything revolves around her (compared to a hormonal high school girl?). There were a lot of &#34;omg what is she doing?!&#34; moments. it wasn't for me but if your of an artistic 'emo' sort then one might like it. a very adult movie as well.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Don't like to get. Something for free then have to pay to play. One of th first games I got for my new Kindle fire.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a wonderful fantasy novel.  The writing style, characterizations, and plotting are pitch-perfect.  The magic is downplayed to give more space for the dark medieval politics.  I was enthralled by this book.  However, I will not read the sequels.  The author is cruel to his characters, and cruel to his readership.  He consistently builds up sympathetic characters and then kills them off.  After a while it gets old.  Sure life is hard and random, but this is just abusive of the reader.  So this one I give five stars to, but nothing (not even zero stars) for the sequels.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|I finally showed Zen Rocky for the first time; for Naoko and I it wasn't the first time, but there were so many scenes we'd forgotten it was like seeing it for the first time. Wow!!<br /><br />The opening fight takes place under the eyes of Jesus, the story unfolds slowly and we get a sense of what kind of guy Stallone's Rocky is - somber, not so smart, with a heart of gold. He's also hard to understand, and a lot of the films dialogue is buried in murk - we only really get to understand what anyone's saying when Apollo Creed comes into the picture, with his \\"be a thinker, not a stinker\\" appeal to kids to put their energy into study and not sports (and Creed himself seems to be a bit of an academic/bookworm - we see him reading, we never see him training... quite the opposite to Rocky himself). One significant scene shows a Creed associate watching a TV interview of Ricky slugging the beef, a look of concern crossing his face; he calls Creed to come over and have a look, but Creed's not interested - he thinks the fight with Rocky is going to be a walk in the park and he's more interested in business matters - a near-fatal, arrogant mistake. There's also no big music until 80 minutes into this 120 minute movie, and that's when we hear first a big 70s funk them, and finally the gigantic themes that we have for so many decades associated with triumph - THE ROCKY THEME!!! Love it all.<br /><br />The movie is full of great dialogue:<br /><br />Marie: \\"Hey Rocky - screw you, creep-o.\\"<br /><br />Apollo Creed: \\"Apollo Creed versus the eye-talian stallion. Sounds like a goddamn monster movie.\\"<br /><br />Adrienne: \\"Hey, it's Thanksgiving.\\"<br />Rocky: \\"To you. But to me it's Thursday.\\"<br /><br />Mickey: \\"Like the Bible says, you ain't gonna get a second shot.\\"<br /><br />Mickey: \\"Women weaken legs.\\"<br /><br />Mickey (to Rocky): \\"Eat lightning and crap thunder.\\"<br /><br />Great famous scenes, like when Rocky puts the five raw eggs into the big cup and drinks them right down - gulp! The running and training scenes and the big triumphant climb up the steps. Rocky's entire courtship of Adrienne, and the turkey-out-the-window deed that moves it forward. Mickey confronting Rocky in his apartment, talking about the 1923 fight with passion and despair, Rocky's rage to the empty room and his reconciliation with Mickey. Pauly's rage at Adrian, Adrian's rage at Pauly. Apollo Creed giving his energy to the crowd with his showmanship while Rocky watches, bemused and a bit disgusted. Creed's muscles are amazing and compact - Carl Weathers in his prime!! The fight is only 10 minutes at the end of the movie, and is supposed to cover a full 15 rounds, but what insanity, what madness, especially that first devastating punch, the punishment, the lancing of the bloated eyebrow, and the ultimate finale, with the \\"ADRIAN!!!! ADRIAN!!!!\\" Wow... what a movie!!!<br /><br />This edition comes with plenty of extras:<br />- a commentary track (which my system played through the sub-woofer, which meant I couldn't understand anything). There was a cool 12-minute video collection of 8mm films made by director John Avildsen that shows Stallone training with Carl Weathers, silently. Interesting test case, and Avildsen talks about using the 8mm to experiment and save the actors embarrassment, a blueprint, a sketchpad, try out lenses, angles, lighting, and to show Sly how heavy he was. There was a lot of rehearsal time for the fight scenes. They learned from a fighting script that Sly wrote out for them, had six weeks of prep, the entire film had a short schedule and budget of $900,000. Wanted a soundtrack like Beethoven's 6th, which they'd play during the 8mm screenings. The 8mm clips showed a body guide, they did all the cringing early so that there'd be no cringing when the dailies came in. Sly and Carl Weathers are shown with their swollen-face make-up.<br />- an 8-minute tribute to Burgess Meredith, which talks about how he had been making films since the 1930s, and his performance exceeded all of Sly's expectations, with a great voice. Burt Young reminisced how they got nominated together. Carl Weathers describes the meeting in Rocky's apartment. Lee Grant went out with Meredith to an Indian guru show, talks about their escape speeding down the highway (not sure why this is included). Burgess Meredith, 1907-1007. Only Sly's face is seen, all others are off-screen narrating.<br />- tribute to James Crabe for 3 minutes, mainly the director talking about his talents as a cinematographer on their 12 movies together, starting (ironically) with Save The Tiger. Opening scene in grim club shows Jimmy's genius - shades and darkness. Always finding solutions to tricky camera problems. Was nominated for his work in The Formula, not Rocky. 1931-1989.<br />- a teaser trailer and trailers for Rocky I, Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV and Rocky V. Great! Cheezy announcing like \\"You can compare him to Nicholson, DeNiro and Brando. But he is Rocky!!\\" \\"His name is Sylvester Stallone, but you will always remember him as Rocky!\\"<br />- three original TV spots, two of 30 seconds, one of 60 seconds<br />- a commentary of 28 minutes with Sylvester, recounting how he went to Hollywood and was trying to make it, rented a small room, from which he could open the window and close the door without leaving his bed. Wrote and wrote. Was with Butkus his dog. Saw Muhammad Ali fight Chuck Wepner, the Bayonne Bleeder, who knocked Ali down. This put him into a writing frenzy, and three days later he had a script, 10% of which remained after the rewrites produced the final script. The original screenplay was very dark, with an anti-hero who throws the fight, Mickey is angry and racist. Rocky doesn't want to be part of that world any more. Too angry and unrepentant. Stallone got a break at a casting call when he mentioned he's a writer. \\"Come back later.\\" The studio liked the script, but didn't want Stallone in it - Ryan O'Neill, maybe, or Burt Reynolds. \\"My $40 car had just blown up, so I was taking the bus to work.\\" Lots of injuries during the production, knuckles flattened out punching beef - beef is hard! Stallone's dad is bell ringer, brother doo-wop singer. Talia Shire was one of the last choices for Adrian. Sly describes characters and motivations to the film, back stories. They had wanted to use Ken Norton for the Apollo Creed role, but lucked out with Carl Weathers. \\"Mr Avildsen, I could do better if I had a real actor reading with me,\\" he said. \\"Carl, that's Rocky, the writer and star.\\" \\"Well, maybe he'll get better.\\" Nice - that's the attitude we want for this movie! Stallone talks about his dog Butkus' \\"train flatulence.\\" Recounts the original ending for Rocky, where he's looking for Adrian finds her backstage, gives her a light hug, picks up a flag, they fade into the distance. Describes the process of deciding the final freeze frame., and his performance exceeded all of Sly's expectations, with a great voice. Burt Young reminisced how they got nominated together.

B00006JSS8|5.0|Genius.  The music took me back to another time when life was simpler and not as chaotic.  A must buy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have played the computer version and when i saw it on my Kindle I said &quot;Momma it's mincraft! I have to get it!&quot; I bought and it's my favorite game of any.And I have A LOT of games. This is must get for ANYONE. Minecraft is played all over the world and they know have a little over 11 MILLION people that have bought an account the computer. That was just the computer.......!!!!!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Awesome movie regardless of age, it will keep you entertained and the minions are just hilarious. I highly recommend this film along with the sequel in theater today
B001ANSS5K|5.0|great book to read while on a beach drinking a corona or while on a bus or plane or train
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|I got the full version of this game for free. The fact that I even got it was a mistake. I got almost to the end when it wouldn't let me tap on something. I tried time after time,but it wouldn't work. I eventually gave up and removed it from my device. I thought it was actually a good game up to that point. Disappointed.
B008220BLG|4.0|. . . it might have looked like this!<br /><br />I'm not a zombie movie aficionado. At all. In fact, in the supernatural beings canon (witches, elves, vampires, werewolves & other shapeshifters, succubi, mermaids . . um, ghosts, giants, poltergeists, angels, demons) . . .zombies rank as my least watchable. They're incredibly slow, and it's not like you can have a meaningful conversation with one. And the proclivity of theirs to eat my brain has to be their most off-putting feature, not to mention, their rotting stench and general decomposition.<br /><br />But this isn't a 'straight' zombie genre flick . . this is an affectionate lampoon crossed with a teenage Romeo and Juliet story. Sort of the kind of picture John Hughes made in the '80s, only 'John Bender' in this story is replaced by a charmingly self-aware zombie boy named 'R'. (At least, he thinks his name used to start with 'R' but that's all he's able to remember.) Even though he struggles to reproduce the most basic human language as he shuffles through his home--an abandoned airport inhabited by other members of the zombie nation--R carries on an amusingly self-deprecating and self-aware interior commentary about his current level of existence . . which is in a word, unsatisfying. One day, foraging for food (humans), R's zombie pod encounters Julie (Palmer) and her band of teenage commandoes on a supply-gathering mission. There's a firefight, but the teens come out the worse for it, being massively outnumbered. R. eats Julie's boyfriend's brain (\\"I'm not proud of it',\\" he says \\"But I can't help it--the brain is the best part.\\") When zombies eat the brains of their victims, they relive, for a brief moment, the memories of that person and thus get to feel human again for a moment. Thus, R. falls in love with Julie on the spot, and taking some brains to save for later, becomes her protector against his own . .er, kind.<br /><br />Julie just happens to be the daughter of the commander of the last remnant of human civilization (Malkovich), so this unlikely duo outstrips Shakespeare's original star-crossed lovers as a wildly inappropriate match. Julie is at first a frightened hostage . . but slowly begins to realize that R. is unlike any zombie she's been trained to expect. In fact, in her presence he is slowly regaining his humanity. Is it possible that the 'cure' for the zombie-virus is . . .love?<br /><br />An interesting premise gets dragged on a bit (okay, a lot) too long . . .the movie moves as slowly along as a zombie gait . .but our two leads are very appealing. Palmer is a rising Australian actress that will be unknown to Americans . . and Nick Hoult (Beast, X-Men First Class) has built an impressive resume stuffed with versatility since his debut as a child actor. People might not realize that this rangy youth is British, so effortlessly does he adopt the intonations and mannerisms of an American stoner (Zombie is really stoner taken to the ultimate level.)<br /><br />This \\"Twilight for the Zombie Crowd\\" is a \\"fresh\\" take on a genre that is anything but fresh. Special mention goes to Rob Corddray as R.s best zombie buddy . . who manages to embue his zombie character with both sidekick humor and unexpected heart.
B0063M22QO|2.0|This version doesn't include the \\"Great Wall\\" or \\"Turtle\\" layout. That's the standard layout for any serious player. The tiles are okay looking and there is music but nothing that makes me want to play this one again. If you like your basic layout then avoid this version.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is so good! It kept me engaged and entertained! Love the new characters and the cliff hanger at the end!! Could not put this book down for a minute!! Highly recommend the whole series!!
B00BMEF6IO|4.0|This item was delivered on time.  The condition was new.  It is a gift for my sister's birthday so I have not listened to it.  I hope she really enjoys this.  Thank you so much.
160774273X|5.0|Go-to book on no-knead bread from a Portland master chef. Everything you want to know—exact weight measurements for the recipes. For the professional chef as well as the home bread baker—bread is so simple, just these four ingredients will yield a fabulous product. Add it to your kitchen library. A+++
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Love sci-fi movies and this series is great suspenseful and I love it. I wish I could of seen the first half of the first season...I guess I will have to buy it to watch it
B002JCSWV6|5.0|I liked the movie. Why are you requiring me to have to write an essay. What a waste of time
B009A9EPLM|5.0|John Williams makes the best cinema music ever no offense to life of pi but lincoln should of won best original svore at the oscars.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just wonderful, now i cant wait for season three with continuing drama and intrigue in the castle I've come to love.
1439127727|5.0|A must read to anyone with an interest in U.S. politics.<br />Covers the last 70 years of U.S. history, starting at the time Truman asked former (and at the time, disgraced) Pres. Hoover to help him avoiding a major famine that could devastate Europe, and finishing in the present, when Pres. Obama has requested help from both Clinton and Bush (43rd) for some foreign engagements. Due to short-term secrecy matters (I guess), the book is more rich on details on the Truman-Reagan era. Even though the living Presidents' relationships are less developed, it still is fascinating to learn, for example, about the friendship between Clinton and the Bushes (especially 41st).<br />This is a great read. Not dense on politics or foreign policy discussions, but full of interesting stories. A nice and relatively light read that is, nonetheless, fascinating and very warming in some instances.<br />HIghly recommended.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My 5 and 8 year old daughters love this game. I wish it weren't so difficult for them to progress (without paying money) but so far no complaints from them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love minecraft, now I can play it on the go! Can this get any better! I hope you guys enjoy this game as much as I do.
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|We did not use the game aspect of this toy. My 4 year old just used the sling and the rest of the components. The breakaway rock was a little too hard for my 4 year old to put back together so there was a lot of adult help on reconstructing the 'rock'.
B005D63ICI|5.0|5 stars cause it's so....thought provoking...evil and good so tightly twisted<br />I dislike that I have to work up the courage to watch each episode, but at least that makes it last longer.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey was an amazing three-season series; original, creative, dramatic without likening itself to a soap opera. All three seasons are worth watching for sure.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I try to play a video from the videos I subscribe to and it never loads a mnemonic d it tells me to wait while it says it's &quot;fixing it&quot; but it never does. I have had to delete and download this app many times just so it actually works again.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I've played Spider (way too much) for over a year and it's just now dawning on me that the scoring system and \\"best player\\" features are fakes.  I send an email to my friend saying I won Game # XXXXXX.  She opens the game and doesn't see my name on the list.  How can I be at the top of the list when my time was 20 minutes slower than the a faster player with the same score?  Why does the score always stall at 3500?  Even their help team couldn't explain this.  I noticed that I hadn't won a (3 suit) game in over 2 weeks and all of a sudden I won everything.  Please MobilityWare - tell me I'm imagining things!!!!<br />Robin
159102594X|5.0|I'm about half-way through this book at this point. Joe Abercrombie's storytelling is phenomenal. It goes from chapter to chapter, detailing the lives of several characters, flawlessly showing you their outlooks and personalities. The build up is amazing.<br /><br />I'm a somewhat well-read fantasy reader, and I've noticed a theme among fantasy novels and stories. That theme is the invincibility of the main characters. They're often clumsily inept at certain things when it's convenient, and incredibly amazing at other things... again, when it's convenient. Authors often show favoritism and don't allow their favorites to get killed or hurt.<br /><br />Abercrombie chucks all that out the window. These characters are real. They're gritty. They're mortal. They feel human. It's incredible. Read this book. Do it now.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|If only we had real guys like this, planet earth and humanity would thrive better. We would not need armies ,ever again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is very entertaining and very fun.the minions are so cute! You don't have to pay for anything unless you want to buy bananas but you earn them them. That's why the game is so fun ,entertaining and cute.also I think you will enjoy the obstacles some are hard. You get to see vector too.
B0044DEAUA|1.0|It would'nt pair with any of my phones.  Something happened in the shipping process.  It would register to the phone but you couldn't the process and that was bad for me. Had to send it back.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|So far the best season of the series! Love the action, suspense and rollercoaster of emotions! Looking forward to more and more Walking Dead!
B0088T3B0G|5.0|One of my top 10 pics. If not it is one of my top five. The actors were great, the script is excellent and directed beautiful. A real good crime story.
0385535147|1.0|The book is really slow-paced and lacks excitement for the first four-fifths. You keep guessing what the book is about until almost the very end. In the book the main protagonist assumes an air of moral and intellectual superiority to everyone. Well, dude, if you are so smart, how come you got five years \\"for something you didn't do\\"? Also, he is so sanctimonious but it turns out he is not so innocent and altruistic after all. He runs with people with drugs and guns. The reader will find out at the end that their sympathy for the first-person narrator, whose arrogance they find annoying but tolerate for the sake of reading and completing a book, is misplaced.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Solid graphics but the game play is rather generic though. You save up coins to buy houses, decorations, dinosaurs, and to clear out the area (to make the park bigger). Resources are there to feed the dinosaurs as well. Naturally you can buy coins and money to speed up the process but it's far too overpriced and not worth paying their ridiculous prices for. The missions are straight forward as well with no originality.<br /><br />It's not a bad app but I wish it was more original, more difficult.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Loved House at Riverton, and loved this one too! Can't wait to read my next Kate Morton book! They're all great!
B003BW0CB6|3.0|I really like Mickey Haller.  He seems real to me, a trait I'm sure Mr. Connelly intended.  This book, however, wasn't the best.  It was okay but not up to standards.  Read it if you are a fan like me,  Otherwise, you might want to pass.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|Everything about this game was great, but when I got stuck on a level I got bored quickly playing the same screen over and over again. This app last two days on my Samsung Galaxy III.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I love the REAL card game magic. however getting digital for kindle sucks. i got rid of every other app beacause memory storage was to low and it still would not download. fantastic.
0345803493|5.0|Great book. I couldn't put it down. I'm working on the third book now and so far so good. I would definitely recommend the Fifty Shades Of Grey trilogy!
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Mr. Connelly showed yet another side of Mickey Haller and I really enjoyed it.  It's nice to know that flaws happen even in fiction.  I would recommend this book.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|Have you ever tried to read the bible? How about the book of Genesis? This first book is about as exciting as that. Skip this and buy something from the author Jim Butcher instead.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is great on any device! It's worth it because u can connect with your friends and create anything! If your a miner, u can mine in the darkest caves. If your a builder, u can build anything to the beaches to the snowy land. With x box, it costs money to connect. :( But in pocket edition, u can connect for free! I love it and think that it's worth every penny! If u can't buy it u can get minecraft lite. There is also a chat box. Hope this was helpful!
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|I loved this show very much. It never gets old and it is very entertaining. If you like troy this is the show you should watch.

B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I have heard this thing is really hit and miss. If it works on your tv, you will love it. I never got it to work myself.
B00459EZLW|5.0|One of the best sci fi shows I've seen, and another one gone too soon. Hopefully they can bring this back, at least in a movie form, to tie up loose ends. A must see!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This was working fine for months and then something changed and I can't even get on....it just kicks me back to my carousel page. Whatever update or change that was made, made this app crap for me. Change it back! It's useless as it is no
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Not a five star book, but a solid four. The pacing was just fast enough to keep it interesting. The characters just defined enough to feel empathy/sympathy. Good beach reading- without any drivel.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|The Civil War was actually about the free trade between the North and South - the slavery issue was a bonus - not the actual cause of the war.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I love watching the weather channel on t.v. and my tablet. I just wish they would go back to the old app.
B00CM6ZLG8|3.0|I rated it as okay because I personally don't relate to the songs, but I like the music. I just bought the whole CD so that I could hear it all and it's cheaper on Amazon.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new format is too cumbersome. The pages contain a lot of garbage. Trying to find information takes too long.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|We thoroughly enjoy Castle - it is tasteful, not outrageous and the storylines provoke thoughts as to &#34;who done it.&#34;
B00C5ZORES|5.0|First CD I've purchased in a long time and I was NOT let down! All of these songs can be listened to over and over. Never gets boring. If you love FOB, buy this.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game has. Lots of surprises and great hidden objects. The only problem is if you don't have Google play the updates are slow to come to Amazon
B005544TRQ|5.0|Entertaining brilliant I love this show its addictive and the characters are always surprising you with what will happen next..you gotta watch
B005HSL626|5.0|My daughter love playing this game she plays it all the time! I played it a couple of times!! cool
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is fantastic! I have not read a book this well written and gripping in such a long time. I felt so connected to the characters!  I also loved the fact that it was set in Indianapolis which is where I live. Towards the end of this book I stayed up WAY past when I should have because I could not put this down until I finished it. It was also the first book to make me cry in God knows how long. Loved it!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|For any Joe Bonamassa fan An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House is a must.  Even if you are a hard blues or rock fan and like lots of guitar pyrotechnics, this album will still have something for you.  For anyone who is not a Bonamassa fan or have never hard of Joe, this is still a great album.  Great mix of songs, great mix of insturments, great mix of styles, just an all around great acoustic album.<br /><br />For fans the album includes new acoustic takes on some of Joe's classic hits which are fresh and full of energy.  For listeners who are not hardcore blues fans this album has a good deal of variety and it never gets stale.  Watching the video of the performance Joe changes guitars between each song and each song is unique listening experience.<br /><br />I can not recommend this album more highly.  It is simply a great album filled with great performaces of wonderful songs.  Anyone who doesn't like this album has other issues becuse the music is fantastic!
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|I've been a Superman fan for 40 years. With so many movies being made about lesser heroes, I was excited for this. The trailers looked great. And then as the film rolled I sunk lower and lower in my seat until I just couldn't stand it anymore and left when the final battle got underway. Believe the negative reviews from many of the professional film critics. Nolan might have been involved as a producer, but he wasn't the principal script writer and he wasn't the director, and that makes all the difference. The script was terrible. The direction was terrible. The only reason I can come up with for the film's popularity among so many Superman fans is that they have been so hungry for a film that they would have liked almost anything. I give it 2 stars for at least trying to make Superman relevant again.<br /><br />The thing to remember is that even though Superman has Kryptonian abilities, his personality is 100% human. He was raised since infancy on a farm in Kansas. He might feel different, but at heart he is a small town American and this film completely missed that. In focusing on the 'alien among us' angle, they gutted Superman's personality that was so well portrayed by Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh. The Clark Kent we have all come to know and love through the years was completely missing. There were so many elements of the plot that made no sense. There was CGI overkill. Superman Returns had some plot problems, and could have put Superman in a few more action scenes, but overall that movie was far more faithful to the origins of the Superman character.<br /><br />The fact that Avengers was so successful should prove that a superhero movie doesn't have to copy The Dark Knight to be a hit. A superhero movie can be light, it can be funny, it can be human, and still be a fantastic movie. I have nothing to say about the relationship of this movie to recent comic book adaptations or graphic novels. As a movie, it is no better than all the other CGI-fests out there with tons of explosions and destruction. Superman is supposed to be special.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I wanted to read this book before watching the movie because I HATE when they make books into movies. This is a really good book and I was not expecting some of the very mature topics covered in this novel. I am glad I read this before the movie because the movie could not compare to how great this book is. I highly recommend this to anyone who can handle serious topics about teenagers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game! In the past trying to play these games I get stuck and frustrated and usually stop playing but this one was fun and addicting. I loved the many ways they hid clues. It exercises your memory and keeps you searching for clues!
1609611543|5.0|This book was very well written. Although I am in the medical field, I believe it is written in a way for everyone to understand exactly what is going on our body when we consume wheat products that we are sensitive to.  I went gluten free as an experiment and I am amazed at how much more awake and alert I feel. No more fogginess or sleepiness after meals!!  I also don't have the carb cravings that I used to during the day.  I haven't had blood work done to confirm, but based on my recent diet change, I must be gluten-sensitive!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is an addictive game! Enjoy playing it on both iPhone and kindle- easier on the kindle! Great for young and old!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Great book!! He needs to write faster so we don't have to wait so long between book. Worth the wait  though.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great story! It is so erotic and a great love story at the same time. I'm not a love story enthusiast but I must say E L James tells a great story. I look forward the the final book. What will happen next. Will there be a wedding? Will they move into the new house? Will Ana let Christian have his way with her? Will the ex sleez ball boss hurt Christian? I can't wait!
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Best Kept Secret is as all other Jeffrey Archers, a good read with flowing informative and interesting text.  Struggled to put it down.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This product allows me to save and share information without a lot of hassle and come back to find it easily.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|While I really love Maggie Smith, this wasn't the best thing I've ever seen her in. It was just meh in my opinion.
B008FYZIVY|3.0|I found out too late (only a moment after ordering it) that this is not the original U.K. version.  I could not cancel it, and  since I live in United Kingdom I could not ask the person I bought it for to return it themselves.
038572179X|4.0|The first half of this book is as close to perfect as I've ever come in fiction.  The writing, characters, story, and pacing are a tour de force.  I wasn't as absorbed by the war scenes, but still appreciated McEwan's absolute command of plot and language.  I'm reading one of his earlier works now and enjoying his talents very much, but Atonement is truly his masterpiece.
B007F1SGM6|3.0|I don't think that the movie should cost so much. I enjoyed watching the interplay between the father and the son, and the cleverness of the son. I also enjoyed watching the mother protect her son mentally and physically.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I needed Flash added on my kindle. You must download this first before you can get it. If you need flash. It is really easy to put on the kindle. Recommended
B0071MQBX0|5.0|The color, the story, and that fabulous music...what's not to love?!  We had watched this on Netflix last week after some time had passed since we had listened to the CD, and even more time since seeing the LA production years ago...twice.  We decided to order a copy of the DVD so we could watch it again, which we did upon receiving it.  Mr. Karimloo was a fitting Phantom and ms Boggess was the best Christine we have heard since Ms Brightman.  At the end, Andrew Lloyd Webber came out and presented various previous cast members including Sarah Brightman, who sang, along with four previous Phantoms, for a thrilled London audience.  Lloyd Webber has been criticized for creating music that appeals to the masses, however, &#34;us masses&#34; are very grateful.  This DVD was filmed in 2011, I think.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|It's a classic book for anyone who has a love for adventure upon the high seas.<br />I read it on my android kindle and will keep in on my shelf for years to come.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|I love a game that takes some brain power. This is it. I have only played it a few times but it's a keeper. Recommended
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's fun to play Temple Run 2. Very interesting game. My 7 year old is addicted to this game. Such a fun game to play!!
B0063M22QO|3.0|too easy, did not find it as challenging as i had hoped for. i want somethingthat truly makes my brain work better.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I took my wife to see Les Miserable as soon as it released in our area.  I learned that she'd never seen any film version before.  She was very enthused by the story, and the production, as well as the back-story and the on-set comments.  Thanks for such timely releases, Amazon!
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Hopefully hip hop will love and appreciate him and move pass the all these mediocre \\"superstars\\" that don't anything for the growth of hip hop.<br /><br />Love
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a very good game. It is fun and challenging but not too challenging. I would buy this app a thousand times over.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Having no television, I have to wait until this comes out on DVD.  I was saddened to see the deaths of two of the regulars, but I understand why.  No one will be able to take Matthew Crawley's place and Sybil will be missed.  I enjoyed seeing Shirley MacLaine as Cora's mother, especially opposite Maggie Smith!  What a cast!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love it. Good points: different types of activities. You can move to the next activity if the current one .  Bad poit: You can only move forward, side to side but not turn left or right. No mystery or build up of suspense.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I'm not sure who the target audience for this film is. I suspect it's all of us. I'm a year younger than Stephen Chbosky, so I grew up with the same John Hughes movies he did, around the same time in life. I have read the book of &#34;Perks&#34; twice, and I think there is a deliberate attempt to make the characters and situations timeless. Charlie finds himself relating to teenagers of earlier generations. I think we are meant to as well. Anyway, I'm rambling a bit, but let me just say that this movie is such a breath of fresh air. These are characters who accept each other and truly love each other. I think I am supposed to be rating the digital download (I have purchased the DVD and the digital download), but if you get a chance, buy the DVD and watch the movie with the two commentaries. You will learn how much love there is not only among the characters but the actors as well.<br /><br />Certainly, there are dark moments in the story, but such is life. Dark at times, glorious at others. This movie captures both wonderfully. Don't waste time reading more reviews. Just get this movie!!! And the book!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I got this game cuz I was bored and I wad like let's try it out and ever since I got the game I'm always on it I love this game my storm id is zayabaya invite me so we can be neighbors hope you have as much fun as I do.

B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is a Really fun movie to watch, I loved all the music,And some of the scenes really made me laugh.
1476734941|4.0|I saw the program on PBS and was intrigued by the book.  I love Michael Mosley's programs because he explains the science behind dieting and exercise.  The recipes and meal plans really help you discover what you can eat and still lose weight.
B000L53D4O|4.0|I bought this for my 10 month old grand daughter.  She loves the toys on the front.  I only wish that the front had a little heavier. It will flip backwards if baby starts to fall that way.  Lucky for me she figured this out and is a lot more stable with it now. So use caution when your little one first uses it.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|hated the book. Love story is poor, abusive, obsessive... Nothing cute about it. I just did not like the book
B008N1LL42|3.0|it is an ok, movie, glad that i did  not go and spend money at the movie theater to watch it, at home was fine enough,
B005DJGMQE|4.0|Movie demonstrates how politics of the 19th century were used to subvert a courtroom verdict.  The government needed scapegoats following the assassination of Lincoln and this money dramatically depicts the trial of one of them.  Well acted and directed.
B006L4MWVE|5.0|This movie makes The Hunger Games look like house party 3. lol seriously though, this movie was awesome. Hunger Games = NO
B003FSTN5C|5.0|it is a great show, trying to get every season all the time. it is just the right mix of action and story!
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Amazing lyrics. Really is the best album that they have released yet.  Well worth the wait...even though we waited so anxiously!

B00DGN51O8|4.0|I really enjoyed this with the family.  The giants were intimidating and yet kind of funny.  Give it a watch!
B0036FOGTW|3.0|Powerfull arguments. I felt inclined to read some counter arguments right away though, as the bookf feels too &#34;one sided&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't put it down....it is very addictive. The animation is hilarious!I definitely recommend this product, and its free! Happy gaming.
B005DNPKSQ|3.0|The wife and I watched this with our teenagers who had never seen it.  It is entertaining and thought provoking.

B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I have never visited the blog of the writer and this was my first read by him.Really good stuff.Will regularly follow Mr Altucher's blog now.This has been one of the most honest books I have read so far.

B00CWV8TIU|3.0|This one is a thinker.  It makes you really frightened and think really hard about the pharmaceutical companies and what they are capable of.
1452110581|5.0|I would swear this book was written by my kitty kids. The title alone drove me to purchase it. Spurred on by the memory of the many pairs of peed on ruined shoes my adopted stray Mischief has left awaiting me. It's some of our cat stories that most owners can relate to put into prose. Very witty book, with fitting photographs - I love it & wish I had thought of it. Kudos to Francesco
B000021Y7X|5.0|From beginning to end it is like attending a Talking Heads Concert. Love the zoot suit, love how the entire concert comes together. I own this video and can not keep my sons 22 and 25 from borrowing it. Classic spans generations.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. By far, I think Season 1 and 3 are the best. I don't normally like zombies or scary movies because I feel that they are pretty stupid but Walking Dead is an awesome show and was right from the beginning. It has a little bit of everything; romance, courage, suspense and so much more.<br />Give it a try. You will know right from the beginning if you love it or hate it!
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Bought this as the core of a new gaming rig I'm building.  So far I've got a base system with 16 gig of ram, I had an older 2 core 2.8 ghz computer that was starting to give me trouble with the games i'm playing.  I was running LOTRO and SWOTR @ min to med settings but now, without adding a new video card this processor's onboard graphics are allowing about med-high settings.  Total cost for my build so far about 500$.  I highly recommend this processor

B00BB8SKPW|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  We stopped watching halfway through because it was so disturbing and had such filthy unnecessary language.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|This is a really captivating story by Baldacci  filled with spy stuff and patriots.  The love stories and the good guys win all again.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|We watched Eureka from the beginning, but it has been a while since season 1.  I enjoyed watching the season to recapture the enjoyment I experienced the first time.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is lots of fun, especially after you get your city established. At first it's easy to go broke and need to buy more credits. But once the city starts to generate income and stand on its own, there are plenty of opportunities to make your city even better.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|rented this movie and watched only half of it until all three of us watchers agreed that we wished no more to sit there watching such emptiness of life substance.  no real connections between characters, just circumstances and the circumstances were so dry and devoid of kindness and life affirming connections that we didn't want to sit through such a bleak depiction of life....
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this series! Truly imaginative and so compelling you loose track of time. I would recommend this entire series as summer reading.
B00AVFO41K|3.0|it has no instructions on how to play it.  I had to try and try to figure it out and then i didn't know enough to even get past the 1st level.  Instructions would help this game! Otherwise I liked it.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book was supposed to wrap up the Crossfire trilogy. This horrid piece of work answered absolutely no questions. I know the author wants to milk these characters as long as she can, but I wouldn't bother reading this fluffy mess.  When the next book comes out, I'll borrow it from the library.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|As always Dan Brown delivered a brilliant book that forced me to use my brain throughout. I look forward to the next go round with Langdon.
0670026603|5.0|This is such a great story.  Our book club loved it and it was great for discussion.  Highly recommend.  Sad ending (which doesn't give it away...any ending would be sad).  Must read!
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|Same old thing. All the scary things are animated unbelievable. But it was really well done and the women were as tough as the men so in the end worth the bucks.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I totally enjoyed reading this fascinating book.  It is different than anything else I have read recently, unusual story and well-written.  A very complicated, twisted love story.  Reviews I read by other people indicated they were disappointed with the ending, but I thought the ending was perfect for the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching all 3 seasons of Downton Abbey. What a glimpse into this timeperiod and the daily lives of the rich and their servants.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I bought this for my grandson partly based on the many reviews. My grandson loves it.  I love it. It is ideal for very young children because it is a book narrated in the really gentle, beautiful voice of Helena Bonham-Carter. it mirrors the illustratations of the book which are wonderful. It is a non scary, scary story in which even the Gruffalo has a rather appealing ugliness. The length is perfect for my 2.5 year old grandchild whose attention wanes after about 40 minutes. I guess what I appreciated most is the simplicity of the tale and the illustrations, no violence of any sort (not even playful), not too many words, nothing to scare a toddler, and the perfect length. I've bought and shelved a lot of movies meant for toddlers (I always watch them first) because they contain scenes that are not appropriate for children who are at an age where they imitate things they see without being able to discriminate between appropriate and non appropriate behaviours. This is just plain lovely and I won't get bored watching it many times. With a grandson who is extremely active, it is just great to have a story which calms him down before bedtime. As an aside, I would really appreciate people reviewing the actual product and not the shipping and packaging problems they experienced. It's not helpful to those of us who want to read about the product itself. I'm speaking to the person who gave this film one star and others who do the same. The Gruffalo is fantastic.
B008Y6OS64|4.0|A gritty and psychedelic account of European youth-drug subculture. Lots of disturbing imagery puts you in the moment and makes you think. Don't watch during or after a meal. Certainly an eye-opener.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Great movie, I got it so I could follow along with all the saying when it is played in my local theather, and it has a feature for that!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Wheat Belly got me to realize what I am eating and shouldn't be. It is also a great reference to go back to.
B00AEL1H9I|2.0|After having watched both seasons, I really want to like this show more that I actually did. The characters lack any depth, the first season they really started to develop and then this season they've gone backwards.  It seems like there are many other things to write about other than every show basically revolving around sex.  Surely the cast is more well-rounded then this being the premise of every character.  It's trying too hard and unfortunately has lost my interest.  I do like the actors in the show and there are moments of chemistry, but the writers have really let them down.  The show about a quirky girl that moves in with three guys has become a whiny girl who's life is consumed with hooking up and talking about it with her roommates as they worry about hooking up as well... Disappointed.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|works great with my kindle and I can plug it in to the computer. so happy that i have an extra one
B005544TRQ|5.0|Husband and I are finally catching up and love the quick banter and humor of the show. Looking forward to watching the next episodes
B005DOKIYG|5.0|I carry my Kindle everywhere in my purse.  This works great to protect it if it would happen to fall out of my bag.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|good fun running game has fun mini games and is free its great and its despicable me get it now
B0049D1TCM|4.0|You will love this if you are a fan of Hip-Hop and pop or Nicki Minaj. The only thing was that when I got this in the mail the CD case was cracked on the front other than that the CD works great and sounds Great too!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game really uses your brain. Great help is available if you get stuck. Each room is a little different in how you solve the puzzle
B008220BP2|5.0|A surprisingly entertaining movie. It has action, comedy, gore, romance and fun. Recommended by 4 adults who watched it together.
B007DIQB50|5.0|Nicki Minaj is the queen of Hip-Hop and rap and you will love this album! The CD was awarded best Hip-Hop album of 2012
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've used the Kindle application on many devices--and currently have it running on a tablet.  There are also applications that are compatible with Apple products and PC's.  I have other Kindle applications running on a laptop and a mobile phone, and have run the Kindle application on other devices, over time.<br /><br />This is marvelous.  Whichever device you might be using, you can pick up where you left off reading, you carry all your ebooks at hand, games, video content, music....everything you keep as electronic media.<br /><br />Lordy!  Whatever did we do before electronic gizmos and Kindle?
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Loved this book. An earlier trip through Norway with star detective Harry Hole.  Nesbo is great, one of my fave authors.
B0017ZB8M6|1.0|I can't play the cd much because it just stop playing, not turning, no more sound, not good cd to play
B0063M22QO|1.0|I decided not to download this product after reading reviews about it.  should have looked at them first.  Commercial interruptions.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I love the National- but I definitely think that they are a band that is a slow burn- it takes a few listens to get into their albums, but with every listen their albums gets better.<br /><br />&#34;Trouble Will Find Me&#34; is definitely this kind of album for me. I have found something new to love with every listen. I still think that &#34;High Violet&#34; is my favorite of theirs, but this is a solid, mellow, and interesting album. Some of the songs, namely &#34;Heavenfaced&#34; are both striking and beautiful. I definitely recommend it, especially at this price. Highlights include &#34;Fireproof&#34; and Don't Swallow the Cap.&#34;<br /><br />Fans of Sufjan Stevens and Beach House should find a lot to love here.
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|The dvd works ok, but the production of the movie and the movie's story are not cohesive, not matched with whata was advertising
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|since the latest update, the game keeps freezing. I've had to uninstall and reinstall twice in the past week! very frustrating...
B00DFFI7K2|1.0|The relationship between the characters seemed forced. Poor acting! I didn't even finish watching it. It was boring and dull. My daughter whose 8 years old could have wrote a better story line.
B001G0MFOM|3.0|I think the cd may be old, but it works ok, so I am ok with it, may buy some more
1781162646|4.0|This was a nice quick read at the beach, but it's not your typical Stephen King in that the vulgarity and horror is minimal. If you've read much of his work, you'll recognize some characters and situations, so don't look for a new, riveting book, but I still enjoyed it.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This novel creates a unique and fascinating fantasy world.  A must read for lovers of fantasy.  This story is a delight.
0143034901|5.0|Throughly enjoying this book. Intrigue, mystery, unexpected twists and turns. Fully developed characters.  Author style of writing is excellent. I look forward to reading more from this author.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Author Damian Stevenson's \\"SOLSTICE\\" is a psychological thriller that arrests the reader's consciousness from the opening page. One feels deep empathy for the bipolar heroin Dana Barnes at the onset. She appears incapable of taking care of herself, and must be aided in her readjustment to the outside world, following an unpleasant stint in a psychiatric institution. The story takes some surprising twists and turns as she is forced to deal with the trauma of the sudden, unexplained disappearance of her boyfriend following her release; and the cryptic, creepy social undercurrents of the Oklahoma town she passes through on her way to see her sister Zoe.<br /> Her boyfriend's disappearance torments her as she struggles to adjust to a Spartan lifestyle with Zoe and her husband Clive at THE RAINBOW COLLECTIVE - a self-sufficient community of pagan nature worshippers. The perceived indifference of the townspeople and Rainbow community members to Dana's plight (and the lack of physical evidence) leaves the reader wondering if she'd ever had a real boyfriend in the first place! The tale takes more unexpected turns as Dana is forced to take matters into her own hands to prove her sanity... learning harrowing lessons in intimate trust in the process.<br />The overall story is smartly written, and thoroughly engaging from beginning to end. The author`s plot is cleverly constructed. He blends mind twisting elements found in psycho-thriller story settings, and the brutal psychotic realities of religious cults to great effect. The story can be otherwise described as a suspenseful, horror-filled journey into \\"The Twilight Zone\\"... while being trapped in a Jonestown setting! You check in... But you never check out! This novel would no doubt make a great screenplay for a movie!
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Enjoyed it.  The DVD was shipped very quickly and was just as advertised.  It was a great movie and I enjoyed it very much.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Will be uninstalling...<br />It's useless...radar doesn't work...Will not give accurate up to date forcast...bring back the old one..this one sucks
B005R32L66|5.0|Skype is so much better than sending emails. Face to face communication is more personal than typing.  A lot more can said.
B002MG0MF8|5.0|This movie could never have been made today - it's a low key character study in which nothing much really happens.  It's brilliantly acted, though, and the characters are all so real and enjoyable, that it's a joy to watch.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|No scratches, no skipping, no stuck chapters.  Awesome movie and a true tribute to the graphic novel &#34;A Death in the Family&#34;
B00COGY2P2|3.0|If you like the Jack Reacher stories you should like this movie.  Tom Cruz is not 6'4&#34; but he knows how to play the action hero and does a good job of playing the Reacher role.
034547581X|5.0|This is a must read for any combat veteran, especially Vietnam veterans. It tells it like it was and pays the utmost respect to the troopers and their families. Noncombatants will not be able to feel the feelings, smell the smells, and see the sights but it will give them good insight into combat in Vietnam.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|Waste of time stupid and this is a great way to waste your time and money on the app dont get any GAMES
140006922X|1.0|Disclaimer: I did not read this book.  Why not? (Because I have a functioning brain)<br /><br />I listened to a NPR fresh air podcast interview of the author.  (Ok, maybe I don't have a functioning brain)<br /><br />Essentially this is what the author said in the interview. (Paraphrasing) \\"I used to be a Christian, then I went to college and read some books and now I'm not a Christian anymore.\\"......BARF<br /><br />So what ever he studied in college (The Koran) apparently is more creditable than GOD'S word, The Holy Bible. And has given him the divine intellectual authority to denounce Yeshua. As just another rabble rouser in history......BARF<br /><br />This is a very clear sign, as to the lack of devotion this heretic had in Christ.<br /><br />So if you are a bible believing Christian, I would strongly recommend not buying this apostates book. All he has done is repackaged the disgraceful atheistic argument that Jesus Christ is not the son of God.
159463176X|5.0|Beautifully written novel.  Although there were many moments of real sadness, it was a touching story that sticks with me, causing me to appreciate my own family more.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I could not get this to download on my device first says it is there then says can't play problem with download
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is totally awesome. I wouldn't definitely recommend this game if u love horses. kids would absolutely love it!!!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Repetitive and unrealistic. Author could have gone from book one to book three and saved everyone a lot of time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game Is awesome I can't stop playing the game. It's also cool that it's based on despicable me.the costumes are also really cool.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ending makes me so mad!!! But I loved this series :) I can't wait for the movie. Our another book ;)
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was a wonderful story that made me feel like I was in the tents themselves. This takes a love story beyond star crossed lovers and makes the reader root for them in the beginning. Worth reading every page!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft on pc EPIC minecraft on Xbox awesome now kindle that makes it amazing I I would give this game 100,000,000 thumbs up but I don't have that many thumbs!
159562015X|2.0|Self-help for career and life success can be a good thing but there are better options out there than &#34;StrenghtsFinder 2.0&#34;. When I finished, I felt like something was missing. Then I read and did the exercises in &#34;Lifekeys: Discover Who You Are,&#34; by Kise, Stark, and Hirsh, and I highly recommend it! In this one book you will learn more about your life gifts, spiritual gifts, personality type (ala MBTI), your values, passions, and even write a personal mission statement. If you are serious about uncorvering your talents and finding where you can best put them to use to make your life better, &#34;Lifekeys: Discover Who You Are,&#34; is the one to buy and use.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it from the first page. I love these characters entirely; with their worldly faults they are so innocent and need each other. I hope they will continue to hold onto each other - and get rid of the ex-girlfriend soon - and learn together.<br />It was kind of Gideon Cross goes Christian Grey and I couldn't stop reading it.<br />Tense and exotic, it answered questions from the first book while opening new ones for the next to answer.:Loved it!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It ways a good book review page for all the world or more of us and all its good for us
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game was a great new version of the old game with many new features and especially new towers. I love playing it
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|this game is beautyful :-)  nice work<br />way batter than diamond dash they should put this on Facebook<br />5<br />stars
B001BANK32|5.0|For me this one started a lifelong relationship with a favorite author.  It's an extremely well written book.  Don't miss it
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This is a good app but not always accurate. Just like the weather man on tv it gives a basic idea but always perfect even if it says 90 0/0 chance of rain expect a mostly sunny day
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I enjoyed this game a lot.  It is nice to use the brain.  This game does require some thought. I would recommend this game.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|Clever plot with plenty of twists and no slow spots in the story.  Worth repeat viewing. A good cast helps make it enjoyable.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|If you like Alice in Chains and have been a fan for a while, then you'll love this album. It is as good as their old stuff. Cantrell must have been inspired because just about every song on this album is good. I strongly recommend it!
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Wonderful portrayal of the South and actually helped tie in the book's story of visions of reverting back to the past and then continuing with the story line of  the present.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie and the cultural and history information it contained as well as EXCELLENT casting and entertainment value.  It is so nice to see a movie about &#34;older&#34; people and their feelings.  A GREAT movie and I am delighted I purchased it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Fun to watch with interesting characters. Love that it is also family friendly and I dont have to worry about the kids seeing something they shouldnt
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is one of the only things I use my kindle fire for other than reading and surfing the web. I'm so addicted that I have to check back everyday for new stuff. Get this game if need something new to do.
1423101502|5.0|My daughter loves this series and is saving her money up for the next book as she's almost done reading this one! :)
B004ELSDZK|2.0|Was suppose to spooking and mesmerizing.  Was neither, had no real stradegy for game just click, click.  Uninstalled after !st play.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I need to keep my toddler occupied so I like to have several good movies on hand that he can watch and that the rest of us can also watch without getting too bored. This is definitely one of them. It's hard to go wrong with a Disney Pixar movie but there are some that are better than others. Monsters, Inc and the Toy Story movies are all great as well. This movie has a nice story, good humor, and great picture quality. I tried the 3D and it's also very good as well as it provides additional depth to what the regular 2D version provides. Overall, very happy with the purchase.
B00275EHJG|5.0|My son watches this movie over and over again. He has a lot of the toy characters that he sleeps every night.
B0090SI460|5.0|This is one of the better Disney Pixar movies out there (along with Toy Story series and Finding Nemo). My toddler loves it and adults can watch it as well as it is humorous and has an engaging story. I highkly recommend it!
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Daughter Loves Movie; Monster High Addiction watches it over and over! Will be ordering more in the near future! DVD
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Simple and easy to understand. The exercises were a big help. The price makes it easy to share. Highly recommend.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Following on with series 2 and more of the same. A great series that my wife and I thoroughly enjoy watching. Don't miss it.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|At first I was so pleased with the layout and the ease of use, but as I read on I realized that parts of verses are left out. I don't know why a publisher/app developer/religious person would let this happen. For example, in Proverbs chapter 31 and 30 this Bible app leaves out the origin of where the king is from, which is Massa. I just HATE it. Every other Bible state minor bits of information like what I stated in the former. What a shame, this is how information becomes skewed and vague for future generations!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I stumbled across this series after buying a Samsung Smart TV and used my Amazon Prime account to view the pilot and first episode. I was immediately hooked! The series is great entertainment mixing high-end corporate America with the reality of life in general. The cast is great and the episodes are all intriguing (so far!), funny, witty. I'm not sure how I missed this when it was originally shown but I'm already recording series 3 to watch once I've caught up.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is awesome !!! I love it great graphics and gameplay.  I suggest<br />New weapons though . Also new online battlefields.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|It was a really good movie and made better being in 3D, will watch again, and the grandchildren will love it when they come to visit.
030758836X|4.0|This starts out a little slow.  But you will be rewarded with a good thriller and story, if you stick it out.  I enjoyed the second half of the book much better than the first half.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Like the Lord of the ring series which I have all, this is wondrous also, I am looking forward to the next movie which I will see Boxing Day, then get the DVD when it comes out. WELL DONE
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Very entertaining,  easy to earn credits without paying for them. Have been playing for awhile.  Slightly difficult to first figure out how to play since it doesn't have an attack button.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is one of the best shows I have discovered recently. The story line, cast, graphics, and all are fantastic. This show will keep you coming back with tons of action, twists, and more. You should deffinitly check out a couple episodes. If you like scyfy and aliens you will love this show.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|I got this movie with this silly name without expecting much. I actually thought that it would be a dense, intellectual and hard to watch slow movie.<br /><br />I was fully engaged from the first minute. I hope you will watch it in the same way I did, without knowing anything about it. Therefore, there is nothing else to be said.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have used the weather channel app for years on my Apple products!  And it was one of the first I got on Fire! Loved it but with the newest design, not so much! It's awkward, graphics not good!  And the ads are huge!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My grandson loves this game.  Of course he is more skilled than am I.  But, it keeps him busy and excited.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I thought this last book wasn't as fun to read.  It did tie up things nicely.  Would have liked a little more spice, felt the author just wanted to end it at this time.
0385349947|5.0|Her sheer honesty was very refreshing! Her thoughts are what most women feel. I felt as though I was here in many stages of the book.Thank you Sheryl for providing a fresh outlook and honest point of view. Sheryl SHERYL SHERYL... a new fan!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The characters are real even though some of them are not likeable.<br />The descriptions are poetic and make you see the harsh environment that is Afghanistan.<br />The plot is believable.<br />I will read it again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a great book - I couldn't put it down.  It had me laughing and balling so it was a whirlwind of emotion to read!  I definitely recommend it :)
B003UPPO2G|5.0|It was everything I was hoping for and more.  The Bee Gees were a wonderful group and this Anniversary Edition is  testimony to that fact!!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Action/ comedy/ great story. Nonstop entertainment from start to finish. You dont really need to be a superhero nerd to enjoy this movie.
B0083GOVLW|1.0|Poor, poor little rich girl loses her position of privilege when the shaw's Iran collapses into chaos. This movie is pure self-indulgent pap.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|Classic sounds with newer material. Always great to hear the Boy's in great voice. They continue to evoke good memories
B003FC6WBQ|5.0|Early Hollywood at its best. Fast humor and clever sexual innuendo. Grant at his best and Stewart<br />a real treat.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I<br />Once I started this book I didn't want to put it down.  I couldn't wait to see where the story went.  The ending makes me think there has to be a sequel.  The story flowed so perfectly.  I would recommend this book any day.
B008S2BZ10|3.0|Really like the movie, download, not so good. Never issues with Netflix on download, always hit or miss with Amazon.
B0002HZ18C|5.0|I collect tug models and I am glad to have this for my collection! Just like tugs! Am glad this was back into circulation again! Amazon has a way of bringing things I like out again. Everything about the packaging and shipping, was first class. Hope to see more things I like. That keeps me looking at Amazon.
B008Q07U5O|4.0|Jack at one of his early best. Great sets and attention to detail. And Dunaway looking hot! Take a peak.
B000FA675C|5.0|Very entertaining and informative. keeps you on your toes on wondering on what happens next and want to do your own research on the paintings
B006U1LYP8|2.0|The print is so small I can hardly read it. I have no way of knowing the print size when I order a book. I have my eyes checked and glasses adjusted yearly and I can read it but it is uncomfortable. There should be a way to know when print is going to be so small
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Ok so I am almost finish with entwined with you and was about to purchase reflected in you and now I am upset. I've been reading the reviews and I am not excited about getting this book at all. It is suppose to be a trilogy and I am finding out that there will be five books. That is not a trilogy. Now I am hearing it is being dragged out for no reason which will cost consumers. That is not very professional Ms. Day. She is throwing a whole bunch of nonsense in the book to prolong it. Well if anyone reads this I have a real trilogy that you will enjoy 40 Shades Of Pearl. You will definitely love it. Its by Arianne Richmonde.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This is a very difficult game to master and finally win and the options are confusing and a little difficult to understand.
B005SZAEYO|2.0|i tried to like it.  it\\"s emmy-nominated, after all.  but it\\"s just too strange for me to remain engaged.  different strokes...
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Loved this as much as the first one. Can hardly wait for more to come out. I listen to both quite frequenty. The passion they put into their music is beyond compare!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Would watch it again and again, I loved that it was based on a true story. Inspired me. You'll like it
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|One of those stories that just touches your soul. Neil Gaiman is an absolute master story teller. Will always recommend.
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|I first heard of this via the news and then purchased the 1st book &#34;A Street Cat Named Bob&#34; and loved it, and then read &#34;The World According to Bob&#34; and now this one and all 3 are the best, very inspirational. I hope he writes many more
B004X2M3N8|5.0|love that i can get the seasons thru amazon but didn't realze i cannot watch them on my phone.  I had to wait to watch it on my computer when i could have watched it for free from my cable provider.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|A new twist on an old classic, I enjoyed it. I would watch it again...may be a bit too scary for children under 12
B009R659L8|5.0|Another awesome read. As usual...I couldn't put the book down! She keeps you guessing until the end. Then you say, &#34;I can't believe I have to wait another year before I can have this experience again. Thank you MH Clark ...you never disappoint! :)
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I like it, it was fun and a twist to the original movie. I would watch it again. Good for kids
B004HWYTP4|5.0|One of the movies that most people recomend, can't wait to see the new one, haven't get the chance yet.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|I first heard of this via the news and then purchased the 1st book &#34;A Street Cat Named Bob&#34; and loved it, and then read &#34;Bob, no ordinary cat&#34; and now this one and all 3 are the best, very inspirational. I hope he writes many more
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I grew up to this music and have always had the record album. Thought it would be nice to get it on cd. The product is just what I expected as well.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was a wonderful fantasy full of action. I was in awe of the computer animation - I would watch it again
B000089RV6|5.0|I love this band and the cd. All good songs on it and the quality of the product is just what I expected. Great!
B008ASLK8A|3.0|I would have loved this movie if I could have heard it. There was so much noise in the background I had to strin to hear anything
B000669GAI|3.0|There were only a couple of songs on this cd that I really like but they were the reason for my order. As for the product it was just what I expected.
B008602KQI|5.0|it's about a young girl with survival hunting skills that ends up in a kill or be killed game that the government created to end wars between districts while still trying to keep her humane values by using her head
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it and cant stop playing it. It does have things that you can buy with real money though.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|An ex big city cop living as a small town sheriff ends up dealing with an escaped drug lord cartel trying to get into Mexico as they kill and destroy anything in his way to freedom but didn't expect to run into Arnold. lots of action and some comical situations which makes it a interesting movie.
B00DGN51O8|2.0|Bryan Singer's worse movie. Argh! He is so much better than this! $4.99 I'll never get back. Very good CG though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing. I love everything about it. I wish for the new update of El Macho's Lair to come soon just like in the Google Play store and IOS. :)
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|The sound was spotty and echoing.  The movie video was good.  Love the service but the quality has been sporadic
B009XIXVU6|2.0|It is difficult yo review this book coherently because it doesn't appear that it was written with a unifying plot or theme.  The novel begins with some promise with the sad and wrenching sale of Pari to a woman who suffers in a  dysfunctional marriage. Unfortunately for the young child, her mother is an erratic, and narcissistic woman who seeks happiness in a series of affairs.  Interspersed in this tale, are other stories of unrelated people who happen to be in Afghanistan.  In addition, the timeline jumps about from the '40's to post 9/11, but not in chronological order. This is a book that would have  worked better if it had been broken down into a series of novellas.  The Kite Runner was a magnificent novel with memorable characters and themes of love, guilt, and redemption. This book is  barely memorable two weeks after being read, except as a slight annoyance.
B0071BY084|5.0|Joe Satriani is a Guitar God for sure. I'm luck enought that my daughter has purchased me a Meet & Greet in Sep13 and I can not wait. Lay back lite up and enjoy.
B00CMQX84A|3.0|I'm a mom of two kids and like everyone else, my fam had been looking forward to watching this since its been hyped by Disney for Months! I think Ross Lynch is a cute kid and pretty talented but thought the movie dragged a bit. Dance numbers were very good but the plot in between dragged. Much better than a lot of the Disney tv movies out there but not as good as HSM in my opinion. And seriously, with the budget Disney has, they could have hired a better editor. I cant be the only one who noticed the multitude of obvious inconsistencies and mistakes, for example, the very end when Mac is finally surfing the monster wave and she starts out with her hair down (which Brady comments on), its still down when she's paddling over to the wave, but then its miraculously in a ponytail when she gets up on the board. Little things like that irk me. Anyway, My 6 y/o loved it which must mean something!
0375869026|5.0|This is such a phenomenal read.  It is quick to read and so moving.  It focuses on a young boy named August Pullman and the difficulties he faces with being a child who looks different than other children.  The author grabs you right away and you immediately form a bond with Auggie.  You can feel the love his family has for their son and you are able to read the different perspectives of those whose lives he touched.  I'm going to use this as the first read aloud to my fourth graders.  The book really embraces the fact that everyone has a different story, but if you are kind to one another, wonderful things happen.  SO GOOD!
1781162646|5.0|Good story, quick read!<br />It shows that SK can spin a good story whether or not its a horror or a crime drama.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is application has it all. It is. great for charting and  does everything but water your plants on a hot day. It is loaded with features that a lot of users will never use, but it' not bloated. Everything is functional. A must have for your IPad or Kindle HD.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|very interesting book.  made me wonder more about what really goes on with my teen and how much i truly know about him.  didnt give it 5 stars because it ended so abruptly (kindle).  so i can imagine that theyre implying who the murderer truly was but i like to see it written in black and white.  just for closures sake.  this was a good first purchase on my kindle.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Although there are some parallels to the movie, one need to read the book first. The one on one interview format was a good idea for this type of book. Brooks has written an eye opener that is not all &#34;lets go kill some Zombeys&#34;. He looks at the various nations responses, economic involvement, military response, and finally human response as well. Good book that I whole wholeheartedly recommend.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because of how incredibly short it was. I could barely put my kindle down, the story is so intense and interesting that I was truly sad when it was over. I love Neil Gaiman and I look forward to more stories from him.
B004FOOQV6|5.0|I use this all the time to help me with quick computations where I don't have (or want to take) the time do conversions on paper. Works as advertised.
0345803485|3.0|OK, obviously my review for this book is #20K plus, therefore probably will get lost in the shuffle. But I felt the need to include a fair and impartial review(if there wasn't one here already, sorry I couldn't peruse all 20,000, lol) that doesn't simply pan it as trash and recycle the same complaints every time (i.e. poorly written, isn't an accurate portrayal of the BDSM lifestyle, the sex in general looks like it was written by a twelve year old, etc.) I will try to explain why I feel some of these complaints may be out of context of the story as a whole.<br /><br />So to begin, I'm certainly not going to tell you this is great literature. It definitely isn't, especially when put up against true bestselling authors or standby classics. But it is an easy read designed for wasting some time in a hammock in the back yard on a nice day when you find yourself with nothing else to do. If you go into it from the beginning expecting nothing more than that, I feel you'll probably come out of it with far less strong emotion and vitriol for the story, or for having read it. It's possible to even enjoy it for what it is: pure fluff that may even turn you on a little bit, lol<br /><br />Christian has been described as abusive and violent. I call this overkill. He is a man who needs to be in control, yes. And to that end he often frowns if Anastasia wears a skirt he feels is too short or if she doesn't eat well. BUT he never through the course of any of the books has struck her outside of the BDSM aspect of their relationship. And as is standard (so I understand) with such sexual lifestyles, there are \\"safety words\\" and stopping points where if one partner says stop, the pain stops. He always kept to that. He did not otherwise hit her or even mentally degrade her, so those descriptions of him are simply not true. So don't let the fear that you'll be reading a lot of domestic violence turn you away. Does he need therapy? Probably so, but any four year old who was physically abused as brutally as he was when he was a kid and who was in the same apartment with his mother's dead body for days before anyone discovered them is sure to carry some serious emotional scars. But the experience has not made him a psychotic or even mentally stunted in my opinion. Does he do a bit of stalking of Ana? Well, let's just say he probably loved that Animotion song Obsession in the 80's :) He's infatuated. Highly infatuated. And he's a bit controlling. But he's still not a candidate for a restraining order. He's a fictional character who was written strictly to fulfill a lot of common female fantasies about that \\"knight in shining armor.\\"<br /><br />As an American writer who has written from the point of view of British characters, I was certainly aware of the author's use of British English when she should have brushed up on her American English, and I will say in her defense there are often very subtle differences in language between the British and the American way of speech. So it's understandable that a few words or phrases would slip through the cracks, and while she at least used the word \\"elevator\\" instead of \\"lift,\\" I would think it would also be common enough knowledge that Americans don't tend to use the word \\"bloody\\" in the same context as the British do. The repetition will get to you after awhile and Anastasia will annoy the [holy] crap out of you with her constant mentions of her inner goddess. Now I am not a violent person but after awhile, I wanted to find her inner goddess, unzip her abdomen, remove her large intestine with deliberation, wrap it around her neck and throttle her with it, forever silencing her inner mutterings to her real life alter ego. Just sayin.' I did not overall relate to Ana or her \\"problems\\" and found her to be one of those annoying women who always come out on top and still complain about how her life sucks.<br /><br />Also, while I agree that Ana was definitely sexually naive for a young woman of college age (whilecertainly far from a sexually worldly teenager myself, by the time I was seventeen I at least knew my body pretty well and how to bring myself to orgasm) I was struck by the number of reviews I read here where people thought it was unrealistic or implausible that a twenty-two year old would in fact still be a virgin. Especially a pretty twenty-two year old. I realize that in 2013 we are living in hyper-sexualized times where younger and younger kids are being exposed to far more sex and eroticism than they need to be. But am I that far behind the times or that old-fashioned where there are no twenty-something virgins left in this world unless they were terribly sheltered or are abstaining for religious reasoning? And seriously, even attractive people are sometimes unlucky in the love department. Speaking from my own experience, it's very easy to make it well into your twenties without having sexual intercourse when the guys offering are not that cute Starbucks barista or the intellectually stimulating manager of your company's IT department, but fall more into the category of that guy in the shiny lounge lizard pants and snakeskin boots leering at you from across the bar :) That may also explain why the sex scenes are described as looking like a twelve year old wrote them. I'm a bit disturbed at the idea that anyone believes a twelve year old could, or would, write anything that sexually graphic. Just say you need something a bit more visual in order to be turned on sexually if you didn't like the sex in the story. But don't bring a twelve year old into it because the fantasy around the typical \\"hot rich bachelor sweeps one off her feet\\" didn't do it for you. Again, just sayin.
B0067R0APK|4.0|It has several nice features, is easy to use and set up. With the GPS feature on it automatically updates it's information for the area you are in. Nice feature. I like it and use it often. Took me a little time to get used to the feature package so I downgraded it one star. If you are a whiz with Apple installations, then give the star back.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|This is a great quality performance. Great production of a great concert. Even for viewers who are not John Mayer fans, this is a great video.
B004HWYTP4|2.0|The movie was just OK, but the fact that it kept stopping and reloading was annoying. We did not expect to have to deal with this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Although the content is pretty intense, it is well written and an easy read.  I cant wait to get the second book!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Red was a great flick. The cast was stellar and I don't believe that the comedic action could have been much better.
B005S9EJ14|2.0|I enjoyed this movie BUT was not aware that the format would be with black ribbons making the picture too small on my TV to enjoy...Vendor should have made the format clear before I purchased it. Would not buy from this vendor again ..
B0037KMHRY|4.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting from this album, so it's hard to say whether it lives up to those expectations. When I listen to the album it definitely takes me back to the movie.<br /><br />As a soundtrack album, it naturally features a lot of tracks that sound mostly the same, so it's probably not the best selection for active listening, but it works well for background music during my gaming sessions.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Renegade great white shark vs Roy Scheider, a gizzled fisherman, and Richard Dryfuss in one of his less annoying roles.<br /><br />Let's not hang around waiting for me to tell you the plot since you should have already seen it already. This review is for the Blu Ray + DVD + Digital Copy + Ultraviolet + Etc, etc, copy of Jaws.<br /><br />The blu-ray looks great. Completely cleaned up film ready to roll on your hi-def tv. Kick back and put your feet up on the table like a bastard and chow on some fresh slices while this shark mangles people all day and night. This is a movie. The extra copies of the flick on different formats are a nice touch (except the ultraviolet, get outta here with that nonsense) and for the price that Amazon is slinging this thing I'm saying it's absolutely worth it.<br /><br />Skip the Filet Mignon for lunch and pop this thing into your cart. No need to read anyone else's review, I got you covered.
B007REV4YI|5.0|After Casino Royale, this is one of the best Bond movies ever. Daniel Craig still demostrates he is the best 007 of all. Some sad goodbyes and great flashbacks that will make the fans happy.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Great movie all around. Great for the entire family. SFX were nicely done and the story line, plot, etc. were great
B009ANP48G|4.0|Great 3D movie, great music and the best of coreographies. For a 4th part sequel, is not bad at all!!
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Works perfectly with my Nexus 4 just as described. Streams content and mirrors my phone perfectly. Sound is very good
B008NEMPTO|5.0|I admit this was one of the movies I was not so sure about, but it really amazed me. Good actions sequences, great special effects and some great 3D moments.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Maybe it's because I didn't buy the app when it very first came out, but most of the other reviews don't apply to me. I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD. I get unlimited layers, and all the brushes work correctly. Sometimes I forget to toggle certain settings, so when I switch brushes I have to go back and fix, but it doesn't bother me. There are a LOT of different options! One reviewer was disappointed by the lack of a smudger/stub, but it is possible -albeit difficult- to use the water/blur tool to achieve a similar effect, especially if the lines are thick. I do agree there should be a real smudger though.<br />I have only owned this app for a day, and there's plenty more for me to learn, but so far I think this app is perfect entertainment for creative people and a wonderful studio for the digital artist of any skill level.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|If you didn't have the chance to see all Las Vegas Shows, here you have a recap of the best of each one. Spectacular in every way.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|GREAT FILM WITH OKAY PACKAGING.  SHAME ON DISNEY FOR POOR, POOR MARKETING  ON A GREAT FILM THAT WILL NOT HAVE A SEQUEL.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Great story and colorful animations. 3D was more than expected. All the characters are cure, but The Bunny REALLY ROCKS!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Loved this book - a must read, especially if you are a woman from Philly area who is in their lates 30's early 40's.  I could relate to Tina's childhood as I too experienced many of those things and relate to her now as a working professional with a family.  Of course she is funny and makes for a fun read!
B000QRIGJY|5.0|As usual Michael Connelly has written an excellent book  I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good read
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love this show because it really makes you think. The story lines and characters are complex and interesting. Keep up the good work.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|An engaging story of overcoming hardships and pain and seeking love and acceptance in a harsh world. Very well done
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|THIS UNO GAME IS BLAST AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR EVERYONE. THIS WAY OF PLAYING MAKES EASIER AND THERE IS NO MESS.
B00C32REYI|5.0|Complex, soulful, and a nice helping of smooth bass.  Baby making music. See this guy live if you ever have the chance.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great book can't stop putting it down. It's amazing how well it's written and made it keeps you on edge
0231161166|4.0|Carey introduces the science behind epigenetics well in an easy read, with amusing analogies. The last several chapters can be skipped by those of us who aren't as interested in the drug development possibilities.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Words can't even explain how much I enjoyed reading these books. Different from all other books I've read. The diversity in characters and the unexpected surprises throughout the book. It's a story told well.
B000JIN3J8|3.0|it is not that exciting for the whole movie and the characters are not better than the version in 1995.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Shouldn't have read the book before seeing the movie. It ruined it for me and I love a good Zombie movie. The book was filled with so much detail that the directors simply didin't have time for.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If you are a fan of historical novels, you can't make a mistake when buying this book. It is my 3rd Follett's book I have read so far and definitely not the last one. It is one of his Page-Turners, once you started reading it, it would be difficult to stop. However, the stories of different characters might be a bit confusing at the beginning and I have to get over the feeling that I would rather follow the story of one character for a bit longer than to get to another one. On the other hand, reading a book and esp. when at the beginning, is process of getting to know each other and so I guess many readers might face obstacles before really getting into the story. A perfect choice when travelling or on holiday!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. Ok felt all the emotions and I even cried a little at some parts. I can't wait to read the next one and I recommend this book to all!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|this album is awesome especially the soulfull deep raspy voice of JIMMY BARNES,song no.11. every time i play this cd in my store and this song comes on everybody wants to buy it. &#34;  too much aint enough love&#34;. this is  a remake of the original released in usa in 1988 and the back-up band is JOURNEY,which is awesome with the hot licks of neal schonn[?] on guitar although it to is great, joe bonamassa  sets it on fire. his guitar licks are the hottest,smoothest, soulful blues guitar licks i have ever heard.. 5 stars aint enough to satisfy me.
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|Came very quickly and in perfect condition. And who wouldn't love Derpy? A great little collectible for any fan of MLP.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|a really great cast and high drama. Glenn Close is truly amazing and I like how the series weaves her family in and out.
034580709X|5.0|I had read all the Harry Hole books by Jo Nesbo.  At least all the ones that have been translated into English.  I'm a big fan, so it was a no-brainer that when the first Harry Hole book became available I would get it.  I worried that it might disappoint.  Why else would they have delayed so long in releasing an English language version?<br /><br />Well, it didn't disappoint.  In fact, I'm certain I shall remember one or two of the characters from The Bat long after I've forgotten The Snowman and some of Nesbo's other characters.<br /><br />This is not to say that the book is perfect.  It took a while before I really got caught up in reading it.  Verisimilitude is one of the charisterics of Nesbo's writing which I most appreciate.  He tells it like it is.  No political correctness etc.  However, we meet a key character in the Bat named Andrew Kensington, and I could feel the cold finger of political correctness at the back of my neck as I read about Andrew.  Andrew is an aboriginal Australian, and he is a poliiceman.  He also knows a ton about Norwegian history, including the dates of rather insignificant historical events.  He also loves classical music and gets misty eyed recalling the 2nd movement of some musical piece by Edvard Grieg.  He was also a champion boxer...etc. etc. etc. He was probably also head chef at an exclusive 5-star restaurant in Paris but Nesbo forgot to mention it.  Rather too much to be believed.<br /><br />But once I decided to just accept the possiblity of such a person existing, the Andrew character became quite interesting, possibly outshining Harry Hole himself.  In addition, Nesbo lets the reader in on the history of the Australian Aboriginals and how the Aboriginals were dealt with by the settlers over the years.  It is all quite interesting.  Now and then either Andrew or some other Aboriginal will tell a story from tribal folklore.  You may find the stories interesting, but I found them dull and rather pointless.<br /><br />Eventually, the true Jo Nesbo takes over and the book becomes quite good.  We learn much about Harry Hole that we didn't know from reading the later novels.  This new information is making me want to go back and read some of the later books in the series which I've already read.  Another thing that stands out is how Nesbo develops his characters.  There are maybe forty characters in the book, yet almost all of them have true-to-life character development.  It is really quite amazing.<br /><br />I was going to give the book a 4 star rating because there were things I didn't like, but I realized I was comparing early Nesbo to later Nesbo.  Nesbo is in his own class.  I'm giving the book 5 stars.  Enjoy.
B00B2166BS|4.0|I like everything about this Pogo Cable except the price. I don't understand why it's not much cheaper than $25.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I'm a Fringe fan.  But I am a Science Fiction Fanatic, so my opinion may be a bit biased. Yippee!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|THE STORY CAPTURED ME.  I HATED COMING TO THE END BECUASE I LOVED IT.  THE STORY IS WELL TOLD AND ITS CONVOLUTIONS ARE MADE CLEAR.  A WONDERFUL READ.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait until next season!!<br />The plot has substance - nice for a change in shows nowadays. It's hard to get hooked on a show, but this is like reading a good book you can't put down.
B004GXZ69W|4.0|This mouse works fine in general. The middle button is a little erratic for autoCAD but with each new mouse it is a monumental task to get the buttons to perform the ay you want in CAD so not unexpected. By and large the rest of the buttons worked fine from the beginning. I did download the program that allows you to assign button functions to get it where I wanted. One of the buttons on the first mouse I received was not working but after a few emails back and forth and some tests the manufacturer shipped me a new mouse out the same day. The new one is what is rated here.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It certainly held my attention and I really got into the characters.  One has to wonder whether Wills wife would survive childbirth and whether Will and Alvinia get together.  Would that be too trite and predictable?
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Bad acting + bad story = bad movie.  The Wicked With is an iconic character in cinematic history and deserved a better actress than Jackie from That 70's Show.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|The actors really made the movie worth watching. Humphrey Bogart was superb. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a really great well-acted old movie.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|it does not work...veeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  blurred and grainy, It is totally rn itdisgusting. i want to return it nownowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, why so strick with the numbers of words here
B003JTHWPA|5.0|A touching story about people feeling. They interact, but they find difficult to communicate. Nonetheless at the end everybody will find his in the world.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like this game ok. It is largely mind numbing but it can be fun to kill time on occasion.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|Was really fun at first, but now when I open the app, the Gameloft symbol shows like it usually would, then the game just crashes.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is kind of like temple run in a way but this games is much better!!!! Get this game and u will understand what I am talking about!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely Loved it! Can't wait for the next one and for the movies to come out I'm completely hooked
B000HZEE64|5.0|I decided to watch this late one night and was blown away with both the storyline and acting.  It was a great movie and restored my faith in the possibility of the education system when a teacher or administrator takes a stand against what is the easy way out.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Every morning, I always check to see what the weather would be like to dress approximately. I wish the keep the old app. The new one is a little flashy.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was a great fan of the Sookie stories  - they are a good light and imaginative read.  I was delighted, therefore, when this new one was announced and pre-ordered it without a second thought!!  Maybe it is the book - perhaps it's just me- but this one never really got interesting.  In fact I took it off of my Kindle without getting past the half way mark!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should really buy this game it is so addicting and everyone likes it it is awesome if you get it you wont regret it
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like it but did not find it very usefull so, I deleted it from my tablet. I do not plan to install it again.
0812982622|5.0|&#34;John Doe&#34; became such a sympathetic character, shaped by his environment, but still containing that wonderful combination of self-preservation and the ability to empathize with others.  Loved the book.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|An entertaining series.  Overall the writers are working to keep the series fresh and yet connected.  The acting is good and it is worth a look if you're wondering whether to try it.
159463176X|4.0|Not as inspiring as his first two books, but an excellent read just the same.  The selling of  children to support the family is a world-wide phenomenon that many are not aware of.  The struggles of the people in more remote areas of Afghanistan are highlighted.  His writing is lyrical, and the plot is engaging.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love this show. Its got everything action, adventure, and drama. I count down the days until the new episodes. My only wish is that they had more than 10 episodes a season.
B0089LOG02|4.0|There was nothing about this book that I didn't enjoy!  It was sad, but always had a positive undertone.  Kudos to Christine Baker Kline for a book well written.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Although it is interesting to revisit chronologically the important events during WW2 (as it was in the first book), poor writing gets in the way. The younger sons from the three different families are exactly the same personalities and differ only in name.  I found myself trudging through this most of the time being irritated by the sophomoric writing. It's hard to believe Ken Follett could have written this book.
B001SZ2Y4G|5.0|This movie is one of those rare jewels that can be considered good, clean fun and is just as good now as it was when it was released. Great story, good acting, just schmaltzy enough to make you grin and not make you cringe.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|Was pleasantly surprised, it was funny and touching.<br />I will probably rent again, something I hardly ever do...lol<br />I highly recommend.
B008JFUR10|3.0|Visually, the movie was AMAZING! And, I'm sure, seeing it in one of the finest theaters (and 3D theaters) in the world didn't hurt it any. I mean, this movie is seriously impressive to look at, especially in 3D. There's a lot of holographic imaging involved in piloting the Jaegers (the giant robots), and it looks super cool in 3D since you're seeing it the way the characters are supposedly seeing it. It's certainly a movie that I'm glad I saw in the theater, because a television set just would not do justice to the Jaegers and the Kaijus (giant monsters) fighting amongst skyscrapers and, frequently, knocking them over.<br /><br />So, in short, if you want to see a film with lots of action and fight scenes, especially involving giant combatants, this movie is for you. Seriously, I think it's safe to say that there will not be a better looking film this year.<br /><br />And it leads off with it, too, as we start out right at the first Kaiju attack. The problem is that it's a prologue, and a prologue with voice over, at that. I really don't enjoy that kind of thing in movies. To compound the problem, it was the prologue to the prologue. Yes, the movie had to have two prologues. Just about the time I was allowing myself to get into the movie and be unannoyed by the prologue, we find out that what should have been the beginning of the movie was just another prologue. So, now, we're something like 20 minutes into the film, and the actual movie hasn't even started.<br /><br />That issue with the storytelling ends up being the movie's greatest flaw. Basically, they started what was an epic tale spanning years and skipped to the last battle. There's no emotional connection to any of the characters, no foundation for the arbitrary scientific-sounding crap they fling at you in the same way that chimpanzees fling poo (and, yes, I have a story about that... for another day), and no logic to the things that happen. IF they had started at the beginning of the story or, at least, closer to it, they could have built something more believable. It's kind of too bad, because, like I said, visually amazing.<br /><br />I'm not even going to get into the specific story issues. They are just too numerous to list. In fact, I'm sure I've forgotten most of them. Let's just say this movie is more hole than cheese (Swiss cheese, you know).  I'll sum it up this way: After the movie was over and my friends and I were comparing notes, so to speak, they were all about how great they thought it was. But I wasn't saying much. Not much more than it was amazing to look at, at any rate. And they're used to this from me, to me being the one most likely to not like a movie, but I was really trying not to say anything, but I guess I had this look on my face, because they were all like, \\"What? What was it that you didn't like? Because it was amazing.\\" So I said I would share the one thing I thought was the most stupid (the arbitrary choice to have two pilots because the \\"neural load\\" was too much for one (like I said, there's a lot of scientific-sounding crap flung at the audience to achieve what they wanted in the story, but that \\"neural load\\" crap is just that: crap)), and one of the guys started to respond with \\"but the neural load,\\" and I just kind of looked at him, and he stopped, and, then, all three of them started spewing various stupidities from the movie. And that lasted for something like half an hour, and I never brought up another thing. So, see, all three of these guys that walked out of the theater loving the movie couldn't hold the stupid back once the gate was open, much like the Kaiju gate in the movie.<br /><br />I wish I could say something positive about the acting, but there's nothing there to talk about. No one was horrible, but no one was great, either. Or, even, all that good. It was a 'fest of mediocre. Okay, Charlie Day was good, but he was as good as it got. I mean, Idris Elba was so flat, they had to give him a nose bleed to pass for emotion.<br /><br />The whole movie was like getting a giant present wrapped in the most awesome wrapping ever: glittery paper, bows, a great card, but, when you open it, you find an open package of chewing gum or something. To put it another way: big hat, no cattle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game that all the kids can play.  Wish there was a way to get more gems though.<br />Highly recommend this game.Yup
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I was glued to this book from cover to cover.  Jeffrey Archer has done it again with this spellbinding novel.  I highly recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read all the Bosch and this is a good one. The plot was well developed and I liked the ending. Sometimes mysteries have a great build up and the ending doesn't make sense, not so this time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book had a wonderful storyline.  Everything was well organized to make it an exciting read.  The more I read the most I couldn't stop.  I highly recommend this book.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|This book had me hooked at the very beginning! It was liberating! Being a lady I can understand her personal issues and feelings and that made it all the better
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie is a definitely must see....it was great all around.  Good storyline, was not what I thought it was going to be about at all
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|Not sure how I ended up with this app.  Not even sure what it is about.  Can't really rate it more since I have not used it.
0307271080|5.0|I absolutely LOVE her! She is so ON POINT about a lot of things; middle class in the third world, immigration, class issues, race in America, relationships, sex, love, feminism, pretty much life in general. She has this subtle feminism that's bare and unapologetic, and I love that about her. At the same time, its not overbearing and patronizing. She's very relatable. Her stories are astonishingly real, and that's what makes it so beautiful. There's a boy and a girl, so there is definitely love in the background, but that's not all this book is about. Through the life and experiences of Ifemelu, we see her expose so many truths about life in America. The ending was slightly surprising to me, since Adichie is known for her practical realism, but it was quite wonderful nonetheless. I think the thing I've fallen most in love with is her style of writing; such simple language yet potent language. Her words are like arrows. She speaks such truth through the use of very simple and unassuming words. Yet, the message is beyond clear and well delivered. I can only aspire to write like her one day!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded this, and TRIED it, but both times, it just BOGGED, and would do nothing.  Just kept saying...LOADING.....but never did.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This case fits my Kindle Fire perfectly. It was easy to install and is very sturdy the stand works just like the picture shows and does not slip or collapse when you are using the device.  I would highly recommend this case.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I hAve been wanting to watch this \\"chick flick\\" for a while. I was always out voted by my male family. So instead of watching it alone, I read the book. It was a great summer read and was one of those books that you are sad when you are done because you know it's going to be hard to find another one that good again.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|needed to replace my cable on the Kindle-the outer white shell was starting to crack and show the wire.  This cable is holding up better to charge the Kindle or to download books to it from my laptop
B004J64QSI|5.0|Les Miserables is in a class by itself as entertainment - and this anniversary concert performance is tremendous.  Alfie Boe is fantastic as are all the members of the cast and the encore performances with the present and past cast members is incredible
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love Gideon and Eva's story! I loved the first 2 books and I couldn't wait for this one. Can't wait to see what else happens with them!

B0060FXDCG|5.0|This was a great price and was just what Dad wanted for Father's Day.  He couldn't wait to watch it.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|bruce willis always entertaining supported by actors of world renown.  will definitely watch again when red 2 comes out.  you will definitely enjoy watching this movie
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Cannot think of a thing that I like with this upgrade as compared to prior format.I switched to different app as a result.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is certainly gripping reading, but I found it not as good as the hype. I preferred Divergent and Insurgent to this story for suspense and real plot twists. This did not have that bit of reality that makes a dystopian novel that tiny bit believable. It happens &#34;somewhere&#34; in an apocalyptic future. Divergent is in Chicago. 'nuff said.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like being able to see how much battery I have left by just looking at the battery symbol. I no longer have to tap several times to get to the part of the menu to see the percent. I use it on the 9 inch kindle HD.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Worth a watch but not exactly a movie I would run out and tell people about. It's got real promise with some really great actors, but it seems like no one feels like acting that day. Even Tommy Lee Jones feels like he is annoyed to recite his lines and half asleep. There is no emphasis or excitement in any of these characters acting. I now know why this went straight to video. Two of musics greatest contributors are in this...Buddy Guy and Levon Helm. Not sure why it was necessary to put them in this movie but Buddy Guy's acting was just aweful. Levon Helm seemed liked he was trying too hard and still failed. Yet the movie is somewhat entertaining with a really weird twist at the end. This is a movie that you could at least watch once
B00BCSBU4E|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. How good to see a photograph of Dr. Fred Hamel at the beginning of the booklet: an act of justice and gratitude. Great to get some CD's that one has already on vinyl (with wear and tear!) Every lover of ancient music should grasp this opportunity! Nothing is wrong with having a different interpretation of works like Monteverdi's Vespers, the Messiah, the Goldberg Variations, Brandenburg Concerto's... And many discoveries, to be honest. And the contents of pp. 190-195 of the booklet, with the recording data of all the CD's: these make this collection really perfect. Thank you, Archiv Produktion, and continue your good job.<br /><br />Hans van de Wouw, Sales de Llierca, Girona
0679308504|5.0|The book was in excellent condition. No dog-earred pages nor tears, and it was a great read! Thanks for the transaction!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Just incredible. Read it in one night because I did not want to put it down!! So emotional and makes your heart ache for both Hannah and Clay. A book for everyone. Thank you for writing this.

B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Season 2 is a done deal and I will eagerly await more if the stories are as good as these are.
B00CHRBA12|4.0|I have a lot of Allman Brothers albums in my collection but, for some reason, I never bought &#34;Brothers and Sisters.&#34;  I guess I was waiting to see what would happen with the band after Duane Allman's untimely death - even though I've always loved &#34;Wasted Words,&#34; &#34;Ramblin' Man,&#34; and &#34;Jessica.&#34;  (Chuck Leavell's piano solo in Jessica is still the best rock piano solo of all time.)  Anyhow, there was a lull in my purchases back then and by the time I seriously considered buying the album, the key cuts were on other compilation albums that I owned.  So, what lured me into buying the 40th Anniversary Deluxe Edition?  I was curious about an entire CD of rehearsals, instrumental out-takes and a studio jam.  My conclusion: Rehearsals and out-takes aren't as good as the final recorded versions (no surprise there), but they provide a vision of what it might have been like to just sit in the room while the band practiced and refined its songs.  It's kind of cool.  This band was always able to find a groove and run with it.  That is evident on the &#34;bonus&#34; CD.  And I re-discovered how much I like &#34;Come and Go Blues&#34; - and the groove the band found for that song.  Not a five-star experience, but worth the investment, nonetheless.
B004T32SOK|4.0|Box is convenient for my use and fills my need for Cloud storage. Having the free storage is a plus.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I really liked most of this book with the exception of the ending.  All the information about esoteric topics and symbology was truly fascinating.  The action was fun and fast paced.  The author provides several well crafted points of suspense and surprises.  My only complaint is that I felt that the ending is boring and quite a let down.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is an hilariously creative film that completely restored my faith in the whole subgenre of horror-comedy--it's more of the latter, of course. While obviously nothing to be taken too seriously, this film does have a solid, cohesive plot-line with some nice surprises. The Sabbat scene is particularly worthy of mention. Expert filming and settings, makeup, eclectic soundtrack, and intentionally stupid but nonetheless lively script. Great props too--love the automatic crossbows and blunderbusses. While it could have gone a little farther in such areas, it makes some interesting revelations concerning Hansel and Gretel's familiar past, adding some interesting elaborations to the Grimm Bros' original tale as well as the entire mythos regarding \\"medieval\\" witches. While this film is mostly its own original self, the borrowings and bits of spoof on WIZARD of OZ, BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, KING KONG, RED DAWN, and a score of others really add something to the mix.
B009G78EE2|5.0|What can I say, I liked the few tracks I heard on the radio and thought that macklemore was pretty decent, so I went ahead and bought the cd and was completely caught off guard and macklemore went from decent to creative genius.  The album is ridiculously full of creative talent and so much potential. I gotta give it to him the dude can rhyme. The beats a strong.  The tracks a strong and there are just no fillers here, the tracks are strong from first too last. Great buy.

B0067R0APK|5.0|This is a great go to weather app for both when you are on the fly or at home. We used it on a two week road trip to help anticipate weather conditions along the way and it was most helpful. I also use it at home to compare with the local weather forecasts and to monitor weather conditions of loved ones who live around the country.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|Ever since I read TDKR paperback I wanted to see it either as live action or animation. But it HAD to be either anime or the WB Animation Studios for it to work. This mixes both styles and the result is amazing. Stop reading and just order ir and enjoy it. Also, you wanna buy it on disc, since you will definitely want to watch it again and again and show your friends.

B0094M4R3Q|5.0|A modern day classic in every sense. All the actors flt in their roles perfectly, very well cast. Great, must own soundtrack.
B00000DGUG|5.0|The follow up to the 35-million copies sold success of Jagged Little Pill. Alanis flees to India to escape the immediate jolt into fame. There,  insight grows and we learn life isn't what it seems. Supposed excites the listener to step outside themselves and live a life of neutrality. In other words, this album, a cult classic.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Beautifully written novel about the subject of Alzherimer's Disease from the viewpoint of the afflicted person as well as her family.<br />Very enlightening and heartbreaking as well as inspiring.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|this book just could not hold my interest and was slow reading for sure.  I confess I read just under half and gave up.  It just takes too long to bring all the locales and characters together.  Not enough heart in the beginning too cold, Unlike the movie which gets you to care about Brad Pitt's character immediately.  I would like to respectfully return the book to Kindle for a refund.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|I remember this movie from a long time ago, that is why I bought it, it is just how I remembered it . 5 stars

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My husband and I live this game. We also play with our 2 year old. He loves it. I would recommend this game to anyone!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters, and since owning the dvd I have seen it over 3 times. So I figured, why not do a review?<br /><br />Casino Royale revamped my faith in James Bond. Die another Day was ok, but Pierce Brosnan was losing his step a bit. Alas, a man by the name of Daniel Craig took the reigns and ever since 2006, he has fit the suit and persona quite well.<br /><br />Skyfall stars Daniel Craig as Mr.007 himself, Judi Dench reprising her role as M, and Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner. We also have a strong cast of newcomers that include: Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, Naomie Harris as Eve, Berenice Marhole as the beautiful Severine, and finally Javeer Bardem as the villian Silva. The cast was great; Javeer Bardeem was very convincing in his role.<br /><br />The Story line is what you would expect from a GOOD Bond movie. Although the film itself deals with issues such as Bond losing his focus and having to regain his composure and mentality to become Bond again, there is a lot of suspense, really nice action, and oh yes, very BEAUTIFUL women.<br /><br />So overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Skyfall from start to finish. I really enjoyed the opening sequence where Adele sings her song for the film appropriately titled: Skyfall. Great cast, good story, a lot of action, and more importantly, Skyfall is James Bond as he is meant to be. Sam Mendes did a marvelous job directing this movie.<br /><br />I do want to mention that I have been hearing rumors that once Daniel Craig's contract is up, that it is possible that Idris Elba(fantastic actor by the way) will be taking the reigns as the new 007. Even if that does happen, I have a strong feeling that Daniel Craig will continue to take James Bond in the right direction, and furthermore, we can expect even better things to come in the forseeable future.<br /><br />9.5/10
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This was far more enjoyable than I expected.  It's an action filled plot with a couple of (semi-cheesy, but good) love stories between characters.  There are definitely a few laughs in there too.  I like that they paid respect to the older generation of actors because they've most certainly still got their stuff.  If I look 1/4 as good as Helen Mirren when I reach her age, I'll know I have succeeded in maintaining my appearance.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I saw one of the songs from this album being performed on TV and had to have it.  I was not disappointed with the album, great songs.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|As usual Follett delivers entertainment and information simultaneously  I could not put the book down.  I am waiting impatiently for volume three.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|This movie was actually very creepy and is the perfect haunted house/ghost story movie. It gave me chills, and made my date grab tight on my arm. It was very believable that it took place in the 1970's. Other movies that take place in the 70's tend to over-do that. When Carolyn and Roger Perron move into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island with their five daughters, they begin to have paranormal occurrences in the house from shadow people to clocks stopping to being pulled by a ghost. They hire Ed and Lorraine Warren to investigate. They soon must deal with the house and the possession of Carolyn. I would compare this film to the original 'Amityville Horror' If you want a great horror flick to actually scare you, I highly recommend THE CONJURING!!!
1933952806|5.0|Got it when I bought my D7000.  Helped a lot.  Advise how to set all the stuff AND why the author made the choice.  Rockwell's website covers most of the same with a little less detail, and a lot less pictures.

B008XX6J4C|2.0|I did not like this CD.  It was not what I expected.  The music was strictly noisy chords, typically like Yanni.  There was no quality music.  One could not recognize the tunes they played.  Sooo disappointing!  I could not in good faith recommend this CD to any true piano music lover.  Thank you, Carol F. Raines
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is my favorite game of all time. It has different levels of challenges. Although I would like to be able to win more of the game than I lose. I assume that's where our talents and intelligence lies, in knowing just where to place the cards where they would help the most..
B00C33M2EE|2.0|I did not lie this CD.  It was very reminiscent of Yanni who played the same cords over and over.  I suppose I expected something more polished and distinctive..................if you will, a true rendition of pieces of quality piano music.  I, in good faith, could not recommend this music to true piano  music lovers.  Thank you so much.  Carol F. Raines

B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This app is the most helpful weather channel I could find in the app store!

B00DHNBPA6|3.0|Television previews hyped it up so much, the previews terrified me more than the actual movie. Not what I expected, movie was all over the place and made no sense. Movie often lost connection.

1878424319|2.0|This book sounds so good and really draws you in but the substance soon fades. I found the book very interesting through the first 1/2 of the book but then it really starts to disintegrate. The 4 Agreements soon lead to Kumbaya moments.  He tried to take this book to far.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love playing the Dragon Story game.  The only thing I would change is how much gold it cost for the dragons it cost to much since you only get 3 pieces of gold a day and also how hard it breed a certain dragon you want.  I keep getting the same fruitful dragon no matter how many times I breed different kinds of dragons I breed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Everyone said, \\"You must read 'Gone Girl,' it's incredible!\\" After delaying for months, I finally purchased this book to see what the hype was about. It's an incredibly intricate tale woven through first-person accounts of both characters. The plot curves more than Mulholland Drive and you're constantly thinking \\"What?!\\" and \\"Nooo...she didn't!\\" as the story progresses.<br /><br />Most people finish the story saying \\"I have never hated two characters more in my life.\\" I agree in some senses but feel like I relate. Both characters have serious flaws. And the whole premise of the book is horrific. However, deep down, both Nick and Amy demonstrate real characteristics that I can see myself or people I know possessing. Maybe not to that extreme. But I'm sure everyone has felt desperate enough in a very personal and emotional situation that they do something stupid. And then they feel a bond to that other person afterwards. It's all very complicated and I recommend reading to fully understand. It's a great book that all types of readers will enjoy, and there are plenty of people to talk about it with! Definitely worth a read.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat. Not many books keep my interest like this one did. I REALLY could not put it down. I was pulling for Jake the whole time. Excellent book.
B004LPLU4K|3.0|A charming story of upper class children finding purpose, love, and growing into a positive understanding about themselves. Still, the divide between upper class and lower class remains.
0446572993|4.0|Pulls the reader in from the start and keeps them there till the end.  A few lapses slows down the pace, but those are just minor hiccups to the overall story line.  One of David Baldacci's best novels of late.  Highly recommend this one.

B001AMNL2Q|5.0|I remember watching this the day I left for USMC boot camp...I started getting nervous.<br />  I know excatly where all the boot camp scenes are filmed which makes the movie better for me.<br />The second part of the film when they get to Vietnam i feel was a bit rushed but I suppose the emphasis was supposed to be on the training aspect.<br />Great film and a favorite with both active military and veterans alike
B008WOULPK|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a while. I bought the E-version so I could read it at the beach and the hardcover because the book is so stunning in person and her drawings are fantastic. Anyone who does not LOVE the book is a dingdong.
B005DD7MH8|5.0|I really liked this fast paced action fantasy. The moral to the story that I gleaned was that no matter what man tries to do to climb the ladder of success, there are pitfalls, whether there are or are not drugs involved. Would it be nice to be superman? It would scare the daylights out of anyone. Do I want that kind of life? I seriously doubt it would make me a better human being. Cooper became a monster of his own imagination... then the monster took over, and to what end. Very good movie.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|My son has been watching this movie over and over since he saw Despicable Me 2 and got 2 minion plushes from his aunt.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is a great book.  I started reading the series and absolutely love it.  Have characters that I love and hate.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Simple. Fun. Worth breezing through I thought. You won't find yourself laughing at clever similes or .. Looking many words up (unless you are in 6th grade and younger) but you will find yourself stressed and cheering all along the way.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I started reading the Wheel of Time series when I was a freshman in college back in 1990.  I have had an on-again-off-again love affair with the series over the last 23 years.  I was all good at the first battle of Falme when Mat blew the Horn of Valere.  I hit the wall after book seven and just about abandoned the Light for the Shadow by the end of book ten.  I was saddened at Jodan's passing and feared the series would die with him.  How could anyone pick up the complex mantle he had woven like an Ogier Tree Singing (okay, enough of the WoT cliches :0).  Brandon breathed new life into the last books while keeping things true to the initial vision.  I was very pleased with this book.  There was pain and suffering fit for the Last Battle, but also hope, perseverance, and greatness as well.  If you've read any of the books, you gotta finish it out.  As much as I'm glad it's finally over, I will begrudgingly admit, I wish there was but one more story to look forward to.  However, the wheel weaves as the wheel does and if the Pattern permits it, perhaps we'll hear a new song sung.  Loial still owes us.  (ok, so much for the cliches).
B003G4W49C|5.0|Regardless of your desired genre, ender's game will be one of those timeless masterpieces that ours kids' kids' kids will be required to read - the difference is, they will enjoy their required reading.
0399224459|5.0|We had to read this book several times every night for a week while we visited our 2 1/2 year old granddaughter.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|We learn so much more about ender and his life while being introduced to foreign languages and cultures as OSC likes to do. Loved this book. Jane is OP.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I bought this cable after my first charger for my kindle fire started working only sporadically. Then, it started with this one, with less than one month's use. What a bummer! Very, very frustrating.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Some fun short stories on the histories of companies, people, and products but like many books of this 'genre' I found it hard to actually finish the last 15-25%.
B00782O7IY|5.0|Good story. Very entertaining film. Great acting. Jean Du Jardin is fabulous!<br />His facial expressions are amazing. He and his leading lady are great tap dancers as well.<br />This film is proof that silent movies can still entertain and impress audiences.
B002361MLA|5.0|Best book I ever read :) It truly was a guide to spiritual enlightenment :) I recommend it strongly for anyone who is one the path of spiritual enlightenment or who is simply looking for a change to take place in their lives.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have been wait for this book for years. I started reading this series many years ago and waited quite a long time for this book. I can honestly say the book was worth the wait.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|Wonderful sweet and gentle. Just like real sheep. We love this series and it is a must have for all new moms and dads. Along with Charlie and Lola, this series is perfect.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The way this author writes her books keeps me reading and reading and reading! I have a hard time putting them down and I get so &#34;involved&#34; in the book I feel As if I'm really there! She can write and tell a story as if its actually happening! I hate that this is going to end and I know I'm going to have to return to reality!
1423136802|5.0|I bought these books for my son. I am very pleased with this book set. I get to watch him read in silence and when he is finished with the books I will read them. Great price
B00867GJYK|5.0|I bought this theoretically for the grand kids to watch, but I was the first one to enjoy it. With a new blu-ray player, I figured what better movie to test it out.
B005K17RU0|3.0|The new update takes longer to load each time it is opened, has smaller print, is visually disorganized, and has less impressive graphics.  The previous version was much more user friendly, and deserved five stars.

B004SIIBGU|1.0|Not too much to say about this terrible app, the Classic eBay is just far superior to this chessy, horrible, lousy app.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I tested the product before I put my phone in and it worked. I haven't tested it with my phone in it because I don't want to take any chances. I use it for a just in case purpose. I will say that you can not hear very well with it on.
B008XGW1CI|2.0|While I appreciate the author's attention to detail; I found this book to be filled with stereotypical characters which I tried to care about, but in the end just could not. It was chore to get through the first third of the book. As an avid reader, I've been re-reading Shakespeare, Melville, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy so the previous statement holds some weight.
0316227706|5.0|Got this book for our office waiting room. The patients love to look through it. Book came brand new and on time.
B002PNAY9C|4.0|My initial response after finishing this book was that it was Epic. I'm not saying it was the best book I've ever read, but there was so much that occurred in this book that one could only categorize it as epic.<br /><br />I quickly realized as I read this story that I would need to take some notes if I was to be able to review this story adequately. My memory is pretty good, but there were certain pieces to the story I wanted to ensure I remembered and I knew I wouldn't remember if I relied upon myself.<br /><br />The beginning of the story jumped right into an immense battle of extreme importance. Watch for the death of a key character by an unexpected set of villains during The Battle of the Burning Plains. This battle begins much of the remainder of the story. Many other authors might have simply saved this battle for near the end of their story and focused much of their attention on building towards it. I liked the confidence Paolini had in his story to throw such a great battle near the beginning.<br /><br />Shortly after the Battle of the Burning Plains we jump right into Roran and his attempt to rescue his true love Katrina from the Ra'zac. This, along with The Battle of the Burning Plains was so enthralling and came so quickly in the book. It was refreshing to have so much action so quickly.<br /><br />After this, I noted that the book started to droll on a bit. One can't expect to be on the edge of their seat forever I guess. It took until about page 300 to get back into some real action which by this time was much appreciated. The other thing that bugged me was the the seemingly new style of narrative from the Saphira. Paolini had her speaking in very choppy hyphenated speak which was truly odd. I don't remember it being in the first two books this style of speech that the dragon takes on. To me, it was distracting and there wasn't any real explanation as to why she had begun speaking like this.<br /><br />I enjoyed the moment Eragon is tasked with replacing Zar'roc for reasons you will find out in The Battle of the Burning Plains section of the book. He is forced to choose a dwarf made sword which of course doesn't suit him very well. Eragon must alter the way he fights because of the lower quality weapon.<br /><br />The portion of the story I was most impressed with, however, was when Eragon receives his own sword, made for him. This, in my opinion, was fantasy writing at its absolute best. Paolini wove a beautiful story that recounts the actual forging of the sword along with the most unique method for performing the feat which in my opinion will go down as the most creative piece of fantasy story telling I've experienced thus far. It is truly difficult in this saturated Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre to come up with something truly unique and I feel Paolini did so magnificently with this portion of the story.<br /><br />I'm still debating if I would consider this the best of the 3 of the Eragon books I've read thus far. It is definitely very close to the best. Even the lull in action was more than forgivable and some of which was explained later in the story to give reason to the need for the details. I would highly recommend reading this book (read the first 2 before of course).
0805047905|5.0|This book is great. Came brand new and on time. We are using it in our office waiting room and the kids love it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It's a good game. It's a lot like other Gameloft games,  you have to build a village and help the people in it survive. The bad thing is that you have energy, and if you run out, you're just stuck. You can't do anything. Other than that it's a really fun way to learn history. I also like how you can choose to be the &quot;Ma&quot; or &quot;Pa&quot; avatars. I highly recommend this game!
0399226907|5.0|This book is great. Came brand new and on time. We are using it in our office waiting room and the kids love it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Read it and believed it made sense and was worth trying.  After 3 plus weeks, I generally feel better in my belly, have had a major decrease in aches and pains, and believe it is beginning to have a positive effect on reducing neuropathy pain.  I have few cravings for wheat, which I have reduced by 90%. I am 73 years old, still active & optimistic, and delighted with progress to date.  I intend to continue and give it a trial over at least 6months. P.S. I still eat delicious meals, and have become a great fan of roasted & grilled vegetables( with smaller portions of beef, chicken & fish). An occasional cocktail is perfectly allowable and is welcome!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book have never heard anyone that thought otherwise. Recommended to anyone. You can not put it down once you start.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|The first time I ever ordered from Amazon was for this album.  My husband and I were living in a small trailer in our backyard after Hurricane Katrina and this album would help us forget our problems for a while and dance again!
B006O5XYWG|5.0|This is a good movie and does a good job as a prequal to the original planet of the apes and showed how that came to be
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This film has some good things going for it.  Most of the characters are well thought out and excellently portrayed, especially the core family (Rudd, Mann and the Apatow Girls)  The quality of acting was excellent, but the quantity was too much for a single release. GOOD film; too drawn out to be GREAT... It begins to drag on in the middle which made my wife an I feel like it would work better as episodic TV series.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great fun, great graphics and very addictive!! I have since tried temple run which is also fantastic. Very impressed with this essentially free game.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is epic. People should get this game. Oz is also a great movie to watch. So if you watch the movie you need to get the Oz temple run game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really great for teaching my daughter about horses.  She loves the game as well as me. The graphics are amazing.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Another great book, but the ending really snuck up on me! I am looking forward to more from Sylvia Day.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I liked the fantasy story line of witches, vampires and daemons, but also the rich descriptions about the work and science of the characters. Great characters, lots of imagination and well written.
B0046MOV8U|2.0|Toronto!  We were polite tomyo!  you were not. Taking yourself for a Queen??? Really ??? Not mine for sure nor musically or in showmanship ! but rather as a strip club cheap dancer within a group ofstrippers ... I am so glad my 15 and 16 year old did not see you pushing your ass into people's faces! Toronto was silent in front of your  gross unattractive vulgar tribal behaviors which no one I know cares to be part of! ! Beyonce... Really????  Thanks for making women's advancement.... I felt uncomfortable from the start and there is nothing wrong with ME!  I paid and spent my resources believing in your respect for Music.... Instead I got smelly stripping females... And I am not into women!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James Altucher is a truly wonderful man. Enormously smart, yet so down to earth. I think James wrote the book on the topic of Self Deprecation -- he'll make you laugh out loud at least 50 times doing so in this great read. James is tremendously humble, very authentic, and a great storyteller. You'll read this and find yourself wanting to hug and thank him -- he's truly \\"one of us.\\"<br /><br />The beauty of this book is that James IS this book. He HAS chosen himself. He does choose himself each day, and he teaches us how to do the same.  James has been to the very bottom (i.e. his blog post on \\"I want to die\\" is #1 on Google), and he's climbed back to the very top -- building successful businesses (although he's failed at most) and becoming a popular blogger, writer and more. This book is a great read for anyone simply open to improving themselves.<br /><br />The book is very conversational and a joy to read. It's like James is literally speaking to all of us-- the audiobook on Audible.com is even better for this reason. I've read almost all the self help and entrepreneurial books out there by now -- Choose Yourself is definitely one I plan to read again, again, and again... and possibly even incorporate a chapter into each Daily Practice.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I wanted another game for my new Kindle, but wasn't sure what to pick. I have Angry Birds on my home computer so I thought this was a great choice. The sounds of the game are fun, along with the diferent levels. Its a fun game and I can add different levels with I'm finished with this group.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|I noticed how popular this book was in the young adult genre and I thought it would be a sure thing for me. I tend to read a lot of young adult and have been on quite the dystopia kick lately. I didn't hate the book and I didn't necessarily dislike it but I guess I just couldn't get into it. I felt like someone was telling me a story but I didn't get that \\"living the story inside my head\\" feeling while I was reading it. I didn't quite connect. Actually, I was tempted to put it down due to loss of interest but I kept reading due to the popularity. I figured that it must get better. It did pick up steam at the thirty percent mark but it just didn't do it for me. The main character has tons of questions that nobody answers which leaves the reader with basically no information either. Maybe the author was going for suspense but it was just annoying. I do feel that The Maze Runner was written for a younger audience than I. A positive is that while I often feel that boys don't have a lot of options in the young adult/dystopia genre, I do think that this would be right up a boy's alley. The protagonist is a male teen along with almost all of the characters. Some of the dialogue is very boyish, taking verbal jabs at one another and talking about farting. But even so, this is a group of boys who are in a survival situation and have to make some tough life and death decisions. The ending definitely leaves readers excited for the sequel; however, I think I'll stop at this one. Note: The Maze Runner is being made into a movie (Feb 2014). Dispite how I felt about my reading experience, I do plan to watch it. I think with the right special effects it can be a fun experience.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My wife is in to Gresham and any other courtroom drama movies/TV and thoroughly enjoys Suits.  I see enough of the knife-in-the-back atmosphere at work, so I am not as fond of it, but I admit it could be worse.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I Love this game it's like a combination of subway suffers and temple run with a despicable twist it's amazing totally worth ten stars instead of five
B000ICZD5M|5.0|Well, Rocky-Horror might be better. David Lynch is a master of Dieselpunk + Camp. Make sure you read the book first, or the movie will make absolutely no sense whatsoever...
B00280LYIM|4.0|My 10 yr old granddaughter loves this series. I bought the Kindle version for her to read on a family vacation when she realized she had forgotten her book bag.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Why had I never seen this movie?  I don't know, but now that I have I'm glad.  A classic narrated tale.  Great for the whole family.
B004C03L4G|5.0|I've been finding wisdom, reassurance and guidance in this wonderful book daily since 2007 and was pleased to add it to my Kindle book list. I use the hardcover version in morning meditations and am continually amazed at how the message for that day is often exactly what I needed to  hear..I mean exactly!! It's uncanny.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a great game for kindle fire. No issues at all. I have been a big fish games fan for  years and did not know that they had games the kindle. I think 2.99 is a very fair price for excellent big fish games. I also like that it says that it is the full game so when you buy a game you are not surprised by the game suddenly stopping saying to purchase more of a game you thought you  paid for all ready. This is my first review however i do read reviews before buying/downloading games and all are helpful. Thank you big fish for having wonderful kindle full games without hidden costs!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Have a 8 year old grandson and a five year old grandson. I got this game while I was babysitting the boys plus their 15 month old cousin who was taking a nap. The older boys played the game so the youngest was able to take a nap. Both boys enjoyed the game a lot.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I wish there were more options like with color, patterns, and frames but I do love it (:<br />It's one of the best editor apps I've found on kindle so far!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is so well written, directed and acted that we are addicted even to the reruns! If you have not yet discovered this gem - get with it!
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|After I beat the game I ran out of money and out of ammo and had noting to do at least have after mission so you can get money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazing game so much fun both my 2 1/2 n 1 1/2 yr olds luv it I am addicted to this game
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|It was a good story overall but had too many details. It's appropriate for grades 4-8, and very fun to read too. Consider reading!
B0090X4GJE|5.0|Love her! She has the best voice and powerful lyrics. Some fun songs, some serious and some just downright meaningful!
B006FE83UE|5.0|I have a first edition copy of the book and a VHS copy (very old) of this marvelous story.  My great nieces had to watch the movie as part of a class their school's American/English Lit. dept. was teaching, They were moved by the strong loving father who fought racism in his own thoughtful, heartfelt calm way and came out of that class with an understanding of life's injustices and humanities illogical hates and foibles. This is a movie that every man, woman and child in the U.S. should watch and, if we're lucky, everyone who does see it will be changed for the better.  Gregory Peckl said that this was the one movie of which he was very proud and humbled to have been in; I'd say that in itself is a helluva recommendation.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I enjoyed all the Hobbit/Lord of the Rings series. The acting was good, but this story line was very disappointing.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Lovely and heart breaking. The narration by Death itself gives this book an interesting and different perspective. I laughed, cried and recommend this one to all lovers of great stories.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|A truly great movie albeit a little disturbing. The book makes a great read as well. Way better then other books made into movies.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The book was better.The dialogue between the heroine and her boyfriend was excellent.<br />I would definitely recommend you read the book AFTER you see the movie.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Fantastic film, I will watch over couple of times in order to digest the messages and possibilities that this film approaches.<br />Eternal love and the re-practicing of not yet learned lessons.<br />If you are that old or like classic films, you notice that the \\"concentrated meals\\" idea has been alluded to in several other films.<br />The Matrix, Soylent Green, and others I'm sure. Ugh!.<br />Nevertheless I enjoyed the film tremendously.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a movie that should be seen by every young couple expecting their first child, or for that matter, everyone who is in any way connected with young people and their children. A fantastic movie with a fantastic message.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|i think this is a good game it gets addictive once you first play it i like this game because its different to others
030759565X|5.0|Gave this to my sister for a gift (she had specifically requested it); she loves all things cooking and baking. She loves it. 'Nuff said.
B00CGPPMKU|1.0|Ok i bought it, expected it to be on my phone and it is and was nowhere to be found. WTF.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|Sanderson has developed an interesting and novel magic system and mythos with his Allomancers and the world of the Final Empire.  With a few exceptions the characters are well developed and sympathetic.  The story is engaging and kept me reading through to the final page.  I recommend it it for any fantasy fan.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like the app. But miss the old one where i would get the written forecasts. I do love the videos because i can watch them on my Kindle Fire.
B008J34466|5.0|Cannot stop playing this, really enjoy it. Great driving music. Had never really listened to Pink before, recommended by a friend
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|I enjoyed the whole season. better than season 1. I watched it all in one weekend. really good show. just wish that season three was out.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|There has always been influences and status of political possition as pointed out in the book. I like the  way these ideas are presented in the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game.I'm a huge fan of anything that is about despicable me.I think anyone would like this well love it actually.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|reminds me of temple run minion style!  cant get enough of the game!  great for those times when you have too much time to kill and don't know what to do. this app can be played for hours on end without ever getting boring!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like using notebooks to collect and organize what is on my mind.  A great way to collect lists that you want to keep.  (e.g. vacation lists, school supplies, address book)  Next year I can see what I listed this year.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|I could not wait to get my hands on this book. I went straight to the book store because I could not wait on Amazon to deliver. Boy was I disappointed. The book starts with a wonderful narrative about childhood love between siblings but a quarter way into the book it all went downhill with the introduction of tangential characters whose development did not develop the main narrative of the story in any way. I kept reading hoping it would get better and hoping for a resolution  which never came. I wish I could get back the hours of my life I wasted reading this novel.
B000FCK9D6|5.0|Author eliminated unnecessary dialogue (I followed along w/English version on Kindle).  This is the third Agatha Christie I have read in Spanish.  I read for an hour while walking on the treadmill, so I've 'used' the book for two/three weeks.  I wish more Agatha Christie in Spanish were available on Kindle since it is easier to use the dictionary function than running on a treadmill and thumbing through a dictionary.  Nonetheless, I can't wait to start Matar es Facil!
B005PK56TA|4.0|I love the concept for this show. Some of the subject matter is a bit much for regular tv though. I would hate to think young children were watching it.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Works as advertised. Easy to use. Setting app up was very easy to do. I have had no problems or crashes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game because it was very challenging and it was a good game for me and my Grampy to play
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I liked his first two books better for sure, that being said....This book was  beautiful. His characters were rich and believable. A book about family and the ties that bind.
B000WTXD30|3.0|I (unfortunately) ignored those who posted about the sound quality as my ear is not that finely tuned, small distortions escape me. Song selection is okay for me as I am not familiar with all of Sir Elton's catalog. But even I can tell that the sound is not up to snuff. I am going to see E. J.'s The Red Piano concert in Vegas in September, might buy something better afterwards but this will do for now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is the most thrilling and intriguing book I have ever read. Katniss, along with her opponents, have such detailed personalities that It feels like you know them! The dramatic plot makes the book  unlike any other. Hooray for Collins!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|After purchasing DOTP 2014 for my xbox I couldn't get enough of it. The android version satisfies my desire for magic on the go with superb visuals, in depth game play and unlockables, exactly like the console counterpart. Highly recommended to newbies and pros alike
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I had a positive experience with my previous MarWare case for original Kindle Fire, so ordered this for my new Fire HD 7\\" with little research.  I am disappointed and will probably return it.<br /><br />I use the standing feature to read in bed.  As I toss and turn, I need to be able to adjust the viewing angle.  Because of the design creating very limited contact area between the plastic holder and the flat surface, there is little friction to hold the Kindle in place.  The tiniest bump (at kitty brushing by, etc.) will cause the Kindle to fall down flat.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|This is a great game. I love it. you face challenges that you need to try it again and again to win and its not hard to buy stuff
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I love the movie.  I have watched it numerous times.  So I decided to buy the book.  I love it too.  I will be reading it again.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Joe,<br />Is one if the best kept secrets.<br />Great Guitar & Vocals.<br />His Guitar playing is unmatched. Lenny Castro is a great addition too.
B000FC130E|5.0|This was a good introduction to Neil Caiman. I've been wanting to read some of his books after seeing some  of his Dr who stories. Enjoyable and a fast read
0670014893|5.0|Another meticulous thriller by JlC to happily occupy you. He develops his characters thoroughly to the point you can swear you know them. You will understand why they are acting, and how they made decisions. And you'll appreciate the ending too. Another keeper from JlC.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Specific, actionable and facilitated learning for creating a company, launching a line of business, or taking on a new initiative. Certainly most relevant for SaaS businesses, but broadly applicable. Truly empowers anyone -- even without an initial idea -- to be an entrepreneur.
B004JN1CW4|1.0|I thought it was bad cause it made me feel happy and I don't like being happy. Bad book overall
B00CCEHR80|5.0|The concert of which this is a record took place ten years later than the one recorded as Volume 1 in this (hopefully ongoing) series.  It's an absolute delight.  Jerry is assisted by two backup women singers who sound good, and on a couple of tracks, Bela Fleck adds some first-rate banjo work.  Rhythm is strong, and there's a fine and assertive keyboardist, and Jerry's guitar work is always a pleasure to listen to.  Listeners who (like me) enjoy the reissues of live Grateful Dead gigs will find that there isn't much overlap -- \\"Deal\\" is an obvious one, and I've heard the Dead do \\"How sweet it is,\\" and that's about it.  There's a Peter Tosh song here, and Van Morrison's \\"And it Stoned Me\\" (I've never heard the Dead cover Van!), and it's fascinating to hear.  Their take on \\"Evangeline\\" -- a song I had forgotten existed until I heard this -- really rocks, and we're reminded again in the variety of material here just how marvelously eclectic Garcia is.  There's Dylan too, of course, and that's very well done, especially \\"Forever Young\\" and \\"Tangled Up in Blue.\\"  Jerry seems to be making a real effort here to project more forcefully and expressively as a singer than he typically does on the Dead albums, and he does well.  Unfortunately, the recording catches the instruments better than the voices, making the latter sound a bit boomy at times.  But what the heck . . . this is a beauty!  Let's hope more are in the pipeline.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|My favorite author, and I read like a book a week, and have for years.  He never fails to entertain and inform.  Total page turners!. Discovered him a few years ago and have read every book he's written and have not been disappointed in any way.  Recommend James Rollins highly.
B0093QJY0Y|1.0|I guess some movies are considered to be classics just because they are old. This is the second time I've tried to watch this dud. I just can't do it without falling asleep.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I loved this book and would recommend it. I carried it with me everywhere and passed it around to friend s
B001974DG0|5.0|Watchers is a lovely tale of care and compassion. The adventure is first rate with plenty of suspense and twists and turns.
0061122416|2.0|The storytelling was too simplistic.  If I was a younger man I might enjoy something like this.  The same themes are literally repeated time and again, chapter after chapter.  It's self-help disguised as fiction.  I read the Celestine Prophecy 10 or 15 years ago and I remember liking it but I may have outgrown this type of storytelling.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great graphics; challenging puzzles.  What's not to like? I will keep playing this one.  It's quite enjoyable and a pleasant way to pass the time.III
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Great. So Applicable to real life. I think this book speaks to all young women entering college and careers. Its a must read for recent graduates of high school or college, including the guys. Sheryl Sandberg addresses things that we are afraid to talk about or don't even know to talk about. Things that might be holding us back. I gave it as a high school graduation present to my sister in law an I hope it inspires her like it did me.<br /><br />Great reality check!
B009ME47H2|5.0|So far so good.  It's everything I needed and more. Only had it for couple of days but it has good quality recording and easy to use.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Every senior should see this movie because you come to realize that as long as you are alive there's hope.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Game of Thrones is my favorite series.  I've become addicted to the plot and characters.  The scenery is absolutely gorgeous and captivating.  I can't wait to get Season 3.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This runs smoothly and is a lot of fun to play. My three year old son loves to watch me play!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|this app I think stinks. I think that because I was once trying to play with my friends and my grandparents and I tapped the game to play and it just shut me out. I played like 2 rounds and the rest of the times I played stunck. I could not play.  I recommend that you do not get this app. and when you do.....  don't say I didn't warn you.  by the way... don't listen to those other reviews there so wired there just faking.  thanks for reading my review.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I enjoyed the book. It gave me insight into the life of Tesla not taught in college books. Thank you for the text and thank you for having it free on Amazon Prime.
B001TCAT9U|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums from Depeche Mode. The opener is just a seductive, kick ass song and the use of old electronics mixed in with the new style makes for a great listening experience. No need to skip tracks here, and its great to see this band still moving forward.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my daughter and I love playing this game! it is really challenging for both of us. looking forward to unlocking other minions.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found this game fun and entertaining, all I found aggravating was at times you are solving a puzzle and if you aren't exactly on the spot it appears you are in the wrong area
B00CWY76CC|5.0|There's game makes you think but not to tough to make you want to quit. I am waiting on the next levels.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|I downloaded Gone Girl onto my kindle, opened it and started reading. Halfway through the &#34;first&#34; chapter I noticed that the kindle was showing that I was 52% of the way through the book. I assumed that it was just an error and continued reading. Finished the &#34;first&#34; chapter and started to doubt that what I had read actually was the first chapter, so showed it to a friend who had already finished the book. Turns out I had read the first chapter of the SECOND part of the book! Thanks Kindle!! I've continued to read it , but already knowing what happens in the second part of the book has obviously removed a LOT of the &#34;suspense&#34; or otherwise. If you put this book on your kindle - you have been warned - make sure it brings you to the start of the book and not the middle!!!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I enjoyed reading this novel but did find it hard to keep track of the characters and their lives sometimes.  Large periods of time were often jumped, some storylines didn't seem to finish.  In saying that, I would recommend reading this novel.
B0091REZMW|4.0|New game I just downloaded, but looks kinda interesting. Other friends have it and they recommend it, so wanted to check it out.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book!! It had some interesting twists, which made it easy for me to keep reading. I now have read a couple other books from Nicholas Sparks and I have not been disappointed!! :)
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's ok, I just start playing the game so I really don't know what to say. But like I said it's fun so far,so I'm going to keep on playing it.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|without thinking about it twice, I recommend this movie, it motivates you to work harder for your goals. I love it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book continues the story of the Hunger Games with revolution starting in some of the districts of Panem.  Book has appeal for fans of political and government duplicity thrillers as the Capitol continues to try to control the increasingly restless districts.  A good follow up to the original games with more games in store for Katniss Everdeen.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|I would recommend this product to children who are bullies and those being bullied.<br /><br />It gives a sense of knowing that in the end, good triumphs over evil
B009WUAK2M|3.0|big booms, gren-ukes, unrealistic...typical.  What more can you expect from all these big name stars?  maybe a real plot?uggh.  like I said, typical.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because when I'm in church and the pastor tell us what chapter and verse to go to with this app it just a tip of the finger.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book has to be my favorite of all three books.  It is a serious page turner and I enjoyed every page of this novel.  I definitely left me wanting more.
1452115567|4.0|My boyfriend liked this photographer's work and is also a huge dog-lover.  Even though many of these same photos are available to see online, it is very nice to have them all compiled in this great book.  It makes a great &#34;coffee table&#34; book and there are interesting descriptions of each photograph.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves dogs...it makes a great gift!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this trilogy.  I was left wanting more.  I am so sad now that I don't have any more books to read from Fifty Shades.  Definitely wonderful books and I would definitely recommend as a MUST read.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The graphics are great but it should be easier to try different areas without having to keep buying bananas until you get used to the game....
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this trilogy.  I was left wanting more.  I am so sad now that I don't have any more books to read from Fifty Shades.  Definitely wonderful books and I would definitely recommend as a MUST read.

B002PMPTIO|5.0|Why, yes, I would rate it all of the stars. There are not enough stars. Just shut up and watch it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I have watched this 3 times ! Great acting job and story! Every time I watch I find something different and interesting!
141659521X|5.0|Anything a new Vince Flynn book is released I know I am in line for a treat. Keep stocking this author.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome! It makes you think outside the box. It tests your ability to think in an abstract manner. It's so addicting that I wish there was no end to the number of levels!
0811836363|5.0|You gain such great insight and you know it's not hyperbole since it's written only in their voices and those closest. Fantastic work.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is the best of the Angry Birds.  It is easy for those who only play occasionally and is fun with Star Wars.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|this is the first book i ever read on my phone - I never thought I'd enjoy reading on a phone screen.  I enjoyed the book immensely - it's a classic.
B00B2166BS|4.0|The pogo charger is not as fast as i thought it would be but it does free up my usb port so that I am able to connect an external drive. The magnet could be a little stronger. Overall I do recommend it.
B0095G5AFU|4.0|Haven't fully tried it out yet, but it looks like just what I was looking for.  Looks like a great way to organize documents.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Brilliant series!<br />Have watched it twice already!<br />Would recommend it to anyone who likes a good political story.<br />Watch it now!
1781162646|3.0|Typical King mystery.  Not my favorite genre from him, but better than nothing.  I buy everything he writes, but prefer the longer novels.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Likeable main character with relatable problems and an antagonist we love to hate.<br /><br />You should check it out.<br />You're welcome.
B002U3CCF6|4.0|It's a great debut book. I liked very much. There is good drama and good mistery. I Recommend. It's Sharp. Really.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A reflection on life, love, joys and disappointments. This books brings a bunch of different people together and creates a story that brings them all full circle.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is pretty sweet because you can do so much with the game and it has been upgraded a lot with new vehicles and maps to keep the game interesting
B001KX50BK|5.0|Very good transfer to Blu-ray, the movie itself is a 5 star one in all aspects. Highly recommend this disc.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was fun.  I could be on this game all the time. Even my dad liked it! Can't wait for more
B008YW5RH2|4.0|I can't put it down!! I sat on my couch and played for an hour when I first downloaded it, great game!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book not only touched my heart and expand my knowledge of books but also taught me the truth yes I know was my suppose to find a true meaning behind this story but the truth with this story is that even though theses two fictional characters have nightmare that may never go away they found it in each other to live life to the fullest
B0000669JL|5.0|This cd has so many of Bob Marley's great songs.  Everything about it is A+.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to Bob Marley fans everywhere.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It had the ending I was hoping for all along. After all the emotions that were felt throughout the whole series this was a great ending.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie before and I don't know why not.  It's not a new one, but it is done so well.  It's a piece of the life  of Bob Marley.  The beginning was a little slow, but as it picked up I was spellbound.  So much I didn't know about him.  Ended with tissues and tears.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|I was getting ready for a month long trip to Africa complete with safaris and scuba diving and needed a way to hold and organize all my microSD cards. This was perfect!. Held the cards very securely, but let them free easily when wanted. I went with this one over other brands due to the fact that it has 2 spots for either adapters or regular sd cards. In my case I brought two adapters, as you never know if one might fail and I was no where near a replacement. Also, you can put microSDs in the adapter allowing for even more storage.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|The animation is so great and the adorable horse is pure Fun. The music has awoken the kid inside of me..
B005KELQEU|5.0|This is the perfect sleeve for a Kindle. It is not excessively bulky and provides adequate padding. Simple yet effective.
B00503BN1M|5.0|I have watched this very funny video so many times. Go on, just see what I mean. The acting is amazing.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Loved the book and they did a really great job with this movie too...the casting was incredible! Definitely watch it!
B008AIGWVA|4.0|This app is adorable. I really enjoyed my cousin getting a laugh out of this! It is so appropriate for young children and adults. So much fun. Give it a try! You and the little ones will have a lot of fun!
1476734941|5.0|I am down 15 lbs at the start of week 12 of the 5:2 version of the FastDiet.  I've never used any other &#34;diet&#34; but tried this one after seeing the BBC presentation done by Michael Mosley.  It really is stress free.  My next step is to add a focus on strength training.  One tip:  don't skimp on drinking generous amounts of water during your fast days.  Everything in moderation, of course, but the body needs proper hydration in order to lose weight effectively.
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|(There are some slight spoilers ahead. Sorry) The first movie (G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra) was better. Here's the long and the short of it. The first movie had it's glaring flaws without a doubt. The least of them was giving Snake Eyes a mouth on his mask. Perhaps the worst thing about the first movie - the needless intertwining plots for the sake of character development that turned Duke and the Baroness into exes and Cobra commander into the Baroness's little brother. Needless. But where they got it right - this movie failed miserably. G.I.Joe: Retaliation completely abandoned character development putting implied stereotype into full effect instead. They gave the viewer absolutely no reason to care about the characters aside from ennobled revenge for their fallen friends. Bruce Willis' character was a cool idea that had no point other than to attempt to fix plot holes in the story. His meaning and significance to the story was vacant. The writing was so thin I dare say they didn't even give Dwayne Johnson a fair chance to show how well he can act. I think Flint was in this movie (that was sarcasm). He was the overly athletic and impulsive white guy with three lines in the movie. The most significant divide between the two movies - Rise of the Cobra felt like G.I.Joe. Regardless of getting origins wrong and mostly cheesy dialogue, one has to excuse some of these flaws for the correct interpretation of \\"fighting over land and sea and air\\" that exemplifies G.I.Joe. G.I.Joe is \\"Go big or go home\\". Retaliation is brand void. It actually feels like that's how they intended it. The mantra most have been \\"if the viewer can't characterize it, then they can't blame us for getting it wrong.\\" The Joes felt small in this movie. Not at all like the large team of highly trained and funded military that was the crux of the cartoon series. Incidentally, the one thing they got right this time was Snake Eyes' mask. At least Quick Kick wasn't in it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The characters are perfect. Stories reflect the original books. Only draw back is only three episodes in a season.<br />Can't wait for this season to start!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|For consistent followers of NCIS who missed this episode it is key to getting closure to season 9 and laying a foundation for the rest of season 10.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Been a long while since a book pinned me down like this one. I burned thru the last 300 pages in 1day. Everything I needed to do today stopped as I was almost forcefully required to continue reading.<br /> I need the next in this scenario to kill my thirst.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|A little slow to start but a good read.  If u like the show u should read the book also.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game has extreme lag on original kindle fire. Tends to lock my device or kick me out altogether. I enjoy this game on my phone, but hate that so many missions require stupid facebook. This makes it impossible to advance, because it cost coins to skip the mission. That sucks because coins are impossible to come by. Had to delete it from my kindle.
B00DU74U74|5.0|It was pretty close to the book as you can get. Still very enjoyable and will add to my collection.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie is so cute! I love all the characters and it is really funny! Disney always does a great job!
0756666937|4.0|This is a great hardcover book for my grandsons to \\"dream\\" with...they are age 7 and 5 and have inherited all of their dads LEGOS and are at a great age to try some of the ideas in this book. I even enjoyed looking at it first as I used to play with my kids when they were just learning about using their imagination for building with LEGOS.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As always Neil creates a mythology that you totally absorbed into. I couldn't put it down. It will definitely be in my re-read list.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is great storytelling. Utterly engrossing. My breaks at work kept going long because of this tale. Kvoth's imperfections are perfect in my opinion. They make him more human- frustratingly so at times. I couldn't be more pleased. On second thought, that's not entirely true. I wish the series was complete. The pace and development is such that when you finish book two, it&#34;s like suddenly being cut off from an addiction.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A fun light hearted book. well written. A wonderful adventure across the life of a simple yet extraordinary 100 year old man .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am 16 and that shows that this game is good for all ages. The game is non stop fun, and very entertaining.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|With the help of this DIY booklet, I managed to format and upload MS to a number of eBook websites.

B00BEIYMAG|4.0|Before I get started on this review, I want everyone to ignore that infamous little phrase that gets attached to films like this. You know which one I'm talking about: \\"Based on a true story.\\" I could go on about the trustworthyness of the Warrens or the lack thereof, but the best thing to do with this film is to ignore all of that. If you go into this with the idea that the Warrens are shameless hucksters, then you'll miss out on enjoying all that this film has to offer. If you go into this thinking that every frame is true or trying to explain to someone how all of this could've happened, you'll suffer the same fate. Just enjoy this for what it is: one of the first mainstream horror films released to the theaters in the summer in a long while.<br /><br />Now on to the proper review.<br /><br />I was thoroughly impressed by this movie. Supposedly this did insanely well when they ran this through test screenings and I can see why. The Conjuring had a lot to offer and didn't try to fill its running time by checking off every box on the horror movie cliche checklist. There are some tried and true formats here to be sure, but they're fairly well executed. The movie makes use of a lot of jump scares, so if you're irritated by those I would probably wait until this hits the rental sites. They're all done in good fun and are for the most part genuinely spooky, although I'll say that the jump scares were far more effective in the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />The acting was excellent in this and whomever thought to hire Lili Taylor should get a huge pat on the back. She's probably the strongest actor in this piece, second only to Vera Farmiga. The ladies genuinely rocked this movie fairly hard. The guys were good as well, but let's not pretend that they were there for anything other than to be played off the women.<br /><br />Now as far as story goes, this was decent. It's actually a fairly simplistic story line when you get down to it. There wasn't a lot of gussying up of the subject matter, although there was somewhat of a side story that surrounded the Warrens' daughter, the demon, and a doll from the beginning of the movie. I do have to admit that I'm not sure what I felt about that part. The doll's acquisition was shown at the beginning of the movie and largely had nothing to do with what the Perrons went through, except for showing up in one scene. The scare surrounding this scene was decent, but I kind of feel that it was one of the two weakest scenes in the film. The other weakest scene? I hate to say it, but it was the showdown in the end. I liked it well enough and it was entertaining, but it also felt slightly anticlimactic. Most viewers won't feel let down by the scene, although my friends and I all agreed that although this was an incredibly strong horror movie, the ending did sort of leave a little to be desired in comparison with the rest of the film.<br /><br />In the end though, the concerns are all fairly minor quibbles. This will still be an excellent film to go see in the theaters and something that I'd recommend for horror fans- especially those who love the older stuff. The director took great pains to make the opening and ending feel like something you'd have seen in the older days of horror, which I greatly appreciated. I'd say that this film is good enough to where it's something I'd outright own when it releases on DVD and assuming that the sequel will be as well done as this was, I'll be there on the opening weekend for whatever other movie they make.<br /><br />On a side note, if you can, see this with a more full theater. I was lucky enough that my fellow theater goers were excellent companions to watch a movie with. They reacted at all the right times, which made everything in the movie that much more scary for myself and my friends.up of the subject matter, although there was somewhat of a side story that surrounded the Warrens' daughter, the demon, and a doll from the beginning of the movie.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Great tracks, songs are long though, but great listening music for road trip or cleaning! great dancing music, my kids enjoy this cd lots, it came earlier than expected too.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I must agree with all the reviewers who has rated this with 5 stars. This All-in-one Mahjong game is perfect to play on tablets. The developer over the period in time has listened to the users of the game and added features and made it perfect. If you love Mahjong style games this has tons of styles to offer and works great! 5 stars from me.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|simply put we love Bruno in our house, take us to mars Bruno, lol we love you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! kids love it too
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I have not read a book that's moved me so much in a long, long time.  It's about the redemption of ordinary people, the way regret poisons you and the ability to forgive yourself and others.  Go on this pilgrimage and you will feel deeply and hopefully go on your own pilgrimage as well, forgiving yourself and others and feeling how miraculous life can be when actually lived in a deep, meaningful way.  It is never too late.  The author knows so much about these characters and life itself.  It's a beautiful, beautiful book and moved me tremendously.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just got this app but it's awesomeness!!!!!! I totally recommend it to people that like horses!!!! :):) I am 11 and I think people around the age of 9 and up will enjoy this game!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I don't play many games, but my nephew introduced me to &#34;Can you escape&#34;.  I like how it requires you to figure out puzzles to move on.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|my granddaughter loved this game so much i had to try it also.<br />she even got another one.i think any little girl will like this.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Most of all this book made me think completely different about how we evaluate consciousness between people and animals even higher thinking animals like primates. The way we look at animals is challenged by this book. The story is so moving. I FELT LIKE CRYING SO MANY TIMES. I enjoyed this book so much. And, yes, the title is perfect.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I love this app. I know it's not perfect but it does tell you what the weather will be in your area or any other place your traveling to and want to see just put in the zip code.  It gives you how by hour weather and I'm pretty happy with it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Classic, romantic and fast paced.  I can never sit down and watch just one episode.  I am so glad Amazon offers this to its Prime customers at no additional cost.  Really adds value to the membership when you get Fantastic shows like this one as part of it.
0071766588|5.0|IT WAS QUICK AND ACCURATE. NOW I HAVE A CONFIDENCE, AND WILL USE MORE FREQUENTLY.<br />NOW I DON`T NEED TO WASTE MY TIME.<br />  THANKS
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am seeing too many movies that are gory or scary we need to see more movies that are just fun and I loved this movie and loved seeing #2 in the theatres
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I love this game. I just wish it would let u play the full version for free instead of just half the game. It's a shame u can't enjoy full version games for free anymore like u used to.
0316247545|5.0|I swooped this up from amazon as soon as it was available, great price! We have a lot of pony books at home with my two young girls clearly obsessed with MLP. This one was great! Every episode aired has a summary, all the lyrics to every single song ever sang on the series, all the characters are introduced. Design and art, background, even a note from the series creator is in there. This book blew all my expectations away, it is surprisingly full of lots of fun facts, and it is very long, which is great! The cover art is gorgeous, I definitely recommend this for any MLP fan!
B00DW2PDH8|4.0|The beginning poem in this book was spectacular!!<br /><br />Chapter one was pretty intense. It took me a while before I figured out what was going on, but once I did, I could say I was probably as terrified as she was.<br /><br />As the story progresses, Eternal is found wandering by a farmer and taken to an asylum for the insane. It is here that she meets her last journey..for now. In this part of the story, she goes back and forth between Eternal (where everything is pure hell) and Delicate Rose (where everything is normal) so you are seeing two different perspectives on the same event.<br /><br />By the time I got to Chapter 7, the pieces start to fall together. The story begins to focus on Lucien, her love, and what happened with him. It is determined that the reason he has kept her captive is he is waiting on the day for her to make him immortal.<br /><br />The there is Edouard. He is her love according to her emerging memories and his memory. He pops into the story here and there and then the author reveals how and why she meets Edouard.<br /><br />The story was very interesting and kept me enthralled. I really like the different POV. The story was a little slow at first but once it begins to pick up I couldn't put it down. The story starts off strange but eventually the author leads you back.<br /><br />I was excited when Edouard comes to work at the asylum because I thought for sure he was going to rescue Delicate Rose from her hell. Instead I get a different surprise.<br /><br />I love how the story played out and I love how the author wrote it. I would recommend to anyone who loves a good vampire novel.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This is a nice app that permits you to connect to the world via radio.  It's easy to search, and you bookmark your favorites.  It's also great that the artists' and albums' information are displayed when the songs play.  It's also great that the user can record songs.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a good, fast read of an Irish tale with a twist you might see coming about trwo-thirds of the way through.  Definitely gives the feeling of being in Ireland - characters are quite believeable and charming - and the childhoods s of the main characters are graphic and thought-provoking.  It's not classic literature - but it was just want I liked.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Fantastic story and so many twists and turns along the way. Always looking toward the next episode. It's amazing how much they can pack in a forty-five minute time frame.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was hoping for something grand like Kite Runner but this story was too fragmented with many back stories on insignificant characters and each story leaves you flat; people either died or forgot one another. Hardly anything came together in a positive fashion. Hosseini is an excellent author who paints a fantastic picture of Afghanistan which is why I'm rating as three stars and not two. But this story is lacking. For a solid, nonfiction story, try In My Father's Country by Saima Wahab.
B003VPWX6K|4.0|A look into the lives of two people who loved each other, but never acted on it. The life of service of a butler in an old house, and how he gave the master of the house everything; even his soul. A very good read for someone who likes the development of characters through the thoughts of the narrator. Very subtle, but very good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series and season 3 was not a disappointment.  But really how could they kill off . . .
B008OOYALE|1.0|I would recommend dragonvale I play it all the time but dragon story it's ok but team lAva could do better
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Nothing to complain about here. Product arrived on time and in new condition. Each season's discs have their own bay within a plastic, hinged, multi-case container. The discs don't have labels, but each box (3) has a pouch containing several coated cards with disc info. The crisp, restoration is first class and the new graphics and special effects would bring tears to Gene Roddenberry's eyes. Tears of joy that is. I've read that some of the discs have issues. Mine were fine except for one episode that skipped. I replayed the offending scene and it was fine (?). If you are a serious STOS fan, you want this collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A nice game especially if you want to have a horse and you don't know how to care for it.<br /><br />I
B009GX7IRA|1.0|It showed that I owned this season for about 2 minutes and when I refreshed the page all the episodes said &#34;buy&#34; instead of &#34;own&#34; and it wasn't even in my purchased section. I don't know what happened. My payment was processed and everything but now the season is nowhere to be found without re purchasing again...I love NCIS, and the show is awesome. But there was a disappointing problem with amazon's instant video.
1781162646|3.0|I was anxious to get this new novel from Stephen King because I loved his early work, but became disinterested in his later writings.  The book was okay and as usual, Stephen King does a great job of describing and developing his characters.  The problem is that while it's a good read, it does get boring in places and you pretty much have an idea of who the killer will be early on in the reading.  No surprises or scary moments, as I was expecting from a Stephen King novel.  I probably won't be purchasing any more of his books.
B005PK1G76|5.0|loved this stroller cup holder. it works on the bob stroller. very simple but just what you need. its actually a lot better than the britax stroller organizer that i purchased for the other stroller because the fabric is more stiff so your drinks don't lean over and spill. very happy with the purchase :)
0312954468|4.0|Great book that puts the reader right into the middle of that era. Wilbur clearly put a lot of research into making it historically accurate and to reflect the realities of those times. It was fascinating.
B000063DIH|4.0|Iron Maiden is a band that had success from day 1. Their run in the 80's is still considered legendary and the quality of their music was always there. This album and its predecessor, No Prayer for the Dying, were some of their first times at being unsuccessful. However, it wasn't like the band rehashed the same material for all of their albums. At least they were experimenting. With NPftD and this one, they did a more \\"stripped down\\" approach. I haven't listened to much of NPftD, but this album is actually fairly respectable, it isn't the junker that everyone says it is. However it's also far from the greatness that we've come to expect from this band. There are a few gems on this album, there are some other very good moments here as well, but the bad tracks of the album are among the worst songs of Maiden's whole career. Janick and David do their jobs with the guitar parts. Many say that Adrian Smith is far superior to Janick, but let's look at this: during Adrian's first run with the band, they were doing more \\"in-your-face\\" metal and adding progressive elements and slowly getting more epic and more heavy. Janick joined the band for an era of \\"stripped down\\" metal. When comparing the music, it's all in your taste, but when comparing the two guitar players, while they are in the same band, they were playing different styles of that band's music. For that reason, the comparison is a little unfair. Bruce's voice on this album is actually really good. I like the gruff of his voice and how he changes from his raw power to his soaring vocals fairly easily. Steve Harris is Steve Harris; probably the best bassist in metal just doing his thing. Nicko is his usual self here as well. He provides a steady beat for the band and adds to the music.<br /><br />The music:<br /><br />1. Be Quick or Be Dead- a drum roll and the album takes off with some very Maiden-sounding guitars. When Bruce comes in however, the listener notices that he definitely gained rawness to his voice andthat added aggression is what actually adds to some of these songs. It definitely adds to this song. The verses are very up in your face and in the chorus, Bruce returns to his usual singing style. Musically, the guitars kick butt! They sound just like the Maiden of old! Nicko is drumming very well on this one. The solo here is pretty good! I like it! The bass is intense as usual. Overall, a very aggressive first track. Great song!<br /><br />2. From Here to Eternity- I hear people throw praise to this song, but I really don't like this one. The music on this one isn't that great, the drums aren't cool, the bass doesn't do anything Steve-like and it just comes off as uninspired. This song should've been a b-side or not released at all. Sorry, I just don't dig what they did with this one.<br /><br />3. Afraid to Shoot Strangers- This song is a very soft, ambient song. The guitars are tastefully played and Bruce's voice sounds GOLDEN on this song! THIS is a classic! This might be among their best songs! The military theme is very well done and the drums are kept simple, but they do the trick. It sounds really good, but it has an eerie atmosphere brooding behind Bruce's voice and the music. It has a feeling of uneasiness and it's a very good song for that reason. Then out of nowhere, a BRILLIANT guitar lead comes in and the song takes a new direction! It slowly gets heavier until it bursts into a normal Maiden style song and the solos begin. The whole song is GREAT! It's a near 7 minute journey and it includes some of Maiden's best guitar work. The bass is full of fury in this middle section and Nicko's fills have gotten better since Seventh Son (again, haven't heard NPftD yet). All in all, this is a VERY good song! The guitar work is some of the best they've made and it doesn't become stale. Classic!<br /><br />4. Fear is the Key- This song is literally a chore for me to listen to. I don't find any greatness or inspiration behind it. This song sounds like a Whitesnake or Bon Jovi groove. I really don't enjoy listening to this. I like this style when Whitesnake or Bon Jovi do it, but hearing Maiden do it just doesn't sound good. This one should've been omitted.<br /><br />5. Childhood's End- This song starts off with a cool guitar intro. Then some very cool drumming starts! I really like the beat that Nicko does for this intro! This song isn't exactly Maiden-sounding, but I do like what they're doing in this song. Bruce's voice sounds good on this song, the drumming levels up in intensity, the guitars are good, but they aren't really up front except for their leads and solos. Steve's bass isn't that audible in this song surprisingly. I can hear it during the instrumental sections, but not when Bruce is singing. Overall, this is a pretty good song. Not the best here, but it's not terrible. It earns its place here.<br /><br />6. Wasting Love- A ballad? Maiden doing a ballad? As absurd as it sounds, this song is actually very good. The guitars are still Maiden, the music is still honest and not aimed to sell, and Bruce's emotion is in top form! It is indeed still Maiden so there is an instrumental section that has a good groove to it. This isn't like the other songs of the album, though, because the instrumental section stays in the same tempo/time/feel as the rest of the song. Overall, I do have to say that Maiden is good at making ballads! This is a very well-put together song.<br /><br />7. The Fugitive- This one starts off with some cool drums and signature Maiden riff! It definitely has a very good groove behind it and the guitar melodies are purely AWESOME! The verses are softer and Bruce's voice sings it very well! Then the verse builds up. This is definitely an epic song. Bruce's soaring voice and the driving music make this one one of the coolest and most epic-sounding songs on the album. I don't really have much to say about this song. It's a very good song though! Solo is great too!<br /><br />8. Chains of Misery- This one is just there. It isn't something so terrible that it shouldn't have seen light, but it's also not \\"Oh wow, this rocks!\\". It's just there. The music is slightly bland and the vocals aren't done in the best way. Lyrics are a little lacking too. I just find this song kinda boring overall.<br /><br />9. The Apparition- This song has received so much hate for so little reason! The song freaking ROCKS! For what the song actually is, it's AMAZING! They don't do much to change the song throughout, but it is very good! They basically start off with one riff and keep it going through most of the song. The only break from that is the instrumental section. This song has a very eerie atmosphere to it and Bruce's voice is pretty good on here. The solo is very good and it has an amazing groove. People hate on this song and call it Maiden's worst song ever. I think this song isn't exactly the BEST thing they've done, but it's closer to that. It's a GREAT song. I like it very much.<br /><br />10. Judas Be My Guide- This song starts off with some very eerie, but melodic and epic sounding guitars and then it goes into a short little solo and Bruce comes in and this song is very EPIC! Bruce's voice soars over some very well done guitar parts and the drumming makes it even cooler! The air siren is back! Bruce really shines through this song! The guitar melodies on here are just fantastic! This song could've come off of an album like Seventh Son... or maybe even Powerslave. The song is that quality that we're used to from Maiden and it's a very underrated classic! I'd say this would have to be the third classic this album produced. Great song!!!<br /><br />11. Weekend Warrior- Ok, this song is garbage, worst Maiden song I've heard. All the other reviews hit this one on the bull's eye. This song is absolute crap. It doesn't sound like Maiden at all. I don't even know what it sounds like, but even the title is kinda garbage.<br /><br />12. Fear of the Dark- This is the classic that people always praise this album for, the title track. The guitars on here are very epic! In terms of feel, this song is similar to track 3, but this one is done in a very different way and isn't that similar. Bruce's voice is very dark and very brooding. This would be a perfect song for Halloween. It's very eerie and very creepy. The lyrics are the same way. The riffs, once the song kicks up to full volume, are very well written, Bruce's voice is in its full, true glory, and the band plays very well on this song. the 7 minute epic that closes off this album leaves the listener feeling that they at least saved the best for last. The drumming has a lot of changes in the song, the guitars have a lot of great leads, melodies, and moments throughout, and Steve's bass is purely amazing! This is a masterpiece! Great song!!!<br /><br />Verdict- I wouldn't recommend this album if you are new to Maiden. I'd say start off with [[ASIN:B000063DFN Powerslave]], [[ASIN:B000063DI9 Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]], or even the newer [[ASIN:B00004TH7Z Brave New World]]. These three albums are very solid, classic Maiden albums and this one, while not terrible, is just lacking the quality that Maiden is known for. The cover for this album is among one of their best covers, though, I will admit. Overall, it's worth buying, but don't start with this album.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't wait for season three of Downton Abbey to come out! I unfortunately watched the whole thing already and have to wait for the season 4. It is simply my favorite series. I would recommend this to anyone who loves history and great storylines.
1442359919|5.0|Stephen King so richly draws characters and their environment that no matter what happens you are totally all-in.  Nostalgic and sweet (similar to 11/22/63) - with required spooky suspense - absolutely wonderful.

B009IH0ICG|4.0|I bought this to replace a lodge chimney that was destroyed by some construction workers. The lodge was flimsy to begin with. The weber is sturdy and solid. Does it's job and seems it will hold up for a while. I have the lodge sportsman grill, which I highly recommend. It is a small hibachi cast iron and this size is chimney is perfect for it. One load will get the grill up and going no problem, but two loads and you're good to for 1.5 hrs of grill time. Although most of this is due to the cast iron of the lodge. One sheet of news paper and 15mins is all it needs.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I loved this series. I kept thinking about it during the time I was watching it and afterwards. I have watched the 2nd series also and it continues to be very timely.

B00005N6KG|2.0|Sony made a folding headset with the same vertical in the ear concept. The driver was slightly larger allowing for a much fuller sound reproduction. I had forgotten about that head set when, behold, I found an old pair stashed with my old electronics. I was so impressed I was attempting to order what I thought would be a similar driver. The driver on the one I received seemed more like it was designed in comparison for the speech range. I wish Sony would remake the old set I just described - we need to keep the vertical head set concept alive. I realize the one they still sell in the USA is more of a one size fits all so they make this one only. The larger size is just slightly larger but worth the fidelity it provides and for most people just as comfortable.
B0098G7AWS|5.0|I loved this movie so, so much!  It honestly made me cry it was made so, so, so beautifully.  :)
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|I bought 3 of these for grandchildren. They needed something for transport of their kindles. They range in age from 5-8 and the sleeve  works very well for what they were intended. There is a small amount of cushioning inside which offers additional protection against dropping. They are kid friendly and the price was right.
B004TI5N38|4.0|A great read. Simply a god story and well written. This is really one to sit and relax and enjoy

B008602KQI|5.0|Having read all the books, I thought this movie was very faithful.  I definitely enjoyed it the second time, and look forward to the sequel
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|This is a great product for what you are getting.  The transfer and 3D visuals are excellent.  Disney is in essence really taking the customer for a ride though because this is a 3D only disc.  No standard Blu-Ray, no dvd, no digital copy, all you are getting is the 3D copy.  As long as you know and understand that, then caveat emptor.  You will not be disappointed.
B005F9TQBU|5.0|With Santana already a bold diverse new phenomenon in the music world and<br />  Carlos hailed as another great guitar hero following their rise to universal fame at<br />  the end of the 1960's, the rock guitar wizard had decide to try something different<br />  after disbanding his Woodstock Era band line-up.  While keeping Gregg Rollie in<br />  the band, Santana took on a more adventurous and progressive approach in their<br />  music with this bold uplifting rock piece that drew a successful line between jazz-<br />  rock and Prog-Rock vitality.  Originally released in 1972, Caravanserai have mark<br />  a creative turning for Santana, where after five years of phenomenal success, the<br />  band's musical scope as well as the master rock guitarist's groundbreaking ideals.<br />  Clocking in at one hour, this landscape-driven adventurous rock piece would take<br />  his band to another direct level as Carlos provide a generous dose on this largely<br />  instrumental masterwork, whether it is jazz-rock or simply epic rock.  Heralded by<br />  evocative, introspective guitar solos, it was a disappointment to some of his fans<br />  (whom they later come to admire), but, like the contemporary jazz that influenced<br />  it (it would even introduce keyboardist- composer Tom Coster in the band).  As a<br />  true document of crystalline vision, Caravanserai is a milestone in Santana's rich,<br />  history, but make no mistake about it, this timeless work is one of finest albums.<br /><br />Important Notice: Oh yes, isn't it high time that we have an MP3 edition of this great<br />masterpiece, because it's time is just about up to be included in the MP3 department.

B002A5WQ8W|5.0|For those who heard and deeply admire Dave Brubeck’s crowning achievement,<br />  I would like to suggest this special 50th Anniversary deluxe edition.  Why? Because<br />  like so many deluxe editions of great classic albums, it gives us more material that<br />  was either left of the recording or related to such an album.  Released in 1959 and<br />  put into it’s widespread release in 1960, Time Out have greatly impressed both the<br />  critics and listeners alike with it’s timeless beauty, striking notes, stunning melodic<br />  drive and lasting harmonic solos, where it became one of the first blockbuster jazz<br />  albums to achieve multi-platinum gold record status and also topped the pop chart.<br />  Beginning with the exhilarating opening track Bondo A La Turk, the masterful track<br />  set concludes with a few creative classic compositions, like Strange Meadow Lark,<br />  the signature hit Take Five (which stood on the singles charts until 1963 and highly<br />  regarded as one of the biggest-selling jazz records of all time), the lyrical Three To<br />  Get Ready, Kathy’s Waltz and Pick Up Sticks.  What you get on the deluxe edition<br />  are two very sporadic live acts that The Brubeck Quartet gave at the Newport Jazz<br />  Festival in 1961 and 1964 as they include a lovely set of tracks featuring standards<br />  such as St. Louis Blues, Since Love Has It’s Way and You Go To My Head as well<br />  as few Brubeck standards, like Waltz Limp, Koto Song—from Jazz Impressions Of<br />  Japan) and also a couple signature hits from the original album, notably Take Five.<br />  Time Out is one of the most celebrated and most honoured jazz albums of all time<br />  since it’s general release in 1960 and well into music history, it have maintained its<br />  magical edge and it always will and even beyond eternity, while the deluxe Legacy<br />  Edition will give you twice the merriment as Time Out (whether in it’s own single or<br />  2-CD deluxe edition) will remain timeless for both it’s groundbreaking success and<br />  as his crowning achievement.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Not my favorite of the 5 books, but definitively among the good ones! Waiting for the 6th! My first book read in kindle!
B00136LZG8|5.0|As the 1970's dawned, Carlos Santana and his band was already set to take on          the music world in full force, when in 1970, they electrified the critics and the public          worldwide with there second blockbuster album that not only took the dazzling rock          guitar-backed elements to fresh heights, but made it their masterpiece that remains          to this day. Abraxas became an overnight sensation where it stunned listeners with          it's highly supercharged virtuosity, high voltage solos, electrifying rock and roll, and          haunting instrumental background as Santana set out to create a starling energetic          phase on their second recording session, while they collaborated with new friends,          among them Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green (who composed Black Magic Woman).          The visually challenging track set start with the visually haunting instrumental song          Singing Winds, Crying Beasts that then proceed with the definitive version of Black          Magic Woman, there own take on Tito Puente's big band/ salsa classic Oye Como          Va, the instrumental classic Incident At Neshabur, Hope You're Getting Better and          Samba Pa Ti (which was successfully covered by Jose Feliciano, who even added          the lyrics, and later Angelique Kidjo), where it make this powerful work of genius a          powerful and challenging listening experience to behold. Showcased by its striking          rock and roll beat, Abraxas is hailed as a award-winning masterpiece which greatly          combines the stark elements of rock, jazz, salsa and the blues which made it quite          phenomenal as this remastered expanded edition makes of this timeless landmark          sound greater, and it will definitely shine as passionately as ever for the ages.

B004AP09CU|5.0|With Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band riding high on the rock charts         and calling the shots in the music world, they presented yet another blockbuster         album in 1978 which provides rock fans and legion of his admirers with a moving         listening experience that would be praised for the maturity for it’s musical themes         and lyrics. Darkness On The Edge Of Town a powerful masterpiece that focuses         on those who are down on their in trouble whom they find a way out by struggling         to overcome their problems- and personal troubles, while looking to improve their         lives.  Springsteen presented the hard truths in a hard rock setting with the tracks         heralded by powerful drumming as the track set starts off with Badlands and then         proceed with other these classic songs such as Adam Raised A Cain, Something         In The Night, The Promised Land, Racing In The Street and the moving title track        (one of the most powerful songs I ever heard).  Although not as heavily produced         as Born To Run, Darkness On The Edge Of Town have full-handed bodied sound         as the music is performed in a grande style and the conviction of his singing adds         weight to the songs and well-structured principles, which make this solid dramatic         masterpiece.  Although it did not produce chart-topping hit singles, it nevertheless         spent 97 weeks on the charts (1978-79), which makes it a uniquely satisfying and         engrossing blockbuster, one that is played with excellent storytelling, forgiveness,         and hope as this true uplifting achievement that will definitely live on for ages and         keep on inspiring those with its ode for renewed hope and determination.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Like being held hostage with all the Facebook requests.

Just one big continual request for money. Disappointed.
B002KVAB5G|5.0|Fresh from their notoriety and success from Exile On Main Street a year earlier,           The Rolling Stones had delivered another challenging and highly successful album           in 1973 with the release of this eponymous tour de force.  Though it may not be as           fantastic, freaky and funky as Between The Buttons and Sticky Fingers, but Goat's           Head Soup does offer a combination of enunciated lyrics, exhilarating guitar solos,           dark overtones, a superb piano background and occasional muses of sex and viol-          ence, which make it a decadent and challenging work of art, despite having such a           bad reputation.  Heralded by a stark track list, it features few classic hits that begin           with Dancing With Mr. D, and concludes with attitude on other tracks like the show-          stopping a-capella' style rock classic Doo Doo Heartbreaker, the Top Ten soft-rock           ballad Angie, Silver Train and other assorted songs until ending with the nasty rock           number Star Star (where the F Word is used), for whom they illustrate how far they           have come in their songcraft.  Compared with the monumental success of Exile On           Main Street and Let It Bleed, Goat's Head Soup was bound to sound inferior and it           certainly does, but nevertheless, it does not deserve it's bad reputation, although it           truly does sound as decadent and careless, the album's publicity and real success           does makes it such a fascinating music experience.  Also featuring R&B keyboard           wizard Billy Preston, Nicky Hopkins and Ian Stewart on keyboards, it even marked           the end of The Stones' golden age while it exclusively contained new material from           the band since Their Satanic Majesty's Request from 1967, but you'll definitely find           this evocative masterpiece to be a truly captivating well-written intelligent stroke of           genius as well as another timelessclassic that ranks among as their best.
B00005J9PB|1.0|I guess I did see where it stated it was the European version only! Next time I will read the fine print!
B00138J7TS|5.0|With Bruce Springsteen again hitting the music charts in 1992 with two highly<br />  successful CD's, Human Touch and this one, where they manage to do well and<br />  make his comeback a special one.  Lucky Town did even better as it addressed<br />  many of his major concerns as he again moved forward on his message, as the<br />  rage, compassion, sense of humour and commitment, which made this album a<br />  second-rate masterwork.  Headed by a solid track set that runs four 40 minutes,<br />  the unforgettable songs like Better Day and Local Hero comment on its timeless<br />  success, while If I Should Fall Behind and Book Of Dreams express fidelity and<br />  generosity, Souls Of The Departed offers a scathing commentary, while he give<br />  a medative epilog on My Beautiful Reward and the title track adds to the classic<br />  status.  The lyrics are better written, the arrangement is tighter and the perform-<br />  ances are stronger than on the Human Touch session, which gives Lucky Town<br />  the sharp tone it deserved--one that ranks as one of his greatest achievements.<br />  Both Human Touch and Lucky Town nevertheless marked The Boss' reputation<br />  as both a socially-conscious messenger and a world class artist--and he finally<br />  released them with a more significant impact.

B00138KCU6|5.0|A year after the world looked on in horror as The 9/11 terrorist attacks killed   thousands of Americans in New York City’s financial district and at Washington,   DC’s Pentagon office, few American musicians provided a good deal of healing   and comfort for their fellow Americans in the wake of the horrifying terror attack   and among them was Bruce Springsteen. Released just a year later, The Rising   is a powerful and uplifting masterpiece which gave a ray of hope following in the   devastating aftermath as The Boss made clear that it was going to be more than   just a album of songs, and he certainly delivered extremely well on this promise.   Backed by a solid track which begins with the opening track Lonesome Day, the   original songs proceeds rather well with Into The Fire, Nothing Man and Countin   On A Miracle.  Also added to the hopeful set are Empty Sky, Worlds Apart, Let’s   Be Friends (Skin To Skin), Mary’s Place—inspired by the Sam Cooke classic hit   Meet Me At Mary’s Place), the techno beat of The Fuse, the moving My City Of   Ruins and the uplifting title track, as they make this wonder rock classic a moral   commentary and towering listening experience.  Also added on the stirring track   set is Nothing Man, which mirrored the “9/11” survivors’ shattered outcome and   PTSD-related aftermath. Gracefully produced with sterling grandeur, The Rising   is a brave and beautiful album of humanity, hurt, hope and better outcome from   the rock titan who was best qualified to speak for his country which have turned   out to be a emotional experience for Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band   whom they provided for America and perhaps the rest of the world in which they   will dearly thankful for, as they showcased this solid combination of both artistic   medicine and superb rock and roll which make this one a monumental landmark   from music history.make this one a monumental landmark         from music history.

B00138H2ZY|5.0|What you are about to experience when you hear this 2-CD set is an exciting<br />  and electrified chunk of rock and roll history and presented by Santana including<br />  the creative young master rock guitar who head it. It was in early 1968 when the<br />  young incarnation of this rock band, freshly signed with Columbia Records, have<br />  celebrated their first steps to stardom with four nights of mind-bending, improve-<br />  fused live shows at the legendary Filmore West in San Francisco for December<br />  of that year.  Sporadically drawing from live performances from the early line-up<br />  that included Bob Livingston on the drums and Marcus Malone on congas (they<br />  would be gone by the time the band made their landmark debut album in 1969).<br />  These stunning performances had never been released before until 1997 where<br />  the long track set include several highlights that would appear the following year<br />  on their self-titled debut album, notably Jingo, Persuasion, Treat, and there epic<br />  take on Soul Sacrifice.

The sound is excellent and improv-oriented, Live At The Filmore<br />  1968 is an absolute show stopper and as a early document of Santana's rise to<br />  absolute fame and immortality.

B002W0KAG0|5.0|In 1969, The Rolling Stones gave their record-breaking grand tour of the United<br />  States that became a real colossal success, but the national tour's grand finale was<br />  later marred by their disastrous free concert at California's Alimont Speedway when<br />  the vibes from The Age Of Aquarius turned into a violent mob orgy wracked by drug<br />  crazed madness and arena-filled chaos--in part of disorganized promoting and poor<br />  security. The Stones gave their deep condolences to those affected by the carnage.<br />  What would come directly from this historical live event (except for the Alimont Free<br />  Concert!) was a live performance that was highly captured on this live album, solely<br />  titled Get Yer Ya Ya's Out, which came out in 1970-and later reissued in it's deluxe<br />  complete 2-CD format, where this deluxe edition for this classic live album makes it<br />  100% perfect from start to finish.

B00138H5YM|5.0|What makes this a truly perfect album is not only the way it was made, but<br />  the way it was performed with such visually stunning creativity, stirring melody<br />  and timeless musicianship that made this masterpiece such a striking work of<br />  art.  Filled with hot rhythm, explosive artistry and electrifying rock and roll, the<br />  action gets fired up as the first rate performing cooks with high voltage energy<br />  as Santana made Zebop a blockbuster hit, as it sounds as fascinating when it<br />  did when it first came out in 1981.

B00136JM6S|5.0|With Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band becoming the voice for there         generation in the wake of the debut album Greetings From Asbury Park in 1973,         they followed it with their next album which solidified their message-driven music         and rock and roll artistry toward a brighter margin.  The Wild, The Innocent, And         The E Street Shuffle gave rock fans and critics a more indepth approach to their         music when it expanded upon their folk-rock and rock and roll stylings to include         an occasional dash of jazz, among other styles, on this ambitious second album         that came out a year later.  Beginning on the opening track The E Street Shuffle,         the track set concludes well with Kitty’s Back, Incident On 47th Street, Wild Billy’s         Circus Story and the lyrical track finale New York City Serenade, as Springsteen         creates a street life mosaic which is owed much in it’s outlook to Van Morrison’s         romantic side of Belfast in Astrial Weeks from 1968.  Expressed with an endless         affection and much nostalgia, The Wild, The Innocent, And The E Street Shuffle         showcases an astonishing advance filled with the promise and hope which leads         to a bright outlook, while he brings in an unruly muse under his band’s control to         make a mature statement that synthesize well on complicated but well-executed         arrangements that made this an enthralling coming of age classic. Epitomized by         Springsteen’s romanticized songwriting and diversity, this one even developed a         renewed interest in full-band rock and roll as it focused on a grand fusion of rock         soulful R&B, which makes it one of the greatest albums in rock and roll history.

B00136Q2C0|5.0|With Bruce Springsteen still doing quite well on the music charts in the 1980’s         while basking in the success of Born In The U.S.A. and a phenomenal world tour,         he took a solo turn on this next CD in 1987 following the surprise break-up of The         E Street Band.  As the follow-up to his most popular album, he delighted listeners         and critics alike with the low-key masterwork Tunnel Of Love, a CD consisting of         romantic exploration, as the title suggested, told in song after song, to whom The         Boss questioned both sides in a romantic relationship, specifically when it comes         to a married relationship.  Sounding more autobiographal  than ever, he gives the         title track a heartfelt midas touch as it conclude well with on other tracks like Ain’t         Got You, as it refers to his popular success, Walk Like A Man—an explicit ode to         his father (but not to be confused with Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons’ 1963         classic hit), as well as Tougher Than The Rest, Cautious Man, and One Step Up         as he performed them with serendipity charm and in a class of it’s own.  And with         a guest appearance from The E Street Band that include Patti Sciaffa, Tunnel Of         also featured outtakes of Lucky Man and Two For The Road, and a vintage 1979         track titled Roulette when it came out on vinyl (side two) and cassette, so that we         need to suggest to both Springsteen and Columbia that they look into this matter.         Tunnel Of Love did turn out to be a great success for him, and it seems to be with         his work and personal life which in part made it an enduring stroke of genius as it         ranks as one of best and most beloved masterpieces.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is one of the most well-written books I have read that is directed toward my age group! I am (and have been for half of the book) in tears still. I, as Hazel did, fell in LOVE with Augustus Waters (or at least as much as you can LOVE a fictional character) just by reading how he was described. He was so perfect. And Hazel was so perfect for him.<br />This book also helped me understand (at least somewhat) what young cancer patients go through all the time, and it made me realize how blessed I am not to have this disease.<br />Thank you, John Green, for writing this book.

B00138GZ5W|5.0|With Bruce Springsteen already taking on the 1980's that began with the release<br />  of the blockbuster hit The River (1980) and the time-honoured bootleg classic Rock<br />  And Roll Is Here To Stay (1981), The Boss had decided to give The E Street Band<br />  a break to release this stirring folk-rock album in 1982.  Consisting of a small set of<br />  demos, where holding an acoustic guitar and a harmonica, Nebraska had become<br />  the content that dictated the approach to the making of this album that features ten<br />  songs and marked a departure for Springsteen, even if it took him further down the<br />  he had traveled previously. The songs are darker and more pessimistic, while they<br />  found him branching out on mature stories.  Starting on the title track, a first person<br />  account of the killing spree of mass murderer Charles Starkweather that took place<br />  between 1958 and 1959, as the song set the tone for it's set of portrayals of small-<br />  time criminals, desperate people and those who loved them.  Just as the recording<br />  was done in unpolished form, but it didn't stop Nebraska from becoming an instant<br />  hit, as the other tracks include Highway 99--also a Top 20 country and western hit<br />  for Johnny Cash in 1983, Open All Night (a Chuck Berry song) and the final track<br />  Reason To Believe, a song whose hard luck verses are belied by a chorus, as the<br />  low-key artistry make the folk-rock classic as a timeless thought-provoking classic.

B001B6NSJ2|5.0|With his band continuing to release one hit album after another while topping   the rock or pop singles charts in the late-1970’s, Carlos Santana had decided to   release his full-length debut album in 1979 with this captivating masterpiece. His   first solo effort Oneness--Silver Dreams, Golden Realities not only showcase the   great rock guitarist broadening his electric guitar virtuosity, but giving passionate   and colourful performances, multidimensional solos, and sheer creativity done in   new age fashion.  Though it may be his first solo outing (the duet classics Carlos   Santana And Buddy Miles Live! from 1972 and Love, Devotion, Surrender whom   he released with John McLaughlin in 1973 would become  his first solo steps), it   also feature members of his back-up band, so the difference between this group   effort and Carlos’ long awaited solo breakout album did worked slightly well in it’s   musical approach and he symbolizes his guitar artistry and performs with a more   isocratic musical approach.  Beginning with The Chosen Hour/ Arise Awake, the   album mostly feature instrumentals and heralded with contemporary ballads, like   Silver Dreams, Golden Smiles--a traditional pop ballad sung by fellow bandmate   Saunders King, as well as on instrumentals, including Light Vs. Darkness, Cry In   The Wilderness, the captivating Guru’s Song, the lyrical keyboard magic of Free   As The Morning and the final song Sung For Devadip, for which the latter serves   as a metaphor for anyone looking for a better and bright tomorrow.  So, let us all   treat ourselves to this solo masterwork that soars with astounding infinity.

B0016CJNS6|5.0|After impressing their fans and the critics with their only psychedelic album a<br />  year earlier, The Rolling Stones have fully resumed their brash rock artistry and<br />  bad boy bravado with another highly acclaimed masterwork in 1968 that proved<br />  they were still a original force to be reckoned with.  Beggar's Banquet took The<br />  Stones to another energetic level that provides a challenging momentum for the<br />  music world that they still had the true satisfaction, even in The Psychedelic Era<br />  of the late-1960's.  Featuring a towering track set that begins with the smash hit<br />  Jumpin' Jack Flash and proceded by an array of high-rocking classics including<br />  Sympathy For The Devil, peppered with fire dancing guitar solos, leering vocals<br />  by Mick Jagger, African rhythms and explicitly satanic lyrics which turns it into a<br />  an image-defining epic. Other tracks include Street Fighting Men, a reflection of<br />  the political- social turbulence of the 1960's that became one of the most highly<br />  innovative singles, and even Child Of The Moon and the classic heartfelt ballad<br />  No Expectations, Factory Girl and Stray Cat Blues are also included.  What can<br />  even describe it's success is how it carefully signaled the decadent sleaze they<br />  took to the point of parody by the mid-1970's. Their is also this possibility that a<br />  deluxe edition of Beggar's Banquet could give it a long-awaited finishing touch.<br />  So if that happens, which is 100% likely, they should look to the UK edition.

Again<br />  showcased by outstanding arrangements, riveting solid guitar solos, an electrifying<br />  rock and roll background and even another set of timeless songs from the dynamic<br />  songwriting team of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, Tattoo You is a powerful rock<br />  achievement that captures The Stones at their professional best.  Featuring a solid<br />  track set, it showcases a dynamic set of classic songs which begin with the thrilling<br />  Top Ten opening track Start Me Up, as it procede with other frenzied definitive hits<br />  like Hang Fire, the reggae jam-headed Slave and the high-rocking Neighbors.

B0016CTX68|5.0|The year 1969 would become another celebrated year for The Rolling Stones          when they conquered America with their spectacular tour which broke box office          records and released there next highly publicized masterpiece.  Mostly recorded          without Brian Jones (who accidently drowned in the pool of the band's mansion),          just several months before the album's release, Let It Bleed would give the band          another critical and commercial success. The extension of the band's blues-rock          persona from Beggar's Banquet into harder rocking and demonic sexual territory          was well-defined with just results on Let It Bleed that became a bonafide hit and          also features guest appearances by Leon Russell (who wrote their chart-topping          classic hit Honky Tonk Women) and Ry Cooder.  The stellar track set is headed          by Gimme Shelter, with its post-apocalyptic lyrics and shimmering guitar lines; a           harmonica-driven Midnight Rambler; a remake of Honky Tonk Women just plain          titled Country Tonk; Monkey Man; the breathtaking You Can't Always Get What          You Want that is done with structured horns, epic tone, and spellbinding vocals.          Stand With Me; Keith Richards' rendition on Robert Johnson's Love In Vain and          finally ending on an exhilarating note with the druggy party ambience of the title          track, as the recording's evocative success come close to the down home blues          The Stones have made as the chemistry makes Let It Bleed a timeless must!

B00138GZYI|4.0|With Santana maintaining their successful stay on the jazz fusion spectrum as<br />  well as the occasional R&B or rock charts with mixed results, they would release<br />  their next album in 1975, their sixth overall, when they again credited themselves<br />  with individual credits listed for each song. Despite few problems, Borboletta had<br />  manage to become another successful venture for them as Carlos turned toward<br />  a casual complement of high-pitched guitar work while the percussions pounded<br />  away to whom they handled the making of this album so well and in good hands.<br />  Backed by a track set beginning with Spring Manifestations/ Canto De Los Flores<br />  that proceed with Life Is Anew, the harmonic serendipity charm of Practice What<br />  You Preach, the delightful Give And Take, the instrumental landscape of Mirage,<br />  Here And There and the African-style title track.  Though Borboletta (which stand<br />  for `butterfly' in Portuguese) did reached the Top 20 on the album charts and also<br />  spent less time their, it would produce plenty of robust success, as Carlos leaves<br />  us plenty of room for percussion, keyboard and saxophone solos to set the mood<br />  (evident on Spring Manifestations), as well as Carlos' guitar (evident on Promise<br />  Of A Fisherman) and vocals (evident on the funky guitar-led Give And Take) as it<br />  gives Borboletta it's style and finesse.  The album features guest appearances by<br />  noted jazz vocalist Flora Purim, Airto Moriera, and master electric bassist Stanley<br />  Clarke, which makes this session a well-deserved classic and a dazzling listening<br />  experience that will give it some greater attention.
B006QPX7UI|4.0|Very good acting (to be expected from the strong cast).  Authentic location and thousands of re-enactors.  And a great story and battle staging.  Overall quite an effort and a good film.  I loved the scene of Lee with Pickett's troops before their battle.<br /><br />I did not like the over-emphasis on Joshua Chamberlin... if you did not know better, you'd get the impression that Little Round Top was the main fighting on the 2nd day.  And then continuing the Chamberlin story on the third day when he was uninvolved.... I'm sure Jeff Daniels was happy but not history buffs.<br /><br />I also wish they had less dramatic speeches and even less of the over-orchestrated, tear jerker, symphonic music and more about the life of the soldiers and of the music of the day.  I further wish the movie had explored (and defended) Robert E. Lee's thinking.... yes he rolled the dice and lost but he knew he had to deliver a knock out punch (the South was about to be cut in half by Grant's control of the Mississippi in a few days, the coast was blockaded, and unlike the North that had a fresh supply of soldiers immigrating from Ireland and other countries, the South was running out of men to fight).<br /><br />Finally, the film could been much more realistic about the horrors of the injured and dying... the movie showed only a modest amount of blood, carnage, and agony, when in reality the battlefield and field hospitals were living hells.  However, I do appreciate that showing a realistic level of violence would have meant at least an R rating, and would also have spoiled the romanticized, heroic vision many have of this epic battle.
B00138JB6W|5.0|What would be hailed as one of his most celebrated albums, Carlos Santana<br />  once again top the rock charts and break new ground with this highly acclaimed<br />  instrumental rock classic in 1987 that still remain as challenging as ever.  On his<br />  fourth solo album (and CD!) Blues For Salvador, Santana delivers a challenging,<br />  but richly-detailed blockbuster heralded by solid guitar solos and it's atmospheric<br />  background that is guaranteed to give you a resounding and fascinating listening<br />  experience.  Backed by a muscular track set consists of world class instrumental<br />  rock, the CD is a catchall' of outtakes of the Santana band and stray tracks from<br />  the 1980's gathered up and put together by the great rock guitarist, as the songs<br />  include the opening track Bailando/ Aquatic Park, which proceed with others like<br />  I'm Gone, instrumental' versions of Hanibal and Deeper, Dig Deeper, two tribute<br />  songs that pays tribute to John Coltrane and Charles Mingus and Now That You<br />  Know (taken from a 1985 world tour).  What is even ironic about this magnificent<br />  CD is that it took an honest look at the conflict in El Salvador that began with the<br />  civil unrest against that nation's puppet regime that had resulted in long civil war<br />  throughout the 1980's as it looks toward the struggles and a bright future for this<br />  small once-troubled Central American nation.  A true Grammy Award winner for<br />  Best Rock Instrumental Performance of 1987, Blues For Salvador is a masterful<br />  labour of love for Santana himself done with style and ethereal brilliance, which<br />  will live on as a timeless masterful music achievement.

B00136LVXU|5.0|In the late-1960's, a bold and diverse new voice who emerged in San Francisco's          Height-Ashbury District made rock and roll history when a young aspiring rock guitar          virtuoso named Carlos Santana and his band of brothers were brought to Columbia          Records by concert promoter Bill Graham.  Also known as \\"Santana\\" (which happen          to be the name of his band), the Mexican-born rock guitar sensation had signed with          Columbia in 1968 that had started with a couple guest appearances in Stephen Sills'          Super Sessions and the versatile blues-rock duet classic The Further Adventures Of          Al Kooper And Mike Bloomfield (1969) that led to his landmark self-titled blockbuster          a year later.  Showcased with a brilliant mixture of rock mastery with Latin American          and African influences, the rock titan presented a soaring massive hit backed with a          pulsating track set that begin with the opening track Waiting and proceed with other          rock classics like the Top Ten hit Evil Ways, Shades Of Time, Jingo, Persuasion, as          well as the electrifying instrumental Soul Sacrifice, Savor and two live bonus tracks-          Soul Sacrifice and Fried Neckbones.  Released in August 1969, Santana confirmed          what the once-colourful and vibrant San Francisco rock scene and those who would          see them live at The Woodstock Music Festival already knew--Santana had created          fiery combination of traditional Latin rhythms and rock music which was as powerful          as it was riveting. With the core band boldly consisting of Carlos Santana on guitar-          vocals, Greg Rollie on the organ- vocals, David Brown on bass, Michael Shrieve on          the drums and Jose \\"Chepito\\" Areas and Mike Carabello on percussion, their debut          masterpiece even marked a brave new sound for rock that would change the music          forever, and the historic masterpiece sounds 100% betterin it's expanded edition!

B002KV4NTQ|5.0|With The Rolling Stones ending their contract with Decca Records with their last           album in 1971 with Stone Age, the band scored their next Top Ten hit Brown Sugar           (Stone Age also includes it) and switched over to Atlantic Records under there own           private Rolling Stones label.  With their contract with Atlantic solidified, The Stones           released Sticky Fingers the same year--the first album under their label, which also           contain the classic hit single Brown Sugar and brought The Stones back on the top           of the charts.  Filled with their brand of bad boy bravado, pulsating guitar solos and           a loose ram shackled ambience that bellies upon it's origins and dark undercurrent,           as over half of the album mentions drug use while it alludes to it in either in subject           matter or their tone, but they manage to keep it clean and in wise format.  However           the key element on his album is not the instrumental interplay, but terrific musician-           ship as the other tracks includes Sway, Wild Horses, Can't You Hear Me Knocking           (Mick Taylor, Brian Jones' replacement, gives an ample focus on the stretched out           coda), the mean-spirited Bitch (no offence to women everywhere) and even Sister           Morphine.  What's also ironic about Sticky Fingers is that it has occasional dash of           the blues- or country and western (I Got The Blues is a ravished late night classic)           that adds to the success of this timeless and enduring classic, as it owes up to the           off-handled mixture of decadence, roots music, high voltage rock and roll, dazzling           virtuosity and outright malevolence that this superlative piece de resistance set the           tone for the 1970's that started with Beggar's Banquet some three years earlier.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Awesome CD, one of the best he has ever done. All his live albums are awesome though!!!<br />Buy this, you will enjoy listening!!!
B00138KN3C|5.0|Signed to Columbia Records after being discovered by the great talent scout-   and producer John Hammond in 1972, this rising young, socially-conscious rock   star deeply committed to keeping the rock and roll tradition alive while speaking   for social causes stepped into the limelight as he soon became a very important   fixture on the rock scene.  Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J., released in 1973,   would introduce Bruce Springsteen And The E Street and to the rock scene and   the next generation of rock fans, which have found him squarely carrying on the   influence of Bob Dylan, folk-rock and even an electric band featuring both piano   or organ solos, capped by the saxophone solos of Clarence Clemmons and the   acoustic solos aided by the group’s husky vocals and lyrics filled of elaborated,   even exaggerated imagery.  Headed by an aspiring track set beginning with the   opening track Blinded By The Light--it was a much bigger hit for Manfred Mann   in 1977--as it is proceed by other tracks like Lost In The Flood, Mary Queen Of   Arkansas and the Good Samaritan-oriented It’s Hard To Be A Saint In The City.   Heading a diverse and energetic band consisting of Springsteen on lead vocals,   Clarence Clemmons on saxophone, keyboardist David Sancious (who also play   piano or organ) and Steven Van Zandt, Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. paint   a bright optimistic portrait of teenagers cocksure of themselves yet bowled from   there own discovery of the world that is saved from the pretentious eye and ear   for detail as the lyrics, melodies and solo arranging well-rooted while the rhythm   is mortified at breakneck speed.  So here is your direct chance to download this   debut classic that gave way to The Boss’ rise to international fame and fortune.

B00136JUTM|4.0|Following a four-year hiatus, Bruce Springsteen made his well-deserved return         to the recording studio in 1992 to release two successful CD’s, including this one.         Often steeped within mainstream pop-rock, rock and roll and social causes, while         using his vocabulary on what he wanted to say with a series of weightier matters,         Human Touch is a well-written generic pop CD which consist entirely on this type         minor material for which he seem capable of turning out in such an effortless and         endless manner.  With The E Street Band still out, Springsteen enlisted a session         drummer, Sam Moore of the R&B duo Sam And Dave, and Bobby Hatfield of The         Righteous Brothers as the track set begins on the title track and proceed on other         other memorable tracks like Soul Driver, 57 Channels (And Nothing On), the Top         40 classic Roll Of The Dice, Gloria’s Eyes, With Every Wish, Cross My Heart and         his rendition of the classic 1909 popular song Pony Boy.  Also featuring TV talent         judge, producer, TV personality and entrepreneur Randy Jackson on bass guitar,         the album did receive mixed reviews, but went on to become a well-deserved Top         20 hit on the album charts. Running about one hour, Human Touch will provide us         worth a good listen, even though it’s not the kind of recording you come to expect         from The Boss, which didn’t provided enough to aspire his greatness, but he have         managed to deliver some irony and provocation his greatness can offer as it even         became another of his best albums to date and that’s something that Springsteen         will always be remembered for.

B006645CFM|5.0|By 1978, Disco and Punk Rock had swept The Rolling Stones off the front pages          and nearly out of the spotlight, but the band had managed to give their music career          another shot when they released something different and rather unexpected.  Some          Girls would become their fiery response to the younger generation around that time,          but not without controversy.  During weeks after it's release, it was met with protests          who responded from a line from the title track they thought was racially chauvinistic,          but Mick Jagger truly stated the line in the song was a parody of racist attitudes, and          The Stones finally made a change on the album cover after getting several lawsuits.          Jagger would even hold an apology meeting with the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the civil          right leader's PUSH Organization headquarters to straighten the situation out, which          had to be done to clear the band's reputation, and with forgiveness soon achieved it          turned out to be a stunning success.  Starting on a high note with the disco-oriented          hit Miss You, the track set proceeds extremely well with other classic hits, like When          The Whip Comes Down, Keith Richards' outlaw hit Before They Make Me Run, the          snide country and western-themed Far Away Eyes, Beast Of Burdon (another of the          band's greatest hits), their alluring version of The Temptations' romantic classic Just          My Imagination (Running Away With Me) and Shattered.  Plus what you also get on          the deluxe edition are the 12 previously unheard tracks, notably with Claudine and I          Love You Too Much, which makes Some Girls quite an even bigger and unqualified          masterwork as well as the masterpiece that saved The Rolling Stones.
B001E70RT2|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good read there were some inconsistencys if you watch the show still a good read.
B002KV4P08|5.0|Although the album may be uneven in terms, it does manage to catch plenty of          artistic fire and highly versatile swinging merit as it became another successful hit,          and perhaps as one of their most celebrated masterpieces from the Stones canon.         First released in 1974, It's Only Rock And Roll showcase a tossed up combination           of unforgettable virtuosity, effortless musicianship, vivid solos and it's high-rocking          bravado that make this offbeat, free-spirited masterwork ranked as their finest and          most beloved albums.  As described on the album's cover, The Stones wear there          title as \\"The World's Greatest Rock And Roll Band\\" with a smirk, which reminds us          of how well their music can stand the test of time extremely well and on how bright          their music will stand in the future.  With attitude to spare, the performance on this          winning disc pack a boisterous punch, as the brilliant track set include If You Can't          Rock Me, the exhilarating Dance Little Sister, the joyous take on The Temptations'          1966 R&B classic Ain't Too Proud To Beg, the aching beauty with Time Waits For          No One, and the reggae experimentation of Luxury and the challenging title track,          as the band makes them sound all the enjoyable and played with stunning results.          When it came to the success of It's Only Rock And Roll, we certainly had to owe it          to The Stones for making it such an elaborate achievement as it's title even points          to the band's reputation as \\"The World's Greatest Rock And Roll Band\\", a position          they have held since 1970 just after The Beatles broke up, which serve as another          stark reminder of that proud reputation that the band still take tremendous pride in.

B00138GYXU|5.0|As Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band successfully entered the 1980’s in         full force and with absolute confidence, they released their next ambitious landmark         masterpiece that brought them even further into the music mainstream in 1980 and         redefine The Boss’ standing in the music world.  The River is their sweeping double         album (and 2-CD!) blockbuster which follow up on the themes and sounds of The E         Street Band that highly showcase a robust set of mid-tempo rock, multidimensional         solos stories of dissolution and hope in the working class, as well as of the struggle         that are often dealt with.  With a sweeping track set filled with both personal stories         and personal outcomes abeited with high authority and solid performing, the tracks         include Independence Day, Point Blank, the 8-minute plus Drive All Night, Ramrod,         Fade Away and the title track, while the rest also include more light-hearted or high         rocking classic hits including Sherry Darling, I’m A Rocker and Stolen Car. Another         high mark for the album is the smash hit Hungry Heart, as it became Springsteen’s         first Top Ten hit single, which combine a rollicking musical track with a more sober         typical theme which have made it a Number One hit across the Atlantic.  As one of         the most highly ambitious and well-publicized rock albums of the 1980’s, The Boss         and the band pulled no punches as they gradually showcased a masterful piece of         music making that became noted for it’s mixture of optimistic outlooks, darker mat-        erial, reconciliation, overcoming fears and a better tomorrow, as the elements help         contribute to it’s power and energy.  With an excellent combination of light-hearted         pop-rock, solid rock and roll, dramatic songwriting and occasional humour in a few         songs, this towering achievement highly well-showcase The Boss in a audio-driven         wide-screen style form.  Hailed as another of his greatest achievements, The River         is another powerful testament that will always remain just as timeless as ever.

B00138EWJI|5.0|This Review Is For The Deluxe 2-CD Legacy Edition!  ----------------------------------------------------------              With Santana already `the toast of the rock scene' and Carlos being hailed as a          powerful new voice on the electric guitar after the colossal success of Abraxis, the          band again electrified the critics and public alike with there third blockbuster album          in 1971 where it was met with the same critical and commercial success for which         their previous two groundbreaking albums did.  Santana III have again showcased          another round of highly supercharged performances, pulsating instrumental hits, a          unique brand of highly diverse musicianship and high voltage bravado, when upon          the album's release, a wild wind was blowing in from the San Francisco Bay Area          and mysticism filled the air where the heaviest currents came from Carlos Santana          his band of brothers.  Containing a high-pitched set of tracks which begins with the          primitive calliber-driven instrumental opening track Batuka, the high-rocking action          crashes ahead with other classic hits like No One To Depend On, the breathtaking          Top Ten hit Everybody's Everything, Toussaint L'Overture (their homage to Haiti's          first independent leader), Jungle Strut, Everything's Coming Our Way and a direct          take on Tito Puente's Para Los Rhumberos.  What an extravagant experience this          blockbuster album it became in which Santana showcases their fiery brew of rock,          jazz, salsa and Latin soul, then what you get from the deluxe edition of Santana III          is a whole concert recorded at the famed Filmore West on July 4, 1971, which add          to the fireworks and demonstrates a far diverse artistry as it show their devotion to          perfected artists like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Tito Puente and Jimi Hendrix, as          well as fantastic live versions of classic hits from the Abraxas and Santana II sess-         ions, such as Black Magic Woman, No One To Depend On, Incident At Neshabur,          Jungle Strut and their jubilant finale take on Gumbo, in which Disc Two makes this          landmark masterpiece the ultimate edition of it's kind.           P.S.: Though I did bought the Legacy Edition when it came out, I may want to          highly recommend to Amazon.com that they finally include this Deluxe Edition          of Santana III, because it will not only give us the complete edition of the highly          explosive masterpiece, but also the live performance in which Carlos and his          band performed at The Fillmore West (now known as The Fillmore) on July 4th,          1971, just prior to the blockbuster album's Fall release of that year. So it will be          a great privilege that they finally include the Legacy Edition of Santana III in the          MP3 Department here on Amazon.com, that way it will bring this masterpiece          much greater success and lasting respect to download in our MP3 sets (I-Pods          also included!).

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Neil Gaiman has a loyal and well deserved following. In his previous works he has a unique ability of placing reality and mysticism in the same tale and not only have it result a captivating tale but one that gives its readers pause to think and reflect. While \\"Ocean\\" had the potential to echo Gaiman's previous works, to me, only a humble reader, he came up short.<br /><br />While the nostalgic thrust of the opening chapter does lock the reader into the memory's of his/her own childhood, once the author has us there he fails to develop a meaningful experience. Three female characters who have lived forever and are on earth at this time to fight strips of evil yard goods or blood thirst pterodactyls? A protagonist who returns numerous times to a mystical childhood setting and each time he departs he forgets that he was there? A father figure who not only has an affair on his wife but attempts to drown his son in a bathtub? A poverty stricken family razes the family home only to build a new house? A pond, that's called an ocean, produces magical results that we are never told its symbolic importance or how this magically fits into the overall concept of eternity.<br /><br />No, such novels as \\"Stardust\\", \\"The Graveyard Book\\" and \\"Neverwhere\\" will remain, in my mind, as adult fantasy classics. But, like all great authors, not every output can reach one's previous lofty standards. This is a classic example of that....
B006ZNRD06|1.0|It's a clear example of deceptive marketing. 7 days of trial and $4.99 after. Coders did their job well -  it's stable on RK3188 chip and hasn't lip sync lag like wondershare player, but marketing is a shame don't support it.

Chinese food means you enjoy it while you eat it but you can be hungry a short while after and it seems like you forgot you ate it. Steak and potatoes, is my food that sticks to you and makes you feel full (not necessarily good healthwise) and you remember the film the next day and maybe for several days. Rice cake movie is a boring movie, which is the worst of the worst.
B000KF7GXO|5.0|Probably the best album of Alannah. This is the one to follow. Perfect. I love it since I was a child.
B001B6EAOY|5.0|I have tried: SANOXY® Dual MicroSD to MS PRO DUO Adapter (Black) for Sony PSP. And that adapter was a failure, TWICE!<br />Had problems recognizing the Second MicroSD card.<br /><br />I have been using this Photofast adapter out-of-the-box for ~28 days since it arrived. I am using two Sandisk 8GB MicroSD cards.<br />So total Capacity is &#60;16GB.<br /><br />Compared to 4 MS Pro-duo during usage, there were no notable lags when read by my PSP 2000. I own Two PSP 2000 so it was easy to compare side-by-side. Both are on 6.60 Pro-CFW.<br />MS Pro-DUO Sandisk 4GB Ultra II Magic Gate<br />MS Pro-DUO Sandisk 512MB Ultra II Magic Gate<br />MS Pro-DUO Lexar 4GB Magic Gate<br />MS Pro-DUO Sandisk 1GB Magic Gate<br /><br />Movies, Music, and Back-ups of my games all run smoothly with no glitches, no lags, and no screen-rips.<br /><br />I have tried playing with the Photofast Adapter for over 4-hour sessions and only the area of the Memory Stick reader got a little mellow warm. But never got HOT nor burned my Motherboard.<br /><br />Had the PSP run for 8 hours and I guess the the reader of the MoBo got used to it but it never got HOT compared to running a UMD for over 1 hour LOL. With a UMD it gets so hot it tingles my fingers which is scary sometimes.<br /><br />ALL in ALL i'm a satisfied customer of this product. At the time I bought this product, the price was double what you pay now. But I rather pay more than to receive a defective product and run the risk of losing my data.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have really enjoyed this whole series so far. I was surprised at the endin of this book as I thought it wasa trilogy. Now I anxiously await book 4.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|With the death of the writer of Bond movies, this 007 was written by a new writer as I understand it.  A woman. It had a depth to it.  No, there wasn't as much techie cool stuff, but there was a personal depth to it that 007 movies typically don't have.  I have to say I was both thrilled and yet let down.  007 movies are known for the cool techie stuff and the romance as well as the action.  If this 007 had a few more gadgets, a little more action AND the depth it portrayed......to me....., this would be the ultimate 007 James Bond movie!  Not like the old, not like the new, but simply perfect.<br /><br />That being said, the acting  was superb, the plot good.  Would I watch it a second time? Probably not.  It just didn't connect with me as the audience at the level I expected it to.  If you come to this movie with no expectations, you will most probably find it entertaining.  Its not a bad movie, I gave it 4 stars, that means its worth the watch even if it doesn't hit all the right magical spots for everyone.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I'm not sure you can play games as well as they say you can, perhaps I'm all thumbs?!?  But it works well over LAN in my house and that's all I need it for.  I've no experience with the over the internet connection so I can't honestly say how that works.
B00AE2I4B6|1.0|I tried to watch it via streaming and it just kept buffering! Waste of time and money. I had to order it through my cable company.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|It's a real time strategy game that's easy to pick up and play a game.  The graphics are bright and colorful and the A.I. can be dialed down to your tastes. It reminds me of Auralux but with defined lanes (which you can destroy and create in later games).  I wish I could put into better detail WHY I like it but I just do.  You'll have to go with that! :-)
0060229357|5.0|My husband and I are expecting our firsts (twins) and as I'm a teacher and he's a librarian, I thought it appropriate that his first Father's Day gift be a set of books he can share and enjoy with his own sons. Harold and his mighty imagination and that iconic purple crayon offer up the perfect bonding material, and the hardcover edition has a beautiful cover and nicely printed pages that will look great adorning the boys' bookshelf. Great story with simple language that covers the complex and intricate topic of imagination - a must read before being all grown up... And then a must read again in adulthood for that easy reminder of what it's like to be a kid.
0756688701|5.0|I really like the diecast car that comes with the book.  they have a lot of cars that neat to find.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I think my wife struggled with the movie she did say this is slow. It not a hard hitting action movie. I felt Mr. Lewis did a very good job as Lincoln. It was a good movie and I am glad I watch it.
B00CWV8X04|1.0|Was not able to view movie after :24 minutes.  Movie froze up at this point and we were not able to get past this point in the movie. Would like a refund or credit for this movie.  Thank you.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is just a guilty pleasure. Can't help but watch. Love Katey Segal and Kurt Sutter. It's not for everyone, I'll admit. But its something my hubby and I can watch and enjoy together.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was a bittersweet end to the trilogy. It made the other two books seem relatively &#34;light&#34;.<br />It makes the reader aware of suspected thoughts brought about the other book.<br />It explains, it helps visualize Panem, and it shows the feelings hidden by pretense in the first two books.<br />The trilogy is an intriguing look into a different world in which we see speckles of history.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the AI of the game. Very smarts. The menu is very small. But is a very simple and fascinating game.  I like the animations.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Mads is a great actor to play the infamous hannibal. He seems to embrace the character, and his odd looks are great for it too.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Interesting subjects good actors. Alicia always tries to keep her cool working and taking care f her children and house.  Always good acting.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|One of my most useful as well as used apps.  The combination of sounds you can create is endless.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />Even my dog likes this one
B005HEDI3K|4.0|If there was ever a series that offered good chemistry among the actors, it was the original Star Trek.  While at the time, many saw the story lines as works of genius, in reality they were western civilization story lines, especially Greek and Shakespearean eras, set in some outer space context.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I love checking my problems without having to lug my laptop around. It also makes it faster than going on their website through your phone/tablet.
B009CGRMFE|5.0|Safe House offers a solid action film in the vein of Bourne Identity and Taken.  Denzel Washington, who co-produced and starred in the film, clearly helped Ryan Reynolds become an action star.
B00AK57N00|5.0|This is the most addictive game I've ever had on either my phone or Kindle. Play it on both platforms.
159463176X|5.0|A great book of reflection.<br />I love the way it looks at the different actions of people and why they do what they do and how it effects the person they become.<br /><br />Brilliant read.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Superb piece of set for fans and collectors.<br />BDLive with dynamicHD does not work on all BD models ... :/<br />But taking tht aside, everything is superb
B0049J3QF4|4.0|Great movie for children especially.  It totally held my 7 year old grandson's attention.  It is a family and kid friendly movie which is not easy to come by these days.  I would recommend it to any family that does not want to second guess if a movie is appropriate if you are cautious about what you watch in your home.
B006YMLE7G|5.0|This movie starts out with an amazing pace of action, and doesn't stop till the end. A must see for anime fans or anyone who likes a good movie. Awsome animation, fun story what else do you need?
B009ZE27US|5.0|It is such a great game. It is so funny too! I put my finger to it and it said I was forty-five but I'm really eleven! Great game makes a lot of laughs.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I've watch movie several times. Great story (science fiction,action and romance),Great special effects and awesome lead actress. And for a dog lover you get Willa.Must see...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|6 out of 5 stars...<br /><br />I don't even know how to begin to describe my feelings for Hopeless! I'm not sure there are enough words to describe how passionate I am about this book. I think every person who loves to read needs to read this masterpiece.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover with Hopeless has absolutely changed the way I read books. It is the standard for which I grade every other book with and nothing has yet to compare for me. Ever.<br /><br />Hopeless starts by introducing Sky, a teenage girl who has been sheltered her entire life. I'm talking seriously sheltered, no cell phone, no computer or Internet access and absolutely no TV, but surprisingly she harbors no resentment towards her mother for this lifestyle. Her only friend is leaving to study abroad in Europe just days before she is slated to begin her first day ever at a public school, she grew up being homeschooled.<br /><br />And let's not forget about Holder, upon being introduced, you learn he is the ultimate good looking, seriously bad boy with a shady past and a great sense of humor. He is passionate yet you find yourself just as frustrated with him as Sky, not understanding his ever present mood swings. I was constantly racking my brain trying to figure out what made him tick, what set him off. Does he care for Sky or has whatever he keeps hidden from his past ruined him?<br /><br />Sky and Holder have a strong connection and intense feelings neither one can deny nor do they seem capable of facing them. Colleen's writing links you emotionally with Sky, she allows you to feel and experience everything Sky does. There were times I found myself laughing out loud, not just a chuckle but genuine laughter. Then in a matter of a couple of pages real tears were running down my face! This story is an emotional roller coaster and you don't even see the falls, twists and turns that Colleen throws at you! I can tell you I was shocked as all the details of this story poured out and the pieces of the puzzle were put together. This is a tragically beautiful story about first love, finding yourself and confronting the demons of your past. Yes, Colleen you are seriously brilliant! God gifted you with an amazing imagination and then paired it with the gift of story telling.<br /><br />Sky and Holder's story invoked so many consuming thoughts and feelings that I'm still thinking about it now, six months since I first read the book! This is not just a book but a journey.ere put together. This is a tragically beautiful story about first love, finding yourself and confronting the demons of your past. Yes, Colleen you are seriously brilliant! God gifted you with an amazing imagination and then paired it with the gift of story telling.<br /><br />Sky and Holder's story invoked so many consuming thoughts and feelings that I'm still thinking about it now, six months since I first read the book! This is not just a book but a journey.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked this 2nd book a little more than the first book. More suspense and better pace. The enemy is clearly defined. Looking forward to reading the 3rd book.
B007HO392S|4.0|Carrie Underwood has an underlayer of anger, or so it seems.<br />Several of the songs on this and recent albums talk about getting even with men.<br />That's great from the standpoint of songwriting.  And the songs have great hooks<br />and great lyrics with well-turned phrases as refrains.<br />There are some lesser songs on the album, but at least half of these songs could be<br />radio hits and/or on a personal compilation of the &#34;best of&#34;.
B009NZPWOM|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! Christian Slater is amazing, Brad Pitt is hilarious... And all around the actors are just awesome!
1476733953|4.0|I just finished Wool, the Omnibus Edition.  I am a lover of dystopian Sci Fi, and I found the story interesting and full of unpredictable twists.  I do agree with the reviewers who complained about the lengthy descriptions and laborious detail. Some of this was hard to trudge through. I can barely comment on the credibility of the science in the story because I am simply not that smart.  I will say that although I do not remember a specific year being mentioned, it's apparent that the story takes place in a future 200+ years from now. Who knows what the tech will be by then.<br /><br />I can say that I enjoyed the characters and plot(s).  Notwithstanding the aforementioned passages of minute detail, I still enjoyed the writing style.  The pros by far outweigh the few cons and I will purchase other works from Mr. Howey.<br /><br />ps. I had to go on the blogs to figure out the significance of the title. Pretty sneaky.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My granddaughter really likes playing this game, she wants to play it all of the time. Good times for all
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|We went to see this movie with my 7 year old daughter, who is a total fanatic about MLP FIM.  My husband and I are genuine bronies as well (oh, sorry, I guess I'm a \\"pegasister\\"), and we thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The storyline was great, the speed of introducing the characters was perfect, and the villain was a true meanie.  I thought the ending was a bit rushed and quite frankly a little scary for little ones (under age 5), but overall, we are definitely going to buy this when it comes out on DVD.<br /><br />I loved the multiple hidden easter eggs throughout the movie, as well as a \\"human\\" version of every single pony in the franchise series.  There were some funny scenes and catchy one-liners in the movie as well, and the character of each of the \\"human\\" girls stayed true to their pony characters.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|If you're looking for a good read to make you fall asleep at night, it'll do the trick. Short chapters, not much thought or imagination required.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I always love the costumes and scenery, so that alone makes watching worthwhile.  There wasn't as much downstairs backstabbing and family quarrels this season, but still pretty good script, and as usual very well acted.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Absolutely loved this book with its clever insights into the world of the Aspergers syndrome via the loveable character Don.  This book made me laugh out loud numerous times but was also poignant and thought provoking.  Several other people have read it on my recommendation and without exception, they have all thoroughly enjoyed it too. Well done Graeme Simpsion!
B00DBTBHR2|2.0|The phantasmagoric, fairy tale libretto of The Magic Flute seems to cry out for cinematographic treatment. One can do things in the movies that are impossible onstage. Ingmar Bergman had his go, producing a classic treatment, and now it is Branagh's turn. His film is lushly imaginative, but in my view overly so.  There are so many self consciously brilliant ideas that the mind and the heart find no place to rest.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the music track. Tempos are rushed, probably to keep pace witb Branagh's vision, and the singing is uneven, to say the least (In the Bergman film, a so-so performance was salvaged by the directorial genius). The weakest link in this current film is the utterly miscast Tamina, not particularly compelling in her physical presence, but, much more crucial, with almost no singing voice at all.  How did an intelligent director manage to make such a colossal mistake?<br /><br />If this treatment helps to find new friends for Mozart's transcendentaly  beautiful score, than so much the better. Mozart's music is eternal, after all.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love all of the toca games but please make toca band for kindle fire that is my favorite game but I only get to play it on my friends iPad :) -gummibearxx
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Depp and Jolie headline this tale of intertwined story lines, who is who, what is happening, and who's doing what?  Jolie plays a high-profile beauty who also happens to be the significant other of a criminal who is on the run.  In order to throw Interpol off of her trail in her effort to be reunited with \\"him\\", she selects an American school teacher (Depp) seemingly at random while on a train, and gathers him into this web of intrigue.  He is clearly in over his head...with her, not to mention everything else.<br /><br />Jolie and Depp do top-notch jobs.  The story is engaging, the character development is good, and you are not likely to figure out what's really going on until the very end.<br /><br />There are great backdrops, and I have to say that even though I don't care much for who-dunnits I like this film and I'm very happy that it's part of my collection.<br /><br />To sum up, I'd say that this is a dark horse film that received very little attention when it was released, and is something of an underdog.  I suggest that you give it a look/another look and see what you thnk.<br /><br />4 solid stars.  It's not just for Depp or Jolie fans.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use!! Easy to see and handy to have ready when you need it on the go or at home!Everyone should get it<br />Great app!!
B00136NUG6|5.0|I owned [[ASIN:B00000JQFI The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol.1]] for many years, but somewhere along the line I lost that CD.  Then not too long ago I saw this new compilation of EW&F's greatest hits listed among one of Amazon's $5 album offerings.  I checked it out and found track after track that to me epitomize this iconic group during it's R&B and disco eras.<br /><br />There are 17 tracks in this collection, and IMO, at least 11 of them are solid gold.  I have to admit that this kind of music appeals to me because I was in HS/college during the heyday of Earth, Wind and Fire.<br /><br />Particularly popular and notable tracks that were popular \\"back then\\" and regularly make appearances here and there on oldies stations as well as in movies, etc., are:<br />- Shining Star<br />- That's the Way of the World<br />- September<br />- Got to Get You into My Life<br />- Sing a Song<br />- Fantasy<br />- Reasons<br />- Let's Groove<br />- Boogie Wonderland<br />- After the Love has Gone<br />- Getaway<br /><br />Some of these tracks are so iconic of the disco era that you can almost see the silk shirts, huge collars, and white suits...scary isn't it.  Yet, it's completely fun!<br /><br />5 stars for great songs and great memories!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|This game is fun and my niece really enjoys it but, it does have a lot of similarities to the free version and internet is practically required. It also drains my battery out . So unless you only want to play it connected to a chart  and in WiFi areas I suggest sticking with the free version , it doesn't drain out the battery as bad.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|As much as many critics did not like this movie I must say they are ALL WRONG...a most entertaining presentation, well done with excellent effects....I really wish there would be a John Carter 2 or something like that. I put this with the movies I can watch over and over and enjoy it each time......not as dark as Bladerunner or the Matrix and with just pure fun down to the speedy unusual dog....you will not find a better story and movie for the kids.  Just goes to show you do not have to have R rating and use 4 letter words to present to adults....or the shock value of terror to get people to see movies.....I wish there is another soon......with the same actors/actress.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I love that it is the best mixer in world on Amazon doing this is acutely fun and recording music and mixes is awesome
1612680011|4.0|Good for thinking outside of the box, and gives some new ideas for creating streams of income. Easy to read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a pretty good app and it has great graphics. It is perfect for all houses lovers. I recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As he's matured he's become more human, more mature, more adept.  I like this Harry Bosch because of his humanity. I guess the same could be said for Mr. Connelly too. First class in every way.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Probably more convincing to agnostics than hardened skeptics, but should make even the skeptics stop and think. A real comfort to those who have lost  a loved one.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|I enjoy the game itself and the abilities make it different, and more fun, than similar games. The problem is that if I quit the game within the app (vs going to home and task killing) the app tends to freeze to the point of forcing me to power off and reboot the device.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A thorough exploration of introversion and extroversion and the effects of social perception/misperception.  Excellent reading for personal reflection, better understanding of those around us, and for creating more effective classrooms and work environments.  Susan Cain deftly celebrates the strengths of all temperaments with insight to bringing out the best in all of us.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|My grandson may be the only 8 year old in America who has not seen Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  He has read the book, but his parents do not permit him to watch videos......but when he comes to MY house, watch out!<br /><br />I had never rented a video from AmazonPrime before and I found it to be easy and intuitive, even for a non-techie.  It was fun for us to watch this captivating movie together!
0140544518|5.0|This is a great twist on the old tale, very interesting and fun specially for a parent that reads a lot of their kids. I'm not sure my 3 year old understands the whole story and she's not familiar w/ the original, so that may be why. But it's a good book non the less.
B007WOA3L8|4.0|There are a couple of guide books I've used for a May 2014 trip to these three countries. It's difficult to find information about Azerbaijan and I did not find any separate guide books for Azerbaijan. The book is well organized and has a section about Nagorno-Karabakh Republic which is Armenian but entirely surrounded by Azerbaijan. We plan to visit there too but it's difficult to get good information. I actually bought the Kindle edition and learned that using a Kindle for a guidebook is a waste of time. Last time I'll bother with that.Good guide--but not great like the DKs
0811879542|5.0|We love this book. My daughter is 3 years old and LOVES this book. Now, it's super interactive, so we've stopped reading it at night before bed because it gets her all excited, plus she's usually eating a snack so her hands are busy.<br />I was very surprised and excited at how creative the book is.<br />There are some refences to left and right and tilt, which the adult would have to do, or coach the child to help with. but it's super exciting and fun!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|So Android armor found a threat on my Kindle, I didn't think es file explorer was the the threat, but boy was I wrong! I WILL SUE THE COMPANY WHO MADE THIS APP! &gt;:(
B002RVCD6O|5.0|I always enjoy the Harry Potter series.  J.K. Rawling would have a hard time topping these books.  I think they are really worth the time.  Always love a good story.
B00011CZRE|2.0|Just did not care for the movie itself.  Someone else may like it it was just not my bag, that's all.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|Again I don't enjoy the movies as much as I do the books.  There is so much in the books that the movies left out but they were good movies in their own right.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun game. Doesn't consume too much time and the dinosaurs are cool. The dollars vs coins is stupid, but people need their money.
B005UG542S|5.0|I have found that as the movies get more into being action focused and less on keeping to the books, I don't enjoy them as much but I still love Harry Potter and the movie was good in that it could stand on its own.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Who do I love more...Christian Grey or Gideon Cross? I'm actually torn loo.Sylvia Day has written the only worthy competition to 50 Shades...love it!
B005HEDIHG|5.0|The remastered version is a renovation of the original series.  New effects mask and clean up the sometimes clunky effects of the original's limited budget.  The result is a cleaner, more vibrant experience without the distraction of some of the more primitive fx of 1960's series.  It is a pleasure to watch.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|This CD is easy to listen to and very enjoyable. This group gets better all the time. I love it.
B005R7DAWG|5.0|The story of Edmond Dantes is an eternal classic, where you follow him from his start as a young innocent sailor, to the focal point of Parisian life as the Count of Monte Cristo. Passion, friendship, revenge, greed. It's all there!
B003G4W4CY|5.0|This is one of the great stories from Arthur C Clarke, I had read it before in paperback format and was pleased to get it in Kindle format. I rate this as one of his best novels.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Difficulty of some levels isuktea frustrating.  None are easy and that's okay but difficulty should be progressive. . Otherwise it is quite entertaining.
1609613937|4.0|After reading the first chapter realize how starch foods are actually good for your health.... Very impress with the results.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have enjoyed reading most every book that John Grisham has written.  He's easy to read and his stories are easy to follow.  I recommend this book.
B00DU74U74|2.0|No great movie.  it follows the book pretty well but there's no excitement. Too sterile. I really couldn't get emotionally involved in the movie.
B004P8JPS6|1.0|Unreasonable a stupid Heeman doing things that wouldn't happen This guy makes James Bond seem like child . Was fooled I thought it would get better as I read more  No Way
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Just wanted to preview the last episode prior to going to the movies to see the new Red2! Good action and fun for the adults in the family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thought this game was very funny and easy to control. I would recommend it for anyone who likes &quot;run&quot; games and the adorable antics of the minions.
B00499QUK2|5.0|The movie is simply wonderful, worth watching. Though situated in the modern time the story doesn't lose the true ingenuity of Sherlock Holmes.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We love the minions and Gru -this movie has enough to keep ME and my busy 3 year old interested
B008133MDK|5.0|BBC does it again - can't wait for the next season. Cumberbatch and Martin are pitch perfect - the casting director should get an Emmy.
B009JZWWGC|5.0|What can you say, it's Star Trek! I have nothing negative to say about any of the movies. There are lots of &#34;inside&#34; jokes that only someone who has taken the time to watch all the episodes of the original series can get, but definitely worth watching.
B00A9ET4MC|3.0|Adiche is so skillful with descriptions of human behavior and so clever with dialogue. But I was disappointed to see no evidence of compassion for the people described, not even her heroine. It felt like half a story.
B008RJFRTK|1.0|Crap!  Does not work on Kindle Fire! It is to hard to use and it has very limited worth or use.
B003KK65KG|5.0|Very though provoking and kind of scary. Shows how bullying can push someone over the edge. Once again brilliant writing.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|i really like to read Harry Bosch novels.  Great airplane reading.  Now that business class has electrical connections for my Kindle- long overseas flight are more enjoyable.

0525952926|1.0|Not only a draggy bore, but simplistic and shallowly plotted.  Coincidences abound, and historical figures (such as Clement Attlee, Churchill and FDR) and activities (such as the attack on Pearl Harbor) only exist in the story to be conveniently  present or happening when the fictional characters need them to be present or happening, to move the sluggish plot along.<br /><br />These characters are a pastiche of stereotypes and I couldn't find it in me to care one rap what was going to happen to any one of them - in most cases, I found myself predicting what was going to happen to them anyway.<br /><br />The thing I hate the most about this novel is that the author, instead of trying to recreate beliefs and attitudes of people living in the Depression/WWII era as they really were --filters a politically correct 21st-century vein into his already badly composed fiction.  I assume this is done so that no reader would take offense.<br /><br />For example, instead of honestly depicting a mother's feeling about her homosexual son, which in the 1940's more than likely would have been:  homosexuality is a grave sin and/or a form of mental illness -- instead, Follett portrays her \\"understanding\\" her son's sexuality, grasping what his friendship with a man really is, and accepting it all reasonably & calmly.  C'MON!  If you're going to write fiction set in the 1940's, about characters who are alive even *before* the 1940's, depict it honestly, with all the blots and stains!  The author does his readers no service by writing politically correct, weak soap opera.  I get offended when prejudices and predilections of the past are watered down.  These beliefs existed; these prejudices affected the lives of REAL people, often in drastic ways.  It's a dangerous weakness, and disrespectful, to try to make the past all \\"cleaned up\\" - writing it as you wish it it had been, rather than what it really was.<br /><br />Ugh.  I can't even think of enough bad things to write about this novel.  That there's a third book to come in this trilogy makes me shudder.  I won't be reading it.o come in this trilogy makes me shudder.  I won't be reading it.

B0091REZMW|5.0|The game is super entertaining, images are great and the levels are challenging. Best of all the game is free! Quality is also fantastic. 5 stars
B00CLD65X0|5.0|We just caught The Downton Abbey fever.  Thankfully, we are prime members So all three seasons were free to watch.  I cannot believe we have to wait until January for season four!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book in a day because I couldn't put it down! The story kept me guessing from start to finish. What a great book!
B001NA6096|5.0|Brought me back to the freedom of my youth. Fast paced for a movie that is predominantly a long conversation.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love English Historical Movies, this is great one with a lovely heart warming appeal. Loved all the actors in the the series.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|This was a great movie from beginning to end. Mr. Washington's portrayal of the slain civil rights leader was riveting.  This is a must see!

B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one of those shows that is the perfect mix of both a serious drama and a funny drama. A legal comedy drama.
0316172324|4.0|Another book that points out some new ideas but I'm not sure about how they will work in actual application.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|A straightforward, fun read. Slightly indulgent for an 80's kid, but more referential than deep. Looking forward to see how this translates into a movie.
