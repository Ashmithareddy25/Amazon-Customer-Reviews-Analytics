B0060ZJ74O|5.0|Movie was in good shape.  Used as a gift so hopefully the person who received the movie enjoys it.  Received by Christmas.
B00005KB9T|1.0|Really should specify that this is a compact disc an not a vinyl. Really disappointed that I have to go through the trouble of returning it and getting the right thing when two letters could have saved me the trouble.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I am not sure what prompted me to buy this book in the first place but I am very glad I did. Well written, great stories and a challenge to look at organizational and personal habits made this for a great read. I have recommended to everyone I know.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|fun and challenging-some pop ups but reasonable amount.  Would like clearer example of what to do to get more points.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie was very good! Great acting! The sings were popular and current. I would recommend this movie. Wish the pricing was a little better.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I enjoy reading the books by Charles Dickens, but for some reason I had not read A Christmas Carol.  I very much enjoyed the book and will make re-reading A Christmas Carol a new holiday tradition.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it, I could not put the book down had to read all three books.  I woould recommend it A++++
B0034G4P7G|4.0|This is just another good story written by life. If you wanna understand internet economy and the people who live and breath it - watch this. It's a great story and no matter whether you like Mr Zuckerberg & Co, an essential watch.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it, I could not put the book down had to read all three books.  I woould recommend it A++++
0689835604|3.0|This is a cute flip up book. My daughter loved flipping the items up and finding things. The flip ups are very stiff though so I had to work them a several times to get them to the point she could do it herself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy for the Hunger Games was excellent.  I couldn't put the books down..  Adventure and mystery everywhere.  I highly recommend them.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I wanna pre order season 3 but does anyone know if this set includes the christmas special for this season??
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Eddie Vedder! It was a great movie and the sound track was out standing. Another on of those purchases that I could have just downloaded, but something about owning the cd just makes a difference. No, to find the LP.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|This movie was a decent remake of the original. It didn't have anything that really stood out from the first one. Worth watching but nothing to write home about.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|As far as a jet fighter game goes, this one is better than some I`ve seen.  The only real drawback that I can see is you can only go so far in points and you have to make an in app purchase, I have yet to find the option in the game to do this.  I guess I`m stuck playing and not gaining points until I find it.  But I will keep playing, and some day I may find it.<br /><br />2nd Review, 2 days after purchase:<br /><br />This game deserves the 5 stars that I originally gave it, but I can`t wait for some updates, especially to the ability of the jets to track other jets a little better. Now as far as the original problem from my first review, the game lets you go so far into the missions and then requires an in app purchase to go any further into the points, awards, and years.  I have since figured out, with my sons help, that you need to go into the settings and change the option be able to see the future years jets, when you go back to the game and try to use a new jet, there will be a $ in place of the usual key to unlock the jet.  Depressing that will give you an option to purchase the jet for $0.99.  Doing this will enable you to go further into the game, and start earning points again.<br /><br />I'd also like to see an option in the future to enable the player to more easily select the jet they want to use, without having to scroll through all of them bycountry and date.  just a thought.
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|What can be said other than the Way of Kings is incredible. This was my first encounter with Brandon Sanderson's writing and I must say I was highly impressed. Admittedly I do not read a lot of fantasy books. Don't get me wrong, I love fantasy and I've mainly satisfied that part of my imagination through other media. The Way of Kings showed me that the true fantasy adventure is still only found in the tale of a book. Only here do you have room for deep plots, character building, and an incredible world. And Sanderson definitely takes the room. This book is massive, but the way Sanderson writes, the thousand pages flew by with a wonderful cinematic feel. Is the story without flaw, of course not, but the point is I was so enraptured and having so much fun that I look at the flaws as part of the journey of experiencing the book itself. After all, that's why I read, for pleasure and the experience of someone else's world.<br /><br />After finishing this book I've now moved on to Mistborn, which I'm half way through. And I'm also exploring other writers and series as well. And of course I'm just waiting expectantly for Stormlight 2.
B000MGB6M8|3.0|It ws good but it just makes me mad when I think that his movie broke up Jennifer and Brad
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Thankyou so much for your thoughtfulness. I enjoyed this movie! the new one played fine. I did not expect a new movie.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I have so much fun playing games like this! I would recommend it to everyone I know!!! It's sooo much fun!
B0060CXN2O|5.0|Love this movie. I watch it frequently...it's simple, clean, and funny. Maureen OHara represents a bygone era of Hollywood style. I recommend this title by all means.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am an old school sci-fi fan and while this series wasn't perfect it enjoyed it with only a minimum amount of page skimming.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I love Kimbra's style and music. She seems to be very underrated but I can't wait to see her when she plays live in the States.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Please put this as the free app of the day $7.00 is a lot of money, and I can't just go spending my money on random stuff.  PLEASE PUT THIS AS THE APP OF THE DAY!!!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game is good for helping you think outside the box. Fun and cute. Great for my sons. I would reccommend it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Nice graphics.  Decent story line,  good combination of hidden objects and puzzles.  Has zoom feature which is very nice for mobile play.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just a great read!  The entire universe, characters, and pacing are just phenomenal! On to Second Shift as soon as I finish this review!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Excellent game, even the free version!!<br />The ad's are a bummer, but still worth the time. This is the ONLY game I have even considered buying the Full version! (;<br /><br />ggqsr
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I bought Rio for my 5 yr old grandson for Christmas.  He loved it.  He laughed and laughed and laughed.  What a joy to see him enjoy a funny, cute, wholesome movie!  I would highly recommend it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|5 stars addicted to this show. I suggest it to everyone. Did not think I would like it at first but really do
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absolutely love minecraft, but it just doesn't update. The next update should have lava an d water and buckets and flint and steel on creative, and buckets on survival.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game its safe enough I can let my daughter help me play plus I can enjoy watching the Tv show and play the game
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I got this because I love Doctor Who and I cosplay.<br /><br />INSTALLMENT:<br />Alright, they give you the batteries but you have to put it in yourself. It's really easy. You pull a button off and unscrew the button and then pull and add the batteries. Then you place it back together and BOOM. Sonic Screwdriver that lights up and makes noise.<br /><br />FUN:<br />I carry this with me EVERYWHERE. I have it in my purse at all times just in case I get a Doctor Who moment. It's great for the Doctor Who fan. I'm a fan of the 9th and 10th, so I got this one. The 11th is cool but I can never forget my first doctor.<br /><br />PEN:<br />The UV ink isn't that strong. You really need to press down and then pull the UV light close to the paper. It's not as seen. It's also only good on regular paper. I tried putting it on my wedding invitations to determine who is who (if they didnt write their name on it) and it didn't work. So regular paper only.<br /><br />The pen nub part kept falling off. It's not really secured. Also, when I just want to use the pen (regular), it was hard taking off the cap without pulling off the pen nub section.<br /><br />CON:<br />The button is also loose now. :(<br /><br />NOTE:<br />Great for cosplaying.<br />Great for photo ops.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Sitting at the keyboard and writing a review of a $2.50 product might seem like a waste of time, but that is what the developers of PicShop are counting on: customers who say \\"Oh, well...\\"  and move on.  The short of it is adding layers and various stickers is a hit and miss proposition.  The app will allow you to import a layer (from another photo) or a sticker (hair-do or attention=getter) and position/size it, but when you apply the action the new layer/sticker just disappears.  About half of the extra effects actually work.  Discovering which do is a frustrating and disappointing exercise.  I bought the app primarily because it allows export of higher resolution files after processing.  It does that.  What it also does is bake down the original image when it is initially opened in the app so processing is performed on a degraded image (many fewer pixels than what was in your original picture) that the user can later save as a larger version (supposedly higher resolution) version of a very down-sampled image. So the saved/processed file is 8 mp rendering of an image the app downsized to well under 1 mp during the processing (perhaps to accommodate limited processing capabilities of the tablet/phone?).<br /><br />Bottom line: some extras just plain don't work on the Kindle Fire HD.  And the app produces a high quality bake down of a low quality rendering.  As the movie makers say, \\"Maybe they will fix it in post production.\\"
B009MF56GC|5.0|One of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. Non stop action from beginning to end! Awesome,
B001AQO3QA|5.0|What more is there to say. It's well packaged and it has tons of good features. If your a fan of the movies it won't disappoint you.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|These books are worth reading if only for the email banter between Christian and Ana. I love these books! Romantic and provocative!
B00000K0DT|5.0|Great movie and great service. This movie is an old classic and I loved it then and love it now.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I love this series and I'm hoping for more. Not wanting to give anything away buti want the end to have so much more.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I loved this movie. It was a great science fiction movie and I recommend it to anyone who loves science fiction or just a great story
B005KJZDXK|4.0|Very clean and unadorned carols. Zooey Deschanel has a beautiful voice. I like M Ward's simple arrangements. Highly recommend it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Some of Grisham's books start to feel the same.  This title was done in a refreshing manner and was a page turner for me.  I would recommend it to a friend and buy it again.  CON:  Could not stop reading it.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|A truly great love story<br />I recommend this book highly for someone looking for romantic adventure. Check out this true love between people.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|I love Green Day and this CD does not disappoint. If you're a Green Day fan you will love it.
B0010V4S2O|5.0|The movie case was in great condition also i was Very happy with my purchase movie was in great condition
B0042C1BP0|5.0|Both my wife and I enjoyed the movie.  Lots of action with good camera action.  Daniel Craig does a good job as the new Bond.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game ever it is free and awesome you need to get this game of you don't you are missing out tho is awesome.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|Love it! This is a great learning game for all ages, and my four year old and I both enjoyed it. I hope the creators make more games like this one, it is the best math app I have found so far.
B0091REZMW|1.0|i have a coby 7&#34; adroid tablet this game downloaded and installed but it would not run on my device as a screen came up and just froze my device.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie is the best I have seen since The Departed!  It is an amazing tale of the hardship of holding on to the past, dealing with family and true triumph of forgiveness all wrapped up in a UFC fight.
0765356147|5.0|Brandon Sanderson ties the series together beautifully with this last book of the Mistborn trilogy. It seems as if he's thought of everything and, when the end comes, you'll find yourself wondering how it was that you'd missed all the signs. The book is beautifully written and provides a worthy ending to a terrific series.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The plot line and acting are amazing.  If you were a fan of the 1st American Horror you will love this.
0765356139|5.0|I must say that I somewhat agree with the other reviews that say that the first 400 pages are much slower than the last 200: however, to say that the former is therefore a waste of space is overly harsh. The transformation that Vin and Elend undergo in the book make it worth the read; the introduction of the Terris Tindwyl makes this book great; the stunning ending makes this one of my favorite fantasy books of all time. I highly recommend the book to any fantasy lovers.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The story line was very interesting and the actors did a good job.  I guess after watching Downton Abbey everything pales in comparison but it was still good.
0765350386|5.0|I found out about this series via Reddit (fun fact: Brandon Sanderson was once roommates with Jeopardy superstart Ken Jennings) and am thrilled that I did. In this book, Sanderson creates a fascinating and mysterious world held together by a plausible and truly beautiful magic system. The dystopia the story takes place in and the complex characters that populate it make for a truly magical read. I've recommended it to every friend that would listen: this is a must read for fantasy lovers.
B00140PK6O|5.0|It was more of the same as Cranford but just continuing the story about the town and the people in it.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Christmas isn't complete without at least a half dozen viewings of this movie. The blu-ray quality is excellent and was a great replacement for my old low quality dvd version. Well worth it.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|We loved it. It takes us to another place and time when things were so innocent.  Too, we love Judi Dench.
B002NN5F7A|3.0|If you've never worked in sales or part of a selling organization, you're likely to be bored... such as my wife. I thought it was a good story of the struggle of salespeople who are expected to perform impossible feats with poor tools that leads to desperation.
B0053O89WY|5.0|We love the Big Bang Theory.  So every year I get my husband the previous season on DVD for Christmas and then we spend the next couple of days after Christmas watching them.  They always make us laugh.
B0070066DI|5.0|This thing is huge! It does fit inside my HTPC's low profile case though. It is quiet and as far as I can tell, keeps the CPU cool.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Fantastic game! I love being able to interact with the game, drawing things that help my Stickman find his friend.  The levels make you think strategically to figure out how to solve each one. Well done and fun to complete.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|its great if you are a horney teen age boy with all the boobie shots.  Ted had some funny lines but seriously-constant pot smoking?  We get the picture after the first clip.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|I like this game but for some reason when I get to a certain part screen goes black. I would like to give high rating but since I can't play past the gate you open with the cards I won't
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Entering the Marvel Superhero universe, where all your favorite superheroes are on screen at the same time is decadent.<br />Cannot wait for the sequel.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoyed Christopher Nolan's take on the Batman series. I'm a huge fan and was not disappointed at this box set.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great price for what was purchased.  Booklet was ok. But having all three films on Blu-Ray for this price awesome
B0015DROBO|4.0|I read this after the movie.  I found the book to be entertaining but long winded.  I really wanted the store to pace a bit better, but that could be due to seeing the movie first.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Great game. But you have to buy the complete version apparently? Besides that it's really fun...a little creepy. Great graphics.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Better then the first book.  The target audience would be for ages 13 to 24.  The story continues after hunting games and adds a new dynamic with conflicting emotions in love.  The end of the book, while seemingly rushed is actually well wrapped.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|As remarkable as ever, so inspiring - voice like a bird, harmony with others that is just stunning, song selection powerful. Get this CD or download. You won't be sorry.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I saw the movie last week and couldn't help but get the soundtrack.  I was a little skeptical about getting the Mp3 version, but the quality is just fine.<br /><br />...can't wait to purchase the DVD when it comes out!
B007YQ6SYK|5.0|What a find! This is music I purchased based on amazon reviews, not having heard it more than once, but boy I am glad I did!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This set was so much more than I expected.  The price was even better!  The delivery options were great and came quickly as usual.  I highly recommend this set.  The 3rd movie was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!  And, the extra special features were equally amazing.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.  I was in the mood for a light hearted comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously (similar to Glee), and this was the perfect movie.  Fun songs, over the top acting, and hilarious characters - watch this when you are in the mood for something funny and silly.
B0093X805W|5.0|Great story for kids.  Lots of fun names and imaginary exciting experiences as the young characters are lead through the factory with a cunning guide.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|I started laughing out loud with the beginning and continued, non stop, till the end.  Unique, fast paced, and absolutely fun.
B001NZXI5U|5.0|Get this one if you like classic Scorpions!! This album was a huge hit for them in the 80's!! They'll rock you like a hurricane!!
B00004YRQA|5.0|I guess it worked great, the play station works fine, sometimes it says needs more MB,,whatever that means, but i have another one...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! The kids and I both like to play it. The more difficult, the better!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I watched the movie first but heard great things about this book series.  This is a great story, very easy and enjoyable read.  I would recommend this to anyone with a few spare moments.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I bought this game for the kids to use and it turns out I enjoy it as much as they do!
B005NS0VNU|3.0|My curiosity has been satisfied though I found it bit boring. Perhaps I will give it a few more hearings and let it grow on me.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|A great read and inspiring!  If we could all see the world through Morrie's eyes, the world would be a better place.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Kate Morton's characters come alive.  She tells a good story and has a knack for revealing her charcters in a way that can be related to.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved every bit of it. Great story and details were great. The characters are surprising.  I liked the idea of the hunger game arena a lot.
B009JTCBLE|5.0|Great album, really like the first two albums.  This album is just as good. Joe Bonamassa is a great guitarist
B00A757EFW|3.0|After finally figuring out how to work the pacman, I like the game; however, as you get to a level where you are getting into the game and how it works, the game cuts off and ask do you want to purchase the full version.
B009Y2KGSQ|3.0|Good album but great like the classic Aerosmith.  A lot of hype about the album from the media which sparked my interest
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book put a smile on my face!! Couldn't put it down!! If you're looking for a book and have no idea what to read, read this!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Funny, seductive and heart felt.  Once I started reading I couldn't stop.  Finished it but really didn't want it to be over.......
0743270754|5.0|An absolutely intriguing and new aspect of the gathering of a group of men working TOGETHER, for our nation. Opinionated but brilliant in their management of their respective departments. Goodwin continues to go deep in her research and delivery of historical material. I note that she sheds her liberal bias in projecting one of our greatest Presidential treasures as extraordinarily human and concerned man of the age. Keep on!
B004P12SSW|5.0|I loved watching this movie.  I Played it on my kindle fire and it was great.  Will watch it again.
B005LZW8FO|4.0|ANOTHER EARTH is a thoughtful, introspective examination of guilt and redemption.  The film centers on 17-year-old Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling), all set to begin her future at MIT, who accidentally causes the deaths of a pregnant mother and her young son.  After four years in prison, Rhoda tries to come to terms with what she has done by reaching out to the pregnant woman's husband, John Burroughs (William Mapother; Ethan from LOST), who survived the accident.  They form an uneasy friendship that slowly grows into something more personal, but by keeping her true identity secret, Rhoda is clearly jeopardizing the very redemption she seeks.<br /><br />You'll note that I have not yet mentioned the \\"mirror planet\\" discovered in the film, nor have I used the words \\"science fiction\\" to describe it.  Yes, another planet, apparently identical to Earth, is discovered on the night of Rhoda's tragic accident.  Yes, we learn that this planet is inhabited by people who seem to be identical to the ones living on Earth.  We learn about this through various television and radio reports, and we see lovely images of this beautiful planet hovering in the heavens above Rhoda and John.<br /><br />But this isn't a science fiction film.  It's a somber and serious effort to unravel the very real horrors of facing one's flaws, looking oneself in the eye, and accepting what will never be perfect - maybe not even close.  Rhoda must learn to understand who she was that night when she was 17, and who she is now, at 21.  John must face his loss and his anger, and figure out how to move forward with his life.<br /><br />The existence of the parallel planet is a device through which the film can pose its questions:  If you could meet another \\"you,\\" what would you do?  What would you say?  What would you ask?  What could you learn from yourself?  That's the biggest question of all.  Rhoda and John are lost, and inevitably connected because of that loss.  It's possible that the only people who can help them find their way again are . . . themselves.<br /><br />Those looking for a science fiction film about a parallel planet will be disappointed.  There is very little \\"science\\" in this particular fiction.  The presence of the planet makes little sense in physical reality, and it really serves more as a metaphor for all the \\"if onlys\\" we tend to whisper in our darkest moments.  If only there was another chance, another beginning, another reality, another Earth . . .<br /><br />I liked ANOTHER EARTH, but it wasn't what I expected.  And its science fiction aspects (including the idea that either Rhoda or John could ever find real solace on this parallel planet) are its weakest elements.  But as a film about loss, guilt, and redemption, it works.help them find their way again are . . . themselves.<br /><br />Those looking for a science fiction film about a parallel planet will be disappointed.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I don't normally read but I got a tablet for Christmas so I decided why not.... I know Nicholas sparks has good books, so I purchased save haven. Amazing book...I loved it, it felt real to me, as if I could see it. Some parts had me on the edge. I couldn't wait to pick up and read more.., between handling a 2 year old and working, I finished in 3 days.., which is good for me!  I highly recommend! I can't wait for the movie to come out in February!!
0307341569|3.0|Gillian Flynn's DARK PLACES is not an easy book to read.  I came to it, like many others, after reading GONE GIRL . . . and there are definitely similarities (in both style and tone) between the two novels.  But while GONE GIRL is essentially a story about marriage gone wrong (as well as the perversity of love), DARK PLACES is just depressing.<br /><br />The story is certainly intriguing enough - at seven, Libby Day witnessed the slaughter of her mother and sisters in rural Kansas; her testimony put her fifteen-year-old brother Ben in jail for life.  Now, twenty-five years later, Libby is a total mess.  She doesn't work (she's been living off the pity donations she received when she was a child, but that money is running out), she has no friends, and many days she can't even bring herself to get out of bed.  She's depressed, morose, and totally unlikable.  It's no surprise that Libby has psychological issues - but she's so unsympathetic, so completely lost in her own swamp of self-pity, that it's hard to relate to her.  When she meets Lyle, a member of a fanatical group called the \\"Kill Club\\" (they are obsessed with mass murders), she figures she can make money by selling her family memorabilia and by interviewing key figures in her own murder case (members of the club are desperate to get inside info).  Lyle and his friends are convinced Ben didn't kill anyone, and that little Libby was manipulated by the police and psychologists to turn against her admittedly fractured brother.<br /><br />DARK PLACES is told through a series of alternating viewpoints - Libby's present-day story is told in first person, while the events of 1985 are told from the perspectives of her mother, her brother Ben, and her two sisters.  Flynn is an expert at weaving together an intricate mystery and keeping her readers on the hook to find out what happens next.  I was totally engaged from the start.  But at the same time, I wasn't particularly interested in what would happen to adult Libby, or to imprisoned Ben, or to Lyle and his freaky friends.  All of them were so perverse, so lacking in any real humanity, that I felt distanced from them.  I did want to know what happened that night in 1985.  Did Ben really kill his mother and sisters?  Or did something else happen, something even darker and more horrible?<br /><br />Those of you who have read GONE GIRL will know that endings are not easy for Gillian Flynn (she has admitted as much, and the ending of GONE GIRL has inspired quite a bit of controversy).  Here, the ending is almost ridiculously contrived, as if Flynn just threw it together in the minutes before her manuscript was due at the publishers.  If you don't mind an incredible series of absurd coincidences, it won't bother you.  If you expect something that makes any kind of logical sense, it will.  It bothered me.  And Flynn's rather flimsy attempt to wrap things up for Libby in the last few pages (to give her some sort of positive resolution) just seemed too little too late.  Every single character in this novel is deeply disturbed, tragically flawed, and very depressing.  This is a depressing book.  If you're one of those people who believe in the ultimate depravity of all humanity, then DARK PLACES will resonate with you.  It left me feeling very, very tired . . . and in need of a brisk walk around the block.<br /><br />Flynn is a good writer.  DARK PLACES is a well-written and interesting novel.  It's also very hard to read, and even harder to forget.  Those aren't bad things.  I guess you just need to be in the mood for a book like this.or to imprisoned Ben, or to Lyle and his freaky friends.

It left me feeling very, very tired . . . and in need of a brisk walk around the block.<br /><br />Flynn is a good writer.  DARK PLACES is a well-written and interesting novel.  It's also very hard to read, and even harder to forget.  Those aren't bad things.  I guess you just need to be in the mood for a book like this.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Beautiful soundtrack, makes me relive the movie each time I listen to it. I recommend both the movie and the soundtrack.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Jillian is amazing! I picked this exercise because it's quick and to the point. My legs are a little sore because I have not exercised in a long time... so it is working! I also purchased season 2 & 3 with the goal of doing a season a month and then to switch them around so I don't get bored. My goal is to eat less, lose weight, get toned and exercise to help with it all. This is perfect for me because if I have to spend a lot of time exercising I won't do it.......this is 30 minutes..........
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this Oregon trail because you can manage a town<br />I like the Oregon trail so much I never stop playing it
B00004YA66|5.0|No matter how many times I watch this, it is so terrific.  There are twists and not a moment of dullness.  Great story, great acting, great movie!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Gross 12 year old humor, not funny at all. And I like Wahlberg films but not this one.Comedy should left to the comedians.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|My sister just loves it!<br />We are opposites, this is not for me but if you like motorcycle stuff and all, it's for you!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I wasn't crazy about the book I hated the ending if it thinking of getting this book.... don't! Thank u
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I bought this for my sister for Christmas and she just loves it.  She watched it on tv and is now so happy to be able to watch it over and over!
B0058VW36U|5.0|i am a 12 year old who love games like this!!!!! fun even my lil bro loves this game... its worth your money.<br />luv it!!! :P
B005NOR4LQ|3.0|This movie was OK. I could not get over the feeling I had seen it before. Some things in the story line did not add up. I f your not to critical it is a nice hour or so. You do get the feeling of COLD. As a older movie to purchase or as a rental it is worth the time to watch it. I list purchase because I like to wait a few days and go back and watch again to see what I missed.
1933952806|3.0|Good book, but I would have liked something that went into more of the aspects of photography rather than a reiteration of the manual (although it is an easier read). The book is very detailed and explains all of the menus and sub menus well. But I would have liked a book that goes more into the art of using the camera. This book is more of a reference, I will probably refer to it often, but being that I am new to digital photography I am going to also look for another book.
B007X4ECMI|3.0|I'm not sure how much sense this movie makes - OK forget the sense it's kinda fun. No way, anything like it could happen but ... The interrogation is a little rough and senseless and the star takes a heavy beating showing little signs of damage and the story line jumps around and the bad guys are really bad and crazy and you windup in space..... See It.
0316044695|4.0|I Liked the book. It exceeded my expectations and was an eye opener to the real adversities and dangers our men face in foreign conflicts and wars.  A real test of fortitude and faith.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I tore through this book hungrily. Thoughtful character development mixed with ingenious alchemy kept my full attention. Five stars, each one earned.
075669812X|5.0|This is an awesome book that comes with a super cool ninja guy.  Makes a great gift.  My child loves it.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Excellent, if little known,movie. After watching Fiennes& Paltrow in &#34;Shakespeare In Love&#34;, this is an abrupt &#34;about face&#34;. A little darker,a bit more dagger than cloak, yet an excellent cast and fine performances by Derek Jacobi, Rhys Ifans, Vanessa Redgrave ( I would listen to her read a phone book!),Joely Richardson, and David Thewlis. The sets and costumes are fabulous, bringing the viewer to a time much more politically dangerous than most of us think of during Elizabeth's reign. Evidence is well developed, and certainly gives credence to the theory that Will was not the author of all those plays! Is it true? Judge for yourself, and enjoy great movie!
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Being a John Grisham fan I was not disappointed with this book and enjoyed every page and turned them all to the end.Another great page turner. Definitely my cup ot tea. Des.T.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Google provides an excellent page for searching the web.  I am usually able to find the product I am searching for with in the first few attempts
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Michael Connelly at his best. Suspenseful and like all great thrillers, when ypu think you know what is about to happen the twist arrives. Enjoyable to the end and waiting for the next. Des T
B002W2U3H4|5.0|Love this movie! Great movie to watch for Christmas! Good for young and older people. I would recommend this movie.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|It was really witty and entertaining.  I appreciate that it can be watched by several different age groups without any trashiness to attract so called &#34;adult&#34; audience.  Good for kids and adults.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! I loved it<br />I would recommend this book to my friends<br />It was an easy read and . I really enjoyed and can't wait to read the next done
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Viewing this video is a great way to start the holiday season.  Great family video and some good life lessons to be discussed.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book! Ready to see the movie:) Wondering if they will be a lot alike? Books are always better to me
B001OGWY1W|3.0|It was too intense for my taste.  I didn't care for the story line with Joker always outsmarting every &#34;good&#34; guy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I don't think G5 has a game that I haven't enjoyed playing. this is certainly no exception to the rule.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome set - the \\"making of book\\" which is included is a great feature for fans. Nice rubberized box has an \\"upscale\\" feel. This is a MUST for any fan of the Nolan Dark Knight series...<br /><br />BTW, if theres not a spin off with Joseph Gordon Levitt as Darkwing, that would be a travesty....
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Best book I have ever read good for teens as well as adults it is funny and action packed overall it is awesome
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I give this product high marks because it compares well with my weather station at home and I like the 36-hour and 10-day forecasts for my planning purposes.  Thank you for asking and this opportunity to comment.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was so fantastic! Unlike what others said the ending want awful it was suspenseful to get us to get her next book! She did the same with the first book! I can't wait for the next book! The story can only get juicer!!! :)
B009LXEBD4|5.0|All her music is wonderful. This is a must have CD. Even if it is greatest hits!! Great music all around
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I purchased a kindle fire not even a full year ago n it hasn't been workin in months. After calling around for an inexpensive repair price I learned that theaee kindles USB port are defected. I decided to purchase a new charger and needless to say the device atill wont come on. It lights up as if charging but it doesn't. The repair price is the price I originally paid for it and to me that's a no brainer. The charger itself woks perfectly fine bur not for its intended use. All in all I am a diasatisfied n frustrated customer. I would not recomend the purchase of the kindle fire.
B009H442DG|5.0|great having these 2 team up again after the success of Grease!! Music on this CD is great  Go John and Olivia
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This movie was not nearly as funny as I thought it would be.... But that is just my personal opinion...
B009O07NDY|5.0|I am a Huge Tolkien fan.  Have read all his books (not just the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings series), seen all the movies (including the old animated ones).  I LOVED this soundtrack.  The song by Neil Finn is AWESOME!!!  I heard it during the credits of the HOBBIT and had to go out and get the CD. That's the first time I've ever done that after a movie -- any movie.  The music, for me, just enhances the Tolkien experience -- brings to mind the world, the characters, the story.  I highly recommend it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Typical Vince Flynn book, a good holiday read, Mitch Rapp  baffles the bad guys with his \\"take no prisoners\\" attitude.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I started playing this game I couldn't stop. I think that the should take out the the nether core reactors and put the flint and steel in creative mode in the next update though
B000OVLBHG|5.0|I've probably seen this film at least 100 times, no lie, 12 years ago when i first watched it i was hooked and watched it every day. Glad that phase passed ha. I won't go into great detail like most reviews posted, all I'll say 'it is what it is' or 'love it or hate it'.. It has great cgi effects, action, humor, almost over the top acting but it works for the film. Most sci-fi films take themselves too serious. I recommend this flick to any fellow nerd out there.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is very lightweight and very sturdy. I bought it for my Kindle Fire HD and have no complaints so far.
B00006JDVV|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie.. 2 times when it released in theatre and several times on dvd(probably 100 times haha). I don't understand why critics bashed this film, the acting, action and effects are great. The dragons are scary, true monsters.. Like Denton says in the movie \\"There's nothin magical about em\\".... This is on my top 10 fav list of movies. It is an apocalyptic pyro mania thrill ride. Watch it!

0156027321|5.0|Great book! The movie was great too, but the book is always better! Read it, you won't be sorry! Promise
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Every bit as exciting and fast paced as the first and second books.  Nicely wraps up the series with finality.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Not as original as I thought it would be. This is a cute kid's film, but not really that interesting for adults.
0143144006|2.0|My Stroke of Insight may be interesting and informative, but I couldn't get past the author's voice narrating the audio version of this book. I can recall only one recorded book narrated by the author where the audio narration added to the quality of the listening experience. And this book isn't it. A professional narrator would not have left me focusing on the voice instead of the content.
0316017922|5.0|enjoyed reading this book-provided new perspectives on success. book arrived in great condition..I have shared it with friends and all found it to be very thought=provoking.Very satisfied with transaction
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great hidden object game that you don't need a cheater to play.  but still challenging. Graphics are great and good story line.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A fast paced contemporary romance, set in Las Vegas, about finding love even when the heroine was not looking for it.
B004U52VPS|5.0|No words. Just an excellent game for my kid. Very enjoyable. And the most important. It arrived to my office in only 3 days.
B009GEYX5E|3.0|The film was really slow to develop (more than 10 minutes) and then I realized that it was expired!!!  It was a xmas gift, so I was very disappointed.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I LOVED A City of Bones. When i finished reading i had strong desire to throw it at he wall.  couldn't stand how frustrating it was. But it was so in a good way. Yeah, i know this isn't much of a review, but i had to write this any way.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game is extremely frustrating because it wants me to spend money all the time. There are two kinds of currency in this  game: the kind you earn during gameplay and the kind you have to buy with real money. The best items all have to be bought with real money. If there's a fire and you want to make sure there is no damage to the town, you have to spend real money. Another really annoying aspect of this game is that every action you perform costs energy, and once you run out of energy, you have  to stop playing for  a while, and when you come back you have  energy again. If you don't want to wait, you have to buy energy with real money. Overall, this game is constantly trying to sell me things. If it wasn't for this major annoyance, the game would actually be quite enjoyable.
0143035711|5.0|Although his writing style is not slick, nor is Mason's prose perfect - he gets it done in a clear and detailed enough way. It's just his story, and I enjoyed it. I think the book is much like his life, not perfect but real and gritty. You can see, even if you knew nothing about the outcome of the Vietnam war, just how USA could win battles and lose a war. Just how messed up things were, and some of events as recorded by Mason are hilarious seen through a 2013 lens, even if he certainly was not laughing at the time. He writes in journalistic outtakes without seeming like a reporter (which of course he wasn't), the viewpoint of a specific Huey pilot type from raw beginner to expert pilot without all the Top Gun bravado junk, with just enough technical tidbits to make it interesting . If you want to learn more about the early mid Vietnam war in a churning helicopter ride, this book is for you.
B0039HR5QS|3.0|I enjoyed this movie. I had heard it was a great film. The pacing was excellent and the intrigue kept me wondering what Turner was going to discover. The violence looked realistic for the most part. In other words, the gunshot wounds were not overdone, as they are today where a pinprick causes a fountain of blood. I thought Redford gave a solid performance. Dunaway seemed like a stand in. Sorry if that offends.<br /><br />1. At the midpoint of the movie, Redford's character has sex with Dunaway's. To me, this was unbelievable given the circumstances. The actual sex scene was campy and unbearable to watch. It felt wedged into the movie and way out of place. Furthermore, it was unnecessary. The characters could have bonded in better, more believable, ways. I thought it was lazy story telling. Lastly, Dunaway's character seemed too comfortable over all with Redford's situation. They're up making coffee like hubby and wife on the morning after? I just can't accept that storyline. It could have been lots better.<br /><br />2. (Spoiler Alert) Watching this movie from the perspective of 2013 caused me to roll my eyes at the ending. The whole mess was caused by the CIA planning a \\"War for oil\\". This is so clich&eacute; to me and it's become a Hollywood default reason to find fault with the USA or the CIA etc. The mind-boggling ignorance story writers must maintain is astonishing so they can continue to write as if the USA is always up to no good. It started back then and almost 45 years later Hollywood is still at it.<br /><br />3. (Spoiler Alert) Act III of the movie is a little loose. The \\"murders for oil\\" should have, in my opinion, been the doorway into Act III, instead we learn that in the last few minutes of the movie. With that said, the very last scene of the movie was top notch.
0425252868|5.0|I heard a radio interview with the book's author shortly before Christmas and knew I had to have the book. I won't repeat what other reviewers have already said but it was everything I'd hoped for and more. Kudos to Mr. Makos for putting it together.
B00112GVFO|5.0|Love this movie<br />After watching it a bunch of times, I still laugh...great flick<br />Totally love the intro song<br /><br />If only there were more movies like this one now.......
B005R32L66|1.0|Dont waste your time. Serously, dont bother. Skype provides little to no support and the free product is a joke.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A great story and historical view of  huge cultural changes in our world..<br />The story from the point of view of a family changing and growing in a world torn with change. Season 3 will continue the family's stories in a world of change around them.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|GOOD PRODUCT, BUT I HAD MANY ISSUES TRYING TO GET IT TO WORK INITIALLY. THIS IS MOST LIKELY NOT BECAUSE OF THE PRODUCT AS MUCH AS IT WAS MY PHONE THOUGH.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed the adventure and would recommend to other readers as a fast read. Suzanne has gone into great detail of the agony fear Pita has to endure to save his love.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Quick Delivery, and easy purchase!! Product was exactly as described, and we loved the items purchased. I highly recommend the product!
030758836X|2.0|I have suffered through this whole book because people wrote reviews saying what a great book this is and what a surprising ending this book would have.  Yes, the book was surprising, but in a more *sigh* pathetic way.  You feel like asking yourself \\"and I wasted how many hours of my life on this book?\\"<br /><br />The first part of the book was mainly boring.  I stuck with it because all the reviews said there would be a pay off.  I do read a LOT of books, and I've read a LOT of surprising twists in books, and I have seriously been blown off my rocker with surprise on some books.....but I really wasn't that surprised with this one.  Yes, your opinion on who was crazier did shift a few times during this book, but by the end I simply didn't care.<br /><br />Waste of time for me on this one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Quick Delivery, and easy purchase!! Product was exactly as described, and we loved the items purchased. I highly recommend the product, and will buy from seller again as well!
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|A truly wonderful book.  Mr. Ford doesnt dissapoint often, and this is good.<br />A stark,  dark, coming of age story that is very well written.
B0067R0APK|3.0|Not a bad app, but I expected more from the paid version. This is why I gave the app 3 stars
B0055V6EZE|5.0|AWESOME!  I love the character HOUSE, but this is outstanding!!! You ca FEEL his passion in his music. A very accomplished pianist! I LOVE this CD!
B00867GJYK|5.0|I was very happy with this item.  It arrived on time, which was important to me.  And of course we love the movie.

B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Love  I Love Love Love Love Love Love Love, really Love Love Love Love Love Love Love super-duper Love Love Love Love Love<br />seriously.<br /><br />This album has all the beautiful sounds I love from M&S, along with their always amazing lyrics.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Love having easy access to my email. Right there on my main page.<br />Because I don't share my Kindle with anyone I have it set to open and no password necessary.<br />(Kindle is password protected)  Easy and quick.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Great movie for a Saturday afternoon. The ensemble cast is fun and as a resident of Atlanta, it was fun to see the city on the big screen.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|First things first this album is amazing.  It captures the feel of the Les Misérables movie as the songs push you through each bit of the story.  After listening you definitely get the gist of the movie just from the audio.<br /><br />I went to iTunes first to look at the album but was hesitant to spend $17 so I chose to come to amazon and HOLY MOLY IT WAS ON $5!! That right there made me realize Amazon is really the place to download all your music.  WIth the cloud stream and the online download I won't be getting my music anywhere else!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast paced and exciting! Once I started reading I could not stop. Definitively worth the money and look forward for the next installment.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is based on a true story, so we all know it has a happy ending.  Nonetheless I was at the edge of my seat the entire time, terrified that one of the many things that could go wrong...would.  The film does an excellent job of recapturing the tension, anger and fear that surrounded the hostage crisis at the US Embassy in Tehran, ensuring you appreciate just how idiotically brave the mission to rescue six embassy employees really was.  John Goodman and Alan Arkin (who are great together -- casting directors, take note) provide some much needed humor while never belittling the task they agree to support.  Highly recommended.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Survival balanced with the ideals of civilized society runs as the ongoing, central theme of this mesmerizing series. Truly compelling stuff.
B0074JODP8|3.0|3 stars is a little harsh - but I only gave the Royal Albert Hall one 4 stars and I liked it better than this, so I've got to go one less.  Why?  Like on RAH, the guests were a total distraction.  Unlike some reviewers here, I really do not care for Ms Hart's vocal stylings.  My negative reaction to her is nearly as strong as my deep disappointment with Glenn Hughes & the BCC sound.  Hiatt and Rodgers were like the guests on RAH - old greats that just don't hold a candle anymore to the stratospheric Mr Bonamassa.<br /><br />Fortunately, it's a nice full program and so you can skip past the guests and still feel like you got your money's worth.  Joe and the boys are really very good - worthy of the many 5 star reviews here.  Bergman is the only lineup change from the group I saw perform live - and a fine addition.  I especially liked Blue and Evil, since that was the highlight for me on Black Rock.  I was delighted that Joe dug into the old catalogue and pulled out The River, because I missed him playing that one when I saw him.<br /><br />But that tees up my recommendation.  RAH is better than this for the musical selections but the DVD you should really get is the old Rockpalast one.  Joe really shines in that more intimate club setting and you can see why he deserved the recognition that enabled him to move on and play the grande venues.
0385528752|5.0|A very helpful guide to for navigating personal and organizational change. Helpful insights, illustrations and potential applications. A must read.
B00936A2SM|4.0|So I'm a big fan of Henderson and his playing on HBC is a treat.  If you're a fan, and more for the really hard Tribal Tech stuff and not so much his Dog Party blues stylings, then buy this.  And Chambers is one of the top fusion drummers today.<br /><br />So why only 4 stars?  In a word: covers.  On repeat listening, they've been growing on me.  But these particular covers were from some of the seminal fusion works of my formative years.  They're embedded in my brain in a way that doesn't happen anymore.  If Scott et al chose these for tribute value, fine, but I'm sure they're capable of delivering some engaging original material.  Hopefully they can focus on a little writing for the next round (or at least cover something that isn't already programmed into the neuronal pathways of my youth).<br /><br />If you're unencumbered with names like Hancock, Zawinul, or Cobham, and awesome contemporary (and fully resurrected from its heyday) fusion from some masters of the art is your thing, then you won't go wrong with this CD.
0399157565|3.0|Liked it but thought that descriptions of medical equipment went ad nauseum.  However, for fans of hers it was still a good read.
B002ZG981E|5.0|The film forces the viewer to ask &#34;Is it real or is it a dream?&#34;  It is worth watching over and over in order to catch the little nuances and details as the film moves forward.<br /><br />I guess we could ask the same question about life?
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Rothfuss definitely hit a home run with his debut novel.  The Name of the Wind is a compelling page-turner with a colorfully vivid story and a likable yet flawed hero.<br /><br />It was good the first time and even better the second time.  Unlike many trilogies the second book in the series, Wise Man's Fear, is just as good.  I can't wait until the final book in the series is released.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This has become my absolute favorite movie. I'm only in my 40's, but I find I can relate to some of these characters very well - young and old.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game and how it engages. The mind to solve the puzzle. Faster and faster each time to keep bettering your score
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I love Michael Buble. He has a great voice. I would recommend this CD. It has all the great Christmas songs.
B00914JWSW|3.0|Good vocals -- not so happy with choice of songs.  I've been collecting Streisand's music for years and her range<br />is excellent here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really enjoyed every page! Surprised of how much it held my attention. Interesting how small details aren't the same from the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I gave it a 4 star because I did not think it was as good as the first two.  Number one was the best, the second was also great, but this one was not  one you did not want to put down.  I would still recommend you read all three, they are worth the time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Once again Colleen Hoover delivers a fantastic book with characters that I quickly fell in love with. From the very beginning I was hook line and sinker in love with Sky. Her wit and inelegance are refreshing. And once a handsome boy named Holder stumbles into her life, the twists and turns of their relationship change both of them forever. Hoover crafts characters that are deep and layered, and the story had my jaw dropping and head shaking.<br />My only hang up, and I don't want to spoil anything, is how the children are portrayed. At times I was wondering what kind of kids think/speak/act like this? Are my little ones somehow missing out on being so worldly and aware? Aside from that, I loved this story and this book. I secretly wish there will be a second book.
B009JZVT70|5.0|I continue to enjoy the re-telling of fairy tales with a modern twist - fabulous scenery and special effect - love the wolf girl!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't write reviews on books I have read not because I don't want too ... I really really should... but I have never found a book that is so profound and real. I am Hopelessly in Love with these characters ... Holder and Sky... everyone of us knows a \\"Holder\\" and everyone of us knows a \\"Sky/Hope\\". They speak to you! Colleen Hoover had me hook lined and sunk after the first page. I was transfixed. To all who are just thinking of purchasing this book... don't think ... go with your gut... This book is AMAZING thru and thru!!!
B008Z9L94O|5.0|love it, shipped quickly, quality product just like i asked for. highly recommend, will be very rare soon enough. buy now.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Loved the book! Interesting outlook on what the world could become! Ending just early enough to leave you wanting more
B00004WX4X|5.0|one of the best hip hop albums of all time. definitely a great album to have in your vinyl collection.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game!I tell u this is not a waste of money.when I first played it I was to scared but the second time I played I got 7 pages but slender got me.you should really buy it it is definitely not a waste of time or money.
B002IDH4PQ|5.0|kid cudi is the man and listening to this on vinyl is the best way to do it. highly recommend.
B00571F26Y|1.0|How can a book about not eating wheat say &#34; do not eat anything that says gluten free&#34; It's just the Atkins diet in another form.  Yes, if you eat fruit, veggies and fish you will lose weight.  Duh.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|One of our favorite movies ever.  We have watched it a few times and still enjoy it<br /> Our grandkids still quote parts..
B005LAIISA|5.0|This is a very good computer animated film involving the Ice Age characters with some new ones thrown in.  It is a true adventure, very funny and you will enjoy the character of Granny.  The film is continuous action and laughs and it will hold the attention of your children.  My grandson was laughing a lot and so were we.<br /><br />This is worth watching with your kids and enjoying a funny and well-designed film that you will all like. I thought that it was as good as the previous Ice Age films and I loved the antics of Scrat.  The music was outstanding and the character's voices were done by some of the best in the business.  This is a cute movie and you should watch it,I recommend it to you.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app works good and it is very easy to use! My pics turned out nice and was very simple to do!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I loved this series. Each character is vividly drawn by the writer's pen and intertwined throughout this riveting tale of lives turned upside-down and inside out by the struggle for power, vengeance, love and survival while horrors thought long dead rise to walk in the light of day. My only wish is that the ending of the series did not leave so many hanging threads, however, such is the nature of the beast we call life. The story never ends.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good story, solid game play.  I liked the twist and the character development.  I wouldn't go so far as to say I loved them,  but you get the idea.
0525478817|5.0|I finished this, tears streaming down my face, in one day. This book will touch your heart and stay with you long after you turn the last page. The characters are complex, realistic, and loveable, and their battles are tender and touching. Even if you don't know anyone who has battled cancer, you'll appreciate the raw emoption that this disease conjures.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app! It's so addicting. I played this until 2:00 am on New Years. I was tired, but it was so fun, I just couldn't stop.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent! But I loved all of the books. This is a great author. would read more books by EL James!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast paced easy read.  Scary part was you could easily see how our society could get to this low point watching children kill each other for sport.
1423140605|5.0|my son loves this series. he is already done with this book and is waiting for another one to come out
B004E2XAFW|5.0|One of the best albuns from Within Temptation, come with a gread DVD with video clips and other things. I can't wait for the next one!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I'm not a boy scout, nor was I raised in the 1960s. I did find this an entertaining depiction of both.
B00631VJIC|5.0|The shipment came in on the right time, it was in perfect condiction. I would totally recomend using amozon again or refure it to someone els.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This solitaire game is the easiest version I have come across  for my Kindle tablet.It is easy,fun and very addictive!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Loved this book and could not put it down! Was deeply moved by Adam Brown's life story and the many obstacles he overcame in his personal and professional life. In the end, his deep belief and faith in Jesus Christ is his true legacy. Very well written.
B00321MGPG|5.0|Based on the excellent review, I bought this set for my husband. All the series are so wonderfully done. The images are incredible and the content is very informative and educational. My 5 and 3 year old also enjoyed watching them. I definitely recommend it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is not hard and its fun! There are a lot of puzzles to choose from so you don't have to do the same ones. Love  this game.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Better made. This adapted is stronger made and less likely to miss the input device for charging.<br />also it's affordable.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I ordererd this item for my sons for Christmas.  I was very pleased with the timing and how quickly it arrived.  It was in excellent condition.  My boys have watched it several times already and love it.  A great purchase!  Thank you.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Really enjoy this show. It's funny, keeps me thinking and guessing what will happen next. Also enjoy the humor in it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed this game very much. Neat storyline and the graphics were cool. I definetly would recommend it! Lots of fun.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|We enjoy the movie!  The plot had a really interesting twist along with the special effects were superb. I highly recommend it.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|I thought the grandkids would like it and I end up playing it not that I'm very good but I had a good time trying.
B005H29GSI|4.0|I had read reviews of the angry birds game and actually returned the space version to buy this one.  For my 3 1/2 year old, it is fun and easy for him to pull the lever and knock down the pigs.  On the other hand, it is not so easy for him to build the pieces up, but I don't mind doing it.  Although, my patience sometimes wears thin when the pieces won't stay up, so I could see how a child would get frustrated.  I think this is a good game though and can be played on different levels throughout the years.  As he grows and is able to copy the designs on the cards and keep track of points, I think he will enjoy it even more.  For now though, we like to just build them up and see who can knock them down.  I'm glad I paid a reduced rate for this product, I don't think I would have been so happy paying full price.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I don't like angry birds but I get them for the grandkids and they love it but this one I got hooked on and doesn't make me to Angry.
B008Z9L94O|1.0|It's a terrible pressing of this wonderful album. Beautiful package. Inner groove distortion makes this UN-listenable. Why bother releasing this and not paying attention to the way it sounds. Garbage.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I enjoyed this so much I bought the full version and the Christmans version and as I said before I'm not very good but it's great fun.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Initially the writing is skillful enough to sustain the changes in characterization. Unfortunately that does not remain true for the entire book. While I don't want to spoil the read for others, the ending is neither satisfying nor believable, just creepy.
B00APUTEBG|4.0|I had never heard of this movie but I liked the stars in it so I watched it and it wasn't bad at all al lot of action which I like.
B001EC3JME|5.0|This holster is great.  I got it along with the halo 290 which is also another great product.  It holds the light snuggly and allows for easy inserting and removing.  I ride a bike with it so it stays on it pretty darn well.  The belt part is ok; it takes a bit of trial and error to get used to putting the holster on the belt because of a clips design.  But overall great and reliable product.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|I bought this one because I love the regular version and don't get me wrong it's good and nice Christmas music I am just so bad ,I think I could only get through 2 songs but I'll keep on trying.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|I love this cd. I just wish it had the grave digger song on it. They are awesome!!! Get it
B009GENZKS|4.0|Not the best Resident Evil movie I have seen so far. It is still entertaining though. I could still watch it a second time.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|If you like Susan Boyle, you will love her new cd.  I bought this cd for my mother for Christmas and she loves it.  She is though a huge Susan Boyle fan.
B009O2XY12|3.0|This game is actually one of my favorites, excluding the fact that once I'm out of energy I have to wait to play and the game constantly screws you by giving you by giving you several same-colored bubbles. There's no reason I should get like 8 red in a row as the last 8 balls when there's no red on the board at all. That has happened like 5 times where the last 10 balls I can't even use except to get rid of themselves. Another problem I've noticed is the scoring is inconsistent. I've played one level over and over trying to get three stars and I've finished it with 14 balls left and got 1 star but after finishing with nothing left and messing up a lot I got just under 3 stars! Also I've had times where it doesn't count the balls left over. How does that even happen? The scoring needs to be clearly defined in the game rules that somehow don't exist either, just the tutorial that blocks your view but won't go away for like a minute. So yeah I love this game and I'd really like to continue playing but it needs to be fixed. Also it needs more bonus stuff. Like bomb bubbles and stuff like that. I don't know of your actually gonna update this stuff and show some customer appreciation but hey I tried.
0062086529|5.0|I remember reading this book as a young child and loving it.  I now buy it for people as baby shower gifts to carry on the story!
B009PEPML4|3.0|I really appreciate Godspeed You! Black Emperor's bent toward progressive instrumental music. This album does not sound like anything else I've listened to this year. But, I feel like they verge into the arena of producing wave after wave of noise until they build a sound typhoon. I would have liked a little bit more diversity in volume, pace, and instrumentation.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|My 9 nine year old purchased this game and seemed to enjoy it at first but it didnt last.  I guess it was just not her type of game.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|I would have given this five stars if there weren't so many repeats from his self titled album. Still, Mr. Clark delivered on the promise of earlier releases. Blak and Blu is a great song.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|dissent. work on kindle fire wont load so don't bye it don't wade your money posse learn from me. please
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Fair warning: you will not be able to put this book down. If you're going to buy this book (and you should!) don't plan on doing anything for the rest of the day.<br /><br />This is one of the best Sci-Fi books I've read in a long time.  It's both hilariously funny and edge-of-your-seat riveting. 6 out of 5 stars!
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Great deal, great quality, and i can get a digital copy.  It is still a great movie almost 20 years later.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My son will play this for hours. He loves to feel like he is a vet. There are some fun little things he can do like turn on a radio, ceiling fan, open the window...
1451650728|5.0|...and then picked it right back up again the next day.<br /><br />I have read Trek novels for decades (in the late 1990's I turned in over 600 of them to a local used bookstore). So I have seen the good and the bad.<br /><br />This book is, hands down, the BEST \\"Next Generation\\" effort I have ever read and I am eagerly looking forward to reading the second two books in this trilogy.<br /><br />Being particular fond of \\"Data\\" stories, this book immediately appealed to me, especially as it provides additional background on Noonien Soongh. We learn things about what motivated him to create positronic androids along with some additional details of his own history.<br /><br />BEFORE you buy:<br /><br />1. Be certain to read \\"Immortal Coil\\". This is also a Data story that lays the foundation for this series.<br /><br />2. I have also read Mack's \\"Destiny\\" trilogy, which deals with the Federation's final war with the Borg.<br /><br />3. At least in this first book, I didn't see any indication that this was a necessary read but highly recommend it as it was a great trilogy and also helps set the scene for this triolgy.<br /><br />4. I have NOT read the \\"Typhon Pact\\" series. There are brief mentions of this series, but I do not feel as though I missed anything by not reading it.<br /><br />5. Prepare yourself. About a third of the way into this story, you will not BELIEVE what has taken place during the time the Enterprise-D and -E have traveled the galaxy!
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for my hubby and he loved it! It comes in a nice case and has a pretty background.
015603252X|4.0|In his Tale of Love and Darkness Amos Oz paints an atmospheric picture of growing up with his parents during the British occupation of Palestine and the early years of the state of Israel.<br /><br />He describes meticulously the background and European social mores of his parents and grandparents and their struggles to get by in the nascent state of Israel. He recounts  the hardships and near starvation his family and their neighbors experienced because of the siege of Jerusalem by the Arab armies during Israel's War of Independence.<br /><br />This is a story of attachment and loss, love and death within a time and culture where family emotions were pushed underground and daily relationships were stifled by conventional custom. In the background is the European Holocaust, the destruction of whole families and communities, villages and towns, that casts a psychic shadow over the personalities in the story. This undercurrent of darkness combines with other currents leading inexorably to the tragical suicide of the writer's  mother.<br /><br />[...]
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Movie was entertaining, had a good message.  Was funny hand cute characters. I would watch this again with the kids
B0063IH60K|5.0|When you're standing in long line somewhere or you're just bored, this game is great to have--many hours of enjoyment.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|For me this is a rent only. Glad I didn't waste money at the theaters on this one. Worth watching but not something I would want to buy add to my movie collection.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|I bought this for my nephew for christmas and he loved it. I thought he was going to need help, but he did it on his own. the book is helpful. He is 4yrs old.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This was a very good story and had very beliveable people, fit the time it was wrote about, I would read vit again
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is fun so far. It reminds me a lot of Zynga's Pioneer Trail on Facebook, a game that I once loved, but felt it occupied too much of my time, but this one seems more like I can go at my own pace and I love it.
B006UV8DJS|1.0|Kindle fire hd. Bad. Bad. Bad. App...<br />It's horrible. Doesn't work. Wong load. Doesn't do color effect or anything it says it does
B004SUDPWI|5.0|This movie has been a favorite of mine for years; was rewarding to view it in such clarity of images and sound.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and The Racketeer held my interest and as usual liked the ending. Not a complicated read, easy to understand and will look forward to the next book.
B00368PSN2|5.0|No comparison between dvd and blu ray ....... great movie made even better with enhanced imaging and sound!  Intend to reorder and give as gift to best friend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was very good<br />My mood was up and down the whole time<br />Not my parents, but anybody else.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|I have liked reading all of the Harry Bosch novels I have read todate.  I will continue throiugh the whole series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|makes you want to play again and again. some games are are crazy and some are really easy to get extra point
B004LWZW7E|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys action, suspense. I was surprised by Justin's performance. Will keep you watching.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Recommending very helpful<br />And available at your. Finger tips,a lot of new words and easy-to-use tool for kindle user.thanks. for the ssmplee
B009MF5BXK|4.0|I am a fan of all of the oldtime actors in this movie.  No it won't win any awards, but it is enjoyable and entertaining.  If you like th old timers this one is for you.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a quietly joyful movie.  While honestly portraying the challenges of aging, disillusionment with life, and even racism and classism, it offers a beautiful optimism and hopefulness.  A beautifully written and beautifully made film, with world-class actors.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Christmas was the best ever!!! Season 2 of Walking Dead was the cherry on top of the ice cream sundae!!!
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Anyone who is not familiar with Nobel laureate Krugman's economic analysis, and even those who are, would gain a better understanding of what got us into the recession and what can get us out.  It is an easy read even for the 'economics' uninitiated.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Totally suprised my husband with this movies for Christmas! His smile was bigger than ever! We watched it on Christmas night GREAT movie!
0765350386|5.0|Mr. Sanderson is acquanted with something that is known as a \\"plot\\".  That means that when events unfold, the characters act rationally, given what they know and whom they are, and that as a result events do unfold, in unexpected ways.<br /><br />Some adventure and fantasy writers are writing a series of clashes.  Events.  A hero goes to war.  Bang!  Bang!  More bang!<br /><br />The Mistborn series is therefore ultimately satisfying, very good to read, despite turns and twists that either astound or annoy, moments where characters run into internally logical realities that determine their fates.<br /><br />And the characters are pretty cool, although the entire Vin/Elend thing is clearly written with a movie in mind, the necessary love story.  It wasn't a bad love story, and so good, just a bit girly.<br /><br />My son and my nephews made me read these books, and they are both pretty darn good, and very satisfying, and so I recommend them.  Read them.  Be patient, enjoy the verve while allowing the layers to unfold.
B009JBZH54|5.0|What a great combo pack for Christmas. My son was so excited to get &#34;exactly&#34; what he was asking for Christmas!
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I started reading this book -- first time reading this author -- and I didn't enjoy it at all.  I found his style difficult to enjoy, hard to get in the flow.  Ended up re-reading several sections over and over again -- gave up and didn't read.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|My son and daughter-in-law were so excited to get this DVD for Christmas. The only thing better would be if they got Season 2 as well!!!
0762445262|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this at first because of some of the negative reviews, but for only $10 I figured it'd be great just as a display piece. It's just the right size to display with a LEGO or Kubrick Batman figure. I'm not sure what some reviewers expected from a 2\\" Bat Signal, but this little guy surprisingly put out quite a bit of light! I've the signal displayed on a shelf about three feet from my ceiling, and the signal shows up fine in a dimly lit room. The lens is also tinted yellow, so if you move the signal closer, about two feet from the surface you're aiming it at, it looks exactly like the black and yellow logo on the box. All in all, I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very good cliffhanger<br />Left me hanging and looking for next one<br />So. Excited can't wait for the next book to download
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|The movie was over-hyped before I watched it. I was expecting a very funny movie, but didnt get one. I would put this movie as a &#34; balance your checkbook&#34; movie.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|i went into this movie thinking it would be little more than a silly cult classic like \\"toxic waste avenger\\".silly but fun too.however,it was much,much more than that.it was full of great action and had a heartfelt and serious message about slavery and the civil war.<br />i got 3 movies for christmas,thinking this one would be good but the #3 of 3 out of them.but it was definately #1.the other 2 were \\"dark knight rising\\"  and \\"dark shadows\\".i liked them all very much but this one was my favorite.i would also go so far as to say it is my 2nd favorite movie of the entire year behind the \\"avengers\\".<br />i am not much of a vampire movie guy.since \\"dracula\\",ive only liked a handful.they are \\"from dusk till dawn\\" and \\"lost boys\\" plus the 2 ive already mentioned.\\"abraham lincoln vampire hunter is ranked 2nd out of 3 there with \\"from dusk till dawn\\" being first.<br />so,it tells the story of abraham lincoln ,slavery,the civil war,abes family,war tactics,his love life,his various occupations etc.i never expected an educational movie here but it actualy is but the other 50% is a totaly blood fest about vampires.it rocks ! i know it sounds stupid but its totaly not.go watch it ! and if you dont,you are being prejudious which is what this movie teaches against.<br />the only thing i wouldve changed is the ending.now i think i can tell the ending i wouldve used because its not the real ending therefore its not a spoiler.i wouldve had abe at the fords theatre thinking hes solved the slavery and vampire problem.then,john wilkes booth,who has become a vampire,sneaks up and bites him.that is not the end.its nowhere close.but,it wouldve been more horror film like.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book particularly because I work in mental health and lived in Philly...and loved the Eagles for a long time...very clever premise, great character development, hard to put down...five star!
B001TH16DI|5.0|Product was shipped very fast and the movies were very crisp as a blu-ray should be. Don't understand why others complained.
0307477479|5.0|I bought this, along with another book, as a Christmas present.  The recipient seems to really enjoy them so far.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this on my kindle and Samsung galaxy pro on a daily basis to unwind and pass the time. Very user friendly, highly recommended.
B00957T6X6|4.0|One of the best stories that I have read. Characters are deeply developed and complex. Most are a mix of good and evil. I say &#34;most&#34; because there are a few characters that are really evil, but even then you see their motivations and how they got that way. Like real life, no members of JRRM's world are 100% good.<br /><br />It's a very big story with a lot of characters and plots. I would call it a horror/fantasy story because after 5 books, it looks like very few good or nice things happen, and when good prevails it's proceeding more misery......<br /><br />I didn't rate it 5 stars because page numbers are available only in the first book. From the second book on there are only percent complete. That would be OK, except that the percentages given are for the whole 5 book bundle. That makes it very hard to know where you are in any particular book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game for kindle fire. No paying to continue. Recommended greatly. Great simulation that never gets bored. Get this game now.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is the best movie ever it was sooooo funny I couldn't stop laughing and the best part it that fat amy has a awesome part in this movie. Totally worth 5 stars !
B000RLHDUM|5.0|The Thomas Crown Affair was well worth it. If you like James Bond movies you'll love this one too! I would recommend this movie to all my friends.
1435114949|5.0|This is a beautiful book!  ...I searched for a long time and couldn't find a better deal.  I would definitely recommend!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Old vets like to read about young fit soliders who can take it and dish it out.  This is a bit hard to believe, but hay why not dream,<br />I wish people who write this stuff could remember that revolvers don't have a safety.  Make me this your reseach was a little shotty.  If you are going to write about this stuff make it a bit more real.  All in all I will be reading the series and may like the others better.  Good work and worth the time to read.
B009O2XY12|4.0|easy for kids to play,the bubbles go where little fingers want them to go .holds their attention .they love it
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book would stand alone but it was a thrill to read Pillars and this one together. What do you say about a book by one of the best writers in History.  Great story, great read.  Do them both and you can have a great time by the fireplace this winter.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|We really enjoyed this as a Christmas present this year,as both my husband and my daughter are big Coldplay fans.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not a bad story but gee why take so long to get to the meat of the matter and short change us with the details later.<br />Looks like one of those books they write just to get a book out.  I miss the detail of the old stories.  Not the best of Grisham's work but readable.
0307730697|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book and will read it again in a few months which I usually do when I find a book I really like..  It was very thought provoking and easy to read.
B000VHMF0A|3.0|Bob Marley is a Legend and I don't use the term often or ligthly.  In fact, the original version of Legend was an excellent selection of his work.  The only flaw with the original Legend was that there were some additional songs that should have been included.  The Deluxe Edition of Legend, however, doesn't enhance the experience of listening to Bob Marley's music it only makes it take longer to finish.<br /><br />The first disc of the Deluxe Edition of Legend includes the live version of &#34;No Woman, No Cry.&#34;  This would have been a great choice for disc two.  The original single version, which was on &#34;Legend&#34; is a much better fit with the studio hits that the listener is accustomed to.  Disc Two which has all of the extended versions of Bob Marley's hits wasn't necessary or interesting.  The songs lost their core integrity because there were too many ill placed musical interludes that the artist himself hadn't used.  Some of the songs on disc two seemed endless.  I've never listened to Bob Marley and wondered when a song was going to end before.  But on several of my favorite Bob Marley songs I found myself wondering when they would end. The mixes and re-mixes on disc two did nothing to enhance the Legend of a great artist.<br /><br />If disc one had followed the format of the lp version of Legend, adding a few additional studio cuts, my rating would have been much higher.  I'm sure I would have rated it four stars at the very least.  Bob Marley was a true genius but the elongated mixes that comprise most of the second disc fail to display that genius.  More isn't always better, sometimes it feels like too much.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This game can be entertaining, but I was mislead by an offer that never arrived.  Another application I was playing turned me to this game with a reward offer if I played coin dozer.  I met all requirements and never received anything.  I sent them a message and nothing.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It was a remarkable book. The ending was sad but it ended kind of happy to. I would recommend this book for anyone to read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is a boredness buster!! I play it in my free time and it is an ama-zayn app.  Thank you Rovio Entertainment Ltd. for such great apps.  What would we do without you?!
1423140605|5.0|bought this for my teenage son who has enjoyed reading this series as well as the other Percy Jackson series, and the Kane Chronicles series.  He asked me to read them as well and I've been reading this series; well written, easy enternaining reads
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the twists and turns . . . the ending was a little disappointing to me. However, overall it was worth the read!
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Awesome, fast way to view favorite shows! Little to no buffering depending on Internet reception if through wifi. I recommend it to anyone.
B0053O89WY|5.0|What can I say . . . If you love The Big Bang Theory, you will love this collection! A must have!
0307352145|5.0|I thought it was a rather good book.  I learned some things about myself, and some things I would have loved to know going through my public education.  I thought I was just weird for loathing group activities.  Turns out I wasn't as alone as I thought I might have been.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|My favorite series with a more interesting plot and better actors than most.  Whats not to like?  Price was OK
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Great movie.  Keeps you into it the whole time.  Great camera work and graphics.  A must see for every one.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is a fun page turner from page 1. Loved it!!!! One of John Griffin's most entertaining. Can't go wrong.
034552554X|4.0|A lovely book which brought about a lot of discussion at our book group - we wore flowered &#34;garden dresses&#34; for effect - brrr.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I own this book in paperback.  I had to read it in college.  I still remember the first time I read it.  I sat in a chair and read it cover-to-cover.  That's how good it is.  It's amazing.  This is one of those books you have to read in your lifetime.  I'm writing this review because I saw it's a Kindle deal today for $1.99.  That's awesome.  Get it.  Read it.  It'll knock your socks off.
B00114RKT8|5.0|One courageous, good man and a movement of other caring citizens takes on the hugely profitable and unimaginably evil slave trade. It takes decades of struggle and many defeats -- and progressive learning how to organize and how to get the entire nation to understand the evil and in revulsion force Parliament to end the trade.<br /><br />The film introduces one of the world's first great social entrepreneurs. It is one of the best portrayals of what is involved in such a life available anywhere. (The best contemporary window into this world is David Bornstein's  How to Change the World (Oxford and 30 others. See also [...] ashoka.org)<br /><br />The film is also an accurate and sensitive window into England at the time. And into the powerful British twin brother to America's Abolitionists.<br /><br />Anyone who sees the current film Lincoln should also see Amazing Grace. Each greatly enriches the other.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Absolutely hilarious.  Not terribly crass humor, which I think is becoming more and more of a rarity.  Great music, great cast.  Kind of a mix of Glee type performances and Mean Girls type humor.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Great sequel to the trilogy. Amazing movie and definitely a must see and I very rarely watch movies or am easily impressed
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|Draw a Stickman: EPIC is interactive in a different way. liked it.<br />  beside Draw a Stickman: EPIC was free ...
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Well it was a gift for my brother and he just absolutly loved it! He wtched it with his sister and mother and they loved it too! Great movie to enjoy withe family!
B005LAIHQS|1.0|Dont get me wrong, this is the best MIB yet, but never trusted Ultraviolet, but I took chances when it said digital copy on it. Guess what? it didnt work. Now I have a sony account and a (stupid) Ultraviolet account and i couldnt get digital copy on my ipod!
B004Y1WCDE|1.0|Doesn't work well with the Kindle Fire HD. I got this so my little girl could watch movies from my pc to her Fire HD, bad idea. Not only is the interface a little over an 8 year olds head, the movies don't load/play well at all. Sorry I purchased this lame app. Will stick with the aVia pro until something better comes along.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Very cool direction and special effects. The rest of the story was just okay. The first version was campy fun. This version takes itself a little too seriously.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|Flawed yet full of humanity ....great, great character.<br />Connelly gives you great insight to his flawed<br />and relentless every man hero.
B002BWP49C|5.0|this is a wonder addition to a new years party .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .
B000FC1MM8|4.0|perfect way to curl up on a cold winter evening<br />reading my favorite dectective!  No one does it<br />better than Connelly.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Don't miss out on this movie due to the luke-warm reviews it received.  I skipped this in theaters thinking it wouldn't really be all that great.  I even took my sweet time renting it from the local redbox.  When I finally sat down to watch it one friday night, it completely surprised me.  This is an EXCELLENT movie.  It's kind of rare for me to grant a movie props on editing, but either the director or editor kept this movie zipping along perfectly thanks to a series of really creative transitions.  Beyond that, it's just a fun movie with a completely likable protagonist and very likable side characters.  I like the fact too that Mary Todd was a unique and likable as Abe himself.  Other than beign slightly reminiscent of \\"Priest\\" (another movie I liked that most critics didn't) in tone, this movie is unlike any thing else I've seen.  Oh, and if you're sitting the fence on this one when it comes to dvd or Blu Ray, get the Blu Ray.  HUGE difference.  The picture quality is GORGEOUS and the special effects look less hokey.  This is just a fun movie that shouldn't be missed.  Honest Abe kicks some serious Vamp butt!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|You can get all kinds information on your hands,<br />from politics to art gallery.<br />Pictures and arts are so beautiful.<br />thanks.
B00A757EFW|2.0|This game will not play all the way through so it really frustrates me. Once you're really getting into the game it stops then redirects you to the home menu.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for occupying children or adults. this game is simple yet addicting. great for road trips or a lazy night on the couch!
B009JBZH54|4.0|I'm a fan so I may not give a proper feedback... I liked the spcecial features for the 3rd installment although I already had the bluray for 1 & II, I still couldn't resist... I also noticed that on disc 1 the features don't play, i couldn't make the menu run, it goes straight to the movie
B005ERIRXG|5.0|By far the most powerful book I've read in a long time. Apply the principles and see the changes in your life. The concepts are great. Wishbone had read this years ago and started living the way life was intended. Whether you call Him God, Master of the Universe or Creator...He is at work and this book teaches how to live on accord with His will.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A good read, but Idon't like having to write all these extra words, please don't ask me to do this again.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|This is literally my favorite album ever and the DVD was so cute. I love Nicki Minaj so much. This is a great buy.
B000FC10WU|5.0|We do Love Her writings for a long time! Sure like my Kindle E-reader, it is great.Keep the mysteries coming.
B008Y778ZG|4.0|Exciting action sequences with likable main characters.  The video is outstanding. There is more real science in this movie than in the global warming hoaxes that are passed off as real.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was beyond impressed with this book. It flowed so well, and kept my constant attention. It was such a unique story and was very well written. Just go in knowing, its a book you most likely wont be able to put down until you've read it all.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story has so many emotions- sadness,happiness, laughs and tears. First book I have read by this author and plan to read all she writes. Well done.
B00AL3KEE8|4.0|I love R Ross on 100 Black Coffins and the Tupac/James Brown mashup...the movie dialogue snippets are cool too :)
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|Could not have been more pleased with this album.  Not exactly a news flash...but there is no one else singing/performing today (either in opera or in the pop world) who is as talented and charismatic and as capable of emotional expression in his singing.<br />Just fantastic.
B00540G3G6|5.0|I haven't checked out the special features on this yet, and we don't have a 3D TV so can't comment on that but this made my Halloween and got me ready for the holiday season!
B000YKE87W|5.0|Even though this album was recorded, I believe, four years ago, I had not heard it.  What else can one say though about Jonas Kaufmann:  He is the best...then, now, and forever.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|\\"Santa\\" gave this to my 6-year old daughter for Christmas and I was really looking forward to watching it with her.  What a load of garbage.  I am absolutely miffed.  I mean I loved Tangled, The Incredibles, The Little Mermaid, etc.  What does getting a witch to turn your mother into a bear have to do with archery and being BRAVE?  So stupid.  My husband and I would like the 1 1/2 hrs returned to us.  Ugh.  The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because my daughter thought it was fun.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|this is me and my dads favorite show of all time so when i saw the complete series for such a great price i jumped on it its got great extras and all 11 seasons in one box you cant go wrong so funny, i miss al bundy wish there was new episodes
B0073LWEXK|3.0|This game is about your grandmother tells you about the Lost City. She gives you a journal, a map and a green mysteries stone.You can put secrets you find in your journal and there is a button in there that tells you what you need to do. When you are on your adventure to find the Lost City, you have to solve puzzles and riddles.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My 12-yr. old son enjoys this game very much on his new tablet..  The game is all the rage with his friends.
B005FISBTO|4.0|I thought I would hate Dexter, but I am hooked.  It's one of my favorite shows.  The story plot is really interesting and keeps your attention throughout the seasons.
B002VXGW2E|3.0|I was looking forward to watching this movie because I love Amy Adams and Meryl Streep. After 30 minutes I could see that the movie wasn't really going in any particular direction, and it lacked focus. After an hour I couldn't watch any more I was so bored! I thought the plot IDEA was great and the actors were really good, but it was just so boring. Don't waste your time.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Great performance on the different characters, spectacular and very funny dialogs. I really recommend this movie. I love Christoph Waltz.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A great, yet suspenseful read! This was definitely one of the better Nicholas Sparks books I have read. Can't wait for the movie now!
B006VA57CY|5.0|For the first series:<br />Downton Abbey is a sentimental look at the turn of the 20th century through the lives of an aristocratic family in Northern England (Yorkshire). This BBC series is impeccably done, covering the major events and inventions of the time and telling a human story to go with them. While the luck of the family is unusually good, it is not as much of the faerie tale telling as many period shows follow. If you are fond of the writings of Jane Austen or the Bronté sisters, you will like the series a good deal. The UK edition is advised.<br /><br />Update for the second series:<br />The trials and tribulations of the residents of Downton Abbey continue with the advent of the Great War. The changing times impose great changes on life at Downton, forcing most everyone to come together in the way that only the British can manage. The style is quite similar to the first series, albeit with a touch more drama than previously found. Those who enjoyed the first run, should enjoy the continuation of the story.
B002W5UVSM|4.0|This book was better than I thought it would of been and I am very glad that I came across it
B00005JO5L|4.0|The movie starts out laying the ground work for a glimpse into the gay leather scene that existed in the 80's and by the end of the movie you are reading between the lines trying to figure out what really happened.<br /><br />If your offended by Gay references and depictions of sex this is not for you. If you like a dark mystery then be prepared to see Pacino in a new light.
B00280LYIC|5.0|read this book now. Great story, should definitely read this book before starting the heroes of olympus series lot more interesting
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Just when you think Dexter is falling into a normal routine everything changes. The writers have figured out how to make you cheer for the bad guy..but then again is he really so bad?
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I found this book to be a tad tedious. The long passages going in and out of third person put me off a bit.<br /><br />John Grisham said it himself, he was a tad lazy.
0062086529|5.0|I just bought this for my daughter who is pregnant with her first child. We read this book till it fell apart when she was a baby. She could fill in every word. We read it backwards and forwards. Wonderful book.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a superbly well written and well acted show.... unlike most television. I do not watch television much because the shows tend to be superficial, mind numbing, and pointless. Lazy writing, lazy production, with a corporate goal of making easy $$$. This series is the antidote and is addictive. When I purchased the first episode, I immediately purchased a second. The next day I purchased the entire season and consumed it in a nonstop marathon. WARNING! This show is worse than Lays potato chips, you cannot eat just one :-)) The only complaint I have is there were some scenes which had graphic violence which seemed gratuitous in that such a well written script did not need to resort to cheep Holly wood tricks and just shock the viewer with a visual instead of telling a story with the visual.
B008FYZIVY|2.0|I got this as a present for a friend and all the cds with the episodes are fully functional except the cd with the special features came cracked i would return it but since i gave it as a present i cant really ask for it back just to return it for a new one. Aside from the unusable special features cd, this is a really great product.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Good movie with more humor than I expected. The movie definitely kept our interest. I would also like to watch the rest of the series.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It is good for the kindle fire, but there are only 2 problems with it.<br />1. It drains the battery<br />2. It somewhat bothers me to have to, press the power button then slide the lock screen, then type in the password<br />Other than that it's a good app but I would apriciate if you guys could figure out how to fix number two
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I am not sure what the all they hype was on this movie.  We had a few chuckles but definitely would not watch it again.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were amazing!!! I loved the steamy scenes, but also the amazing plots!! I thank EL James for writing these wonderful books!!
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|excellent
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So good! Not what I expected at all! Good story behind it! A must read! Enjoy it right now people!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The actors were great and the music was upbeat and enjoyable.  Rebel Wilson was the highlight.  It's a movie that serves no other purpose than to entertain and sometimes that is all we want.  The only down side was the vomit scenes which I felt were totally unnecessary.
B00A757EFW|5.0|IT IS GREAT, GET TO PLAY GAME ON THE GO.  MISSED BEING ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME, NO MORE. RIGHT HERE AT THE TIP OF MY FINGERS.
B007VUCAVO|3.0|no super great features here but the app is competent and decent enough to help you monitor the usage of the device and maximize the battery life.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I am a watch guy who liked the looks of this Seiko automatic for a weekend watch.<br />I also liked the idea of an automatic timepiece that would not require a battery,<br />Much to my surprise the accuracy is almost to a digital standard.  All in all a good looking watch that represents quality and value.
B00ADIT8U2|1.0|I am a huge Tesla fan and this app unfortunately falls short of any appropriate representation of the man and his work.  very basic production value, this is a simplistic 2d puzzle app that would have been better served as a hidden object game.  disappointing.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Something, who knows what, is in King 's brain and at mile marker 81.  Reminiscent of Christine and The Dome.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book could have easily gone down the path of self-help dribble, but instead it focused on habit research, and blended self-help where necessary. Speedy read, relevant stuff, highly interesting. One star shy of perfect as the middle chapters drug a bit.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|A fantastic compliation of all the themes from the 50 years for the Bond films.  A must for any &#34;true&#34; Bond fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At the time of this writing, it is 2 in the morning.  I took exactly one two-minute break in the time between now and when I started The Hunger Games.  That was four hours ago.<br />This is one of those books that you almost can't stop reading.  Yes, it is somewhat predictable in places, yes, the entire concept is fairly gruesome and terrible if you think about it, and yes, I would like to pick Katniss up by the scruff and smack her for being such a blind idiot.  However, all that and more was woven together in such a way that it made, in my humble opinion, a story of the highest caliber.  Now I'm stuck between a need to sleep and the little voice that says, \\"sleep is overrated, go get the next book.\\"
B009FBX5M0|5.0|I love this soundtrack.  I find this CD.  I feel that it was a very great purchase.  I love it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When you read the summary given, you will automatically assume that it's just another book about a cancer patient, it is not. I cannot even put into words how amazing this book is.<br /><br />I just advise you to read it.
0307593525|3.0|I gave this as a gift for someone who had just started cooking. Dissappointed no pictures of the recipes.  I believe this should have been in the description of the book.  Was wondering if the original book had pictures?  The book was shrink wrapped so I did not look at the book myself.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Very light movie and good for easy entertainment if you want something that won't tax your analytical skills. Non-violent and no car chases are also a plus.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Finding things in the dark is a cool twist but it's a bit too easy the graphics are nice but the same music gets annoying
B005TBWN0K|2.0|Just got this today. I'm using it with a jot pro stylus and after lifting the stylus from the screen one or two times it switches from write mode so no further marks are made until I tap the pen Icon again. Very aggravating. Expected better from Evernote. Not sure if I will even continue to use. Is there something I am doing wrong here?
B0025YKDJC|5.0|Rented on Amazon Prime; everything came through really well, and I had forgotten this gem of a movie. Some funny moments and a good reminded to live life and actively make decisions. =)
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Very good read. Lots of history and twists. Dan Brown does it again. Would recommend this to readers everywhere. Great book.
B0091REZMW|3.0|seems ok so far. have just started it. first app of this type i have played. not sure if it willbecome redundant quickly or not.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I thought it was going to be better and live up to the earlier movies. I was a bit disappointed.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|If you want to read an exciting action zombie splatter-fest you will be disappointed. This reads like a collection of survivor stories years after the war with the undead. Still good but not what I expected. Was hard to develop feelings for characters you spend only a few moments with before it was on to another interview.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Saw this with my five young kids the other night.  All kids, 10 and under, really enjoyed it.  Even the adults enjoyed it.
1593272774|5.0|Great idea book to supplement your technic power functions.  Super bonus was that it was affordable.  Great pictures to help direct your lego nut into trying new ideas.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game but when I came home from school I played for a while and then dirt turned into osbedian and dirt turned into mossey cobble stone!!!!! that's not all!!! MY WHOLE GAME TURNED TO CREATIVE! !!! was it just the fun of herobrine??? would you like to hurt a 8 year old girl?my username is bunny cakes ;03
B0096BIENY|5.0|What is not to like about Il Divo?!!???  Fantastic!  To get 2 CD's for the price paid is an extra plus!
B00992CF6W|1.0|it is stupid what's the point of it.Me and my friend hates it but I despise my other two friends liking it.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I have a droid phone and am used to the Andronotes app so I haven't really used this one yet.  I had it on a previous phone and never used it.  I think I'm just used to the andronotes, but I will definitely take time to get adjusted to it.  One thing that would make it better than andronotes is if it is alphabetical when searching for notes!
0374214913|3.0|Not an important piece of literature but a perfect read.  I read it in just a couple of days. Not enough for a book club...
0375413405|5.0|This was a gift and the recipient loves it.  I'll have to grab a copy for myself!  Julia Child was an amazing woman!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A wonderful read, hard to put down. Would recommend to all my friends who enjoy Nicholas Sparks. Loved it lots.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a really great app, you have to really think about some of the challenges, becuase it may look simple but then there can be a twist you weren't expecting. This is fun for all ages, my 3 yr old twin boys ask for it when they see my Kindle Fire come out. They need alot of direction and are limited to what they can comprehend, but they love just playing the same level over & over again most times. Graphics are of course top quaility being a Disney product. I started with the free version, but got the full versioin because it's so addictive. You feel successful after figuring out each level. It's similar to Where's my Water by Disney.. Highly recomend getting it to get addicted to it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW! I laughed, I cried and then I lauged and cried some more.  The most touching book I've read in my whole 37 years! I would say that someone should make a movie out of Hopeless, but no movie could ever do this book the justce it deserves.  WOW!
B0052GACNM|5.0|This is a great album. All the duets are good, the best being Aretha and Tony. The most soulful rendition of How Do You Keep The Music Playing that I have heard. Aretha adds a little bit of her African American roots to the song.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I would love it except it has some glitches.<br /><br />otherwise the game is addictive and I cant get enough of it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I'm a music nerd but I LOVED the covers they did in this movie. There are a few questionable parts as far as kids are concerned but other than that, I highly recommend this movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Can't wait to pick the book up again, I have to see where this book is going. Good Read Keeps You Interested.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is not a light read and it's going to stay with me for a while. Just wow, really. Yes, I would recommend this to people to read, but be forewarned the content is not for the faint of heart. The only beef I have is the speed of acceptance; however I believe it is addressed in reference to the future they discuss and we don't see. Well written with incredibly powerful content. If only all victims could be saved so well, with this amount of love and understanding.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good read! In fact, I can't wait to read the next book in this series! I just couldn't put it down.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Watch it if you haven't seen it, watch it if you have. I don't want to hear any excuses about &#34;Mehhhh subtitles, blah blah too hard.&#34; STFU and watch the damn movie. You'll forget there are subtitles after 2 minutes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple solitare app. Works great, runs great. A little hard to see, should lookbetter in landscape but doesn't. otherwise, great.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|The acting isn't great, and the whole thing is a little predictable, but this is a funny, funny show!  Bought it for my husband and ended up watching all the episodes with him.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I love the kind of movie that has all those great lines tucked in amongst regular dialogue. This is the movie to own and bring out to watch with guests and be able to enjoy catching a hidden gem of a line for the first time every time you see it! Brilliant thank you!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Every cover of a Nicholas Sparks book is white people almost kissing.<br />And every Nicholas Sparks story is equally similar.<br /><br />That being said, they're fun to read.  And they draw you in.<br />If you liked his other books, you'll like this one.<br />If not, quit reading Nicholas Sparks, 'cause they're all the same!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a wonderful book and I read it in one day! I couldn't put it down once I started and the ending was a little different then I thought it would be. I am very excited for the movie to come out.
B0002TKFGS|5.0|If you like John Denver this is obviously a great choice for your collection.  I still like having music that isn't in the cloud.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Love Holmes tales and like the presentation in this book. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are always a good read.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It's okay, not great. Some of the best lines come from the contest moderators (Elizabeth Banks & John Michael Higgins), much like Best in Show.
B008476HBM|5.0|I am happy to finally have read it. It is a lovely read that is worthy of being deemed a classic.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This was so much fun. The game is fast and makes you think ahead. It is fun for all ages. Enjoyable. And it was free.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking Up Married was funny and easy reading.  It was my first book to read on my ipad and I enjoyed it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a fun hidden objects game with pretty good graphics. Neat little story line. I would recommend this game.
B000I9YV30|1.0|it keeps pausing i havent been able to even watch the movie.i want a refund or i will never download a movie again esp. if they dont improve them
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Discs were in great shape, product new sealed in plastic as described. Looks beautiful in blue ray & is high on my re-watch list.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|She is quick, smart, and down to earth and oh so funny.<br />This is a great read anytime and anywhere.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a fantastic book, I had a hard time finding stopping points  as every page was better than the previous one. Just when you think you have  it figured out it takes a turn! Loved it!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Maybe 3.5......I REALLY wanted to love this book. I was prepared to love this book. At first, it reminded me a bit of Shadow of the Wind - a great book about a bookstore. I did love the author's voice - he often made me chuckle as I read, as he not only wrote the story, but also his inner thoughts at times, which were clever. and I loved the setting of San Francisco - it is always fun to identify with a character or locale. My problem, though, was that this book had SUCH potential, but kind of just meandered along. I think it really needed some big conflict, or problem, or enemy, or something! there were hints that something big might come along, but no, the story just kept a nice even keel the whole time.<br />This story also, like the past few books I've read, involved a protagonist who, along with various of his friends, was very good at computers. He ends up working at Mr. Penumbra's 24 hour bookstore, because it was at least a job. Not a whole lot goes on there, but he finds out that there is a mysterious group of the Unbroken Spine who are trying to figure out the key to immortality by decoding an old book. It just sounds as if there should be plenty of possibilities for adventure there........ but like I said, it's very low-key.<br />There were some good quotes, thank goodness:<br />&#34;Simulated light from the simulated windows casts sharp-edged shadows through the simulated store. If this sounds impressive to you, you're over thirty.&#34;<br />&#34;Fingers of thought are raking the space behind the cushions, looking for loose ideas, finding nothing.&#34;<br />He also described the &#34;cult&#34;...&#34;it might have been designed specifically to prey on bookish old people - Scientology for scholarly seniors.&#34;<br />So, this book was kind of a let-down for me. It was a fairly quick read, but I think it didn't live up to its potential.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Never change any Mahjong games. They are wonderful and keep alert and attentive and brain power to match each block with the number or design.<br />No changes. This keeps me entertained for hours.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|This looks good, and might would be a great app but I have not been able to change the location settings, it keeps giving the time and weather for California.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use google for everything when I want to search, email or purchase or rate product. I believe in this time and age you can never not have enough info to search.
B004T32SOK|4.0|This is a great app that has come in very hand in storing and sharing items in the cloud.  I would highly recommend this app.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This keeps your mind intact. Remembering that you need to match and add and remove. No negative thoughts about this game
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I got this for my mom as a gift and she loves it! I already have the album and really enjoy it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Nothing since Tolkien has kept my attention or spun as beautiful a story. The characters seem to come alive when they are first introduced. I could not have asked for a greater high fantasy series.
0330456555|5.0|Really impressive story - David Baldacci has once again written a masterpiece that thoroughly held my attention through the entire 613 pages (biggest book in his series).
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I really like this book. It's different from books I've read. Sometimes it predictable. I think I know exactly where the next one will pick up birthdays just me. I give the matched series and A.
0810970686|5.0|My kids love this series. So I ordered it for them to read and pass the book among other kids so all the kids can read it and share what they like in the book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Excellent characters and story. Could not put this book down! Hoover had me obsessed with this book and in love with the characters.
B005HSL626|5.0|We love this game! Its very entertaining and on the Kindle it's like 3-D. Like playing it on my Kindle vs my phone. Super fun to play!
B000F8O35U|5.0|This collection was a great one. Even though it was used, I still really enjoy watching it. Great movie and DVD collection for your children to watch.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Everybody in the house plays this game and as most people know, it's very addicting. No one wants to allow those green pigs to win ! LOL.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Those this book is kind of kinky at first, I love them. Best books so far!<br />Want something good to read at nests! ? These are the books!
B001EN71CW|4.0|I love Firefly and I got this at a great price. This is a perfect addition to my collection. Much better than DVD
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I love all of the books this man writes, just some more than others. This one made me think, a lot.  Don't want to give it away so I'm not gonna go into details, but it's worth reading for sure.  I always seem to put myself into the person the book is being written about. Try it, u will like it. What would you do?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely amazing loved this book SUCH A GOOD STORY LINE CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT TWO<br />WAYY BETTER THEN TWILIGHT
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book because, although it's pretty hard to relate to it always kept me guessing what would happen. Towards the end I just couldn't put the book down!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I just received a kindle fire for Christmas and i was looking for a good game app that wasn't terrible or really dumb.<br />Then i came across Rayman and it was perfect, the controls couldn't be better and the music was catchy and the missions started off easy and got harder at the perfect pace.<br /><br />Id recommend this for all ages and someone who is looking for a good but simple game.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|I really enjoyed this  book but there were times when the characters or the author would go on about philosophy that was very interesting but a little boring.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Hard to manuever, and it's not the full game...it's just a sneak peak.  Granted, it's free...but was expecting a wee bit more.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|I've seen the first three episodes. I had to go to iTunes to get the first one at 99 cents because the season 1 disc 1 at Netflix has been on Long Wait for six months now. After that, I got the next two through Amazon so I could park them on the TiVo, so now I can resume with Netflix. This was harder than it should have been.
B009K45Y62|5.0|This bluray is awsome the movie is great and is an epic film and emotional ending for the nolan batman universe. 2 thumb up for one of the best movies of the year. The boxing of the discs is bit of a let down, it comes in a silly plastic cover but the hell, the bat cowl is everything. This movie is more comicbook like than the 2 previous, but hey, its batman, and we go to a cinema to be entertained, not to watch a reality show.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|This album is a gem!  I didn't even realize all the songs but two were covers, and I listen to a LOT of holiday music.  I think it says much about Tracey's presentation.  I particularly like her interpretation of Sufjan Stevens' \\"Sister Winter\\", and \\"Joy\\" is simply the standout of the record for me.  There is not a bad track in this collection.  Her take on \\"River\\" is evocative, emotive, and will bring a tear to the eye.  My best holiday music find of 2012!
B003UESJEM|5.0|Here we go again, here we go again with word requirements, here we go again, here we go again, he
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is so addictive! It's entertaining and enthralling from start to finish! The period accuracy and the multiple story lines keep you interested.
B0034G4P80|4.0|When I received this item there was a large cut all the way through the cover which I was not happy about but luckily the movie played fine so it wasn't that big of a deal.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie is NOT my typical genre and I don't care for the subject matter, however, when you have a house full of relatives over during the holidays...you tend to get out voted.  Anyhoo, this movie was quite charming and enjoyable.  The music was, for the most part, good and the casting was superb.  Hey, I'm shocked, too!  Certainly worth a viewing!  Enjoy!
0789204096|5.0|The Norman Rockwell  332  Magazine Covers gave me many hours of enjoyable  reading. It's small format is comfortable to hold unlike many larger coffee table books. It is well constructed and finely printed. A great value.
0679805273|5.0|This is a fabulous book, everyone young and old should own it!  I bought copies for myself and my nieces.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|this product was amazing, had very quick shipping, and was of great quality. it was and especially great because all of the dvds had a bonus disc with extra features, and it was super cheap!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Will Ferrell is perfectly cast, this is such a feel good holiday movie. Have watched this movie at least 4 times just this holiday season. Can't watch it enough, has SO many scenes which my wife and I relive and re-laugh almost daily (almost every scene in the movie).
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|My aunt told me to read this series. I'm so glad I did it was awesome. I'm in love with their relationship!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game will suck you in!!! Great graphics and gameplay. Puzzles are challenging but not impossible. Hint button and map. Storyline is good too. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. Love the monkey too. Nice addition to the game.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I became fascinated with this artist and simply had to buy some of his music.  I like most of the pieces on the CD and love his writing and his music in general.
0316232955|5.0|This book was really funny! I'd recommend this to all writers out there that want to laugh and anyone who doesn't mind a ton of cursing. I also recommend reading the book before the movie. The movie has more details on everyone else while the book only really has Carson's point of view. If you haven't read it... GO NOW!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It had a bit of a slow start but i am eager to start book 2!!  The love story helped keep me extremely interested!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The first book I read on my Christmas kindle. Very interesting, as his always are. I also learned a little more about the late 50s-early 60s.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|I bought this CD as a Christmas present.I watched it with the person I bought it for and we both loved it because the content and quality of the CD.It exceded  my expectations.

B00942S4OY|2.0|One Direction is OK for tweens but not for teens.  My 13 year has out grown One Direction and their music.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book pulled me in and kept me interested to the last page. I love the characters and was even choked up in more than one part with a feeling of almost being there. This book was recommended to me and I would definitely recommend it to others. Loved it!
B008XNZMOU|4.0|My daughter enjoyed this recording very much.  She thinks Taylor Swift is the greatest.  She now has all her recordings.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This DVD-A is truly incredible!<br /><br />It consists of the extremely popular Beatle's songs spanning 10 years. I listen to them in my car that has DTS Surround built-in since I bought it a few years back. I'm still blown by the incredible sound quality today. This is the money!
B0086700CM|5.0|My son got the game first. I played his and loved it. I just had to get it for myself.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I liked this book because it had action, mystery, and lots of twists to keep you wondering. I am going to have to try to read the rest of his books!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this game because of the various options you can play. It allows you to choose the kind of deal and it plays really quickly. Great free app!
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|For the most part a good family movie. A couple of lines may be a bit beyond some younger viewers and the gay character at the end was dissapointing. Overall...a good movie.
1601251505|4.0|I wish it came with color-coded edges so that I could flip right to the pages / sections that I needed. I am a total noob though.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This movie was great and absolutely hilarious! We all watched it for Xmas eve. Everyone really loved it. I had only caught part of it on HBO which is were I found out about this movie. Must've been a sleeper movie but well worth buying!
B004UID2LC|2.0|Youtube Downloader is a wasted program. Shortly after downloading it, I used it, and even shorter after that, I deleted it. It is a very heavy program that allows you to copy and download videos from youtube, and once downloaded, starts sending you constant spam from their contributors. I deleted the program because of how inconvenient it was to use and had to block the flood of email traffic that shortly ensued. I would caution anyone from downloading this app to use.
B000SEGQNS|3.0|I expected more to be honest but its fair enough. Author wanted to keep it short in purpose so i wont complain about it.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|Hotmail is a decent program. It allows you to do basic functions to check and send email from your Smartphone device. It does lack on some of the functions that the full program offers like filters, or other nice to sort options that the full version offers. I would recommend this app to anyone that wants a quick way to answer or send email while on the go.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Ihave this game for my ipod touch and it's awesome this is the best Angry Bird game ever.I wonder what the next Angry Bird game is going to be?
159514188X|5.0|Wow - probably the most powerful book I have ever read!  This is a realistic study in how each of our words and actions, when combined with those of others, can build up and completely shatter someone else.  It is relatable not only to teenagers, but adults as well.  I am 40 years old and saw parts of myself in this book, in Hannah.  Rumors and lies can and do have a snowball effect in some people's lives.  We always here \\"Everyone has problems\\" but everyone handles them differently and are affected by them differently.  Whether you are a victim, bully, or perpetrator, you will see yourself somewhere in this book.<br /><br />SMALL SPOILER:  I say BRAVO to Hannah's voice!  A couple reviews didn't like her and found her to be spitefull and childish - I found her to be honest, and possible using the tapes as a way to maybe work through it all and not commit suicide - until she went to her teacher, who unknowingly sealed her fate; he never should have let her walk out that door.<br /><br />How many of us could have helped save someone from hurting themselves, had we only paid attention or listened, really listened? How many of us wish someone else would hear us??<br /><br />Fantastic book that will touch anyone who reads it...
0394826817|5.0|Like all his books, this one teaches the little ones in ways they will understand and it is never too early to have them learn manners.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|the set of three book s is an entertaing and the story line keeps you on your toes. the people in the story are easy to relat to even if they have money to burn. but there is a sence that they are real / magical and the sex is all over introducing differnt aspect and mida hope it is for adults only book for sure.

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I have not had wide exposure to other versions of this type of software, however, I am  able to load, open and navigate my office based files on my Kindle Fire, therefore, I am pleased with the performance and operations so far.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Great package! I always have to buy the movie with a digital copy nowadays and it honestly should become the standard. I'm so glad this set includes it as well as the Blu-Ray and DVD. As for the movie, you know its awesome and lives up to the quality of any Christopher Nolan film.
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|Oveall a good movie for action lovers! The plot was inline with continuance of the series.<br />It will be interesting to see where they go from here.<br />Look forward to the next release.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I downloaded this, and tried it out for a few minutes, before wiping my data and handing my phone over to my kids. It is a very clever and novel app. I would recommend this app!
B008I43DYU|5.0|This Kindle Tablet edition works great! Just as strong as my desk unit, and the large button format is very user friendly.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|A ok story, a few laughs but not many.  Really wanted to like it, just kind of blaaah.  If I had to do it again I'd try something else, this wasn't worth the time spent.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|I use this to carry my canon elephant series digital camera and it fits perfectly in there. You would be able to fit slightly bigger cameras in here.  I could also store the battery charger and a card reader but everything will be snug if you do.  It has 3 pockets so you an store everything separately.  Also comes with a wrist lanyard.  It is lilt padded to protect from minor bumps.  Good for the money as with all amazonbasics products.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If Amazon would allow it, I'd end my review after just one word \\"Wow!\\".  But they are requiring at least 20 words, so I'll just go on and on.  I've read all of Colleen's books (all 3 of them) and they are all Amazing!  I can only hope and pray that she continues to write many, many more.  I may hunt her down and demand she be my \\"very bestest friend ever in the whole wide world\\", because of her personality and sense of humor that shine through in her books (and her blog), I know hanging around her would be a hoot and a half!<br /><br />Back to the book.  It captured me from the very first page and I couldn't put it down.  Read it completely in about 24 hours.  I couldn't get enough.  It went places I didn't see coming and left thinking \\"OMG!  What just happened here?!?\\"  Writing brilliance!  More please!
0071636080|5.0|This was a gift to my son. He loved it and is recommending to his friends around the world. Thank you

The search feature performs so much faster than that of the dictionary that is pre-installed on Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Use it to look up the meaning of a word, build your vocabulary, and learn bits of interesting trivia.<br /><br />Clearly, a must-have for your mobile device. And it's free.

1742200206|5.0|I was born and raised in the New York City area, and I've been living in Western Queens for the past nine years.  I can see the Empire State Building from my front window.  So, sure, I could tell you where to go, how to get there, and what there is to see from my perspective and experience; I could tell you to stay out of Times Square after five, and that the real New Yorkers shop and play in the Village and Union Square.  But if you really want a comprehensive guide to New York City, this is your book, because it's too big a city, with too much stuff, to rely on the knowledge and experience of a few individuals.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A great guide to a great city, even if you're from here.
B00881PPTO|3.0|fine, if i were one to travel more, bet you that I would use it enough to really, really like it

Breckin made me laugh on the regular, Holder made me fall in love with him instantly, and Sky was inspiring. The story-line in this book is incredible and unpredictable. This is possibly the best book I've ever read.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not a reader at all. Matter of fact I probably haven't read a book in years and honestly was not even about to see this movie in fear of it being some teen fad like twilight. But, after I had been talked into seeing this movie I found myself actually desiring to read this book and I'm so glad I did because it gave you so much more than the movie. You get so much deeper in the relationships. Don't pass this up!!!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|The little kindergarten children loved it and all the events we created to go along with it!  The teacher was glad to have it to use year after year!
B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|While all films are subjective to the individual viewer's tastes, horror films seem even more so. What scares one person may not do anything for another.  If you're looking for something with terrifying creatures, non-stop grueling horror, or a blood filled slaughterfest, the Innkeepers is probably not going to be your cup of tea.  It's a somewhat traditional ghost story that builds slowly with a few \\"jump scares\\" and a great atmosphere that becomes more oppressive throughout the film.<br /><br />  The Innkeepers centers around the Yankee Pedlar Inn, an old hotel that is entering its last week of operation. While the owner of the hotel is away on vacation and the guests have slowed to a trickle, the only two employees left, Claire and Luke, decide to stay at the hotel in order to do a little amateur ghosthunting. Like most older hotels, the Yankee Peddlar has its own resident ghost, the supposedly restless spirit of a bride left at the altar. Claire becomes excited at the prospect of recording evidence of the ghost while Luke builds a website devoted to the hotel's haunting.<br /><br />  Luke and Claire, while being completely average, are both quite lovable. Claire is  young, a little quirky, and definitely seems to have no plan as to where her life is heading after the Yankee Pedlar closes. Luke is a bit older than Claire. A college dropout who claims to regret his decision, Luke spends most of the film glued to his laptop computer. While the film is not a full blown character study, it does allow us to observe two characters who apparently have no future plans and yet consider the customers at their current job as a nuisance. Perhaps the only thing that Claire has going for her of any significance is the hope of recording evidence of the hotel's ghost which becomes an obsession for her.<br /><br />  The movie mainly follows Claire's attempts to contact the ghost and invites the viewer to get caught up in Claire's fervor to see something supernatural. While about half of the film is filled with the banter between Clare and Luke, the other half is filled with quiet scenes of Claire waiting for something to happen. What initially seems to simply be an old hotel with its own ghost story slowly becomes more menacing and oppressive as we get wrapped up in Claire's obsession.<br /><br />  The Innkeepers is not a CG filled terror fest soaked with blood and gore, but a rather quiet little film that relies on the likeable nature of the actors and the desire that we all have when we hear a compelling ghost story: To ask, \\"Is it real?\\"half of the film is filled with the banter between Clare and Luke, the other half is filled with quiet scenes of Claire waiting for something to happen.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey said he checks each and every review posted on Amazon for his books. If I were him, I would install a little alert that notified him whenever anyone gave him a 5-star review on this book. Hugh, here's another thumbs up.<br /><br />This book, series, whatever you call it, is MIND BLOWING. Truly, an incredible, deeply engrossing, emotional roller coaster that left me ignoring pressing life matters and pleads from humanity to put it down. If I had to pick my favorite book of last year, and that's counting in some really exceptional ones, I'd put this at, or near, the top of the list.<br /><br />What really makes this book great, for me, was how the story unfolded at a really excellent pace, and never allowed you to really see everything until the end. And, even then, did you figure everything out? The other piece to this that left me so awestruck was how personally invested I felt in each character, and how so much emotion seeped out through the pages. Howey is a wordsmith, and the sentences that might not matter to others could be pulled out at random.<br /><br />I love this book and have shared it with quite a few people since I stumbled upon it. Do yourself a favor and read something that will undoubtedly go down in Sci Fi history.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|I love George Harrison, and I love these songs. Got it just in time and the packaging is very pretty.
B0035JRVR8|4.0|Love it.  I love Audrey Hepburn.  I just rated it a 4 because I totally love 'How to Steal a Million' with Peter O'Toole much, much better.  It is a good movie and my granddaughters love to watch Audrey Hepburn with me. It was delivered quickly and in good condition.
B00005214X|5.0|Loved it. The box is beautiful. I enjoyed this so much. Being a George Harrison fan, I recommend getting this.

B006BY2DBI|5.0|I have most of this set beautifully bound by Folio Society in print and don't want to write in those volumes, so I use this kindle edition to allow me to add my copious notes to refer back to, highlight quotes that appeal and generally augment my reading pleasure. This kindle set works well for this purpose.<br /><br />Another advantage of the the kindle copy is that it has all the introductory material which I value too. Plus it also contains all the poetry and some lesser known works - it is truely \\"complete\\", well edited coming from Oxford and so a copy I can trust. I value this as I primarily use my kindle for complete editions of literature eg Dickens, Austin, Hardy et al and the classics.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I Absolutely loved this book.  It had simple way of looking at complicated things. I would reccomend this to anyone
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Bought this because I have watched the show early on but not from the beginning so I wanted to start from the first one so I can see how the story goes. I am not disappointed so far, only makes me want to be on my bike even more. Too bad its January and I live in the north. Oh well, come on summer please.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a very funny and entertaining movie! I enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it at any time to anyone!

B007REV4T8|5.0|\\"Skyfall\\" is the third James Bond film starring Daniel Craig as 007. It's got one of the best villains in the Bondverse with Javier Bardem, an Academy Award winning actor, playing Bond's foil. This film more than any other Bond film I can remember makes M a much more developed character. How can you go wrong when the director is an Oscar winner and a great deal of the crew have been nominated too? If you love James Bond, you won't be disappointed with this movie. I think casual fans will also enjoy it, and it should win over some new fans to James Bond.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is great. Its really intresting and has good decriptions. I abousltly love the games how they teamed up to help each other. I can't wait to read more to find out what is going to happen. The next book is supposed to be really sad tho. :p
B000F1IQNM|5.0|my grandchildren love this movie and so do we !  excellent product for a very reasonable price.  please continue to offer deals similar to this.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love the puzzles, challenging, but some of tiles are really small and are hard for me to read even with my glasses
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie arrived in good fast  condition. It was bloodier than I thought. Very sad. Others had read book which is why I bought the movie
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Does what it's supposed to do, gives good info and well I like it.I recommend it if you just want to see how much longer your battery is gonna last
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is my second Colleen Hoover book and I love it just as much as the first one! I plan on reading the third right after this review·
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it. I have always played this game since I was young and able to. It's pretty easy to win.
B00466HM28|4.0|I am a pianist and I found the keys and pads stiff enough to render it unusable - I had to concentrate on the velocity of my key presses to the exclusion of most other considerations.<br /><br />I ended up returning it, but I wish I hadn't, because I haven't found anything like it yet in terms of features per size. It's no substitute for a proper MIDI controller, but for quick-and-dirty desktop use - and if you can get used to the stiffness, or maybe have the patience to break it in - the size is fantastic.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have actually not even played this game yet but I am sure I will like it. I downloaded this game for my niece so she could play it and she loved it.
157421327X|4.0|I bought several books for students to use in the classroom.  They use them for ideas to add created texture to their own projects. Good purchase.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|All of Rick riordans books are awesome. Can't wait for the new one. I'm mad at the cliff hanger though
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I gave this a five star because I could not put this book down at any time, I can't wait for the next!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|You will have to get ready to buy but other than that it was beautiful graphics and spine chilling I just want to thank everybody  who parted in making this game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is my second favorite book series (Harry Potter is first) Love the writing truly an amazing series  would recommend it to anyone!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|All I can say is that I love Kinney`s books. But this one has got me thinking about how many more wimpy kids there will be to come. Because if this is the last one that would be a tragedy.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I recommend this book to for teens that are having any type of hardships in their life because it really teaches a valuable lesson.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|First of all, I chose the white case, because I wanted something different than my basic Kindle case (which is a pink Marware case, that I love), but still bright enough to stand out in a pile.  While the hard shell piece of the case is white, the soft cover is a soft, bendable black material, which ends up being the top cover of the case.  So you don't see much white (its the bottom), and the cover attracts link and dust immediately.  Really not thrilled with the look, and yes, that matters to me.<br /><br />Also not thrilled with the stand.  Ignore the reviews that say it works perfectly.  It doesn't.  It works OK.  If you're not on a hard surface like a desk or table, it really doesn't work well at all.  I like to stream video on my Fire while cozied up in bed, or on the couch, and this stand is virtually impossible to use in these kinds of settings.  I end up holding the thing in my hand, getting a cramp.<br /><br />Honestly, if this wasn't the third case I've tried (first one was a horrible color, second somehow ordered for the HD version by mistake), I would send it back.  As it is, I bet I order something different within the next couple of months.  Blah.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it! So interesting. I have read it five times! My favorite book in the series. A must read! Don't read&lt;Read
B000I9YWDO|2.0|This was recommended by a coworker a while back.  I was expecting something like a Dilbert expose of corporate America, but this was not that good.  I do not know whether the role of the boss, the regional VP, was supposed to be a parody of a typical Silicon Valley boss, but it seemed to me to be merely lame acting.  And worst of all, the central theme pivoted around an illegal act, which was very depressing and disappointing.  I can hardly believe that Jennifer Aniston ended up in this cheap flick.  Very dated, with some ancient computer equipment featured.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like this book because it is easier to understand the meaning of the word and I like the short sentences in the dictionary
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Shows what nice people lawyers are. The idealism of legal practice is extruded through the realities of life, family, and rivalries. Will keep the reader turning the pages.
0345505387|2.0|I was really looking forward to receiving this book, but I was very disappointed when I realized that the book's pages were out of order.  That made for a very disappointing read!
1451696191|5.0|Echoing what other reviewers have said - this epistolary novel successfully captures the awkward highs and lows of high school, and does it with a simplicity of style that is effective and affecting.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|Tried this on my kindle fire HD and as other reviews say it crashes within seconds of starting playback.<br /><br />I strongly recommend searching for XBMC.  I've used it for ages on my home theater PC and they just released an Android version of the software.  It works exactly like the PC version. You'd have to get the apk directly from the developers at XBMC.org and install yourself because amazon does not carry in the app store.<br /><br />So far it streams every media type of tried (including DVD .iso files!) seamlessly from my desktop PC to my tablet.  Pretty much exactly what I want.
B000067FP8|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my 3 yr old grandson, Steven.  He loves the Gremlins, this was a great edition to his movie collection.
B0055SWM08|5.0|My 3 year old can't stop playing this and neither can my 65 year old father in-law.  The easy levels are great for the kid and the harder ones are challenging for the adults. Great, great game.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my 3 yr old grandson, Steven.  He loves the Gremlins, this was a great edition to his movie collection.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|A visit into an odd world of peculiar children that can't exist, but then you start wondering........what if?<br />Could It exist?
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I can see why this is highly rated.  It's fast-paced, addicting and a challenge.  Like most games these days, you won't see most of the special items without paying for it.
1401323952|5.0|Great book, just make sure when you order it to check wether its the American imperial measurements book you need or the rest of the worlds metric book.
1419705849|5.0|Bought this for my son who is an avid Wimpy Kid reader.  He can't put it down.  Written in the same fun and humorous manner like his other books.
B0063IH60K|5.0|After I downloaded this app I used my Kindle on the Trax ride to work and it made it seem like minutes.  Easy to use - I had a great time playing this game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have minecraft on the Xbox and Mac to but this game is awesome and I think that you should get it!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is addicting.  It passes the time while riding on the train.  I would like a hint on how to get passed level 15!
0790742780|5.0|I am not very good at reviewing movies....but this is a must see classic ....something along the lines of &#34;Being There&#34;....a must have and must see movie.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I haven't had any problems that others mentioned in their reviews. my only complaint is that the brews feed has a bit of a delay when updating for new stories.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|We watched it twice in the 24 hour rental period!<br />I would definitely tell my friends and family about it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is great! I Love finding recipes, craft ideas, and anything else! App works . perfectly on my Fire and I have no complaints!
B003H9M1QM|5.0|I bought this to watch with my grandchildren when they visit.  We all watched it on Sunday and it was just as great as it was when my children saw it years ago!  It looked great in BluRay!
B0091QSNEE|1.0|I thought this game would be fun for my grandchildren but I found I couldn't actually download it into my Kindle - or if I did, I can't find it!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|no complaints, it does what I need and the gradual volume is a real bonus. I also like the snooze option.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This show gets better and better every season.  They know how to push all the right buttons to keep someone entertained.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Told mostly from the perspective of the German side - and Franz Stigler in particular - it REALLY opened my eyes about the moral standing of this fine man, and the German air corp in general (Luftwaffe).  I had some preconceived notions about the German treatment of Allies, but it was eye opening to see that the norm was to have true warriors that still have a soul.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I loved Firefly and when I saw that this was available on Amazon.......I had to buy it and it was a great price too....
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I just saw the news in cut the rope and I tried it out. I'm only on the 2 &quot;area&quot; but, This is soon fun!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this ap is it amazing it gives me all the pictures I want its very cool everyone should have this app!!!!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Room: A Novel had an interesting concept, telling the story from the child's view, but it also took away from the depth of the story line. It could have been told from both the Mother and the child. Sometimes it lingered too long.
0823013626|5.0|What I have read so far, is GREAT. Teaching me alot of new things. Explains things in a good way.
B000FIMG68|5.0|A great follow up to the first season!  If you enjoyed the first season at all this is a solid buy.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|Really interesting. The girls all lead fascinating lives and naughty lives at that. Just to let those more conservative readers know- there is some mild sexual content and swearing.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE AND I WOULD WATCH IT AGAIN LATER ON HAS ALOT OF THINGS IN IT THAT A PERSON WOULDN'T THINK WENT INTO RECURTTING IT WAS A WELL SCRIPTED MOVIE THAT I WOULD PUT AS A MUST SEE.
0385535139|4.0|I bought this book for my husband as a Christmas gift.  We both are huge John Grisham fans.  This book did not disappoint.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Very interesting movie. Nothing like the book even though it was based on the book. The movie was good. I liked it
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|My nephew has tons of LEGOs but did not have any of the Lord of the Rings sets.  This is a good starter set.
098478280X|5.0|this is very good book, easy to ready and to the points. Do the problems and exercises in the book, I gained a lot confidence in coding interviews.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a wonderful book, carefully researched and elegantly written.  The history reads like fiction in the hands of this highly skilled author.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|the artwork of the DVD version looks Great! it's better than i expected.<br />and the movies, what can i say? i  love this trilogy!
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Just in case you thought that this was too small of a hood...  All lens have a specific hood.  Please google that to know why it's not as long as you'd like it before you rate down on size.<br /><br />It works how it's supposed to.  Qualify is great as well.  Good buy.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|good game. just bought it yesterday and its addicting. you should play it. I haven't stopped playing since I bought it. 4 stars.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is so fun!!!! you get to play with friends on facebook or just other people. this is the best game ever!!!!!!!
B0011NVCSO|5.0|This is a fabulous album. I love the unique sound of the band. If you like new music you will enjoy this band.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|The bear is funny. But most of the funny stuff was in the commercials. Not sure why it's received so much hype as being one of the funniest movies ever - not even close.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I put everything into this app - grocery lists, gardening maps, all those damn passwords.  My only complaint is that the little icons are not very self explanatory until one gets the hang of it.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|This is one of the best zombie-apocalypse films I've ever seen it, and it's surprisingly technically a comedy (although there definitely are some dramatic moments in my opinion).  Simon Pegg is the man in this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love to read, but it's still pretty rare that I find a book I can't put down to the point that I read it in one sitting. The story line sucks you in. There's passion, struggle, heartache, romance, strength, & still a plot worth reading too...which is something I've found to be increasingly difficult to find lately. The emotions were SO intense. I would buy it again & definitely plan on reading it again!!
B003IY48PS|4.0|I gotta be honest; I'm surprised it has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but still I enjoyed the movie.  I was kind of expecting something zombie-related.  If zombies is what you're looking for, you won't find it here.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I like this guy better than Damon in this series; a more gritty character fits better. A good movie overall.
B004NTDEXY|4.0|This is a solid pair of blu rays.  I think American History X is superior, but History of Violence aint too bad.  I was in between 3 and 4 stars, but gave it four due to getting this pack for such a solid price.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Very sad book.  It was a very sad book.  It made me open my eyes and pay more attention to my surroundings..  Anything could happen.  Keep your kids close!!!
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game.highly addictive and will cause you to spend money. definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone.
B008LZHA3G|2.0|I bought this after reading a very favorable review. Was disappointed in the sameness of the songs, mostly all dejected ballads, without the variety and creativity of some of his other recent albums.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It was ok. The ones with Matt Damon were much better but i can see where they can make sequels to this movie. I guess i was looking for more action.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|His continued exuberance is irresistible. Wonderful, varied music in his  heartful style. Thank god he never went to Plan B.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Extremely hard to put down. I'm not sure what else to say about it. Good read, for sure. Definitely worth reading.
B003L77GRO|5.0|The 5th season of Dexter is great.  Suspenseful as always and entertaining...you'll be routing for the bad guy (??) once again.  Stiles plays an intriguing character/survivor who adds a new twist to an already twisted up story plot.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Couldn't believe how lucky I was to get this set at such a low price! My boyfriend loved it and the art is lovely. Purchased this item as a gift so I can't speak to special features, but overall it's a high quality display box.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|If you're interested in how Google, or search engines for that matter, got to be what they are today, then read this book, it is certainly for you.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the best book of all three in the series. I was not sure I'd keep reading these books after the graphic descriptions of &#34;abuse&#34; in the first one, but they proved to be a great love story and life lesson!
B006O7XOOW|4.0|I selected this item for my niece's new baby, who just turned six months old.  We put it together with very little trouble.  The instructions could have been more clearly written but it was extremely simple to put together.  The battery compartment was a bit tight and required a little force to open.<br /><br />Once it was fully assembled, we played with it for a couple of minutes before allowing the young one to interact with the toy.  She was immediately drawn to the Ballcano.  It has a blue and red flashing light and it plays music.  So it had her full attention.  She was shown the cylinder to turn to make the Ballcano \\"erupt\\" causing the balls to cascade down the side.  It only took a couple of times before she caught on and started turning the cylinder herself.<br /><br />On the opposite side of the cylinder is a piece that can be turned to start the music playing.  Again, once she was shown how to turn the piece, she had lots of fun making the music play.<br /><br />She was not old enough or does not have the motor skills to retrieve the balls and put them in the top of the Ballcano.  I suspect it will be a couple of months before she can fully engage with the toy.<br /><br />She was fascinated by the music, the flashing lights and the balls cascading down the side of the Ballcano.  I think it will be entertaining for a few months as she learns to retrieve the balls and make the Ballcano erupt all by herself.<br /><br />I was concerned if the music would cause a distraction for her parents or others.  It was not too loud and the tunes were not the type where they would grate on you after hearing them too many times.<br /><br />While the toy says it is good for a six month old child, I think that is stretching it a bit.  I suspect it will be more appropriate for a child who is at least a year old.<br /><br />It will teach the child some cause/effect lessons and will help develop motor skills.  It seemed sturdy but only time will tell how much wear and tear it will take.  The toy is all plastic and does not have any sharp corners or edges which would hurt a child.<br /><br />The little girl's reaction to the toy was very positive and I am sure it will keep her busy for many hours.ill take.

0060899190|5.0|This is a brilliant and wonderful thing. Frank Warren's idea is deeply beautiful and the secrets he publishes here are inspiring and really human. This is very heavy and thick book -- think coffee table style. It would take a an hour or maybe more to work through the whole thing and thoughtfully consider each postcard. Great purchase.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was a gift I got for my husband. I love how compact it is and we were pleasantly surprised that inside was a book with all the disks. Each page had a disk and a scene from the movie that looked like a watercolor painting. My husband also noticed the movie was enhanced and the picture quality has greatly improved. The packaging and the disks are of great quality. We are very happy to add it to our collection of Blue Ray dvds.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|What's not to love..... this is the Bee Gees! Fabulous cd's for the price, we are really loving listening to it
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Well wat can I say Seth didn't let me down! Had an overal good laugh I would recommend this movie to friends.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|The plot line was almost nil.  I knew some guy was being chased, but nothing made me care if they caught him.  Absolutely no character development.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|it is the best app ever because you could do math pronouns on it and it techs my student's how to coller
B008J34466|2.0|If ever a grouping of songs was used as a conveyor of curse words, this CD is it!  One song stands out as something I'd listen to more than a few times...the others, not.  Pink's customary use of clever lyrics is noticeably missing.
B009AMANBA|5.0|When I saw the previews for \\"Lincoln\\" and found out that Steven Spielberg was producing and directing it, I knew I would be in for a treat.  What I didn't know was how much of one.<br /><br />This movie was magnificent.  I've not seen anything like it in years.  There's so much to like... the acting was exceptional (by all!), the set and costume design were top notch, the musical score (by none other than the brilliant John Williams) was beautiful and the dialog was clever/wonderful.  The film is based on the book \\"Team of Rivals:  The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\\" by author, historian and Pulitzer-Prize winner Doris Kearns Goodwin who has chronicled the political lives of other past American Presidents.  Essentially, \\"Lincoln\\" is about the passage of the 13th Amendment (after the Emancipation Proclamation had already passed and he had been re-elected) and how difficult it was for President Lincoln to get members of his party and even of his cabinet to pass it.  Clearly some artistic liberty had to be taken with various parts of the movie's dialogue, but the House of Representatives dialog where many of its members would publicly stand to address each other and the issues at hand must have been accurate due to the reporters in the chamber!  The reporters were the public record keepers writing down the words of the congressmen and publishing them in all of the popular and well regarded newspapers of the day which are probably available  (perhaps at the Library of Congress?) for public viewing.<br /><br />I don't know what other movies will be competing for movie of the year or who will be competing for Oscars with Daniel Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones, but I sure hope this movie wins big.  See this.  You will not be disappointed!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved it. From start to finish. I could not put it down. I felt every emotion. It will make your heart pound and bring tears to your eyes. I fell in love with the book!!! I did not want it to end......can't wait to read the next one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent casting.  Excellent story line.  My first experience realizing how much service staff the rich had at that time and we didn't even see the laundresses, gardeners, and much of the livery people. Interesting to see the relationships and loyalty fenerally between family and staff.  Looking forward to Season 3.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Kat is such a fighter, the love story between she and Bones. Thank you Jeaniene Frost for keeping me entertained.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Three terrific movies. Very entertaining. Looks great on Blu-Ray and terrific value for the price. Sounds great on the sound system. A great buy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose this rating because of the breath taking action and the details to make it more interesting than other book's
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|I am typically not hard to please in the movie entertainment department, but this movie was a total flop. Mildly entertaining at moments. But basically a waste of time.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|We really like this CD.  It was so nice to have just in time for Christmas, we are definatly wearing it out.
1451638450|5.0|Fans cherish each and every word written by her...this Bujold person. They whine and and snivel (or sometimes twist and shout) when events don't go the way they think they should. Well here 'the Bujold' gives us a twist that's worth shouting about. Ivan, a solid character at last, gives us a tale to bring a smile, a laugh then an outright guffaw...with an almost George and Gracie feel. Such a heart warming delight. This is light romantic comedy on a par with the best that the 30's and 40's offered up. Might as well call it, ''The Road to Barrayar''.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|This came very fast and served as a good Christmas present for our girls.  Both like the song Call me Maybe and it's been interesting listening to them Karaoke.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies i've seen.  The witch trio is wonderful!  The story is a solid story.  the ending a bit long, but 'tis a wonderful movie!!
0307474259|5.0|this is not a diet book, but the information in here is invaluable. Once you understand this, you'll understand how to make better decisions and choices when buying and cooking your food.
B003B02O0A|4.0|Like all of his book, its hard to put it down. A bit drawn out in the middle of the story, but it kept my interest all the way through.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the kind of game you don't want to put down. just 'one more time ' and it's free!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Quick draws you into Pat Peoples' world and makes you fall in love with his characters. You will not want to put this book down.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't usually read love stories,but this one caught my eye. Great book,great story,great ending! Definitely recommend this. The characters are so real,you really get lost in the book.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|A must for every Madmen fan. It never disappoints. Great story arcs, superb acting, witty, accurate to the period to a tee.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|funny, if you like family guy crazy funny how its the same music is used haha. for the show and the movei
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|ITEM WAS RECEIVED AS ADVERTISED!<br />SHIPPEING WAS ON TIME!<br />ITEM WAS VERY PRICE COMPETITIVE!<br />WILL BE A REPEAT CUSTOMER!<br />THANKS!

B005CGI4EG|5.0|The buyer was very friendly and the cost of the item was great.  It was sent fast and the item showed up in great shape.
0446567337|5.0|This book came on time and was in good condition. I like this author and the books that are written by him. I have not had time to read this book yet. Hope to enjoy.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|just in the middle of anything even of it's already plugged in it will stop the game and &quot;remind&quot; me it's still charging. It ticks me off!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Funny Movie!  Lots of swearing and references/images of people using drugs though.  Movie combines a little of everything, comedy, action, drama and love story.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|These two BFFs from college are nowhere better than in this BBC costume comedy series.  Even their work in the Rowan Atkinson &#34;Blackadder&#34; series doesn't hold a candle to their brilliant buffoonery as the clueless nob Bertie Wooster and his long-suffering but vastly superior &#34;gentleman's gentleman&#34; Jeeves, forever sweeping up after Bertie's messes in romance and family politics.  Attention to Art Deco detail of clothing, manners, speech, architecture, automobiles, and popular music make &#34;Jeeves & Wooster&#34; a delicious holiday from real life - a Jazz Age &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; Lite.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Not just for teens. Even though you know this book with have it's sad moments, the author does a great job taking the focus off illness and onto youth and the vibrancy of living the life you choose.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Got it for my kids but it is fun to play and compete with the kids. Easy to learn brings back memories.
B002PEP4U0|4.0|Amazing what you can do when you just try! Despite a lack of education and resources, the main character succeeded in quest for bringing electricity to his village.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It held my attention. Finished in one day . Kept me entertained while I was home sick on New Year's Day.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Not as good as her previous albums. But some gems like stay stay stay and begin again.  I preferred her more country style.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I absolutely adored this movie. I think the actors were well chosen for the characters. The male--dark and handsome-ish-- and the female--homely. Loved, loved, loved it.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|the game is just as it has been and still fun, im enjoying a couple new characters. i am happy with my download.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a very fun game.. it keeps you guessing and very addictive. I couldn't stop playing and my kids liked to help me to... I recommend this game.
1591841216|5.0|This is a short, easy to read book that will get you thinking away from the mainstream, a most enjoyable read!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Purchased this after reading Gone Girl and was not disappointed. A great read and definitely a page turner. I found myself racing to the end!
0307592731|5.0|I am an outdoor enthusiast and really enjoyed this book.  It was a great read and I feel like I've found another great author to follow in Strayed.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|My niece loved this!!!  I got it for a Christmas present. She was very excited. Very nice video, great birthday present as well.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I love books and it normally takes a really really bad  book for me to put down.  After hearing all the hoopla over this book I finally broke down and decided to buy. Its absolutely one of the worse books I've read.  Its poorly written with unbelievable characters  (HOW many times can you repeat &#34;my breath hitched&#34;?).  Its not even good porn.  The dialogue was so juvenile I actually googled the author to make sure she wasn't 14.<br />This book is big and its has a pretty large following...and frankly, I don't understand it.  (like a bad reality show on paper...welcome to america, I guess:)
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is a great record, really artistic, and diverse, I can't imagine anyone who likes real music who wouldn't love it!
0316228532|2.0|Be warned if you are a sensitive reader.  This is a gritty, gritty novel.  There was no positive resolution at the end (if you are the kind of reader who hopes for that).  J.K. Rowling is  an extremely gifted writer - there is no question there.  This novel makes me think of others that are brilliantly crafted but have scenes that are so disturbing that I wish I had never read them - for example: Fall on Your Knees by Anne Marie MacDonald, A Find Balance by Rohinton Mistry, The God of Small Things by Arundati Roy.  Brilliant novels - wanted to bleach my memory after and am haunted by them occasionally.  In Casual Vacancy, I didn't like any of the characters; I felt no affinity for any of them - in fact they repelled me.  I found it all too much - too much gnarly grit.  However, I am a pretty sensitive reader - especially since having children of my own (toddlers now), so I understand that not everyone is looking for a more gentle or more comic read.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Its an easy time killer that may help to improve your short term memory. Some of the tiles don't seem to match, yet are the right choice.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My whole family enjoys this app.  We take turns trying to get all of the gnomes. Very similar to Where's My Water.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Most people say this movie is similar to family guy, and they are correct. Seth Macfarland does the voices so they will sound familar.  If you like the kind of humor on family guy you will enjoy this movie.  If not, you should probably stay away from this film.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I went into this game thinking it would be a regular detective game in the search for a victim, but it turned out to be a deliciously eerie and thrilling dark game.
1423140605|5.0|My granddaughter loves this series and couldn't wait to get this one.  Riordan writes great adventure stories while helping readers learn the great myths.
0061122416|4.0|I wasn't too sure about this when it was suggested to me, but once I started reading I couldn't put it down!
0783233477|5.0|Lots of people don't know about this wonderful film. Perhaps the timing of it's theatrical release has something to do with that; I don't know. What I do know is that it is filled with wonderful performances that drive a cleverly written script. I saw it in the theater when I was younger and more recently with my wife and daughter. We were all touched by it in a uniquely profound way.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is handsome and entertaining but Anthony Hopkins delivers on a level that only he can. My wife had trouble choosing who she liked best.
B00447L4KA|4.0|I got this to replace an old vhs copy, love it! Sometimes the oldies really are the ones to watch!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Just very well done of the Avengers.  I love how they tied in each character of all the separate movies.  Very entertaining, and everything I could expect from a superhero movie.  It really brings any comic you read to life with great special effects.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|My teenage daughter requested this for Christmas, we all love watching it together. Watch out though the songs will get stuck in your head!
1423140605|5.0|The Mark of Athena was a great book. It was a page turner! I read at least a hundred pages a day! If you have read all the other books in the series, I would highly recommend this book to you!
B005NFJAMG|4.0|I got this to replace an old vhs copy, love it! Sometimes the oldies really are the ones to watch!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Let's get more textbooks added so that I can stop being ripped off at school! I love this app though. It's so convenient!
0780626494|4.0|If you survived the 70's & 80's you will love this. I got this to replace an old vhs copy, love it! Sometimes the oldies really are the ones to watch!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Thoroughly gripping novel. Leaves you guessing at so many turns. This book is a real page turner, well written, thought provoking. Any one of us could potentially find ourselves in such a situation.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you were a fan of 50 Shades, this has way better writing in my opinion! I need to order the next one and pre order the third one!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Aside from..having to pay to continue the game after you are intensely involved,it was a lot of fun. I finished the game in a few hours.
B0054NRC6S|2.0|I was expecting to see the movie itself and not a kind of trailer. Don't know what happened, but I thoguht was downloading the movie.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|This is not far there's a catch to this; it may be free the app but I played for a whole day and the next day BOOOM!!!! It was all gone!!!!! and it was hard work!!!Also I got up to level 55555!! Last thing;you pay crap for people!!!!
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I got this case for my mother.  She (and my father who &#34;adopted&#34; it) love it.  It is light and since they are in their mid 80s, they find it easy to carry.  They slide their hand through the strap (yes, it is a strap not just a stripe), and and are able to cradle it with their hand.
B008602KQI|5.0|A wonderful movie, well made and well acted. Enjoyed it tremendously, recommend it to everybody. Looking forward to the next one<br />AMS
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for the next season. I wish i knew when the next season starts. I was recomend to everyone
B007J4T2G8|5.0|From the very first page to the last it had my attention and I very much enjoyed this book. Excellent easy ready. Thank you first awakening my senses.!!!!!
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love tis show and would recamend this show to everyone that loves a good comedy. There isn't enough stars for this
B008476HBM|1.0|This is not a good Kindle version. It doesn't load well and is difficult to read as parts are cut off or wrap oddly.  Even though it's free, it's not worth it. It's too frustrating trying to navigate and read.  I'd spend a bit of money and get a better version, or better yet, buy the actual book, or even better, buy both. This has got to be one of the most romantic stories of all time.<br /><br />If you're not a Jane Austin fan, you will be within a few moments of entering into her world.  For those of you unfamiliar with the story ~ (Do people like that even exist?) ~ Here is a brief summary<br /><br />The story takes place in England. We meet the Bennett family ~ The mother's sole intent is to marry her five daughters to successful men, which should ensure they will be cared for properly, as only males can inherit property. The story focuses on Elizabeth Bennett, the second daughter, who pales when compared to her extremely attractive, older sister.  Thankfully, Elizabeth is witty, smart, well-read and confident ~ perhaps to her own detriment. Now meet the wonderful Mr. Darcy. He is handsome and extremely wealthy.  However, his social skills while technically impeccable, do not measure well when used on those with a lesser social status.<br /><br />Throw in some other characters and you now have in your hands the most wonderful and romantic story ever written.<br /><br />Hmmm ~ perhaps I'm a bit biased.<br /><br />Still, buy it or borrow it ~ However you get your hands on this book, read it and fall in love.
B000YDAYCW|5.0|Came as pictured and already broken in.  Extremely comfortable and warm, they are perfect for walking in cold weather and snow.  Order a size smaller than you normally would, they do run 1-1.5 sizes too big.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Great Soundtrack to a great movie. I enjoy listening to the music. They did a very good job of editing the song.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Foul language was atrocious & absolutely unnecessary. Plot was senseless. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Below juvenile. Dumb.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this all the time. It keeps me entertained for hours on end. Its a quick and easy game.
B006H5120E|5.0|My wife was sort of mad that I bought this.  However, as she was watching it, her attitude changed.  She kept commenting how great it was in 3D.  I kept thinking it was amazing that this was shot 15 years ago in 2D with no idea 3D would be around, and yet the 3D was blowing my mind.<br />The story is still great, and the 3D adds a whole new dimension to it (pun intended).<br />The extras are also very informative.  It is fascinating to see how they made the movie, even if you are only given a high level glimpse.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Its my favorite game to play. Recommend it to anyone. Its hard to make up 20 words but the coloring is fantastic and the creator did a excellent job on it. He needs to come up with part 2.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I read them all after watching the series on HBO. If your a fan of the genre you'll be a big fan of George RR Martin. It's the first titles I've read by him, and I can't believe what I've been missing all these years
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great product.  Offers a lot of features for FREE. I highly recommend the free download. My family uses it on all our devices.
B00144VBBS|5.0|Great songs by Toby Keith, shipped fast, great service.  35 songs like this is a steal for the money, thanks!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it! Bought it three days ago and with 4 kids to take care  of, . I still managed to finish it.
0375842209|5.0|should be required reading for everyone...<br />a must read for 2013.<br />not an easy book to put down once reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book I loved it this book is absolutely brilliant different type of book I read but a great book
B000YHE4AG|5.0|Very cute holiday movie. Nothing groundbreaking, but it will make you smile and laugh around the holidays. Would recommend if you've never seen before.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So I have read books 1 and 2 in paperback- never again the kindle makes it so much easier.  For now on it is my kindle I will use to read all my books
B00021HBGS|5.0|My 2.5 year old son got these tub stickers for Christmas and absolutely loves them.  Prior to Christmas, getting him in the tub was a challenge and he was never excited about tubbie time.  Now, all we have to do is mention getting a tubbie and playing with his stickers and he runs to the bathroom and jumps right in while the water is still running.  He now plays in the tub until the water gets cold and we have to drain it.  What a wonderful toy!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Cliff hanger! Lol :) it was great! I love these books! I am about to download the third :) !
B008B68J2G|5.0|This cafe is adorable! The detail is awesome! The chairs look like they are colored iron. The little lanterns are tiny skulls. You have to string them on yourself, but it's super easy! The cakes are cute. I wish Mattel would have included more then 1 glass/1 coffee. Since the set fits 2, what if both had wanted coffee? XD<br />Anyways, the detail is impeccable. This is great for displaying your dolls. As previously said, getting the dolls to a position where their underwear doesn't show (eek) can be difficult but once it's accomplished the display is awesome!<br />The box is cool too since it shows different dolls: Ghoulia on a scooter, Deuce on a scooter, a gargoyle boy (the one Rochelle mentions???) Can't wait till the movie comes out!<br />Overall, I recommend this item, but because of small pieces you can easily lose, I don't recommend it for a young child.
B003O86FMW|5.0|These books are so entertaining, I cannot put it down. This is my favorite book in this series and I read it over and over again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book tells a story of love, loss, revenge, and forgiveness all at the same. The way the author intertwined two storied at the same time will keep you reading page after page. Each character is described in such detail that it will feel as if they are a part of your life. The ending is suspenseful and exciting and completely unexpected. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a story that will weigh on their emotions while also warming their heart.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|We have two Boys that live out of State.  So when they are traveling home<br />for a visit, I like to check out the weather they will be facing on their<br />trip.  Now no matter where I am, I can keep track of what kind of weather<br />they will be facing.  Love that.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is such a great book! If you haven't read this book yet stop everything your doing and read!! It is GREAT!!
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|[[ASIN:1594487154 To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others]]<br /><br />Dan Pink proves that \\"It's even possible to summarize his new book with a Pixar pitch: Once upon a time, only some people were in sales.  Everyday, they sold stuff, we did stuff, and everyone was happy.  One day, everything changed.  All of us ended up in sales---and sales changed the world from caveat emptor to caveat venditor.  Because of that, we had to learn the new ABCs---attunement, buoyancy, and clarity.  Because of that, we had to learn some new skills---to pitch, to improvise, and to serve.  Until finally we realized that selling isn't some grim accommodation to a merciless world of commerce.  It's part of who we are---and therefore something we can do better by being more human.\\"  (Chapter 7)<br /><br />To Sell Is Human challenges your assumptions about \\"selling\\" with the latest research drawn from the social sciences.  For example, here is a sample of three popular Myths debunked in the book:<br /><br />Myth #1: The Internet has obliterated salespeople, rendering them as obsolete as milkmen and meter maids.  <br /><br />REALITY: The death of the salesman has been woefully exaggerated. In 2000, before the advent of smart phones, social networking, and widespread broadband, 1 in 9 American workers worked in sales. Today? It's exactly the same: 1 in 9 American workers works in sales. (Chapter 1)<br /><br />***<br /><br />REALITY: Like it or not, we're all in sales now. A first-of-its-kind survey reveals that people are now spending about 40% of their time at work engaged in \\"non-sales selling\\" -- persuading, convincing, and influencing others. (Chapter 1)<br /><br />***<br /><br />Myth #3: Sales is mostly about hoodwinkery, sleazebaggery, and deceit.<br />REALITY: That was once at least partly true, because sellers always had more information than buyers. But the decline of information asymmetry has shifted the rules from caveat emptor (buyer beware) to caveat venditor (seller beware), where the high road is almost always the best option. (Chapter 3)<br /><br />***<br /><br />If you are one of the 1 in 9 sales professionals, you may find that the author uses the term \\"to Sell\\" more so to focus on influence and persuasion, while omitting traditional sales process, opportunity and account management topics.  If you liked Dan's research driven approach in \\"A Whole New Mind\\" and \\"Drive,\\" you should find \\"To Sell is Human\\" a good read.  Instead of Dan's sets of three words like Design, Story and Symphony, or Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose from his previous work, Dan pitches the new ABCs and three new skills to get your 2013 off to a great start.<br /><br />In the name of transparency and disclosure, I serve as the Program Director of the Wharton Advanced Management Program (AMP) and collaborate with Wharton faculty to select distinguished speakers to lead discussions with the senior executive participants.  Dan became a regular AMP speaker beginning in 2009.  While Dan arranged for me to receive a free copy of his new book to review in advance of publication, the comments above are solely mine and have not been reviewed or edited by anyone else.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I ordered this 3d bd and loved it. Took a little longer after release day to arrive, however when I was able to finally watch it, it was all I hoped for.Totally recommend watching the 3d version. Great movie for the young, and young at heart!
B000SEJHRA|3.0|We picked the book for our December book club since we tend to have our holiday pot luck then.  We like light reads in December.  Came with very high reviews, but many in the group did not find it funny.  I found it entertaining and funny at times.  One book member thought it was quite funny, but most were luke warm.  Funniest if read over time and not in one sitting, I think.  It's a short, easy read at any rate.
0307352145|5.0|Cain says introverts are thorough.  She surely is!  In all fairness, while this book tackles introversion in a helpful, supportive way, there's plenty of substance here for an extrovert, too.  Deftly weaving ideas on introversion with how it is exhibited in the business world, the schoolroom, home, and the animal kingdom, Cain also uses the most current research in addressing questions such as the influence of nature and nurture in creating introverts, the strengths and weaknesses of introverts (and extroverts), and how the environments above are discussed in professional academic circles.  She examines well the way that introverts tend to function internally, and how they interact with one another and with extroverts, making recommendations on how to facilitate communication between members of disparate groups in ways comfortable to all.  Many famous and not-so-famous individuals illustrate her points, including a pantheon of distinguished people one might not group together, including Einstein, Moses, Gandhi, Rosa Parks, John Quincy Adams, Steve Wozniak and Warren Buffett among others.  Many other people are drawn from her own life or the contacts she made preparing the book.  Quiet is perception-altering, being informative and bringing in human examples and stories in ways that this reader found inspiring.  Yes, I am an introvert and felt on more than one occasion like Cain KNOWS me!  Everyone dealing with others, particularly teachers and business people, but just as much anyone knowing a member of the other camp or seeking clarification of one's own camp will benefit from Cain's fine information, writing clarity, and well-supported and -thought-out insights.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This book is about a neurosurgeon Dr. Eben Alexander, who suffered an attack of E. Coli bacterial meningitis that resulted in temporary brain death, and a Near Death Experience (NDE). The overarching premise of the book is that based on his experience of the NDE that death is not the end, that heaven exists, and that he is a scientist and was a skeptic and therefore is qualified to scientifically analyze what happened to him in objective terms. Fair enough, game on.<br /><br />My first impression of the book was how much of it was feel-good biography. I'm not against that per se, but it seemed to be a bit of a distraction from his \\"Scientific\\" argument.<br /><br />And speaking of his scientific argument, I was seriously disappointed. Some examples:<br /><br />- He says that he is a scientist, and then states: \\"Likewise, extended consciousness phenomena such as remote viewing, extrasensory perception, psychokenisis, clairvoyance, telepathy, and precognition have seems stubbornly resistant to comprehend through \\"standard\\" scientific investigations? Oh REALLY? That's funny. There's $1 million bucks on the line for anyone that can actually show that any of those work in a scientific test, and none have.<br /><br />- The best scientific theory I had seen put forth explaining what happened to him was a \\"Reboot phenomena\\" where his brain saved experiences before and after it went down. Essentially preserving dream states or hallucinations as it was shut down. His argument: \\"But this seems unlikely given the intracacies and interactivity of my elaborate recollections.\\" That's it, that's his \\"Science\\".<br /><br />I really wanted to see a clinical breakdown of his thesis, and got excited as I read as he mentioned he had an Appendix that would \\"summarize his hypotheses\\". I finished the book and excitedly went to the Appendix to find the hypotheses and presumably more scientific information supporting his position. Disappointment was all I found. He just listed the hypotheses and no real answers. Apparently his answer it \\"I was an expert and now I'm convinced, so you have to accept it\\". Argument from Authority Logical Fallacy for one, please.<br /><br />I would add that I thought about whether the other parts of his brain were actually shut down. He asserts it, but does little to provide support to his position. It was also telling that his event was very culturally normative to him.<br /><br />I read other interviews of him, and in those he states that his original book title was \\"An N of 1\\". Which frankly, I could possibly respect more than what he ended up with. An N of 1 is a scientific study of ONE thing. One person. As opposed to a study of hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands. Yes, they can be helpful, but they also are limited and need to be viewed skeptically when applied to more than that ONE person. Likewise, I do not find his arguments to be particularly compelling or supported with science. In the interviews, he also stated he considered writing an actual scientific white paper. OH THAT HE WOULD. I would love to see the EVIDENCE. Not some argument from authority fallacy.<br /><br />Now, I want to add that I actually think that people do experience life changing events like this from various things. Even he mentions drug hallucinations, meditative experiences, and so on. Great. But that is not \\"Proof of Heaven\\". It is proof that our brains are awesome and mysterious things that have surprises in store. I am okay with that. I am not okay with assumptions of a very JudeoChristian heaven being proven by a mystical brain event.nd no real answers. Apparently his answer it \\"I was an expert and now I'm convinced, so you have to accept it\\".

B00APUQH0W|2.0|Just an average story. Eastwood's plays a bitter old man, probably too old for the part. Acceptable for TV but not in a theater.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It drew me in so much I felt like at times I was in the book. Will be purchasing book two momentarily!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|This is, by far, the worst movie I have ever seen<br />great cast<br />potential? perhaps<br />Did they think it was going to be as popular as Mama Mia? I just don't know<br />it isn't even bad enough to be good<br /><br />don't bother, save your ears and your retinas
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Smart, fast-paced and full of surprises. This series has some of the best writers and actors anywhere. You just don't know where the next turn is coming from.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|This novel had potential - a notable author creating with the MI5 &#34;soft&#34; cold war and tumultuous 70's London as his backdrop.  McEwan has a talent for creating finely drawn, flawed, sometimes humerous, protagonists.  Serena Frome isn't one of them.  Beautiful, advantaged and supposedly &#34;clever&#34;, she fails as a young woman to grow out of teenaged self-absorption.  After earning a Cambridge degree and landing a plum, though underpaid, job with MI5 (though her affair with an older man rather than on merit, natch), Serena's desire to be loved and romanced takes precedence over everything - her older lover's obvious trouble, her sister's trainwreck of a life, the pain her co-worker friend feels in her romantic rejection, the danger faced by undercover agents in the IRA she is responsible for tracking, the reputational risk she imposes on her young writer lover.  As the &#34;spy&#34; story progresses, I found myself increasingly annoyed with McEwan for wasting his setting and for the lack of self-awareness or intelligence in his main character.  I kept hoping that enlightenment would come to Serena, but unfortunately she ends up confirming everything that men past a certain age believe about a woman's ability to contribute, much less behave professionally, in the workplace. Looking back, I now see McEwan shares the same lack of ability to draw complex female characters with other noted male authors of his generation. The ending is hokey, gimmicky and lacking in credulity.
B007S3S8HO|4.0|As the oh-so-proud owner of dozens of Angry Birds games, plush toys, building sets, etc., I can say this is a mixed bag.  The quality of the product is great (in typical KNEX fashion).  Building structures is fun for my 7 year old.  He didn't really expect to have a \\"video game like\\" experience knocking things down so he wasn't too put off by the fact that knocking the structures apart just doesn't work.  He enjoys it anyway.  So I go 4-stars for quality and the building experience.  I dock the fifth star based on it not being much more than a (costly) building set and that there are way too many TINY pieces.  If you do get something to break apart it's a nightmare to find all the pieces.  I have enough small KNEX size impressions in the soles of my feet to tell you - this is not a good thing!<br /><br />Overall: Angry Bird fanatics will be happy to have these likenesses and the building is fun.  If you are looking for the \\"game\\" experience, there are better sets to knock down.
B008YWY0HK|2.0|Movie is extremely disappointing.  Instead of a strong female heroine, which is what one is led to expect by the marketing, it's just another female dealing with the expectations of her parents, her 'position' in society.....Very disappointing movie, and in addition it's boring, cliche, trite.....small children who are not critical thinkers will probably enjoy it, but no one beyond that.
B005T0M0HW|5.0|I bought this cookware set for my grand daughter for Christmas to go with the hape gourmet kitchen.  She absolutely loves it!!  Some people complained that it was very small but it is just the right size for my 2 year old grand daughter.  It is well made and attractive.  She especially likes the salt and pepper shakers.  She is constantly seasoning everything she &#34;cooks&#34;!  I also bought the Melissa and Doug pizza set.  It has lots of felt vegetables which fit nicely in the pans and on the plates.  This and the kitchen were her favorite Christmas gifts.  She plays with them a lot!!! I would highly recommend this set.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|When you're a big reader, you start to see patterns in books.  This one broke established patterns and I was taken along on a scary ride.  Anyone with children can easily be drawn into this poor family and it isn't where anyone would choose to be.  The old phrase &#34;ripped from the headlines&#34; come to mind.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Definitely worth owning! Great movie, action packed, the Combo pack is perfect because you can watch it anywhere. Loved this movie.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Good reading for a travel trip, great attention grabber to spend travel time.  Never hear the &#34;Are we there yet?&#34;.
B00114RKT8|5.0|Wilberforce was greatly used by God to rid England and eventually America, and many other parts of slavery.  He could not have accomplished this without the hand of God upon him.
B003XQPT9A|5.0|A classic Christmas Carol story brought to life with all the muppet characters.  Piggy was great, Kermit was refined, and Gonzo was classic himself.  Great way for kids to learn Dickens.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Entertaining and fun it's different and can be difficult to the point of frustration but then so are all the angry bird games.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Very nice product!<br />I like this product and use it at night to calm down and get ready for sleep.
B002ZCY7TG|1.0|of course beings that we started from the beginning of the series, it took a while to get to this one, but once we did the disc would not play in any equiptment we have in our house. By that time it was to late to return it. Basically we got ripped off on both 2 CD series. I love the series but will not by CD's from amazon again.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I am not an experienced player and I found this version frustrating.  Actually uninstalled app.<br />I was not that pleased.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|There was no question in my mind that I was going to finish this trilogy after the moment when Katniss took her sister's place. I enjoyed this book and an content with the ending, I like who she ended up with and applaud Suzanne with finding a happy ending with a reminder of all the hardship that has happened. Wonderful series.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie. It had some definite parts not appropriate for young kids, but overall a great movie with great music.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good movie, can pretty much stand on its own. Good action/story.  It won't blow your mind or anything, but if you haven't seen it yet and you're looking for a rental, this should do it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't have enough good things to say about these novellas. While I am an enormous fan of dystopian and post-apocalyptic fiction, Mr. Howey somehow manages to bring something fresh, creative and gripping to a genre that's oversaturated with derivative pulp.<br /><br />I could not put this omnibus down, from beginning to end. I was gripped and rendered emotional by the characters found here; Juliette is a heroine to be praised for being strong, intelligent, and utterly human flaws. Every character, despite being someone in the future, is relatable. I found myself attached to their human struggles and the utter depth of emotion put into them.<br /><br />The story is cohesive, the plot interesting; I found that I had impending dread that I knew where the plot would go, only to be utterly - and pleasantly - surprised. The craft of Howey's plot is only outdone by the quality of his rich prose.<br /><br />This is a gushing review, I know. I can't quite help it - this Omnibus is entirely worth every penny and then some. I would've paid far more for it on Kindle had I known what I was in for. What I wouldn't give for a paperback just to \\"keep\\". It deserves a spot on my shelf, pardon the snobbery.<br /><br />If you are a fan of books that run in the dystopian or post-apocalyptic genres, the Wool novellas are not to be missed. Period.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway suffers is the best game I have ever played and<br />it takes skill to play this fun game smile!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great Nicholas Sparks novel.  I can't wait to see the movie!!  It was hard to put my kindle down, I wanted to hurry up and get to the next page!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Harry Bosch book!  After having read every single one of these books, I feel like I know Harry, or at least I wish I did.  What an awesome character.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was funny and had its own spark...the story is a lovely read for an afternoon sit down. thumbs up!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|At this price point, there is nothing that can touch this bag. It holds a ton of gear, and has great flexibility. Highly recommended.    Update. 1/29/2015.  After 2 years this bag is still working perfectly for me. I carry around my Nikon DSLR body and 4 lens, a variety of filters, 5 batteries w/2 chargers, and various other small accessories and still have enough room to through in another lens if I pick one up. 2 years of occasional use and everything is holding up great. No issues with any zippers or seems. One of the best purchases I've made for my camera rig.
0061537969|5.0|Telling the story from the dog's point of view seems like a gimmick but it works perfectly in the book.  And what a great story the dog tells.  So touching and frightening and thank goodness for the ending.  I needed that.
B005EGXTEE|3.0|Read this book because of all the hype. Was disappointed but that is possibly because it got such good reviews. I have not seen the movie. It reminded my of The Lord Of the Flies. Which I read in high school many years ago.
0618871713|5.0|Fascinating life and funny but touching book.  I really enjoy the memoir told in pictures as it brings so much depth to the story.  It puts me right in the middle of the action.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and the whole series. Although it is totally so far fetched it was good. I am not a romance novel reader but all the writes ups had me hooked and i am reading other romance books now as well. Worth the read.
0307592731|5.0|This was the most fun, the most honest (I think) and the most gripping memoir I have read in years. It made me really admire the author and wish I knew her as a friend.  What a tough life and a great way to start over and reinvent herself.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I dont know what to say about Adele that most people dont probably already know.  She is amazing.  I do not have her first album, but this one is just amazing.  The songs are tear jerkers & her voice is so fabulous!
B005LZW8FO|5.0|I haven't seen this movie, but it was on my Grandson's wish list and he was very pleased to receive it for Christmas.
B004XUDJII|5.0|I bought this album because I love Jar of Hearts, but I discovered that she is an awesome artist.  I love every song!!
0307593312|5.0|I suppose the best way to describe Haruk Murakami's 1Q84 is to say it is hard to describe.  That in itself can be a virtue:  it is sometimes nice to read a book that can't be summed up in a sentence or two.  And in this case, it pays off:  this is a fascinating novel that despite its length (my version came to around 1150 pages, divided into three volumes) moves at a good pace.<br /><br />On a superficial level, this is the story of two people, a man and woman, both around thirty years old, in 1984 Japan.  Tengo is a math teacher and aspiring writer who is commissioned to ghost a rewrite of a teenage girl's novella.  This story, superficially a fantasy about fairy-like creatures called the Little People, actually seems to have some basis in reality.  The other character, Aomame, has accidentally entered a slightly different world, most noticeably distinct by there being two moons (just like the world in Tengo's ghost-written novella).<br /><br />The first two volumes of the story alternate chapters between Tengo and Aomame (in the third volume, another character gets into the chapter rotation).  For a long time, this creates two parallel stories that don't seem to have much in common; eventually, however, it becomes clear that Tengo and Aomame have close ties to each other.<br /><br />This is - as stated earlier - a lengthy story, and it moves at a leisurely (though not boring) pace.  It is part mystery, part science fiction, part fantasy and part romance, and I found it fully engaging.  I've really only glossed over the plot, but it is an interesting one.  If you're in the mood for something both substantial and off-beat, this should be a rewarding experience.
B0000714BP|5.0|I love, love, love this movie.  I cant decide which of the main characters I love the most.  They are all awesome in their own way.  This movie is so much fun!
B0053O89IS|1.0|I believe they are running out of material. It is like a soap opera now. The tension they used to have was more entertaining.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|The voice acting in this movie is wonderful.  Of course the animation is awesome as well...but its fun to hear all the famous voices pop up throughout the movie.  Jim Carrey is wonderful as Horton...he carries the movie well.  I also just love Katie...she is a small character that has limited air time, but she definitely stands out.  I recommend this movie to kids & adults both!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I liked this movie, it wasn't too drawn out and was quite funny. I would recommend watching it. Good music
B00321MGPG|5.0|I have always loved shows like this, I have watched them all before and have enjoyed them all so many times. I could watch them a hundred times over. (figuratively speaking). and would recommend watching this and all others to whomever has never seen them before.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I cant always find the puzzle piece but I have fun trying. If I knew the game was this much fun I would have gotten it a long time ago
B001NLKT60|5.0|there is way too many great points to talk about the whole book or series. but, I absolutely love everyone of these books. I basically keeps a hold of me throughout the entire book. you have to read them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game rocks.  its so easy to just sit and play a few or a lot.  Its easy for any age.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|it's a fun little app but I wish it came with more songs but other then that it's pretty cool and I would recommend it to all ages
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|This is a great film, and watching it on Blu-ray is fantastic. We couldn't believe how realistic the characters looked in high definition. If you've found yourself wanting to share &#34;Indiana Jones&#34;-type adventures with your kids but have been unable to because they're still a bit too young, &#34;Tintin&#34; could be just the right film to help you bide the time.
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|Entertaining drama. A wonderful blend of literary figures in contemporary context. An engaging mix of relational conflict and action. And to the writers and producers, thank you for not blowing me away with a bunch of needless profanity.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This film is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but it can be a beautiful, moving experience if you're in the proper frame of mind. When I recommend it to people, I tell them NOT to watch it if they just want to plop down on the couch and watch something fun on a Friday night. If you're debating between watching &#34;The Tree of Life&#34; or &#34;The Bourne Identity&#34;, pick Bourne! The appropriate time to watch this is not the next time you feel like seeing a movie, but when you want to visit a museum. THAT'S the proper frame of mind! :-)
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Great to buy movies through Amazon, where I can pay less for the same product.  I'm always scanning at the store into my Amazon app on my phone to find out that I can just buy from home.  I add to my cart through the app, and then buy after I've added all the movies (in this case) that I want.<br /><br />This was a decent movie, and myself and my family all thought it was better than MIB 2.  I would recommend it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Three fantastic movies gorgeously presented. Like many others, I already had &#34;Batman Begins&#34; and &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; but upgraded to this set since it was only a couple bucks more to buy it than &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; by itself. No regrets!
B002W2U3H4|5.0|I rented and downloaded this movie to my Kindle Fire HD and used the HDMI cable to play it on the TV. It ran smoothly and the whole family enjoyed watching this. Excellent movie for the holiday season. My 7 year old niece kept watching it on the Kindle until the 48 hour rental expired.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I wasn't going to watch this movie, but my wife insisted. Turns out this was a great movie and I would have missed it only because the previews don't do it justice.
B005JR4K28|5.0|I had my reservations about this show, just based on the fact that it looked like another Friends remix.  After watching the entire first season in a marathon viewing, I have to say that this is one of the funniest shows on TV right now.  I highly recommend checking this show out!
B004U52VPS|5.0|I got this game for my 4 year old nephew who loves playing Angry Birds on my iPod. In fact it's one of the first things he asks for when he comes over. When I saw this game I had to get it for him! On Christmas when he opened it, he was extremely excited! He kept bugging his parents to open and play it! When all gifts were open including a new InnoTab 2, what he went for first for play time was this game! He spent almost an hour playing it with his dad! Excellent buy!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Very fun, kind of hard to breed certain dragons and to earn gems but otherwise very fun to play and reach goals
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|it's awesome! can hardly wait for season 3 to come out cuz i will for sure buy it.  love it!
B009LDXQGW|5.0|The weeknd trilogy is amazing. You get a different kind<br />of sound from each cd  in the trilogy.Go out and buy yourself a copy
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I recommend the Weather Channel for anyone who has loved ones scattered around the country, as well as for your local weather. I can switch from one location to another, for present temp., hourly, 5 day or 10 day forecast.
0316017930|5.0|I was introduced to Malcolm Gladwell through reading Blink several years ago, and I thought it quite original so I followed up with his earlier book, The Tipping Point. Also excellent. Outliers, in my opinion, is Gladwell's best work to date.<br /><br />First of all, the title is slightly misleading (probably to appeal to a business market). A more honest description would be Outliers: The Myths of Success. We're so enamored with the idea of equality and nurture trumping nature that it's difficult, and probably offensive, to suggest otherwise.<br /><br />The book is divided into two compelling measures of success, opportunity and legacy, and the way Gladwell presents it is like this: All of us are capable of extraordinary achievements in life, but the when, where and how of our upbringing will inevitably limit us in ways often beyond our control. These factors are not determinant, but highly influential. The child says to Life, \\"Not fair!\\" and Life responds indifferently with, \\"I never said it was.\\"<br /><br />I'm reminded of a quote by Thomas Jefferson who said, \\"I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it.\\"
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This movie was the best movie that I had ever seen. This movie is about a vampire girl named Mavis who is in love with a human.
B007THA4FI|4.0|A real analysis of the dark side of people's nature. Focusing on how just a few people can be so destructive to a community with gossiping, spreading rumors, racism, elitism. Fighting between stinginess in heart and pocketbook versus some characters who were deeply generous and committed to the community as a whole.  Interesting and easy to read. A departure from the author's previous books which is fine with me.... just different and from what I understand a little biographical in the most susperficial sense.
B009329Y30|5.0|Its totally a chick flick, and does what they do and warms the heart makes you go a[...] the story line is strong if you liked sweet home Alabama and the notebook you will like this one too
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good accounting of what prison must have been like for her and who she met. I liked her epiphanies and her found gratitude and blessings along the way. I would recommend it to ages 16+. Lots of early lessons initially ignored.  It's like a 2nd coming of age.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|These fit virtually all kindles and are great to have multiples of it you travel.  I use them often and keep them in differnet rooms
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I gave this as a gift, and the person has been raving about how great this cd is, and it has been in her cd player for a month!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such a great book! I'm downloading the second right away!!!! I couldn't put this book down! So captivating. I'm in love.
B001LM1456|2.0|Just watched this last night with my daughter. We bought it as one of the prequels to &#34;Avengers&#34;, but now wonder why. The background of the plot is barely glossed over in flashes during the opening credits, leaving one with only a vague idea of the preceeding story. The whole script is two-dimensional and the characters are actually just caricatures. &#34;The General&#34; is a bad joke and Liv Tyler's character is little more than a Care Bear - &#34;It's all right&#34;, &#34;No, don't, please&#34; repeated endlessly.<br />Thank God they got Joss Whedon to do the newer movies!<br />If all you're interested in is CGI special effects, might as well get a lobotomy and watch &#34;Transformers&#34; movies.
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|DIFFICULT TO USE , NOT USER FRIENDLY. MORE EFFORT THAN WRITING IN A DAY PLANNER. WOULDNT RECOMMEND AT ALL .
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a really fun and creative game. I recommend it. I haven't gotten tired of it at all. Excellent replay value.
B003F5NSTW|4.0|It doesn't feel quite right to admit that I enjoyed this story-line.  I did have to put it down for a short time as whilst I was reading it, yet another school massacre unfolded in the US which made it a bit too hard to read.  I loved the style of writing in the form of letters to Franklin and was always wanting to read &#34;just one more chapter&#34;.  I did not see the end coming, that's always a nice surprise.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What an absolutely amazing story of survival. This guy is an absolute inspiration and truly an American hero. He takes no credit for his actions and repeatedly states that he would be nowhere without his teammates. His modesty and courage combined make for an outstanding true story of a man against all odds. Thank you for your service to all our military out there!
B009KHCT94|3.0|i had a different idea of what this movie was going to be like, i think it could have been better
B008MG1E4A|5.0|First hand accounts of capturing and killing Osama, as well as all the training and experience he went through to get on this amazing seal team, why wouldn't you read this? What a great story.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Some food for thought, but some of the analogies show how pursuing logical conclusions from a plausible thesis can lead to absurdity.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this app.  I've been using it for sometime now and I really love the way it wakes me up slowly rather then the shell shock out of bed sort. lol  I highly recommend it.
0811879631|4.0|Bought this gift for a friend of mine and they really love it. It's very beautiful and gives a nice highlight of Pixar movies.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Grandson is a big Captain America fan.  He loves legos, and he loved this.  It was a great stocking stuffer.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|The best Doors CD ever! I can't quit playing it. I forgot what a great singer he was! LOVE IT!!!!!
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Not the makings of an academy award winner... but a solid effort by Seth McFarlane.<br />Mila Kunis is a happy bonus.
159413586X|1.0|Spoiler: I hated this book its nothing like the others, Katnis is no longer the strong character seen in the other books she spends most of her time drugged up or hiding. I get that war changes you but I had hoped it would have made her stronger, where is the girl who defies the rules and risks life and limb for her family and friends, apparently she checked out because she was not apart of this book. There wasn't a lot of action until towards the end and its just a mess, more hiding. The whole assault on the capital, why? revenge I guess but I would of rather seen a unified struggle rather than the mess I just read, what was she gonna do when she got there? I kept waiting for her to stand up and be this powerful woman leader and it just never happened. The whole thing with Peeta really annoyed me too, I mean really I just kept waiting for her to go to him but it never happened. Also all the meaningless killing of characters in such senseless ways, I had to reread a couple of times to make sure that a character had just been killed off, it was so quick and unnecessary. I finished this series feeling like I read an entirely different book. The book itself I did not like, Katniss is not this strong character anymore, I think that bothered me the most. But then the ending it was so rushed, and we as readers weren't apart of it because again are heroine is drugged up and not invited to the party. I really loved the first 2 books I think the second was my favorite, but this one was a real let down sorry.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Saw the movie before reading the book and was very satisfied with the detail in the book. Read it in a few days, couldn't put it down.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is fun and cool and stuff. I like it because it never ends. I am on level 10. You should get it because it is free.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I truly enjoyed this game.  It was challenging without being too difficult and certainly not boring. Objectives can only be completed during the proper season and objects can only be found in it's proper season. The map which updates as you progress is helpful. The journal also has a hint button at the bottom of the page - which opens about six seconds after pressing - shows one step at a time without spoiling the next step for you. No problems or crashing. Well done.
0307960471|5.0|I really loved this book and didn't want it to end. I recommend it to all mystery book readers. The end
B00APUQPX6|5.0|My parents enjoyed it as much as little brother did. So I recommend it to any anybody who is looking for a great family movie.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Original plot based on interesting characters.  Seth mcfarlin made the perfect Ted.....no one could have done better.only issue with movie is the predictable ending.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I loved the witty writing, twisted plot that kept on twisting, I cheered for Nick and wanted to kill Amy myself. I have never wanted to skip to the ending before more than I did reading Gone Girl. Needless to say when I finally got to the end after 2 days reading non-stop, I was notoriously let down and devastated. It was that terrible.  I won't read another book by this author due to this fact.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was an amazing book I could not stop reading once I started. The strength between holder and sky was so powerful, I had to know what was going to happen next! I highly recommend this book as well as all of colleen Hoover's other books!!!
B000WXO9HA|4.0|This is not the best Hendrix albumn out there. It is fantastic though. I would highly recomend this albumn if you like Jimi Hendrix.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Wonderful book. Kept me entertained throughout. Hope this becomes a series. Pictures that were provided were a great descriptive tool.
B009PU2KIQ|4.0|I enjoyed this cd and listen to it quite often, I wish he stayed more with the blues rock style but overall a very good cd
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|great movie and not damaged, used but not damaged. I would highly recommend it.<br />Thanks for getting it to us so fast.
B0091QSNEE|3.0|It's fun but I wish it had more meals so you have more to play . But I do in joy the game
075669812X|5.0|My son saw this at Walmart and wanted it for Christmas.  I got it on sale, and my son loves it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I'm pretty picky when it comes to games &amp; normally I won't pay for apps but this one is totally worth the money! The storyline was smart, the puzzles weren't terribly hard &amp; there was a good balance of object finding puzzles &amp; problem solving puzzles. As I said in the title, I didn't want it to end! Will definitely be turning to Alawar Entertainment for more games!
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Cute movie,  Kids wanted to see it, so I bought it on a cyber monday sale.  Kids like it.  Move makes you think.
B009NXV2RK|3.0|I enjoy a good Tom Clancy Thriller and in particular the Jack Ryan series.  The latest book tries to emulate the racy thrillers of the past but I think the characters are becoming a little tired despite the injection of Jack Ryan Junior.  The plot has not been well developed as in the previous Jack Ryan novels.  I was entertained nevertheless and the cyber terrorism dimension to the conflict will educate readers in just how easy it is to circumvent security and how that could play out in terms of impacts to public and private infrastructure.<br /><br />The Chinese planned hegemony over the South China Sea is a believable scenario which was mapped out in considerable detail as the plot developed.  The plot necessarily hangs on the premise of an unstable personality heading up the Chinese PLA.  I preferred the approach of Premier Wu with his economic strategy which is in reality being employed by China right now.  Tom Clancy has taken that and just logically extended it to build a believable plot.<br /><br />I wonder at the responses of so called president Jack Ryan and his use of force to take out the cyber terrorism locale and the head of the PLA.  In real life that would be a declaration of war but it is a possible scenario if there is real and present danger.  The book ends too abruptly for me.  I would have liked to see what developed after the American response.<br /><br />Still it was good to see the old team in action again.  I would certainly recommend this book to others.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Nothing ground breaking. But what would you expect for a third sequel. Had a few laughs, fairly predictable plot. Not bad while on sale.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Superb product. Good quality of materials. Colors bright and vibrant. And appears to be necessary for Kindle protection. Love it!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this nifty little app for everything.  Passwords, grocery lists, movies to remember to rent next time I'm at a Redbox...I survive on Post-It Notes at work, how could I survive without this on my phone?
B0079R8KO0|3.0|It does the job pretty well. The only problem I had was that once of the plastic tabs was either broken or wouldn't go into the proper hole for what ever reason so it wasn't in there as securely as it could have been.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Phenomenally good book. Sparks never fails to capture emotions that all readers can relate to. Adding suspense and multiple character's viewpoints makes this one of my favorite books by him.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|My system ($35,000 from Best-Buy, and installed by the Geek Squad) has the most up-to-date, high tech components available on the market today and I can't run this DVD.  It keeps asking me to transfer some data from the player to a memory source and neither the producer of the DVD or Sony or Panasonic can explain what it wants.<br />Bottom line is that I've never seen the movie or watched the DVD.  Memory sticks don't work.  Nothing works.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|If you seen 1st you have to see this 1 and its Incredible. I loved from start to finish and shows some of the Most beautiful women and Co star female is Oh my God Gourgous.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has more twists and turns, ups and downs, and plot reversals than the average reader can follow.  You're convinced who the villan is, and then it's not.  You're convinced who the victim is, and then it's not.  Very strange and very hard to follow, but at the end, it's worth it.
1449417051|5.0|It was a present for my grandson and we could not get him away from reading it to open his other presents. It was a great hit.<br /><br />How to tell if your cat is Plotting to kill you, 2013 Wall Calendar
B0013FSL3E|1.0|the movie does not even play when put into my player.  i ordered this as a christmas gift for my son and it stops constantly throughout the film.  i am not a difficult or picky person, but the movie stops every 2 seconds and gets to a point where it will not work at all. hugely disappointed
0062206044|5.0|If you are going to get this book, you might as well get the rest of the series. I bought this to fill in the holes of books I am missing in the series. These books are about a family who sticks together and preservers while constantly catching their uncle who is out to steal their inheritance but the stories never end with a happy ending. It is a fun twist to a children's/young adult's book and every last one of these is very fun to read.
B00003CXAT|5.0|The movie arrived quickly and worked fine! It nice to be able to buy older movies that my kids can enjoy
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I love Batman so much and this is so incredible to own and I can't believe I paid less for this than I would have just buying one of the movies. This is the best.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|I have used it on 5 different device and have had 0 issues with it causing crashes or problems of any kind. The game itself is great and a good time killer.
B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|Its a good movie, but it came in bad conditions, it looks like it was touched with something hot, because it is melted in the front cover.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|The movie is unbelievably awesome!  5 stars! Absolutely love it. But Ultraviolet is a HORRIBLE service. No stars for it. I could not even download this movie. I have lost all my other movies on flixster. The customer service is AWFUL! I can't recommend buying the bluray if you want a digital copy too. iTunes works flawlessly. Shame.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Its a great movie, I love it when I downloaded it illegally with a torrent so I have to buy it.
030746363X|4.0|This is a book that my son asked for specifically.  I was able to buy it at a good price and it arrived promptly.  He was delighted with it.
B000BDLJBU|4.0|Pros:<br />Solid, right angle plug<br />Cord fixator is inside (to make sure you will not tear off the cords where they were soldered)<br />A cheap fix for any decent earphones/headphones<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slightly bulky (just a tiny bit slimmer than iPhone 4S w/o a case)<br />When the plug body is rotated, the sound tend to partially disappear from my left or right earphone (might be just my piece)<br />No manual on how to solder the wires and no marks on the contacts (left/right/ground)
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Movie was ok, but not great for 2 such big name actors. Steve Carell does a good job as the therapist, but many aspects just seemed too long and not well tied together. Was glad we only spent $1.99 on this for 3 of us and not theater ticket prices.
0684857219|5.0|I can always find new techniques to put into my workouts from referencing to this book. Lots of excellent information!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book flat out. Charlie reminded me of a family member I have. For my first book I read on my kindle I really enjoyed it.
1419705849|5.0|my son loves everything Wimpy Kid.. he loves all of the books, clothes, everything.. he loves this new book.. wat a great deal!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book. Highly recommend it.  Best I've read. Didn't want it to end. Read it. You'll love it, I promise!!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very interesting and fun game! Especially for people who love solving mysteries! Abandoned carnivals, magic mirrors and dark worlds! It's a blast for anyone.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|This book hit home more then any other book I've ever read!  It was so good and worth reading twice!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down. Cannot wait to start the next one! A page turner for sure!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this series it's great it leave you hanging and excited for the next book. One of the best books I have read
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It's a good book, it just seems a little short. I finished it in about 2 days and I was hoping there was more.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book. Makes you think about how people take things for granted. Recommend this book for anyone to read.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This was kinda of interesting it takes forever to get to the next letter that's why it's a one star rating.
B008518MOW|5.0|Of the three MIB movies this was the best of the three. All SciFi movies eventually have a time travel aspect but, this one answered a sluu of questions.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|This may be frustrating for mystery fans.  The solution for each problem is surprising.  There are enough red herrings to stock a fish market. Nevertheless, the episodes are so well written, well acted, and well directed that you are thoroughly engaged and entertained.
B005LAII08|5.0|This is a movie for people who enjoy a good story, beautiful music and, understand that though it is animated it is a story out of Scotland. Thus, it is for the children of intelict and, not for the Wee Barrans out there who thought it was tooo scary.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Great picture quality, the editing is done well. No hyperactive quick cuts, and the sound is actually really good. You can hear the bass, and the rear speakers are used well when listening in surround sound. Really wish Death Magnetic the CD sounded this good.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|The Jason Bourne series is the closest we Americans will get to a James Bond type film series. Maybe this one is mroe cerebrial but, the action is only half of the intrest.
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|I like d it but it was not very funny. I hope they come up with something funnier than this.
B00425S1H8|5.0|This does just what its supposed to do, and it works on both of my laptops -- both of which are new enough to have no RS232 serial ports on them!  It does require the installation of a driver which can be easily obtained online and works fine with WIndows 7 64 bit computers.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I've always been into Thessalonians, this one made the series even better.if your looking for a good book this is the one for you.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The movie was just o.k. for me and my family.  It wasn't really what we were expecting, and some of the dialogue was so thick with brogue we couldn't really understand what the characters were saying.  It did have its sweet moments, though, so I would recommend it for viewing.  This just isn't a movie I will want to watch over again.  Once was enough.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Mr. King, I salute you. This tale of time travel and what-if completely captivated me. Thanks for all your research to make this story come alive.
145210655X|5.0|I got this for Christmas and I love it. It is definitely more for the parent but the drawings are funny and descriptive enough that your kid will like it too. It's kind of like the best animated movies. Kids love them for the visuals and parents love them because they appreciate all the references that only the adults get. Highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great book following 50 Shades of Grey. It has mind blowing twists, wonderful erotic writing, and conflicting romance. I could not put this book down when I began reading.
1423140605|5.0|As a kid, I was interested in Greek/Roman mythology, but not enough to get too excited about and really research anything. Rick Riordan changed that with his original Percy Jackson series. He's done it again with the Heroes of Olympus books. The Mark of Athena was a page turner and then such a cliff hanger!! I cannot wait to read the next installment. He's re-opened my eyes to the wonders of the gods. My sister wants to know how I know everything that I do about the gods and goddesses of ancient times. I'm not about to tell her that a \\"childrens\\" book re-kindled the fire and how Riordan has me researching even further. Riordan does not disappoint!! Mark of Athena is fabulous. Would recommend for anyone from 8-99.  ;)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I seen this book advertised several times so decided to give it a try.  Read it in 3 days.  Great romantic read.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The product is good overall, but not at the \\"normal\\" price. I find this on sale through Amazon and the value was acceptable.<br /><br />The Good:<br /> - Proper fit<br /> - Cut outs are perfect<br /> - Protection is okay, not for severe drops<br /><br />The Bad:<br /> - Cover is a bit on the thin side<br /> - The list price is far to high for this mid-level cover.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This isn't a bad cover; I consider it mid-line for moderate bumps. Buy it if discounted.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|niece loves it but needs to be easier way to get gems. :/<br />Make so many coins equal a gem or something.
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|I couldn't figure this game out and quite frankly it just did not catch my attention.  I usually am patient with new games, but this one was very frustrating to me.  If you can figure it out...good for you!!!  LOL
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Not since the &#34;X-Files&#34;, has a show grabbed me from its &#34;Premiere&#34; and held me for every single show!  When &#34;Supernatural&#34; arrived on the scene on the then &#34;WB&#34; I sat &#34;riveted&#34;  to my TV.  Jensen and Jared's Chemestry brings &#34;believeability&#34; to the show as Brothers. Their &#34;Life&#34; has captivated me....You know you love the show when you &#34;DVR&#34; the episodes on TNT, you have all the seasons in their boxed set, and you just went and purchased ALL of the boxed Season's on Blu-ray. (Not to mention you have a &#34;repeating&#34; reminder on your smart phone) and Wednesday nights, for just one hour, you get to see a show that is 2nd to none.
B000002OCP|5.0|I'd give this album 10 stars if I could! It's not traditional blues, but what kind of narrow minded, backwards, purists is blinkered enough to try and say this isn't some of the most mind bendingly good music of all time? I honestly don't know. I've loved this album for years and was astonished to find it is generally derided by alot of people.<br /><br />If you look past this you'll get a funky, intense record that still has that deep blues feel to it, maybe it isn't suited to the \\"this is how my music sounds and it CAN'T EVOLVE no matter what\\"  crowd, even if it becomes one of most amazing pieces of musical fusion ever.<br /><br />But please don't be put off this album by these people. This album is life changing!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I am an animal lover. So, I chose this book because it was about a dog. Liked it because it was told from the dogs perspective.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|I bought this as a gift to my wife, she loved it.<br /><br />. . . . . . . .
B0030IIZ56|5.0|I got the combo pack (DVD and Bluray disc).<br />Package was original and the discs are working great.<br />Package arrived on time.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game was awesome. I highly recommend this game.  This game was worth the couple of bucks I spent. it was a long game and many clues and help to get u through.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|This is not a move for everyone, this is more of an art house type of film. We all have issues and baggage and the characters in Short Bus certainly have theirs. uses nudity and sex in a way that is nor gratuitous, but it is erotic.
0140143505|5.0|I happened across this sweet little book in the library. What a delight! I have a friend who is a true bibliophile like Helene. I gave it to him for Christmas and he raves about it every time I see him. Cleverly constructed. Some insights into life as lived in London after WW2 also.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|great activity to help stimulate young and old minds alike. wonderful addition to our ever growing techy toys and gadgets. thanks!
1451695195|1.0|I was looking for more. Not much to it. Very thin on details. Seemed to me to be a lot of repetition..
B008IYR2BA|4.0|I really enjoyed seeing a character such as Dexter question religion. His struggle with it really developed his character so much. Can't wait for Season 8! but yet still not as amazing as season 4.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this read! It began with such an unexpected twist and continued to pull me in throughout. I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to get to the next book of the trilogy to find out what happens next!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is the best one to start with. Other Angry Bird games get harder. You need this one for the basics.
B003TQKVGU|4.0|I found this book quite good, easy to read and very helpful for understanding  and changing your own behavior it make me feel motivated as well so I very much recomande this book to everybody who truly want change their life
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|A refeshing space exploration of deepspace,<br /><br />  Different plot of space exploation. Product in  ghood condition plays well.<br />and a different asepct of how we got here and why we should keep up on deeper space exploration missions.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Ted...this movie was just too funny...great movie and great price.  Flash Gordon in the movie made it.  My family liked it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|has a lot of footage of concerts,behind the scenes,and early unplugged Paige and Plant. well worth adding to your collection
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|It is a family guy movie with less random side stories. The Bear that is cute is just like a friend who has to no problem wasting time.
B00005U122|5.0|sent this as a gift to my guitar teacher. he loves it ,he teaches me via Skype, as i drive north, south, east and west  a lot
B00ARAN9JW|5.0|Its is a very well done 3D shooting film. if you looking for a heart touching film, this is not it.
B001676320|5.0|We had a copy of this, tho not on Blu-ray but apparenty misplaced it.  We had spent many hours watching it and sharing it with our friends.  We were so determined to find another copy that my husband and I, without each other's knowledge, bought each other a copy for Christmas!  Now, we will share the extra copy with a dear friend who had fallen in love with it first time she watched it with us!  This one is DEFINITELY a keeper!!!!!
B009LREA1S|5.0|A true to form Batman movie. Not a story about a horse or a man with family problems. It is a Batman movie. Batman is very human and it shows through.
6305882592|5.0|Fantastic Movie!!! It's one of my favorite.  I've given it to many of my friend as a Birthday or Christmas gift
141659521X|5.0|If you are a Vince Flynn fan, here is another &#34;home run!&#34;  I have enjoyed each and every book he has written!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A wonderful read for all ages. Travel to the Wonderful Wizard of Oz in this classic. It's a lovely story that has gentle lessons of being grateful for what you have.
0446572993|5.0|Another smash hit for Baldacci.  His novels could be made into movies with ease because the characters and scenes are so well drawn.
B009186JYI|5.0|Its the Rolling Stones what's not to love. This was a gift for my husband who is a huge Stones fan and he couldn't be happier with it.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I cannot keep buds in my ears, so these are a staple for my daily workouts. They are light (I feel like they aren't there), but they don't last. I have gone through 1-2 pairs a year for the last few years. I do use them both indoors and outdoors, however, and the fact that I keep replacing them reflects how much I like them (and they are inexpensive).
B007SYWFRM|1.0|for this game you need a certain addition so now I cant play it. it sucks like the vikings. die stupid game
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS! its an amazing album. Bruno Mars is My favorite artist. It arrived right when it was supposed too. I loved how you could preorder too.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Everything you see can't be Oscar worthy, and there's nothing innately wrong in that.<br />I think the plot held up and the director moved through it fairly seamlessly. I will likely watch it again. I hope more in the series go to film.
B007PKDW44|5.0|I really like Volbeat, as they are hard yet melodic at the same time.  This album has a nice variety of songs; it's not the same music over and over.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't LOVE many books, but this one was great and unforgettable. Such a meaningful storyline and relatable characters, right amount of drama and love. Believe the reviews!
0061692042|5.0|Reading Canada was in part inspired by my hearing the author participate on a television panel. His patient, compassionate and determined manner was extraordinary, and reviews of this novel indicated that its subject matter would be well-suited to his style. It was, but equally rewarding was his ability as \\"a born story-teller with an inimitable lyric voice\\" (quoting Joyce Carol Oates). The story is a page-turner, the characters rich, and the insights revealing. The extent to which the antagonists are flawed often renders their insights compelling: \\"Whatsoever thy findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work, no device, nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest\\".<br /><br />Ford's practice of telegraphing future events in the narrative is at first unsettling, but it is here that the reader discovers that this story is more about the journey than the destination. As poor choices are made, the capacity of people to deal with the consequences is everything. Small ill-considered crimes can be shattering, heinous premeditated crimes can escape consequence. Outcomes are never fair, but understanding and resilience are their own rewards. All in all, this is a very fine novel.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is good for playing Klondike but if any other typed of solitaire are available I haven't discovered how to find them
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is one of the best books I've read recently.  As a child, I loved rummaging through old photos at the secondhand store and trying to imagine the lives these people lived.  Mr. Riggs has used a series of wonderfully odd old photos to illustrate this tale of monsters and time looping peculiar children.
B002UM5BXW|1.0|I borrowed this book on my Kindle and returned it after just a few chapters. I've read many thousands of pages from books about food and cooking, but this was the first time I ever encountered a sex scene in such a book. I thought I could overlook discussions about illegal drug use and some harsh language, but it was just too much for me.<br /><br />I read a short description of the book before I borrowed it, but it wasn't at all what I expected. I guess I should have read the reviews before attempting to read it. I guess this guy is someone on TV, so people who have seen him may know what to expect, but I'm TV-less and was completely broadsided.
B0059XTV7Q|4.0|If you have any comcerns regarding purchasing this DVD because Madonna is tied to it, that is the reason why you should purchase it. A very well done, crafted, researched, lavish, written, directed film. Madonna threw herself completely into the production and the result is one of the best films of the year. I like Madonna - not obsessed - and have always wondered if it was not a \\"MADONNA\\" production it certainly would have been received better at awards time. The woman has a gift. Again, well worth the purchase.

145470246X|5.0|I have so far made three of the designs in this book and they all turned out beautiful.  The instructions are very easy to understand and the illustrations are perfect. Please write another book!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie, being a Colin Farrel fan, but I was not impressed. The writers chose to use the S-word over and over rather than using more thoughtful language. The idea of not knowing what is real or fantasy is interesting, but was not developed well. I kept waiting for a plot twist that never came. Also it was just one chase scene after another without much of anything else.The futuristic scenery was interesting, nevertheless this movie was a total waste of time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addicting told my sisters about it and my brother we all have downloaded it and play all day....even in church ( forgive us Lord)...lol
B000XA5K48|5.0|Filled with enough gratuitous action shots and humor to make a grown man squeal with joy. Yes, that's me! The plot was second nature, but tied in nicely with the overall action theme of shooting 'em up. The subtle jokes, smart wit from Paul Giamatti and that good feeling you get when a bad ass guy walks out the same way he came in made this movie a keeper for me. The story doesn't get too much in the way of why you purchased the movie- Action, Guns and a little sex. 5 stars compared to the overly complicated dreck they're coming out with now in 2013!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|the kids love this knock off Super Mario Bros game they play it all day I even tried it a like it
B0030B624E|5.0|Funny, sweet, violent, gruesome-not words that usually appear in the same sentence, but perfectly describe Zombieland. The actors seem to have been born to play these parts. I'm a middle aged female, probably not the demographic the movie makers were going for, and I don't watch horror films. If I can love this movie, anyone can!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game, it's fun and always a challenge. Recommended to all my friends. I wish it had new worlds like the iPhone
030758836X|3.0|I thought the writing was strong for much of the book. One of the tricky things with alternating first person main characters is creating voices that are distinctly different from each other, and the author did a good job of this.  She kept my interest throughout the book.<br /><br />SEMI SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br /><br />The ending, however, was terrible. At first, I just plain didn't like it, but then after thinking on it a couple of days, I decided that if it had been fleshed out a little more (it reads like her outline to the final chapters)it would have been better. While I thought the characterization of the main characters was okay, i think it needed to go a little bit deeper so at least we'd have some insight to why the characters behave as they did.<br /><br />I had strongly recommended this book to a couple of friends, and now I'm a bit embarrassed. But at least we'll have a good conversation of it.  And I plan on checking out the author's other books from the library as opposed to purchasing.
0790729393|5.0|I never heard of this movie but love Robert DeNero. I was surprised by how many great actors were in this movie, I definitely recommend seeing it at least once.  I have watched it several times you see things you missed the first time around.  It was truly an awesome picture glad I found it on Amazon's website.
B0079KGAOY|4.0|Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci and Rene Russo star in Richard<br />Donner's Action films. These films focus on L.A. cops, Martin Riggs<br />and Roger Murtaugh and their personal lives. Lethal Weapon -(1987)<br />A veteran cop and his new suicidal partner investigate a drug-related<br />murder. Lethal Weapon 2 -(1989) Two L.A. cops face crooked, foreign<br />diplomats. Lethal Weapon 3 -(1992) Cops, Riggs and Murtaugh go after<br />a ruthless ex-cop. Lethal Weapon 4 -(1998) Riggs and Murtaugh face<br />getting older and a Chinese counterfeit/smuggling scheme. I've always<br />liked these films and glad to have them together. All 4 films not only<br />have nice picture and sound, but neat extras including a bonus disc<br />with more neat extras. I recommend this great set.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|I have this movie on VHS but wanted to ensure nothing happens to it so I purchased it on DVD as well.  It is truly an awesome Movie.  I love Chazz and DeNero together. Has a great message that comes thru loud and clear.  Do not miss this picture.
B00319ECGU|5.0|great price great collection I would recomend this for anyone who likes Clint Eastwood Loveit! love it!! Love it !!
B0086700CM|5.0|soooooo fun and coooool. this game is amazing. this game is soooooooooooo awesome.I love it. one girl in the game goes really fast
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow. Keeps you right on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this to anyone who has ever felt the urge to want to change the world. Love this book!
B00ARAN9JW|4.0|The movie itself was pretty good but the picture was blurry an pixelated which is odd with the speed of my home internet connection speeds
B004TF3HSO|5.0|Le Orme - Felona E Sorona 2 CD (English & Italian)<br /><br />  Felona e Sonora was the third album by Italy's Le Orme and a progressive rock masterpiece.  Based on the concept of 2 planets orbiting in the same cosmos with very much contrasting personalities.  Felona is the \\"Happy planet\\" while Sorona is the dark moody forboding planet .<br /><br />  This 2011 remaster package is a great way to re-enjoy or enjoy this magnum opus with the original Italian sung version and for the first time the English version.  I would stick with the original of course as the results are similar to other bands who tried this...RDM did it with Contamination.....Banco did it with Banco......PFM did it too with Photos of Ghosts.  Although the English version is interesting the Italian sung version is better.  The English version is ripped from vinyl as I guess the English master tapes were lost, but the original version sounds wonderful.  Some nice photos and detailed liner notes in a small digipack fold out replica of the vinyl album.<br />  Musically Felona is beautiful from start to finish with a ton of great guitar, bass, drums and a ton of vintage keyboards.  Felona is 70's space prog with great melodies and songs all contained within a concept album format with epic musical imagery.  Each song builds on the story and each songs is carefully pieced together.<br />  If you dont know Le Orme then this is a GREAT place to start.......
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|The movie itself was pretty good not quite as good as the original they changed the story way too much an i feel there was way too much left out. It felt like the whole movie was made with only 3 characters ... the picture was blurry an pixelated which is odd with my connection speeds
B0084IG8TM|5.0|If you like the movie, you will be happy with this DVD.  Both of my kids enjoyed the book and the movie.
B004EPZ08O|4.0|Yes I have added another one to my list but they are getting boring and running on the same track, with a bit of this and that it would have been better plus the story line could help there. The actors did it credit and I stayed awake and managed to survive the movie. The thrills start at the beginning and continue on throughout the show there are times it is interesting, It's worth watching and judging for yourself I rated this one an B plus, entertaining keeping me on my seat with what is next spills just not to spoil it all, mum is the word, I would still buy the popcorn and relax for a while
067144901X|5.0|Our first copy was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy. Our daughter loves the second copy just as much. Boynton is a great author for the preschool set!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Continuing on with the movie was fantastic and the cast do a great job keeping everything going to hold the interest in the show. A little slower than the others but still the edge of the seat entertainment here and there not knowing, making you guess what's up.  The actors play their parts extremely well and make this blood lust horror look fabulous which of course it is. Marvelous entertainment so get to the popcorn and enjoy relax and listen, you never know what will happen next.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|it was very well written and gave a lot of room for thought.  I enjoyed how the book came together at the end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!  Can't believe it was as riveting as \\"Hunger Games\\"'  Can the last book possibly keep up with these two??
B003QTUQGU|5.0|Very surprised. Well done and enjoyable. Would recommend to most audiences. This was recommended by a relative. I was not sure that it was that great. A must see!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This book is not something that I would normally go for, but I thought I would give it a try.  I was hooked, then uncooked, then hooked again.  I liked Clay 's character, but thought the relationships between characters could have been developed more.  This is definitely a novel for the nerdy novel reader.  A short read, as well.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Preordered this for my son. He loves the Batman series thrilled to get it without having to run all over the stores trying to find it.
B004529NKC|5.0|ordered this along with the other step up movies as part of a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it
B0038NN3B4|5.0|Love it love it. It's all me and what I have looking for in changing my attitude and motivation toward weight loss
B009ANP4F4|5.0|ordered this for my daughter for her Christmas and she is a super fan of all the step up movies
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Eben may have had some type of experience while in a coma. I'm pretty sure this book was written for cash, not to share his experience!
B008P1EWIM|3.0|Either I don't know how to use it appropriately, or it doesn't give detailed info like other weather apps do..
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had no idea what the book was about and just started reading it. Very well written and melted you pulled in to the end!!! I recommend this book to everyone.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Perfect for casual pick up and play style. You can go at it for a few minutes or play for hours.
0761163808|5.0|Such a great buy! This book cannot disappoint...everyone who opens it loves it!! I bought another one for my nephew who loves animals and he is obsessed with it!
B007MDB548|5.0|Excellent movie for young girls.  My daughter is 4 years old and loves all the tinkerbell movies.  Looking forward to more.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Painfully realistic. Felt a connection with all the characters. A pleasant surprise, looking forward to more from this author.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Not very far in but not bad. Some puzzles are fairly easy though. I am not really a good judge since not far but I like it.
0345529057|5.0|Wonderful books and came right away. I first started watching the TV series and when I found out it was a book I was very excited.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read and liked all of John Grisham's books.  This one is better than some; I really loved it!
034580404X|5.0|This series is great. I get on my reading sprees then stop for a while. I have read the first book which was great. It isnt as well written as some Books I have read, however the content makes up for it big time.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Good game fun to play awesome like it I will keep it I have played others and like this better

B006PHD0RW|5.0|Everything is so addictive i want to stop but then think &quot;just one more&quot; . Its fun and i love it if you want a game that keeps you up all night this is perfectly the one.
B000001DWG|5.0|Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.  We used it already and recommend it to others.
1936608618|5.0|Seems majority of the reviews before me are a lot more educated in fitness and endurance training. I just started Crossfit and bought this book for not only expanded knowledge but for broken down views of the lifts most used in Crossfit to help me prepare for my WODs. I think in general, raises a lot of good points on endurance training that I had never considered before as I used to just train by running and occasionally lifting weights. I highly recommend this book as it's also written very well and easy to understand for people like myself.

B00A77II0U|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I finished it too quickly however. Quality hidden object games are hard to find, but this one was great.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.  We used it already and recommend it to others.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|The over 50 crowd will enjoy! Very Funny. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones  never, never, ever disappoints. Watch it!

B003TSEEDY|4.0|It's amazing how the reader would have no idea where these kids are from but that they are so easily relatable. Bought the book this morning and finished it it by dinner.
B000002GJH|5.0|Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.  We used it already and recommend it to others.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I tried to play solitaire and all I got was just advertising and there was no way to close the ads. I can't even get to the game to play it. I deleted it from my kindle immediately. Horrible product!!!
B0045DO8LA|5.0|Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.  We used it already and recommend it to others.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game needs some extreme work. First of all, in creative mode, if you place down a crafting table, you can't access it. Same with the boiler. Second, its a little lagging, and it does get a little annoying. Third, they need 2 put more items in creative mode, which also gets a little annoying. But other than that, its very fun, high quality, and well worth the $6.99 price. I would recommend this game to any Minecraft fan, and everyone else who's either been wanting to try Minecraft, and everyone who doesn't know anything about it.
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.  We used it already and recommend it to others.
B008BU70HW|5.0|The detail to every facet of life after World War  I and the changes that evolved are remarkably  copied in every way.  Interesting and informative in the way British aristocracy lived before and after the war.
B001HN6922|5.0|Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.  We used it already and recommend it to others.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|The kids enjoyed it, but not up to par with the other Ice Age movies. Worth renting, but don't expect too much.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.  We used it already and recommend it to others.

B00AMBK0X4|5.0|My newphew (age 14) come over one day. So my fiance and me decided to rent a movie. Brandon (the newphew) decided he wanted to watch Ted. When he told me it was about a teddy bear i was a little skeptical. Im so glad i watched this! Funniest Movie EVER! If you not like cursing, or your kid to see sexual gestures then this is not the movie for you! However, if your an adult wanting a good laugh, you should rent! You wont regret it.

0061767581|5.0|Best Book - im not a book reader but decided to start reading anyways. I started with this book and i am now hooked! I am now on the second one. (: Way to go Lauren Conrad!
B009NQKXYK|1.0|This movie just didn't do it for me.  I couldn't get into it.  I thought the story was weak.  The trailer made it seem a bit more involved then it actually was.  The ending - terrible.
B009329Y30|4.0|I have heard how great this movie is and I would have to agree. I really enjoyed this movie. It kept me in the moment the whole time!
B005LAIISA|3.0|Although the preorder was reduced by a couple of dollars when it arrived, some of the stores had it for $2.00 more off.  I think I will defer the preorder to see what the local merchants have to offer.
B009VB97EY|3.0|After hearing all the buzz on facebook and stuff about Magic Mike, i decided i would rent it. I paid $4 for this movie for 48 hours. I feel as if i wasted my money. This movie was not as good as i expected it to be. Yes, the men are to die for hot. BUT, i guess i just expected more. The movie was alright, but i will never rent nor buy this movie ever again!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was not sure about reading this trilogy but, once you start it you can't put the books down. What a great story!!
B009SQRL4U|4.0|My newphew wanted to watch this movie on Christmas Eve. I rented it for him. I liked it for a kids movie! Great for kids under 7 years of age.
B000002KGT|5.0|I bought this cd for my dauther. She lives in Switzerland and could not get it there. I gave it to her for xmas and she's trilled.
B001706I5I|5.0|My family decided to have Christmas at my house this year. Of course we had to watch a Christmas Classic. The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is amazing! & it always gives me a good laugh. Every kid and adult should get to watch this at least once in their lifetime.
B000IZA9NU|1.0|Sorry. It's not what I've come to expect from a Trek movie. I enjoyed the cast as always but the movie must have been operating on a very low budget. The special effects were horrible. Every thing looked so \\"plastic\\". Stunt work was terrible and did they even go to warp drive once? But it is what it is. A bad egg is laid every once in a while.
B0044KJIIC|5.0|I have all the season of smallville on dvd i bought them as each season came to an end,,,but when i moved all my dvds went in a box that i have not found to this day so i decide i was goin to just buy the season online and watch them so that is what i did i am goin to miss watching this show every week the good times....u know most shows nowadays dont last no more then 2 season maybe 3,4 or even 5 but 10years that is a life time and i was great watching the show and growing up with the character as well...
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I first borrowed this book from a friend and once I started reading it, couldn't put it down.  I have read it again since and the story was just as moving the second time around.  The story is written in such a way that it made me feel as though I was back in WWII Paris, experiencing the horror and terror of the Nazi occupation through Sarah's eyes.  The book goes back and forth between the past and present and intertwines them in a way that keeps you totally engaged until the very last page.
0547884591|5.0|Beautifully done and a lot of fun I've never had any interest in cooking beyond mac and cheese but this book hade excited about cooking. The learning theme is also quite inspiring.
B009PJXY3M|5.0|This album doesn't clearly fit into any genera or style.  However it is because of this that makes the album enjoyable. That being said, the only way to know if you will like it is to listen.  Ready or Not is the closest thing to fit into a single genera/style.  Check out Hurricane & 5:15 (Available on both the Deluxe and standard versions) as well as We're Dancing and Postcards (Deluxe only). It is also worth price shopping as Amazon had both the Standard and Deluxe versions for the same price when I purchased my copy. In which case the Deluxe version gets you 3 more tracks for the same price.
B007N31YH0|5.0|DVD is like new, arrived on time and when promise,cost was very reasonable, received exactly what I paid for and was promised
0955153077|5.0|After 4 years in school for digital art, I'm learning more in the first 30 pages than I did in most of my time there. Highly recommend it!
0525953728|5.0|It was thorough, clear and precise as to the information given.  I especially enjoyed the candid remarks about how the politicians rushed to claim their influence in the success completely done by seal team 6 and the support team that spent 10 years tracking to locate Osama bin Laden.  My respect goes to these soldiers who sacrifice their time preparing and refining their skills to complete such difficult work.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|As usual, the Pendergast books are the best. Could not put it down. Read it in two days! This book has 4 stories going on at once, but you can follow easily. Pendergast gets in real trouble!!
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|We loved this DVD so much, we bought two!!! Have watched it more than once even with my kids.  They loved it!Thank you for a great product at a super price!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great, fun game. Wonderful graphics. Works great on my kindle fire HD. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|The first season is worth watching and is presented extremely well in this box set.  The options of viewing as a series is very useful.
B0094KTCUQ|5.0|By far my favourite Pixar movie. I love to cook, and the nobleness of cooking, of preparing something for someone else to enjoy is captured perfectly in this movie.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|My kids (aged 1, 3, 5 & 7) have had a great time \\"playing\\" with this set since Christmas...then this morning I decided to get in on the fun and actually teach them how to play using the cards and following the rules.<br />WHAT A COMPLETE DISASTER!😫😫😫😫<br />This game has amazing potential, but wow did someone in design drop the ball in a big way at Mattel.  As most other reviews here indicate, it is virtually impossible to build the 'castles' as they are illustrated on the cards because the blocks don't stack well at all.  Yes, we tried laying some blocks on their side, which works well for a couple of levels...but for most of the levels you can not build the castle as it's shown if you don't stack the blocks on edge.<br />I quickly realized that this game would not be fun if played as designed and intended.<br /><br />It seems most of the positive reviews on here were written by dads who just gave the game to their kids and let them build.  Sure, my kids had the same experience using the blocks freestyle...but at 20-30$ a set, I would expect to actually be able to play the game the right way too.<br /><br />So, I called Mattel this morning and was pleasantly surprised when they offered me a product voucher for the price I'd paid (19.99 @ Walmart in Montreal).  No proof of purchase required! I would have otherwise returned the game to Walmart except that we had already recycled the box after it got ripped.<br />The customer relations agent I spoke with was very helpful and courteous.<br />She also referred to a 'new' Angry Bird Space Planet Block Version game...which, she thought, may actually be Mattel's response to the poor design of the earlier games.<br /><br />I think I'll take my voucher up to TRU and pick up that newer version!<br /><br />I suggest you call Mattel and ask for a refund!
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Not blown away but laughed out loud a few times.  Not bad for McFarland's first live action film - will be interested to see what he comes up with next.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Piano Master Christmas lots of fun, hard to stop playing with, granddaughter really enjoys playing the songs and gets better and better.
142313866X|4.0|This book is excellent in that it clearly presents drawing styles, techniques and easy to follow instructions. My daughter used this for her high school illustration class and had great success. It's a bonus that the characters (of which many varied Disney characters are presented) are so cute.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Was looking for something just like this. Got a good deal on it. Charges Samsung galaxy iphone ipad really quickly. It also can charge them up to 4 times!  I recommend this product
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A wonderful book about the tragedies of war. Insightful and well written. It doesn't matter what your political view is... This book is about real people in a real war facing an impossible situation.
0345803485|5.0|Loved it. Agree that you can love it or hate it. I am not a mainstream reader typically, and I am not usually a fictional reader. I got swept away quickly with this one, and needed to read the next one immediately. Agree there are adult topics in the book, and can be a little graphic. Was a nice change of pace for me, and my relationship with my husband. Definitely enjoyed the book, loved the second, and have not finished the third. If you can handle adult sexual themes, and words, its fun. Would totally recommend to a married woman or young female adult. Would say the age range of recommending is 20-40.
B00A757EFW|2.0|(1) Namco is milking this concept for $$$ yet there is no innovation.<br /><br />(2) If you want authentic/same as original, this is close.  I don't personally see the point in paying ANY money to experience a game that's decades old, but maybe you do.  Even then, $6.99 seems too high by a factor of ten.  Personal opinion.<br /><br />(3) This game has missed the opportunity to use touchscreen technology in a way that would improve on the original concept.  Why not allow waypoints or pathing like the airplane landing games?  Or multiple Pacmen?  Or different game modes (e.g. like Pacman CE for Xbox Live)?  I found the virtual joystick to be frustrating, as other comments have indicated.  I bet you could get used to it, but why isn't there a whole other interface in the first place?<br /><br />I think a creative maze/chase game designed explicitly for mobile devices could be a big hit.  This is just Pacman rehashed designed to sell based on the name not on the experience.<br /><br />Developers: Please come up with ideas that take advantage of the touchscreen interface.  Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Ninja Fishing, Word Hero, and airplane landing games are good examples.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|Tom Cruse and Val Kilmer so the job in this action based movie. Lots of action in the air and on the ground. Fun movie to get involved in. No dull spots in the one. Recommend this one.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|Just what I was hoping for.  Even my husband, who is not a James Taylor had to admit that he enjoyed it.  Played it over and over during the holidays.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Michael Cain does a great job as Scrooge in this one. The muppets are just right to accent Cain to get the point across. I like this version for the whole family. Fun and laughable in many parts.
B006VRDZ44|1.0|Just not very good.  Unlikeable characters which seems to be the norm - but also the plot is tried and true as in not very original.  Acting is good I suppose - but for me that is a so what when the plot is really just like the untouchables but in Atlantic City.
6305127646|5.0|Val plays a list of different charactors in this action based movie. It is great movie to get involved in and keeps you at the edge of your seat through most of the show. Very enjoyable.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Family favorite and Christmas necessity on DVD...there is nothing like a Griswold family Christmas and now we have it on DVD to enjoy
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book to see What Was He Thinking!<br />This book was recommended to me by a coworker, and I found it worthwhile.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|I'm writing this review because I love, LOVE, great jazz and vocal improvisation, and Gregory Porter is a total package. He has a deep, smoky voice that teases the ear. Listening to Gregory is like seeing the artist in an intimate jazz setting. He's comfortable and his music stays on my mind. I find myself humming tunes from Water first thing in the morning, mid-day and through the night. This music and Gregory's vocals are a natural marriage. As my 14-year-old granddaughter said recently after we listened to Water and Be Good, &#34;I love his voice and the songs because he's masterful at storytelling.&#34;
1451627289|1.0|Stephen King<br />11/22/63<br /><br />There are 32 pages missing from this book about three fourths of the way through.<br /> Very disappointed.
