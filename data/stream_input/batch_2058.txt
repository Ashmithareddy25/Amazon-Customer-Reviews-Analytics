B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I have to say, I thought it would be a lot like the actualy &#34;Google Website&#34;. Maybe my expectation was a little high. I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of the fact that when I turn my Kindle horizontally (length-wise) the app doesn't follow, like most would. Other than that, it's really not too bad.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Blu-Ray has sharp picture and excellent sound quality. The series is a wonderful addition to our library of &#34;keepers&#34; that we enjoy watching over and over.
0316789720|5.0|Bought for 11 year old g'son. He loved drawing with me using a different Ed Emberly book I had purchased for me when his dad was in second grade mannnnnny years ago. The author continues to provide hours of pleasure. 6-64 drew on the day I gave the book to my 11 year old g'son.
B001UV4XI8|1.0|I received my dvd I'm the mail in a decent amount of time. I waited like two weeks before I had time to watch it. I get 10 minutes into the movie and it goes blank and a red pirating screen pops up. No more movie! I was pissed! Have not heard back from them.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|GREAT BOOK SET MY 10 YO LOVED IT! He has made me purchase all the Percy Jackson & the Olympians' books! Very fast delivery!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This Solitaire game is good, but it became annoying to have to skip the commercials in between games.  I will probably purchase another solitaire game just to be rid of the commercials.

B009A3NGF4|5.0|I heard the second Mumford & Sons album wasn't as good as the first, but when I heard this album, I loved it! It's the same old Mumford and the quality of the album is just as amazing as the first. People fell in love with the new sound of Mumford, and when it wasn't new anymore, it \\"wasn't as good\\". But I say, wonderful job, Mumford and Sons!
142312166X|5.0|GREAT BOOK SET MY 10 YO LOVED IT! He has made me purchase all the Percy Jackson & the Olympians' book! Very fast delivery!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved every part of the three books, the only thing I did not like was the fact that I was done. MORE PLEASE E L.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Seth is a genius, I don't know how he does it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Talking about suspense!! I was reading and reading and turning the pages so fast. I didn't want to put this book down. And THEN I got to chapter 30!! O. MY. WORD!! Just when I thought it couldn't get any more suspenseful!! And then I got to chapter 43 and I was speechless.
B00992CF6W|1.0|sure I love this app but has anyone noticed that you get updates last. that's why I hate/love this app
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely amazing!!!!! Gets better & better every time I read it! I definitely recommend continuing on with the book's & movies
B000J103PC|5.0|Love Meryl Streep and the entire cast! This movie is great. I know plenty of people who don't care for it, but I love it, I think it's fun and yet has content. I've seen it so many times, I've lost count.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The web site itself is slow.  Often when the last number is called ( right before the last bingo), ap will not even allow you to daub the last number.  I was in this ap a while back and got out of it for this very reason thinking it just needed tweaked and it would be taken care of by technicians.  It wasn't/isn't and I am about to leave again.  I would not recomend it.
B002K0WBY6|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters when it came out and I loved it so naturally I bought the dvd. Do not regret buying it because I always watch this movie randomly and it never gets old. It's so funny! It's a fun movie to watch with friends and family.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It's good but not really that interesting to the reader because it's was only 3.4 points but it's was really good
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I give this Limited Edition set a 5-star rating because that's what it deserves. The special features are great and even the look of the set is beautiful. Downton Abbey is one of the best shows I have ever seen and I am a huge fan. I love the show and I'm glad I chose this set. The price was very fair and I received the item rather quickly!<br />A must have if you love the show!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I live this game it's so much better than the 1 temple ruin like how you use the tightrope @ the beginning
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I love this movie. Watched it for the first time a long time ago and I was absolutely moved. NIcole, Jude and Renee do an amazing job.
B002APU580|5.0|This movie is a great summation of Jane Austen's novel while still presenting the story with a fresh interpretation. Keira and Matthew are fantastic as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|It only takes an episode or two to become hooked on this true masterpiece classic.  I got caught up to start watching the third season by ordering this from amazon, and viewing it in it's entirety in one afternoon right before season three started. Such a wonderful show in all it's splendor!
B003WRDR0S|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I read it a while ago and it was magnificent. I could not put this book down! The story is just very powerful and very meaningful. If you've seen the movie and haven't read the book then you are missing out. I recommend this book to any avid reader out there or even if you don't read often!
B002IKLNW4|5.0|Very humorous description of a life growing up in small town america and the search for the perfect town.  Well written and entertaining.
0425263916|5.0|Steamy, Steamy, Interesting! I zoomed through this faster than Bared to You, and felt more comfortable (there were times when Bared to You made me feel a little uncomfortable). You find out so much more about Gideon, Eva and their family. Keeps you on the edge! Get a friend to read it with you, you'll need someone to share all the \\"OMG\\" moments with. Pissed I have to wait until MAY for the last book. Read it closer to May so you won't be stuck waiting.
B003U6BE8I|3.0|I suppose that had I not read the book, it would have been much better. :-) That's what my students told me, anyway!
B008J344BQ|3.0|I love Pink..but some of the songs are just okay. I guess I am looking for a repeat of her Funhouse CD...
B005IQZB14|5.0|Recommended to those with wanderlust you can travel vicariously through this book.  I did not want the trip to end.
B0090X4GLW|1.0|Many of the songs are only snippets of the song...bought the CD so I could hear the whole song...not pleased at all. Once CD's are open...you can't return them. Won't be doing that again :(
0143117009|3.0|Note, this is well-written, but by the third or fourth example, you'll have figured out the theme-- which is largely:  \\"Don't cut down all your trees!\\"  Basically, the whole gist of the book is centered around cultures that depleted their natural resources, and, as a result, disappeared from the face of the earth.<br /><br />Not as interesting a premise as Guns, Germs, and Steel, and much more pedantic.  Jared Diamond is still a solid writer, but this book is too long by 50%, and the premise is too simple for the elaboration within.  If you loved books like this, and you're an avid fan of the \\"man is bad/environment is good\\" genre, you'll probably still enjoy this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a surprise bargain this was. It is a really intriguing post-apocalyptic situation the human race has found it's self in. The story lines are tense and really had me biting my nails through this read.<br /><br />Won't say too much, but start reading it now.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|It's Breaking Bad!  There's never been a better drama/dark comedy on TV in any country, period.  I could say more, but why bother?  It's Breaking Bad!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this as it is on my students booklist. I always enjoy the themes involved in this book. It's clearly teen-fiction in the way it's written. The plot moves along at lightening speed which is the both the success and perhaps the loss in the story. You can't help but being engaged in the story as Katniss is catapulted into the hunger games arena; being swept along with her are a number of other characters who have varying degrees of involvement.<br />This is my only problem really, in that the other characters feel quite undeveloped - i don't feel I know, or care about them very much. Having said this, I'm aware it is book one of a trilogy and expect the other characters to be developed for good and bad in the other two books, so I take this book as a great set-up for the trilogy and involving some really interesting themes both ancient and modern.
034580404X|5.0|a great histoy and easy to read, but very complicated to leave the page or make another thing, congrats for the writter
B004LROUW2|1.0|Haruki Murakami - you are my favourite writer. I love the mix of mundane and pure fantasy in your stories. Your solitary protagonists have connected and whisked me into the fantastic worlds you create. It is my love of your writing which makes me so disappointed with this book. My only hope is that somebody sabotaged and murdered your writing in the Kindle translation.<br /><br />What I found in this book were shocking poor character development. Characters were introduced, given some page time, we were shown loose connections to other characters, then they were inexplicably dumped never to return or affect the story at all. This is but a small part of my concerns. The way the female characters were portrayed is disgusting. I know that in your writing you have always included the female characters a little fetishistic-ally but his was normally done by focusing on nuances, the girl with the most amazing ears, that people would fall in love in an instant. These nuances, observations had an innocence to them. However, the way the young women are involved is unnecessarily pornographic. For the most part the reference to their breasts, nipples just seem unrelated. I wonder If Haruki has turned into a dirty-minded old man.<br /><br />The story is unresolved - not in a mysterious way, but just an unsatisfying way. As ultimately I don't care about the characters and what happens to them.<br /><br />It's going to take me a while before I can re-read his greats - wind-up bird chronicle, wild sheep chase, hard boiled wonderland etc through fear that they are tainted by this rubbish.<br /><br />I was left feeling I had not only chapter missing, but a whole book!
B000M343BM|3.0|It's a good movie to watch with a guy because it's sports related.  Plus there's enough in it to make women happy too.
B005LVR6ZA|3.0|Still unsure about it. Ubik the confusing spray, lotion, powder - book. Actually, it was quite charming book. Written in 1969 so is a little dated but also has some comical science-fiction predictions. I loved the money-grabbing appliances. I'll have to read it again in 6 months time and read it from a different angle.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book had my jaw dropped at the turn of every page. I am still stunned and shocked at the turn of events in this story. I am just so amazed. I cannot wait for the third one to come out.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I wasn't sure I liked this book at first, then it surprised me and I couldn't put it down.  Then, that awful, stupid ending!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We found the Piano Guys videos online and instantly fell in love with their music! It is very soothing, yet upbeat. We have listened to this CD again and again and never tire of it. Even my teenagers love it! Can't wait for their next CD! We will definitely be purchasing it.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|It's the beautifully-illustrated, more cultured cousin of Apples to Apples. I highly recommend it especially for parties or family gatherings. You'll want all the expansions, too!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|What could be better than to be on your Kindle, think of something you want to search and being able to do it quickly.
B004SBX112|4.0|These little birds have so much personality, and the piggies are so smug. It's very satisfying to beat them down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun and not boring. love it. cool. worth it. buy it. :) :):):):):):) :) love it cause its super fun
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Just one more opportunity to beat up on smug piggies. The different moves, and the guiding lines are very helpful too.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|This is NY's first great album in at least 6 years and it's worth the wait.  Somehow he takes a bunch of lame old camp songs that nobody actually likes and makes them super cool.  The only thing better is the album that followed... Psychedelic Pill...  definitely get that one on BluRay.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|I was really surprised when this album was released.  The covers of &#34;Our Day Will Come&#34; and &#34;Will you Still Love Me&#34; were the prizes on this release.
B0063GORYU|5.0|My husband plays this on the computer and now that it is on Kindle, he has taken it over. A little bit slow for me but others enjoy playing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed every second!  I can't wait to see the movie in February.  I loved the slow-building romance.  GREAT CHARACTERS!
0345803485|5.0|Excellent reading! Enjoyed all three books to the fullest!  Heard it from my hairdresser who continues to pass the word.  Keep them &#34;coming!&#34;
0747582971|5.0|I received this book very quickly at a great price. The book was in excellent shape, I would definitely purchase from good will again
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so much fun I love it is really interactive horsews are so life like, great 3D effect it makes me want a horse of my own
B008IJTFYW|4.0|the sounds were very pleasant but many pretty much sounded the same. i eventually deleted the app and just used a cd from spotify.
0525953728|5.0|talked about all the training that he/they went through on a daily basis and how the last mission went down.  Good book!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I down loaded this game because it was reccommnded to me because I love playing all the cut the rope games. I find it a little more challenging but throughly enjoy it. I like how that &#34;jibber&#34; too!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I got the first season for Christmas and finished it within a day, and then bought season two the next day. It's so amazing! I love the character development and the plot lines especially! I wish there were more episodes in each season, but it looks like I have to wait patiently for the next season.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I find this much more challenging than angry birds and sometimes get frustrated and have to put it down for a bit, but all in all it's a fun app.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|For me, this is one of those books that I will pick up and read again and again. Colleen Hoover delivers countless well executed emotionally packed twists and turns. I don't want to say too much because I'm afraid to spoil it. What I will say is block off some time because once you start reading this one is hard to put down.<br /><br />On another  note:  I would love to reread this book from Holders point of view. While I do feel there is a good balance of perspective in the story, Holder is such a pillar of strength throughout the book, I would love to get inside Holder's head as he starts to make personal connections, and unravel the complexities of Sky and her past.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like most people enjoy angry birds but I really enjoyed it on a larger screen with my Kindle. Great fun.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Not a bad movie. Funny at times. Good fun poked at Glee type films. All around feel good movie. Sophomoric undertone.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I like the simplicity of this app. No muss and fuss. Just add a note and it's there for you.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I have a 4-year-old grandson who is rather energetic, which makes it difficult for him to hold his attention in any one area for very long.  We recently ordered &#34;Dr. Seuss' The Lorax&#34; on my Roku (from Amazon.com).  My grandson sat throughout the entire movie, quite spellbound.  We all enjoyed the movie as well as its message!
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Works great on Kindle Fire, Samsung Fascinate,and Droid 2. Very Handy to have. Does not work unless the internet is available, which I verified one day, but thats ok by me. Still like it alot and would reccommend it to any looking for something similiar. Using an HP CP1525nw that is connected wirelessly only. Would have given it 5 stars but it does not render fancy fonts (like in a word document) very well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very good game. lots of stuff going on in the game. I definitely recommend this game. there is just so much to do you never get bored!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The words of God. How do you not give this book five stars? The app itself is great too. Amen
B00005LOUP|5.0|A Christmas gift for my son and he says it was good!  It was excellent.  It came when it was supposed to and as described. The movie isn't something I really liked because Jim Carrey is not one of the actors I enjoy but my husband and son enjoyed it.
B000002JK2|5.0|I really like this album.<br />the copy i got is in good shape and plays well.<br />It came in a timely manner and wasn't too expensive.<br />a good buy.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album. I love the show and the music from the show, I just wish ALL the songs that I heard in this series was on this album :)
B004SKJTY6|2.0|This is a short incmplete behind the scenes film. Doesn't really contain much information. Not something you need to pay for or own to enjoy the movie.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I pre ordered this album because I heard one of the songs prior to it being released. Once I got it I couldn't stop listening to it!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|At times I while reading I could feel the main character's self destruction and could not bear her self isolation. It was quite raw with emotion and true feelings at times that could be almost unbearable to read. When a reader can feel this way that means the author has touched a hidden feeling that the reader has subdued and can relate with. In other words....I loved it.
034580404X|5.0|This book was everything that I heard it to be.  Nervier boring. A page turner.  I finished all three books in a week.  The ending will leave you with a smile of cheers.
0545425115|5.0|The book did not interest me at all at first (I had to read a for a college class) then read the second chapter and was so hooked on in.  I love the detailing that Suzanne Collins writes.<br />The book was used but it looked brand new.  I was very satisfied with the price as well.
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the best sci-fi adventures ever but I'm sure you've already watched it or know about Firefly. Series was gone entirely too soon but you can enjoy it on this fantastic Blu-Ray set. Great commentary, interviews, bonus features plus the show looks fantastic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Hard to put down. Can't wait to read the next installment and where Katniss and Peers end up.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun and relaxing.  The best way to take care of a horse short of living on a farm  It does run a little slow on my device though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is lightning fast for playing Solitaire on your Kindle Fire HD.  It is really a fun application of Solitaire!
B000L53D4O|5.0|I bought this for my grandson for Christmas.  I like how it will grow with him. He isn't walking yet but he can still play with the activites and when he does start walking he will be able to push the toy around and still get lots of use out of it.  Good contruction, bright colors.  Great purchase!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Awesome game I have beat. It 2 x. I know level three white Dragon has a couple boards that are extremely hard but can be done.  A must for anyone who likes a challange
B0015AARJI|5.0|My son needed a second controller for his Play Station.  This fit the bill nicely. Works great for additional player.
B0053O89K6|5.0|Too bad the show had to end.  I enjoy watch the show over and over.....also this show was always an hour long.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is really fun and has great graphics , imagni studios is doing a lovely job creating games :)
B005DZ35RC|5.0|Not his best movies, but I enjoy watching Johnny Depp as an actor.  I would recommend his other movies as well.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|I primarily got it for him, I am not a big Angry Birds gamer.  No crashes, weird glitches and such.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I installed this program, it seemed to work for a while, then failed to download books from my library. Now it crashes after two or three minutes.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|Fine toy for a child who like DDR like games. Not useful for learning the piano or to hear christmas songs in full.<br /><br />Just an oversimplified Christmas game
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Since the new movie came out, I decided to read this classic. I'm so glad I did! It is such a great work that while I was reading it I was like &#34;Wow.&#34; Half of it is a story, which weaves around Jean Valjean in a complicated and suspenseful way like a drama that couldn't make me stop reading. It vividly shows how much most the French people suffered and paints a potrait of their courage, patriotism, and pain. It provokes constant emotion from the reader. The other parts of the book explain Hugo's opinions and ideas of life that are inspiring to read.
1468179993|4.0|Title:  How to Deliver a TED Talk Secrets of the World's Most Inspiring ..<br />.Excellent guide to include key points in a presentation.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|One of his best and there are so many to choose from. So glad I got it I listen to it all of the time
B009E3EY38|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my husband, who is a big Led Zeppelin fan.  He really loved it.  Said it was a great collection and has spent a good time in our media room watching this.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|War Horse is one heck of a movie and it's a recent one at that.  It has just about everthing one could want in the movie.  It has been made into a broadway production and played near where I live.  I didn't go but I've been told it was astonishing to see.  Even if one has seen it in the theaters, they should purchase this video.  Honestly,<br />this video will keep your attention from beginning to end.  To anyone who wants to view a movie, choose this one!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Key app to enable printing on my tablet. Works great. Adds great deal more capability. bla bla bla bla bla
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Mr Reacher dispensing truth and honesty. Mr Reacher dispensing truth and honesty.  I am worried about Tom Cruise impersonating this upright character.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved everything about this book. The right amount of suspense, drama, love to keep you on your toes. This book had a great twist in it. I couldn't put this book down. One of my all time favourites.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This is the best Rian Johnson movie thus far in my opinion, as always Joseph Gordon Levitt was great and it always helps to have an all-star cast alomgside the main characters of him and Bruce Willis. As far as willis goes, i'd say this was his best sci-fi film to date since i couldn't even bare to watch the trailer for surrogates. Emily Blunt is a large role towards the 2nd half and she is solid as well, and always beautiful. Even if she hasn't in my opinion been cast in any stellar roles, i think she could shine in one nonetheless. I overall thought this movie was well worth the rent and would buy it later on, i was debating renting this or Taken 2 and am very glad i chose this since i know T2 would be good, but less original. The film industry needs more sci-fi that isn't cheesy and this movie does good to deliver just that. Best of all, it's not a 80 minute short movie like alot of the genre so you get almost 2 hours of entertainment!
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I really enjoy watching The Big Bang Theory whenever I want to.  It is a very funny citcom and it makes me laugh.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read.  It is very well written and so interesting I literally couldn't put it down.  In fact, I ended up reading the entire book in one day.  After reading this book you will very likely be much more appreciative of life.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|this book is well researched, entertaining and inspiring. His book The 4 Hour Body is also most definitly worth a read.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A true Christmas  with great humor not to be missed before every Christmas, the best of the Vacation Series !!
044654759X|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It's one of my all time favorites. I recommend it to anyone who loves Nicholas Sparks!!
B00080DIWE|5.0|This stand makes painting models a whole lot easier. It gives you access to all sides and you just give it a twirl. Made of quailty plastic this should last for years. It is 2 stands one for holding car bodys and another for for all other parts.
B0051BNRTO|4.0|I always anxiously await Hornby's next novel. This one did not disappoint.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 as there are a few dry spells here and there.  I just re-read it for the 2nd time.  I've read it both on paper and on audio-book.  Both are a treat.
B007KITQTQ|5.0|Watching this film again after so many years, and now on bluray as opposed to as old VHS, really drew out just how wonderful Jurassic Park is, with so many memorable scenes both visually and mentally stimulating and an incredible score that stays with you long before the bluray is out of the player. I will definitely rewatch it in the future and recommend it to anyone who loves this movie. I have yet to watch the 6-hour documentary, but I look forward to that feature. It's unfortunate that this movie is not available in the US without purchasing the trilogy pack, but I am glad I was able to get the UK import.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The whole family plays it and loves it. It's addicting. We have races to see who can complete a level first.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|Reasonable pricing. Can't find any features to do anything other than take a picture! More features would be nice.... More features!
0345803493|5.0|Writing and editing were lacking throughout the entire 3 book series. Having said that I thoroughly enjoyed this book for allowing me what I believe to be a most intimate glimpse into the 'mystery' world of S&M sexual erotica. Something I could not even begin to imagine. Nor even begin to allow myself to explore.<br />This 3 book series allowed me the freedom to do that.<br />Additionally, I can relate with Anastasia on a very basic personal level and feel the \\"writer\\" did an outstanding job of articulating Ana's feelings ofof exploding sensuality, mature innocence, emotional rollercoaster, and overall physical ramifications of new adventures.<br />I have wondered about mild things that were touched upon in this book.<br /><br /> really exist et past for a tolerable glimpse into this specific type of world of erotica and \\"romance\\".<br />Yes, I agree Christian's character has flaws, but personally I believe, thru readingthe this, I would be able to \\"see\\" both sides of the coin.<br />Regarding Anatasia! Just because she is an outstanding young lady with a good head on her shoulders and anI education, who isn't a hoochie, 'I must be a slut conniving ho to even really exist or to get anywhere in my life' type of woman!  And itI doesn't mean she cannot possibly exist in real life America 2013.<br />Real, pure, naturally beautiful, fit, educated, talented woman really do exist.<br />Not everyone is tainted by television, radio and movies.<br />While I am totally against violence against women, I found this book series insightful and one that I would recommend.<br />Naive 48 y/o Mother of 3 Adults

0345803485|4.0|Yes, I did find the writing irritatingly repitious; sardonicall, mercurial; burnished copper highlights .... However, for me, it was something I could get past for a tolerable glimpse into this specific type of world of erotica and \\"romance\\".<br />Yes, I agree Christian's character has flaws, but personally I believe, thru readingthe this, I would be able to \\"see\\" both sides of the coin.<br />Regarding Anatasia!

And itI doesn't mean she cannot possibly exist in real life America 2013.<br />Real, pure, naturally beautiful, fit, educated, talented woman really do exist.<br />Not everyone is tainted by television, radio and movies.<br />While I am totally against violence against women, I found this book series insightful and one that I would recommend.<br />Naive 49 y/o Mother of 3you Adults<br />D Posthuma
B006YC74E8|5.0|I've tried many other apps for photo editing but none of them seemed  to work. It is amazing. You can size the picture. Cut the edges  to make it smaller. Overall this app is amazing. I highly recommend this app. None  of the other photo editing apps seem to work  so when  I found this one it was not only beyond me expectations, it  was very useful.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it!! love the prizes. just wish you didn't have to wait so long for coins. I have shown this app to my mother daughter and son!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Addicting and fun! It was difficult at first but it definitely a good sequel to temple run 1. There needs to be a 3rd one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Good App.  Can switch to the version that you like. Easy to carry to church.  Easy to navigate.  Have on my smart phone too.
0062064304|5.0|This artbook is amazing, if you are 3D artist, you should have it, because is very complete, you won't repent.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LOVED this this book!! I told everyone I know to read this book! So now I will tell everyone I don't know to READ THIS BOOK!! You will love it too. I was so sad when I finished reading it because I wanted to read it for the first time all over again. Hopeless is very well written, and a good story. Do yourself a favor and read this book!
0307341577|5.0|I just finished Dark Places and I am glad to say that I think I have found a new author. I also read Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which was also good, but I found this one much more of a page turner. The actual details of the murders are revealed gradually and keep you reading to find out more. I found the main character very sympathetic. Yes, she is selfish and a little strange, but then who wouldn't be under the circumstances. Highly recommended.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is fun to play and since you build up coins it doesn't consume all your time. I did find it helpful to wait until the coin shaker bar turned red before using it to get the most out of it.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Good for a few hours of mindless entertainment. Does have a few quirks though. Some of the objects touch area are off
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Works just like the one I have on my smart TV. Easy to use, even on my home network PCs
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Although it seems like it should have been an update tto the original temple run, this TR is packed with new features. I especially like the mine carts. Its free, so why not?
B004I8WD6E|4.0|This product works great. It is also very durable and it look really nice although it plastic get yellow after a while
B003SAF76Q|5.0|This is one of my most favorite albums. It provides nice heavy riffs and excellent vocals. The final breakdown in the song &#34;Sleepwalker&#34; is awesome.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this I great its has more ways to play like the mine and the demon gorilla was a nice touch love it
B000KIPT30|5.0|I would not recommend it for listening to subtle or audiophile quality music...  however, as a multiplexer for running a mix back to band members during a recording session, it works very well.  Each person is able to adjust the gain on their individual headphone output to accommodate their needs during the session.<br /><br />The price is great.  The construction is sturdy.  Overall, a fine little headphone amplifier, especially at this low price point.
8866130931|4.0|Very good. A monthly planner could be a good addition as stated by someone else. Otherwise it very interesting portable and useful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ALREADY OUT FOR IOS WAITIMG FOR ANDROID<br />CAN'T WAIT CAUSE I HAVE IT ON MY IPOD! QAURTZ BLOCK SIDEWAYS SLABS UPSIDE DOWN STAIRS!
0131988425|5.0|This book is pretty complete. I used this book as an undergraduate and I still refer to this book frequently as a grad student. This book is well written and I would recommend this for anyone taking DSP
B0033AGPFS|5.0|This vinyl edition of Electric Ladyland just oozes quality. The vinyl sounds fantastic. It's heavy and clean. The packaging is also beautiful and sturdy. The album is an absolute classic and this record breathes new life into these songs. When I bought this Amazon had it for a great price which makes the whole thing even sweeter.
0525953728|5.0|Mark's book makes a splash entry with the first Chapter ending as the helicopter is just about to crash into the courtyard of Osama Bin Laden's house.  From that moment on I was hooked - couldn't put the book down.  His youth in Alaska learning to hunt and understand how to handle guns with respect and his determined character gave him a solid base for what he was preparing for.  He tells the story of the raid on Osama because it's important for him to relay an accurate account of what really happened.  He honors his fellow team mates and is self effacing.  There doesn't appear to be anything in the book that would reveal secret technical advances or anything like that.  He wants the American public to be aware of the \\"true heroes\\" who have lost there lives since September 11 and make sure their families are not forgotten.  Mark Owen tells a great story - gives us great inside into the lives of the invisible warriors we owe a great deal to.
B000002KFJ|4.0|Only thing of note is the first song - Hole in the Sky - your CD is not defective, it cuts off after 4minutes - error, accident or intentional on their part, that's the way the song on the album is supposed to be and your CD doesn't have something wrong with it.
B00138KGOS|3.0|I remember loving this album when it first came out (vinyl) but listening to it now.....well, I still like some of it, but overall am not as enthusiastic about it.  I guess it's better to let some things from the past alone!
B000AJIF4E|4.0|*edit update *<br />i feel compelled to update after a week of burn in and experimentation ( again i, in no way, pretend to be an 'audiophile' -however, i am not completely without some background re sound<br /><br />after they have opened up a bit, i STILL think they are a poor poor choice for relaxing, passive listening.  i believe that while they are very very very clear, they are also a tad harsh and brittle in the highs, although sibilance is minimal.<br /><br />i think that IF, and that is a big IF, but IF you find the right disc ( with the right mix on it ), and have a very good source, you can hit a magical sweet spot with these.  i still maintain it takes a bit of work to get there though.  i still think i am pretty close to spot on when i say that these are stunning for monitoring and mixing ( maybe a little less on the latter ), but the interesting thing is that they will absolutely force you to consider the frequencies and colors of the sources you are using.  you will NOT enjoy these with low quality mp3's.  IF you have a good soundcard, or an amp, and have a properly mixed cd, you can hit an amazing sweet spot.  just don't think these are right for casual listening.  anyway my 1 cents worth on this update.....<br /><br />i am writing this review from the perspective of someone who is NOT an 'audiophile,' an 'elitist,' nor someone who pretends to hear things they don't, just a moderately interested listener with a bare minimum of mixing experience ( digidesign )....regarding these headphones sound, well, i can pretty much suggest the following 3 issues, provided you have any hearing whatsoever....<br />1.  you WILL learn to use the EQ settings on your equipment, you will be forced to, or you WILL have ear and brain fatigue before long<br />2.  you will need to have a pretty good 'source' and equipment both, to enjoy these phones, they will make poorly encoded flac and mp3 files sound VERY bad, in other words, they will EASILY show you how bad ( or good) the encoding was<br />3.  you will need to allow, i would say, 20 or 30 hours of burn in to get them to open up....<br /><br />just my opinion, not worth much i suppose, but goodness, these things are NOT meant for just passive listening....you just about canNOT passively listen to these...are they clear?  yes.  do they represent the recording? yes.  is the bass controlled? yes.  is the bass 'boomy?'  NO THANK GOODNESS.<br /><br />However, there is not any 'polishing' of the music, and unless you EQ each disc, in conjunction with your equipment, i don't think you will enjoy long listening periods with these.  You will soon hear things that will drive you crazy.  They are AWESOME for teaching your ears to discern different mixes, frequencies and flavors of the disc, but it will soon wear you out.  GREAT for reference, for mixing, for analysis, not very enjoyable at all for relaxed listening.  Know the purpose you have for your headphones before you purchase these.
0545425115|5.0|This book is very enjoyable to read. You can't put it down once you have started. It is a teen book nonetheless, but very entertaining!
B005LAII12|1.0|If you were to take a black marker and draw fake eyebrows on your toes, they would be more high brow than this movie.<br /><br />Perhaps this is funny if you are prepubescent (or close to that age), but as an adult, I have no idea how anyone could suffer through this movie in its entirety.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is the bomb. at first I thought it was going to be exactly like temple run(the first one,) but it isn't. it's almost like it's an entirely new game.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I love this CD.  The music is just wonderful and I love the voices of the cast.  I have heard other people complain that they didnt like some of the cast's voices but I love the realism and I think they all sang wonderfully.  I especially love the harmonizing.  All in all it is wonderful and I play it everyday as I am working on the computer.  Cant wait til the movie comes out on dvd.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|Great story about who owns your creativity and why the creative work. The black and white photography in this film is just wonderful, not to mention the really great Frank Lloyd Wright like architecture.
1933952806|5.0|I had four books on the Nikon d90 by well known authors, and Darrell Youngs book was the one I always turned to. No excess junk just to fill pages. I now own a Nikon D7000 and my first purchase was his book &#34;Mastering the Nikon D7000&#34; It gives you exactly what you want with easy to understand examples and best settings. I belong to a camera club and have recommended his books to the members.
030745455X|5.0|I can't put down this book. You just want to read it from cover to cover in one sitting. This is one of the most entertaining and intense book I have read
B00A2BTCM4|4.0|Just listened to the new 2112 5.1 mix It was great. But not as good as it could have been. The guy who mixed it didn't really do what I call a great job. He kind of phoned it in. There's some good moments but for the majority, all he did was put all the music in the mains and then put it in the front and backs again with a little delay so it opens it up and spreads it out. It sounds real nice, but it's not dynamic enough for my taste. In my opinion, the big guitar riffs should come blasting out of the front speaker and slap you in the face! And the little guitar or drum fills should be sneaking out of the back at you. And the vocals should MOSTLY be out of the front. There's a little bit of that, but almost none.<br /><br />In the meantime, getting to hear one of my very favorite pieces of music in a brand new way for the first time after listening to it religiously for 35 years is, well... a religious experience! Certainly worth adding to your collection if you love Rush.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Must have<br />I really recommend this to everyone who loves a good hidden object slash adventure game the only I don't like is being forced to write a long drawn out reveiw but if u do u get a sequel for frees so they say anyway I guess ill find out soon enough enjoy
B002ZG999U|3.0|Bought for husband who was a little disappointed in it.  He wanted to see it before going to see the second version that was coming out at the movies.  He said he's glad he didn't pay to see it at the movies.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Item is quality made. Kindle goes to sleep when closed. Holds kindle in good postion for viewing. Give the tablet great protection.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is awesome! I no longer have to wait till I get home on my computer to get sucked into Pinterest, I can do it anywhere now!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It seems accurate and us the first thing you see after charging. Install this and you always know where you are batterywise.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a fun read for a free weekend!  I enjoyed reading the interactions between the main characters, and how he re-evaluated his motivations for keeping the marriage.  I highly recommend it, especially as a free download!
B00111YM5G|3.0|The premise behind the story isn't bad. Actors aren't too bad either.  The setting is nice and dark and gritty, but the demons are a little comical.  Over all I wasn't expecting something grand and amazing so it was an ok movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game I have played in a long time it is worth every thought never have second thoughts
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was interesting. Main character is annoying at times but you also understand it at the end. Not bad
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Loved the 1st Matrix, could do without the others, all in all good deal for px. I would recommend to friend.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good book. Def couldn't put it down. Recommend it to anyone especially if they don't like to read very easy to read
B00B0NDQPC|5.0|She would've been a household name. This is a collection of talent showcase material from said period. I prefer her bluegrass songs,but that is the genre that hits my heart. If you like this period music,you'll love this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cool game. wish the horses were cheaper. and could buy more with coins. but is a pretty cool game.  and they should add more things to buy.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love love love temple run but now they came out with temple run two I screamed and downloaded it ......BUT it does have problems it will not let me do something but the rest love it
B000001FS6|5.0|The live brings you more energy from the band. Has a great range of songs from their career- recommend it
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Same as title, wish I had a 3D tv to watch the 3D version. Good purchase to add to collection of other Marvel Movies. I got it on sale for like 26, so no complaints on price for what I received.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I totally get both sides of this issues of this couple. For Megan my father was her mother in the marriage department & where I can't relate to a sperm donor I always knew I would adopt since age 13. Then, there is Connor's side. I totally understand wanting to maintain a controled environment in order not to get hurt anymore emotionally. He never wanted to fall in love are a mate to fall in love with him. Not to far off there to my thinking my poor boyfriend was almost walking down the aisle with me before I could say those three little words. So, this book go through many different humours stages of this non relationship of an almost marriage. Megan & Connor find out things about themselves that surprise even them. I totally recommend this book. It is very enlightening to see there is more to love & marriage then I do.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run just got better! I love the ziplines and stimulations added. and still as always was, the graphics are impeccable! Must have! Will reccomend to a friend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|DOES WHAT IT SAYS.<br />EASY TO USE. EASY TO SEE. BIG NUMBERS. EASY TOUCH SCREEN.<br />WOULD RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND
B0065CCM76|3.0|Another compilation of Seger material that falls short. I am, by no means, a Seger fanatic. But I did own a radio in the 70's and 80's. And there's a lot missing from this set. But first, let's look at the positive.<br /><br />GOOD NEWS:<br />The remastering of these tracks is startling in it's crispness and clarity. Excellent work on that, for sure! The sound quality on GH1 (1994) was much inferior to GH2 (2003). This collection addresses that annoying discrepancy once and for all. There are great songs left off other collections which are present here (\\"Travelin' Man/Beautiful Loser\\" [Live]), and the new tracks are actually hits. And finally, this is the best Seger collection available. It has what most casual fans will want.<br /><br />BAD NEWS:<br />This really could've been \\"Ultimate\\" but here's why it's not. Both disks have only 13 tracks each (both of which clock in at well under an hour). Given this fact, the omission of numerous big hits is unforgivable: \\"Even Now\\" (1983) hit #12 on the charts; \\"Understanding\\" (1984) #17; \\"American Storm\\" (1986) #13; \\"The Real Love\\" (1991) #24. There's plenty of room for these songs and more. Having MULTIPLE Top 30 hits missing from the \\"Ultimate\\" collection is entirely unacceptable! Then there's the matter of radio staples that didn't chart which are also left out\\" \\"Feel Like A Number\\" [Live] (1981). These songs (with the exception of \\"Understanding\\") either aren't available for download and/or haven't been remastered. I would have gladly paid more for a more complete package.<br /><br />In the end, this 2CD set is still the best thing going until something better comes along.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|it is so awesome it is free too. I love it. it is so awesome it is free too. I love it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The first combination options of sounds is relaxing; great to induce sleep.  I offer the rain, wind, and thunder.  You can choose your preferred sounds.
0061992860|5.0|If you want to enlighten yourself with the ways and tactics of survival; For most of any type of situation that you may find yourself in, and that of others who may be alongside with you?<br /><br />Then this small portable book (slightly moisture proof quality pages) is for you!! The information, easy layout, clear simple instructions and pictures undoubtedly gets 5 stars!!<br /><br />Someone once told me: \\"Share your knowledge...For it is the only way to live forever\\"!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I'll just say this.  The end of the book is thought provoking and packs one heck of an emotional punch, at least for me it did.  I almost quit reading this book at around page 100 but determined to keep going finally at page 126 things took off.  The reason I almost quit reading was because a part of the story just stops progressing forward and time and is about PI discovering all types of religion and the writer expounds on what makes each religion soooooo great but different from others.  BLAH BLAH if I wanted to study religion I would of bought a text book.  Even though I had to suffer through about 60 pages of BLAH BLAH when the writer finally gets to the story I bought the book for the book took off.  Even at this point I was ready to give this book 3 stars until I got near the end and was blown away.  It took me about 2 hours to get the book out of my head.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|An incomparable pairing Rankin and Rebus. Keep him working,please Mr Rankin.<br />He is Scotland's greatest export-perhaps a wee drop ahead of the whisky...Nah that canna be true!
0446554995|5.0|Excellant follow-up to the Pendergast series.  I read &#34;Cold Vengence,&#34; and this back to back.  It made for a wonderful reading experience.
160774273X|5.0|This book is great about the true craft of Artisan bread making.  It is amazing how exacting the authors approach is. It is almost more of a science experiment. You alter anything like time, temp of water, more or less yeast, rising time etc and the bread takes on a completely new characteristic. This is a real education about how each ingredient interacts. Having said this I will also admit that some of the recipes take quite a lot of preparation.  However if making the best bread is your goal, this is the place to start.<br />I have bought 4 copies of this book and gave as gifts to friends and family- of course one gift to myself.  Really a great book!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I liked the pace of the book and having the story unravel through the eyes of each character. Also the way the story meshed past and present recollection was very well done. It made me want to keep reading chapter after chapter to see the next character's perspective. Additionally, the language used was appropriate for the characters personalities, background and age. Much unlike the prudish, almost juvenile language used in the fifty shades books. I love authors who aren't afraid to use the language a certain character would actually use.<br /><br />The reason for four and not five stars is that I didn't like the way the book wrapped things up with a couple of the characters.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|it's nice to have this collection just in case one of your friends haven't had the opportunity to see one of the 3.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|My son was so excited to get this for Christmas.  Packaging was very secure and arrived right on time!!!  Excellent!!!

B0058BI864|5.0|I bought 3 seasons of the big bang theory months ago and havent been able to watch them all as of today 01/30/13 - why because Amazon has a terrible stteaming server. I will NEVER buy a seriers from Amazon on line again. If Amazons wants happy customers they need to step up.<br /><br />THe seriers is great - Amazon SUCKS
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love this game it is awesome lol at animations weird all over again<br />love this game a lot  SOOO so so should get it
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Sweet, hot, and completely amazing!!! Great book! Well written and has a great story line. Great book for the beach.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game too much. I should be reading more and. Playing less. I like the way the cards move to where they are going to by the touch of a finger. If you like solitary, you will like this game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It's better and more challenging than Temple Run 1. As soon as I saw it on the app store I downloaded it and play It more than any other game on my Kindle Fire. I vote you get it...love Temple Run 2
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|What a production! The best I've seen and I've seen it live. I've never seen a musical this grandiose as far as set, costume, makeup, props, talent, etc. Great casting of the Phantom and Christine (Ramin Karimloo & Sierra Boggess). They really bring new life to the score. Bravissima!! If you like this, I recommend you watch the sequel too, Love Never Dies with Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne. Also an amazing production, smaller, completely different tone but also a talented cast. This 25th anniversary is any musical fan's dream come true. Buy it.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|I knew the big twist in the movie going in to it thanks to the TV show but it was still enjoyable. Even knowing what was going to happen I still felt a lot of anticipation about what was going to happen next. There are a few moments that are a little hard to believe that they had a camera right there right then but if it's not real it's at least really convincing. Considering renting it on here was less than a dollar different than renting it from Redbox and I don't have to pick it up/return it I'd say it was worth the rental, I probably wouldn't have bought it.
B004DM0UII|4.0|This app is probably really great if I would give it a chance. I'm partial to the I heart radio app! But this gives you a HUGE ARRAY of radio stations with any kind of music you like. I'm satisfied this far, although it does buffer a lot more that I heart Radio. I use the Samsung Galaxy Note.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is a great app! i play this sometimes. its even better on my kindle! Great for when i'm bored 2
B00ARN0XGG|3.0|I love the PA movies and have watched the previous 3 repeatedly so I wasted no time in seeing this one.  After watching it, I decided to do a review which is something I don't normally do even if I think a movie is great.  I gave the movie 3 stars not because it is a 3 star movie (its really not) but because I am hoping that the payoff will come in PA5. In a way one might consider this movie to be an hour and a half long prelude to the next film (I hope). PA4 itself is a slow moving movie with very few scares, a fact that is validated by the sheer number of reviews who have said the same thing.  The few scares there are are old hat, no new ground and the Xbox is really just annoying, an updated baby podwer. What this movie does have is a lot of exposition and even more unanswered questions.  It is the unanswered questions that makes this movie feel like the prelude to a much more interesting and intense movie.<br />(Spoliers ahead)...<br />If PA5 can successful answer questions like what happened to Robbie, how did Wyatt/Hunter end up in what seems to be a completely random family instead of with his Aunt Katie, was Alex's levitation an important future story plot or a cheap effect with no value to the movie, and several others, then PA4 might be redeemed as being an important (albeit slow and boring) installment to the franchise.  But we will have to wait until PA5 to know which way it will go.  If your a hugh PA fan then go ahead and rent the movie but whither your a hardcore fan or just a casual viewer, I would hold off on actually buying the movie until 5 comes out and we see if 4 pays off or if it marks the decline of this movie franchise.  Fingers crossed for the former.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to play. No problems. Lots of fun. This is a great game for all ages. And the price is right!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|BEST GAME EVER U NEED TO GET THIS!!! PLIS ITS FREE AS IN NO MONEY NEEDED!!!! GET IT! GET IT! GET IT!
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Good plot, presenting another leg of black ops.  Nice tie-in to the previous trilogy.  Made me think twice about whether one could be truly isolated, living in a mountain home.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I'm teaching students how to improve video shot on an iPhone, and am using this inexpensive mic as one of my tools.  Sounds great.<br /><br />My only complaint is there is no low battery warning light-- so you either must change batteries before an important interview or take your chances.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love this app! I love that it has the audio, because when i can't sit and read, i can put the audio on and listen to the word of God! But i don't like that i have to be under wifi to use it :(
B005EWDA9M|5.0|It's a very nice reading. I love the metaphors when the author describes the characters thoughts and feelings. I can't wait to read the 3th book.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I love everything Joe Bonamassa does. Song structure, melody and meticulous guitar playing. He will only get better with time.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I read about this book on a science fiction blog, an I thought ig might be SF or Fantasy. Insted it is a wonderfully realistic, thoroughly modern book.<br />It is about a man and how he deals with life and it's problems and how important friendships are in life.<br />My wife and I both loved it, so will you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As an Amazon Prime member I enjoy instant videos via our Roku system and the entertaining Walking Dead series is one such example.  Watch on your time schedule and spend $2 an episode (much cheaper than a night out at the movies and not too far from the kids and their babysitter if something goes wrong).
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Nice upgrade fom the original release. Better graphics and much improved gameplay. If you liked Temple Run then don't delay, get this app.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|i chose this rating because i want to be able to stream and watch videos, but  i don't no how to completley use it yet, the first thing i got was instruction to use it but i don't know where to go from there. pleas help?

B008SOS63S|5.0|one of the best blues and rock guitarist players that I have heard recently. You can hear the influences of Eric Johnson and Joe Satriani, among others, in his playing. A good thing, i think!
1616550414|5.0|There is just too much good here to even begin to write a review, it would be like writing a book.  Simply amazing book that is a must by for a fan period.[[ASIN:1616550414 The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia]]
B005RUUUAI|5.0|If you have not yet seen this program, and have any affinity for sci-fi mixed with gratuitous zombie, give it a watch but start with Season 1.  The very first episode draws you in quickly with the &#34;wow, what would I do in that same situation&#34; and &#34;wouldn't that be freaky&#34; kind of feel.  My husband and I love the program and adore the option to download episodes on our own schedule, for $2 each, immediately to our TV, via our Amazon Prime membership.  Very cool option for busy parents - just lock your door while you watch so that kiddos don't see zombie action.
B0076DELIG|4.0|If you read any of them, you'd have to read this one.  The relationship with his teenage daughter helps round out his character and the story.  The Past story mixing with the present was great and well done. A little bit of Cops in LA and a little bit of Iraq made for a good read.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I've watched it dozens of times over the years and never get tired of it.<br />The comments about the &#34;evil corporations&#34; just crack me up.<br />I know it is supposed to be a serious moment but you just have to suspend logic and reason and enjoy.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This is a fun game.  Sometimes it's hard to put it down!  It's quickly becoming a game we have to limit or not do close to bed time.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Can't get enough of Joe Satriani's guitar playing. This album has more of the same of what to expect from a newer production. Add it to your collection.
1577312082|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's delivery of the subject matter speaks volumes about the clarity of thought and insight his teachings offer.  He expresses his thoughts clearly, and therefore credibly.  He tells us in some respects what we already know, at least intuitively; and in so doing he helps us understand that the journey to inner peace is self realization, not in the pursuit of the material things or status.
B000C20VRS|5.0|Great Price for the one and only collectors edition copy of Scarface, has all the bonuses extras that made this a worthwhile purchase
159514188X|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher is a novel exploring the emotional issues that many young adults of the day are dealing with in either their own personal life or the life of someone around them. Asher writes a compelling story about a teenage boy, Clay, whose high school acquaintance, co-worker, and crush, Hannah, has committed suicide. A few weeks after Hannah's suicide Clay receives tapes that tell him the thirteen reasons why Hannah decided to take her own life. Hannah narrates these reasons throughout the story. Asher's tale follows Clay as he listens to Hannah's reasons why.<br />The reasons that Hannah discusses on her tapes are viable in the lives of all young adults living in today's world. This novel explores the rumors, sexual desire and promiscuity, illegal alcohol and drug use, and life's social experiences. Reading about these experiences in Hannah's life can help all to relate and hopefully learn how to cope and help someone who is going through similar experiences as Hannah was experiencing. It brings these experiences close to the young adult reader and also the adult reader.<br />While the things written about in this novel are extremely hard to read about and can be uncomfortable to some readers, Asher presents them in a tasteful manner in which all readers can read and learn about in a non-explicit way. This lends the ability to read this novel to a younger audience, although I wouldn't recommend it to anyone younger than fourteen. The material that could be considered explicit is presented in such a manner that the reader must come to a personal conclusion about what happens. The material is not \\"in your face\\" in any manner.<br />The writing of this novel also sucks the reader in and leaves them wanting more when they have to put the book down.  When reading this novel I sat down, and even though I had other things I needed to do, I couldn't put it down. The reader will get involved with both the characters of Clay and Hannah because you worryright alongside with Clay and you yearn to help Hannah and steer her away from her suicidal ideas. The writing develops the characters in a believable manner and helps the reader to care about these characters immediately.<br />I absolutely recommend this book to everyone and I thank Jay Asher for writing and sharing this wonderful story.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I expected Lawless to the a well done, if violent, police/crime drama. Something like &#34;The Untouchables&#34; in Virginia. That it was.However, it was also a beautiful depiction or rural Virginia in the 1930s (Jim Crow and all). The movie didn't flinch from the hardscrabble life of the folks living their back then or the violence and corruption.<br /><br />Highly recommended with exactly acting performances all round. It even has the lovely Jessica Chastain before she rose to super stardom in Zero Dark Thirty. Mia Wasikowska portrayal of Bertha Minnix is also worthy of note.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is a must see. I've watched it 7 times already. If you like good music and an intelligent story line you'll love this movie. Rebel Wilson is the one to watch in this one, the Aussie actress really brings the comedy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|when temple run 1 came out I didn't really like it but this one make me love temple run even though you have to move your device. I like because its not the same thing every time you run.
B0026P3G12|5.0|love her voice and enjoy listeneing to her first albumn and will buy other as well to go in my collection
B001H5X7JS|1.0|first copy i received was loose in case, swapped it for another, the replacement was also loose and scratched up
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I was having problems with it, so I deleted it. When I went to re- install it, it didn't work. Stupid app...
B00AIBZM40|4.0|This movie kept you engrossed from the start and held you after one surprise or scare after another......very well done. : gripping in a word would do it. Chastain's character was hard to warm up to but ....... well I don't want to spoil it for you.  The male lead was dismal at acting but after all, he wasn't the pivotal character.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Loved every minute. It is a very good book to read. It holds your attention but leaves you wanting more!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Which says a lot! Good show, rented it and. Decided it was just one of those shows I had to have.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I enjoy playing with this. I have the free version and it passes the time away when I need something do.
B000UJ48VI|1.0|This DVD came in the case cracked. Therefor it was unwatchable.<br />I needed this movie for a film and literature paper and I ended up having to rent it via iTunes.
B0082PQ93C|5.0|This is an engrossing book. It is like watching a train wreck...you can't put it down! Obviously the author put countless hours into her effort.
1616550414|5.0|Excellent book! I now know more about Legend of Zelda than I ever have and I do not consider that a waste of knowledge! It really serves to show just how brilliant the series is, especially the timeline. Very awesome. One of the corners got little damaged in shipping despite it being shrink wrapped, but still a great book and great price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played. I do have to say that the computer version is a little better than this version
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I resisted reading this series for some time, and finally succumbed!  It is a pretty far fetched story, but is a riveting story
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is such a great way to get creative ideas... It also can be a former motivator!! Endless amount of hours could be spent on pintrest!! Lots of fun!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the dementionality and three-D effects this game gives you is a total adrenaline rush that you will really enjoy over and over
193609648X|5.0|Absolutelly wonderful book. I liked it very much. Beautiful yarns and colors, patterns and explanations very goods too. Great book for crochet lovers
B0081KTI0E|2.0|There's nothing I love more than a good horror story. This wasn't it. They rely on jump scare tactics rather than good story telling. The performances are good, and it looked good, but the plot is weak and predictable.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Loved it but let Down by the ending..... Kept my attention though. I couldn't wait to read every night until I figured it out.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|I saw the film first, and felt that I only got half the story, when I read the book I got a lot more out of it.
6305603847|5.0|Loved it was what i wanted, good quality and a psychedelic movie that told the story of the life of a boy growing up
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. I got it for my grandkids but found out me and my husband enjoy it to
B002VWNIDG|5.0|My son wanted to watch this and we couldn't find it.  So I bought it.  Good movie, but they could have left some parts out.<br />Great condition.
B0047WJ12K|1.0|the streaming seemed to be a problem the music and background sounds drowned out the voices so we could not hear what they were saying over 80% of the time sooo basically missed the whole movie...... will have to get it from netflix and try again.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The US dvd has the special episode. However, it is not called the Christmas special. It is called \\"A Journey to the Highlands.\\" The episode is very important and not to be missed!
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|A far fetched and very fast moving story, which holds one attention right to the end, and one looks forward to reading the next one
B002KSA41U|5.0|Since I did not notice that these DVDs are not the right &#34;zone&#34; for playing in the US I had to buy a DVD player that would play them.  After I got that the DVDs play and I love them and my nieces and nephews, it Dr Who fans, love them too.  Good price for a quality item.
B008EK91XU|5.0|Fantastically written book; great insight to the life of an amazing athlete and true global citizen. A must read if you like swimming and one of its most successful athletes.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Awesome story line, easy to read, kept you guessing, will read other Jodi Picoult books in future. Great characters too.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I love that it helps with your eye and hand coordination.  I love that it has difficulty levels.  I don't normally play games on my Kindle Fire, but this is one great exception.
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|nice size nice weight good watch accurate easy to use the problem is the wirst tape but it doesn t matter
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I thought this would be amazing but I was wrong I downloaded it on my kindle fire and now it wont even go to the menu screen I am definatly uninstalling it
B008NW67IQ|5.0|Got this CD for my niece for Christmas.  It was a good price, was well packaged, and arrived promptly.  She loves it.  Thanks!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|it did not download to my cellphone,i can't find it. only place it it listed at is in my account orders
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is really the best game ever.I personally like the first one more,but this game is still really cool.there's alot more powerups witch is cool.I also have to say the graphics are amazing.the only part I don't like is the fact they don't give you all the characters from the original.fix that it would be a five star game
B0036OS3N8|4.0|I always take a size 10 but I read the reviews and it was suggested to go up one size. I am glad that I did as size 11 fit perfectly (and they dont look huge on your feet either).<br /><br />We were up in Tahoe for two days and these worked perfectly. They were waterproof and my feet were warm.
B001OKCT2M|5.0|This movie is a surprise for it campy wit. I has action and adventure plus it's just plain fun.  Wesley Snipes is hillarious and this is one of the first places where you will see Sandra Bullock.  If you are expecting Rambo, you won't like this one.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|I got this as the FAOTD &amp; have really enjoyed it.  I had very little trouble figuring out what to do &amp; the instructions provided were good enough for me.  It's not rocket science!  The difficulty does increase as you beat the levels &amp; there are added interferences to make you have to think.<br /><br />Basically you have a maze of walls, a mouse, &amp; cheese.  The cheese gives off an aroma so you must drag that aroma from the cheese to the mouse through the maze so the mouse can safely follow it to the cheese.  If you hit a wall an exclamation point will appear at that point.  If you don't drag the aroma all the way to the mouse he were won't move when you hit play.  There is a bar at the bottom of the screen that shows how much aroma you have used &amp; have left.  The less you use the more stars you earn.  If you make a mistake you can slide the bar back &amp; forth to easily fix it.  There is a squiggly icon that when it's white you can press it, then drag along the aroma to make the mouse move faster in those areas which will be red.  Then the left side is the play button for whenever you are ready.<br /><br />As you progress there are doors that open/close with a button in the maze that you can guide the mouse over.  Also, there sometimes is a rat that can kill you that follows the walls it hits usually but if it crosses paths with the aroma it will follow it.  Sometimes you get cats &amp;/or a dog.  If you get too closeto the cat it wakes up &amp; tries following you.  2 cats can jump at the same time &amp; hit each other &amp; die.  Dogs will bark at the cat when it gets close enough &amp; freezes the cat.  You have to work with everything you have.<br /><br />I really have been enjoying this game.  I stop playing &amp; come back to it.  I like that it's difficult enough to have to put it down &amp; come back to it but not too difficult to not figure it out when I come back!
B00AU2B0DE|1.0|David Cassidy,bobby Sherman and Michael Jackson would have found out where this no musical talent recorded this junk. then they  would have promptly shoved the microphone down Justin B's throat.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I so love these guys.  Everything they do is so authentic, it would be easy to believe they were born in Appalachia like the style of music they play and sing.  England is not so far away as it may seem, after all.  It just doesn't get any better.  If you don't have this one yet, by all means, don't wait another minute to run out and pick it up - or order it here, of course!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game because it is fun and challenging.<br />the more you play this game the better you will get!
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Just a fun, feel good movie.  Plot is mostly predictable, but the characters are fun and engaging. Go for it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great and more realistic than others. And it's not like most free games. It's the best horse game I have!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|What a great ending to the trilogy.  I still think this is not only the best Batman ever made, but should have been nominated for an Oscar.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|It had lots of action and special effects.  I like Sci-fi movies but I think that the original with Arnold S was better.
B00B19F3PG|4.0|It wasn't the best horror movie but didn't drag on and wasn't too cheesy! I recommend it if you like supernatural movies!
B008220AVW|5.0|This was a great movie. Shows hard work pays off! It's nice to see that people still work hard to achieve their dreams and are humbled when they do.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was my first Flynn novel.  Excellent character development and I especially enjoyed the format whereby each chapter was alternately written from each main character's viewpoint.  The twists were expertly presented. Unfortunately, the ending was a huge let down.  Overall, I would highly recommend Gone Girl and plan to read another Flynn novel soon.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Fantastic rollercoaster of a game can't wait for the follow up! Beautiful graphics exciting puzzles! One of the best hidden object games I have ever played!
0439023521|5.0|This was a great book. I originally did not think I would get into this book or the series like I did. I have now read this book twice.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|this case is perfect and come's in my favorite color<br />and protect my iphone is the best order  for my
0345803493|5.0|After reading the first one, of course I had to read the second.  Still kept my attention and was glad I read it.
B003K15IF8|4.0|This is a well-written, intelligent book for intelligent readers who are interested in the life of the mind, the world of academe, and the workings of the human mind. It is an interesting portrait of a man, a period in American history, a place, and the way  time, place, and circumstances affect human behavior. It gives a revealing insight into academic life and politics, at times amusing, at others frightening. The depth of knowledge revealed by the writer of the academic subject which is the area in which his chief protagonist specializes is impressive.
B003IWYOF4|5.0|This is one of the best John Hughes Film ever made in the 80's. it is about a group of kids who are as diffrent as can be but by the end become friends. And I just love it on blu-Ray. The color is great and sound is wonderful. If you haven't seen this movie then I have to say go for it. It reminds us of how school was back in the 80's. And how diffrent people can get along if they wanted to. So Go for it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you want to feel like you've REALLY worked out but only have 30 minutes to spare...buy this. You won't regret it. At first the exercises seem simple and like a breeze...and then you keep doing them and realize that they're harder than they look! By the end of the first work-out I was exhausted and feeling GREAT. It's really all you could want from a workout DVD -- try it; you'll love it.
B008S80P38|5.0|This album is amazing.  Deadmau5 shows excellent technical precision.  The album gets better with every listen.  I go from wondering why there is a collaboration with Wolfgang Gartner to thinking that it's a perfect fit.<br /><br />It's great to see that this album builds off of previous albums in the sense that there is a classic Deadmau5 sound to some of the tracks, while others seem to employ new tricks while somehow avoiding the all-too-common foray into dubstep, big drops, etc.  Classic Deadmau5 with the long builds, but build never seems too distant like it sometimes has in the past - which can happen quite easily when you're working with songs frequently extending past the 6 minute mark.<br /><br />I could keep raving about this album, but just go buy it.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|My heart was in my mouth at the introduction to this book and without giving anything away I also had tears in my eyes when Patricia McConnell called the dogs' owner the next day. This is an insightful, moving and warm book. One that will touch your heart and deepen your understanding and appreciation of your four legged friend. Who knew that every time he looked at me with that confused, quizzical expression that I love so much, that he really was confused because the signals I was sending him were crossing all over the place.
0345803507|5.0|I read all three of these books in about three days.  I was obsessed to find out how it all ended.  I was glad I read them all, but I wasn't impressed with the writing.  The story was totally not believable, but that's not why I read books to begin with!  Entertaining for sure.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|i would recommed it and it arrive when said and arrive in good shape and on time and good shape
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|We enjoyed this movie. The kiddos and I watched this for movie night.  There were a few parts, though, that were a little intense for my bunch.  But overall, if you don't mind a movie that is a little dark, you will enjoy it too.
1449410243|5.0|Its title should tell you that this book is not to be taken seriously.  While I'm not a fan of some of the references, over all, it accomplished its goal:  it made me laugh.  In several occasions, I actually laughed out loud.  I'll happily give this as a gift to my fellow crazy cat lady friends.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I really disliked this album at first.  It seemed slow and dull.  Maybe I wasn't ready for the sound, but I'm glad I gave this album a second (and third and fourth and etc.) listen a few days later.  There are some standout tracks, but no tracks really seem to diminish the quality of other tracks.  Great voice.  Highly recommended.
B00000F214|5.0|Came quickly in the mail. This is a great movie with a great plot and ending. Must see movie if you never seen it before.
0345803485|5.0|What's not to love?  This was a great read.  The writing isn't great, but it defnitely kept my attention.  Not realistic in the least, but that's not why I read books!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|An amazing game great graphics so much better than the first one if you like games that are addicting you shoud definatly get this you will play it 24/7 there are splines rivers and some new characters to unlock awesome game you should totally get this game AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING CANT SAY IT ANOUGH
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|this movie was a pretty decent movie.  Not totally what i expected based on growing up with the smurfs, but still decent.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is fun because of the games and seeing all the pictures of family and friends..It is easy to keep in touch with old friends.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game but the onley thing i whould change is the should tell you how manny more  coins yoj need to get a serten item.plees change.
B009U9S6FI|3.0|I liked the first part of the book describing some of the author's experience in the WWII concentration camps. It would have been good if that same topic continued throughout. The textbook in the second half reminded me of my college career. Not pleasureable reading, but having the author's philosophy spoon fed with the expectation that it will be digested and accepted. In my retirement, I am not interested in scholarly philosophies, I read for curiosity and self-fulfilment.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I read the first book before I watched the first season.  I will say that I was glad to watch because the books can become very overwhelming and full of sooooo much information.  It was nice to see it on screen to fill in some of the gaps!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was hesitant to read this because I don't like \\"scary\\" or creepy stuff but this book is nothing like I imagined. It was absolutely amazing. I couldn't put it down once I started and read late into the night and finished the book in 4 days. Great read!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|and this was a great kids movie too.  very entertaining and we adults even enjoyed this movie.  we watch it often
1932100385|5.0|This is a stupendous, scientific book that every doctor should be aware of and apply to their practice.  If they did it would change, for the better, the face of modern American medicine in both style and substance. This study proves that what we eat determines the health of our body. We are what we eat.  Eat well (plant-based) and you'll be free of disease. Eat the typical/normal/usual American diet and your life will be plagued with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, etc., etc.  The book is easily read by any adult looking for the science to change their eating habits for the better.  I also recommend you watch the Forks Over Knives DVD and read the Forks Over Knives book and Cookbook, as well as Dr. Caldwell B Esselstyn's Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease.  They all go hand-in-hand to help people change their lives for the better through food.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My son was so excited to get this Lego.  We received it very quickly.  He spent days building it.  It was a great way for him to stay busy.  He plays with it every day.

B005NFW0U0|5.0|What can I say?  I'm a teenager at heart.  I'm almost 40 and love this show!  It's really well written and I hope to see many more seasons to come!
B002BJGYV2|5.0|This transaction was very easy. I had been looking for this dvd set and bought the product right away when I saw it. After I bought it, only a few hours later it had already been shipped. I received the shipment only a few days later, and the product was in perfect shape, just like described. I have already finished watching this series and can't wait to buy the next one. Very happy with the overall product.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|My kids love this movie!  It was a treat to watch.  I would highly recommend this for mid age children.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|THis is a pretty good game.  Ijustgotit a few days ago so Im still figuring everything out.  Iawish it had more mini games
0425263916|5.0|The development of the characters is great and kept me turning the pages. Can't wait for the next in the series.
0345803493|5.0|Have not finished this book yet, so far, so good.  So far it has followed the story very well and we will have to see.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read these when they were all the buzz.  This is a great series to read.  Very entertaining and totally kept my attention.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love temple run 2. this remindes me of it. very. so if you like temple run 2. buy this game!!!
1593272774|4.0|this was neat for my 11 year old nephew and he loves legos and reading so it was a perfect gift for that age
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing. I loved every page! From the very beginning you are hooked! I'm starting book two now.
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|great DVD of George's music, have to love this man and his music and his talented gift he shares with the world
B000HEWEJO|5.0|one of my favorite holiday movies. It never gets old. I bought this one for my son and his soon to be wife along with some starter items to start their own traditions and memories. She loved it all.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I put this on my tablet, and it's great. It lets you set timers for when it goes off, etc., and it adds just that little bit of noise to help you get to sleep.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|All the episodes from the first 2 seasons are on this set, including Christmas.  This is a nice collector set.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|my kids loved the movie and it was nice for adults to be able to see the muppets come back again.
B005KELW26|5.0|Was shipped in a reasonable time.<br />Great Quality<br />Would purchase again!!<br />Would recommend this product and this buyer to someone else!!<br />Thanks!!
B008F5QQI2|5.0|of course this is going to be a great listen, can George do any wrong (besides the public issues) his music is always great
B009VSW15Y|5.0|love the camera. great pics and easy to use. gave up a heavy camera with individual lenses for this one.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a great intro to all of the big Marvel heroes. I can sit down and enjoy watching this with my wife, my friends, or my 3 year old nephew. There are a few instances that make my mind scream &#34;BS&#34; but the point of a movie like this is to shut down your preconceived notions of what is possible and what isn't. If you are able to do that, this is a fantastic viewing - if not as a conclusion to several previous movies, then as a prequel to IronMan 3.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Having a Ball with this version! Really keeps you on your toes ziplining and rolling thru the mines: trying to get a little further each time!
B007JRU2UK|5.0|George or no George, This was a great movie but he made it even better.  Keeps you interested.  Watch it!
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|I hate it, hate it, hate it.  The settings are too much and too confusing.  I just dont think the interface is nice at all.  The best RSS reader I have used is Newsrob but its not availble on the kindle.  Dont know why.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|FUNNY movie, great idea is this era of so many singing shows and the competition shows on the television, this was great
B008602KQI|5.0|like this one a lot. i have seen and heard alot about it already. Im sure it will be one I watch mroe than once.
B002RVCD0U|5.0|Let's face it, most action movies don't engage the viewer nearly enough nowadays. That's what I was expecting with yet another Terminator movie. I was caught off guard in a great way with the fluid plot line decent acting and plenty of not so over the top action sequences. During all of the mess, you never really lose sight of what's going on, the story is allowed to progress without sacrificing the story. Most plot holes are left filled to at least a casual observer, and the ending is open enough to continue the series. I'd be lying to say I'm not excited to see what they come up with next.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Fantastic Series.  Best since 24. Looking forward to completing Season1 and moving on to the 2nd season. I loved it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is the best game I have in a long time. Really like it there should be another Dragonvale game called Dragonvale 2 great and thanks
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I ordred this tape just before I went to hear them. Was such a good tape and love to hear their songs over and over. Great transaction with Amazon. Fast and efficient.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|She was truly an inspirational gift and this makes for a true listening enjoyment to keep listening to over and over
B005HJU7HA|5.0|another good read for rainy days. characters and story line were well written and held my attention all the way through.
B005LAII80|1.0|Awful thanks god I watched it for free using torrent on my nexus 7 and streaming it to my TV via WiFi. DA movie sucks bad a lot. I think it might have been DA worst movie I've ever seen . lifeless. Trust me.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Two weeks into it and we,my girl and I, are feeling better. We don't know how much weight we've lost, because were on a sailboat in the Bahamas. I'm thinking more clear and in a better frame of mind.<br /><br />Just remember  &#34;If your not living on THE EDGE your taking up to much space&#34;
B009YP9L7U|1.0|The plot was a little boring and predictable.  Not really my style.  I guess I just found out I dont like romance novels anymore!!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Different layout from any book I've read before.  Each \\"chapter\\" is a different account of the same war.  I particularly liked how the author covered, not only the front line part of the war, but different political aspects of it as well.<br />I am very curious to see how the book translates to the big screen.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Rihanna does shine bright like a diamond, bright like a diamond, bright like a diamond..... she is a great listen
B004J4WN0I|5.0|The characters in this book are very fun to read about and I really enjoy the surprise ending. Yeah go Atticus!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|all is I got to say is this game is fantastic but I'm sticking to the oringanl I think the first one is better
B00479SVBU|4.0|The first one didn't work.I contacted the company and they sent a replacement that works fine. I just wish that it would play all formats of music,not just MP3.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This is one of my favorites! I love creating crazy vehicles. The one problem is that it will not stop deleting from my kindle, it is ultra annoying! Fix this!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Action, intrigue, and adventure. Love and war. Characters to love and to loath. A richly detailed world to capture the imagination. A rip-roaring read leaves you longing for more ( luckily there is more!).
B0056FMNYA|5.0|I did review for this product for last 1 Month and finally i went to B&H and finally got it. Trust me...you will love it if u have one. I can tell that u can close ur eyes and trust this product. It has 2 secure lock where ur camera will be steady all the time, u can even jump with ur camera attach on this grip. Bottom line is just buy this product. Keep Clicking
B009MCRHH6|5.0|A really great way to spend time while learning new ways to form goo. A fantastic time waster. I love this game.
B000V86OKG|5.0|It was complete what i wanted and proving that Micheal C Hall is an excellent actor so yeah it rocks
B004U52VPS|4.0|I bought this for my brother for Christmas and he absolutely loved it!  He played with it nonstop for a couple of days.  The slingshot is rather hard to control, but for a young kid, it wasn't a big deal.  The pieces were nice and durable, and held up well.  Although the game can get a little old/boring after awhile, I still thought it was a nice idea.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well written, splendid actors, marvelous cinematography, complex but believable plots.  I am adding ten more words as you requested.  Can't believe this.
B0095R76EW|4.0|I found it to be very enjoyable and good movie to watch with girlfriend. Story line was witty and believable.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Incredible characters that we care about, amazing acting, and a great story that makes the fight scenes matter and us care about the people and who wins.
0060936223|5.0|I was born after this era and not have I wished that I was around this era. Best memories are described in this book but also it describes a great love story. So worth buying. U would not regret it
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I am a 59 year old woman and this is so refreshing from the same old stuff they have been putting out lately... Very impressed with his music writing ability! ... kinda sexy too... play it often.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Tearjerker but so well written!  Great crossover novel...definitely not just a teen novel.  Difficult if you've experience cancer as I have, but so many truisms.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|No complaints at all.A very cool, very challenging puzzle. The boy I bought this for is a bit on the young side for the &#34;Epic&#34;, but all in all as a product I have no complaints.
B003JBHQP4|5.0|Amazon produces a decent memory card reader at a great price.  I use this for casual file moving (mostly photos) and it works very well.  Windows recognizes it quickly.  I have not compared transfer speeds across various types of media but for casual use this product is a must.
0307352153|5.0|I received a copy of Quiet by Susan Cain for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review, as part of their \\"Blogging for Books\\" program.<br /><br />It was hard to read this entire book, because I wanted to give it a 5 star review after only reading the introduction.  It was that good, and both introverts and extroverts would benefit from reading it.<br /><br />I've known for a long time that I am an introvert, but I also felt as though there was something \\"wrong\\" about it.  This book educated me on various studies regarding introversion and extroversion, and convinced me that introversion is not only how I was made, but made me feel good about being made this way.  Being introverted is not something that anyone needs to apologize for.<br /><br />In Quiet, Cain writes about various studies conducted by psychologists along with examples of real-life people in order to understand introversion in our culture.  People range from Asian college students who have difficulty with the American bias toward extroversion to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt to Ghandi.  She explores introversion in academia, the church, and businesses.  She also gives some tips for parents who are raising introverted children.<br /><br />I don't think enough good things could be said about this book.  It should be a must-read for any introvert who wants to know themselves a bit better as well as any employer/manager who cares about his or her employees and wants to see them thrive.<br /><br />I'll leave you with a couple of quotations from the book:<br /><br />\\"Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man's world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are.\\" (Introduction, page 4)<br /><br />\\"Without introverts, the world would be devoid of:<br /><br />the theory of gravity<br />the theory of relativity<br />Yeats's 'The Second Coming'<br />Chopin's nocturnes<br />Proust's In Search of Lost Time<br />Peter Pan<br />Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm<br />The Cat in the Hat<br />Charlie Brown<br />Schindler's List, E.T., and Close Encounters of the Third Kind<br />Google<br />Harry Potter  (introduction, page 5)<br /><br />Perhaps, with this book, we can all understand each other a little better, and work better together to accomplish our purposes in this world.Eighty-Four and Animal Farm<br />The Cat in the Hat<br />Charlie Brown<br />Schindler's List, E.T., and Close Encounters of the Third Kind<br />Google<br />Harry Potter  (introduction, page 5)<br /><br />Perhaps, with this book, we can all understand each other a little better, and work better together to accomplish our purposes in this world.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|it freezes like crazy and the controls don't work as good.do not buy!!  its a hoax<br /> even though its free
B009I2UH2W|5.0|If you need a iPhone 5 charger this is the one. Nice and sturdy and fits well in the phone and power point in the car
B00178JDCK|5.0|Works well, has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options.  I would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb.
B002PSXR2S|5.0|Think of an older 'Lake Placid', but more enjoyable with Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward. A fun watch on a snowy day.
0345803485|4.0|The best part of this book is not actually the love (read sex) scenes!  It's the main characters inner dialogue.  I'm also a big fan of the email banter between the two characters.  This is a dark love story about flawed characters, I think that's why its got such a following!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|In Dr. Panda's Restaurant there are many fun things for your toddler to do, including invite animal guests to sit down at a table, prepare their food, feed it to them, and even clean up afterwards.  There are about a dozen different foods to prepare including fruit smoothies, apple pie, pizza, and more.  You get to chop vegetables, assemble the pizza toppings, stir the stew, etc.  My 3-year old son loves this game, I would recommend it (and the other Dr Panda apps) to anyone with small children.<br /><br />As far as the technical review goes - it works perfectly on our kindle fire, it never force closes or locks up, it fits just right on the screen, etc.  5/5 stars - great work TribePlay!
B005LAII08|5.0|The Quality was great and the Movie WONDERFUL.  I only played the Blu-Ray and used my PS3.  The movie did seem a bit short though.
B001MV49HG|5.0|I can't even put into words how incredible Oasis was and still is. You either get it or you don't. They were a remarkable balance of badass and sentiment. They were endearing musicians and people. They captured the spirit of youth in a way very few ever did or have since. The songs stand up over many years of listening. The melodies are brilliant and the lyrics simple and catchy while remaining creative.<br /><br />Simply put, they were the best.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I liked the action, the dark story line, the ruthlessness of the good and bad characters, and the plot line about the judgement of a new judge.  Very nice!
B001TH16DI|4.0|When Fire Fly was cancelled, Josh Whedon made the film Serenity to continue the story! Well, Star Trek did it first! Too bad they couldn't do that with Heroes or The Adventures of Brisco County Junior!<br /><br />This saga starts a decade after cancellation, but within the fictional time line it's just two and a half years after Kirk's five year mission! Unlike most fans, I like the motion picture! This AI called V'ger heads to earth to find its Creator! This set doesn't have the director's cut! Odd how they updated every episode including the unaired pilot, but they didn't decide to release the director's cut to match everything up! Hopefully the release of the newest film will inspire a release of the director's cut to honor Robert Wise's memory! Other blu rays suffer from this lack of director's cut: Army of Darkness, Lethal Weapon, The Punisher & Live Free or Die Hard!<br /><br />Wrath of Khan is a sequel to the episode Space Seed from season one! Like The Motion Picture, it's just the theatrical release!<br /><br />The Search For Spock & The Voyage Home are continuations to Wrath of Khan!<br /><br />The Final Frontier is my least favorite of this set, yet my least favorite Trek story of all is at the end of season two of next generation! Lots of clips!<br /><br />The Undiscovered Country is a great ending to this set and leaves it open for Encounter at Farpoint, which opens the first season of Next Generation! Unfortunately, there's no director's cut here either! If you like these films, but want the director's cut, it may be better to mix & match with DVD until they get it right!
B005XN3150|5.0|I was bored one night and thought I would give this series a try. It seemed rather 'childish,' but got great reviews.<br /><br />I am very glad I gave this show a try. It is 'childish' is a grownup way. The show is very well done. The characters are complex and the storyline is presented in a way that totally pulls you into the fantasy. Sometimes I hate dual storylines but this show totally pulls it off. The cinematography in StoryBook land is fantastic. The villainess is beautiful, wicked and has some amazing dresses. I hope to see more storybook characters in future episodes.<br /><br />If you like fantasy type stuff, give this one a try. I am so glad I did. Season 1 and ABC both definitely gets 5 stars for this series.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I'm a triathlete and running is the hard part of any race for me.  This book gave me a lot of insight into the mental part of running.  I also enjoyed the vegan recipes.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A typical Sparks book.  Easy read.  Good characters. Predictable plot.  Worth the time and money! I saw it has been made into a movie.  Good!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I thought this book had such value in its contents....we never really stop to appreciate the time we have and this book really reminds you to do so.
B006LSZECO|4.0|THIS MYSTERY STARTS WITH A BANG AND DOES NOT LET GO. IT IS FULL OF TWISTS AND TURNS,ALWAYS UNEXPECTED. I COULD NOT WAIT TO TURN THE PAGE TO SEE WHAT WAS COMING NEXT.!!!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Think outside the box with an obviously award-winning game with original artwork and game play. Work with (or against) gravity, wind and rain in this physics-based game. The puzzles sometimes present an enigma - how are you suppost to proceed? But 'The Sign Painter' leaves clues, and with a little imagination and experimentation, the solution become clear.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Clever in spots.  Entertaining and understanding of the outsider.  May buy if priced around ten dollars.<br />Not for very young children.
B00067BBSC|5.0|If you are a TOTO fan and don't have this. Your not a fan. I have bought 4 of these for other freinds of mine and they all love it. Good quality footage and sound!
1849904251|5.0|Extremely insightful in to the show and the inner workings of the characters themselves, including a good amount of their motivations. Fun and 'fangirl-squee-inducing,' I thoroughly recommend this book for any fan of the show.
0375812024|2.0|This book was not what I expected.  The book is very silly and unreal, nothing real about airports.  Also the quality was very poor as some pages were cut wrong and the pictures do not match.  Some of the writing is cut off on the bottom quarter of the print.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids think it's great. I've played it a few times too and would definitely say it's better then the first one. Graphics are better. Sometime it will through us out of the game though but other then that love it!
B007FJFDXS|5.0|More obstacles and mind-bending puzzles in the latest version of the excellent EDGE game. After a month of playing, this game is still entertaining. When you finish the higher levels, it's not easy to remember exactly how to get through the earlier puzzles a second time. Enjoy acrophobia as you look over the edge into the darkness of space.<br /><br />The game designers moved the tricky &#34;hover&#34; action to the bonus levels ('Remember?'). Go back and redo levels to get the S or S+ grade = super fast. Look carefully to find all the stars on some levels to get the highest scores.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I chose to give this book four stars because, though it's not the best book I've ever read, I was drawn into it almost immediately. I liked the characters all the way to the end, and I didn't see a lot of the twists and turns that unfolded.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|This series has capture every detail in the life of people who were slaves in the Roman times.  Not only this series is filled with love, courage and the will to fight to become free but it depicts the romance and lust during that era.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I really love this movie. I really like Tom Hardy as Forrest and Jason Clark as Howard. It is unbeliveable that the story line actually did happen. How Forrest had his throat cut and he actually lived. Really enjoyed this movie.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|We ordered this season just before Netflix made season 4 available, but we're not sorry. We absolutely HAD to know what happened in season 4 before season 5 got started.<br /><br />The extras are interesting, and something we wouldn't have gotten from streaming the episodes. This was definitely worth it.
B00129H7VS|5.0|If you have not seen this series then do so!  Great story of WWII told here in this series.  A must own for WWII buffs.
B0076DELIG|1.0|Not Connelly.  I want my money back.  Storyline was ok.  Writing was stiff , stupid , simple and boring.  Few things were believable from the nonexistant relationship with his lover and his &#34;fantastic&#34; but not to be trusted daughter to a police investigator following him for what seemingly is for the fun of it .<br />I have been a diehard fan for years but this is dribble.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book put the most used parts of publishing on kindle in one place. I have it on my tablet to refer to. However if you are just starting read all of the material Amazon provides to publish your book. (Search Vergason in Amazon books)
B003MG5CO8|5.0|I enjoy watching the movies that the main character has done in the past.  All say that this movie brings joy, laughter and a sense of understanding for all human beings.  It is a remarkable story that everyone would enjoy.
B00009NQQO|5.0|My son is 18 months and loves this toy. I also have a friend who's 4 year old still plays with it in the tub so, it will be great for a long time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the story hated the ending.  I hope there will be a sequel. My first book read on my kindle.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|AND SO FAR ITS GREAT , DRAMA , SUSPENSE GREAT ACTORS AND A VERY INTERESTING PLOT. I HOPE THEY KEEP IT ON THE AIR! SO FAR ONLY TWO EPISODES HAVE AIRED AND BOTH WERE GREAT . GIVE IT A TRY YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. ONE MORE THING NOT FOR SMALL CHILDREN.MAYBE 13 AND  UP.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I am totally hooked.  Dexter is an addiction for me!  I have to pace myself, or I will sit through the entire season in one day!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I was very excited to watch this movie. Sadly, I wish that I could get the hour and a half of my time back. A total let down
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game brings out the very competitive side of my nature - I canwaste hours just trying to do away with those evil little green piggies!!  I like the fact that the games is based on priciples of physics, it gives your brain a good workout as you try to figure out the best way to force and gravity to achieve your objective.  The little sounds the birds make are funny, as are the exclamations the piggie smake when they get whacked.
0307341550|5.0|I'm glad I found this author. Dark and captivating. Hard to put down. Very thought provoking. I will read all of her works.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this would be a simple romance novel.  Was actually disappointed at first when I realized it was about teenagers but I ended up loving this book.  I never expected the twist in the story.  I was was hooked!  Another reviewer said she got bored half way through and stopped reading.  Big mistake! That is when it gets good!  Yes, it's a heavy and sad storyline but a great one at that.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS A WINNER AND A CLASSIC WITH CARY GRANT IN IT. IT IS COLORIZED AND HAS SEVERAL BIG STARS IN IT.  THIS IS A MOVIE THE ENTIRE FAMILY CAN WATCH AND ENJOY! ANYONE WHO WATCHES IT WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Could not stop watching, episode by episode, I became so locked in to the story! Stayed up all night to finish.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|This step up movie is great just like all the previous step up movies.  Great performances by all.  Good story and fantastic dancing!
B008HK3SO0|4.0|Very protective case for the Kindle Fire - I've dropped mine once or twice with no ill effects.  It is a little inconvenient when you want to pull it out to read while on a bus but it does what I bought it to do.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|not bad but lack the action that I expected more of a good tv movie instead of the big screen.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|This UNO for the Kindle is a lot of fun and gives us time to do something while we wait at the Dr's Office, in traffic, on road trips or any where really. My son and I play it quite a bit even at home.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Blu-ray with incredible video and audio quality. The movie is a masterpiece! Black Friday made it the best deal ever!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|A funny and yet poignant story. If you are married and of &#34;a certain age&#34; this love story will ring true.
B009H442DG|5.0|Have a merry Christmas as you listen to these holiday classics.  Think back to Grease and remember how much you enjoyed it!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Fun game, great graphics.  Took quite awhile to load, but worked fine on my Acer tablet.  Nice long game but not at all boring.  Worth the money.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|Bought this for my daughter. She played it every day for a week straight and then down loaded it to her laptop.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|HOS were challenging, but not so much as to be frustrating. Cut scenes and storyline were great. I guess my only &quot;complaint&quot; would be that some of the puzzles were a bit too difficult for me.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Devil Colony includes lots of fun elements, including history, Native Americans, nano-technology, suspense, conspiracy, and even a little Morman religion.  Easy reading, the Sigma Force people work to solve an ancient American mystery.  Rollins writes the novel in a way to keep the reader interested and involved from start to finish.
B000FC12SM|3.0|It's okay, really nothing new that you can't figure out. An enjoyable cruise along read.Good to read if you think you missed something.
1452110581|5.0|I purchased this book for my 3 children and their spouses and a friend all of whom are cat lovers.  The poems and short stories are so cat like, I can see those kitties typing quickly and having lots of aha! moments.  If only humans could be so clever!
B005ETA5K2|4.0|I found this product for my laptop and I found it is great and it does its job and brings in the better signal. I am impressed with it.
0765325950|5.0|Read the book in just over a week, I like the way it ends and sorry to have this journey come to an end?
B001224WBS|5.0|what can you say if you love Depeche Mode, you'll love this CD.  Well worth the purchase price and the fact that you can use the cloud player makes it even better
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this take runs with no problems on my kindle fire. it has good quests and keeps me playing more each day. you don't need gems to play but it would help if u want any good equipment.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I don't care for the demonic undertones but the game was great otherwise. There are lots of help options. The map showing available actions was what got me through it. Thanks!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I wanted to find out what Angry Birds was all about so I downloaded this app and was pleasantly surprised to find that it is very fun and addictive.
1419702238|4.0|A new book that was asked for by grandkid.  Arrived in a timely fashion so I guess she was happy with it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I spent several hours laying in bed trying figure what was going to happen next while I went through this adventure
B0006GANOQ|4.0|I loved Sandra Bullock in this movie.  Reeves was also pretty physical, but Bullock stole the show.  She definitte did some great movies after this one.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Challenging when you think you've got it Surprise! Lots of fun, awesome I give this a 5 star rating recommended for all Angry Bird fans.Love it!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Even though I've pre-order it, I'm watching season 5 and love it that Castle and Beckett have finally got together. Can't wait to watch the gag reel
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I'm glad they made this app.  I really like that there are so many sounds to choose from.  I would definitely suggest this app to others.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|My sister had to drag me to watch this show, but I'm hooked now! The cast is superb, the scenery magnificent. If you like period pieces, this show is a must see! Love this show!
B005QUQ99K|5.0|I got this for my 10 year old nephew for his birthday. He loved it. Though he put it together super fast so if you're buying this for a talented lego assembler you may want to buy something bigger or more than one small pack because the building fun doesn't last long.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|Costner was there for the male hero image, but this movie was really a success due to Whitney's singing.  You couldn't beat it.
0688163173|4.0|Good book. Made you think and examine your own reality. We discussed it at length and then watched the movie with Leo DiCaprio. Well done!
B003TSEEDY|1.0|Awful musings of a mentally demented young person/ I have nothing good to say about it.  Good by again tonight makes the necessary words
B00ATPVA78|1.0|The game never downloaded, so I could not determine whether I liked it or not... I'm not sure what happened. It appeared as though it had downloaded but it didn't.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great Novel, cannot wait for the last one! Great to read before or after 50 Shades- similar style but different senario
B00005JLEU|5.0|What an awesome film. This is another one that I watched from my childhood, and having it on DVD than VHS is so much better.<br /><br />The extras you will need to watch because the work behind such an amazing movie is more than one person can handle.<br /><br />I can't wait for the new Studio Ghibli films to come.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|INTENSE is the only word I can use to describe this movie.  I will say one thing, it's the best action movie I've seen in 12 months.  What a great way to start the DVD season for 2013.  This Renner actor was outstanding as the new Bourne, or I should say, one of the other Bourne's.  There was non-stop action in every shot.  You really couldn't get up for a second or you'd miss something.  I even watched it a second time and loved it even more.  This is a movie you don't want to miss.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I like this game because it's fun and u train your own cute monsters to battle.<br />:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B005DZMP00|5.0|Sound quaility great. My father loves listening to the old songs that he did in his 20's. Again, great music
B006LSZECO|3.0|After seeing this on the best sellers list for 20 some weeks, I was really anticipating  a great read.  But no, it wasn't great.  Interesting and well-written but not that good.  It's on my Kindle so I may revisit it.
B005LAIHZE|2.0|I am not sure what I was expecting but this was not it. It was ok to watch it once and I was so excited about it I purchased it before seeing it..I won't make that mistake again.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Well I am rating this game because I need more gems. So yeah. It's cool there isn't all that much to do. The graphics are good. It was worth my free money. GREEN DAY FOR LIFE&lt;3333
0783233477|5.0|I just can't say anything negative about this movie, except that maybe it was a little sad at the end.  The performances by everyone were outstanding and I don't know how Pitt kept a smile off his face for the entire movie.  He was so good in this role.
1439170916|5.0|This book covers so much about the history of cancer and the research being done.  Helps you gain a clear understanding of this horrible disease.
0345423496|4.0|Yeah, I knew there was a 2001, 2010, and the other one, but never knew there was the book 3001. I got it for my dad, I'll probably read it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I typically download a number of books at one time and read them sometime later, so when I got to this book I had forgotten any hype and &#34;Martian&#34; was my only clue as to what it was about.  Wow!  From the beginning I was hooked.  The story is very fast paced and believable.  Anyone who remembers Apollo 13, either actual or the movie, should find &#34;The Martian&#34; well worth their time.
0920668372|1.0|There is something very disturbing about a mother who puts a ladder on her car and drives to her newly married son's house and climbs through his window. I understand what the sentiment is supposed to be and I like the idea of the &#34;circle of life&#34; but really???!!! It's just wrong!!
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|Loved the books.  Could not put them down.  If you liked twilight you have to try this series.  You won't be disappointed
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like it.  It is helpful to have with me on the Kindle.  It seems to have a lot of good information concerning the days weather and upcoming
0451457994|5.0|I've seen the moive so I really want to heard the book. I'm in the middle of another now and will read this next.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I've never reviewed a movie before so that just tells you how much I loved this movie! The first time I watched this I watched it a second time right after and still found something to laugh at! I keep renting it so I think it's time to actually buy it because I know I'll be watching this movie again!
B009MF56GC|3.0|I loved the first one and this one is OK/Good I likes the comedy quips that came from everybody and I especially loved the tongue in cheek making fun of themselves and previous characters. I like it well enough to not be sorry I bought it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|AMAZING. Great characters and letters, and I believe its the best book that I have ever read.. I'd recommend this to anyone
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm going to try not to talk about the book, all I can say is that Jamie McGuire wrote a very cute story about two characters, that drives me crazy all the time I was reading. The chemestry and all the events that they live, make them realize that love is very important. It's a very cool story, love the moments, love imagine songs about it, totally recommended!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I actually liked this movie remake more than the original!  We rented it using amazon prime ... So easy to do and no lag at all.
B00001OH7X|5.0|David Bowie is unique.  My husband likes a lot of different music but always makes sure he has all Bowie's work.
B004F1F32A|5.0|The only bad thing about the download was the movie wasn't available on Amazon Prime, meaning that I'd have to pay extra to see it. It was good to see the movie before seeing Taken 2 that I got from Amazon on Blu-Ray.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good amazing awesome fun funny cool awesomely cool addicting addicting addicting addicting addicting addicting addicting addicting addicting addicting addicting state,star rating 5
0399160450|5.0|Nothing more need to be said.  I have read all of his fictions begining with Red October. I would like to know why Search and Destroy was not published.
0062209078|5.0|I became a Who fan after I heard them on the Woodstock Album. I thought their set was the best. I have the book on CD. It's thoroughly enjoyable hearing Pete tell the story in his own voice. His voice is casual, conversational and easy to listen to. He's even able to laugh at himself, at times. Maybe he will consider producing another book using his voice. The story is organized chronologically and highlights feelings, actions and episodes throughout his life. He touches on a number of personal issues, provides some technical insight into the equipment he was using during various periods, and lets the events in the story stand on their own, without being overly judgemental. The story is paced nicely, moving forward in time without getting too bogged down on a single topic or person. Pete is the story's anchor. He provides a unique view into his life, the life of one of the world's greatest rock star/composers.<br /><br />I've seen some of the negative reviews and I just want to say that some songs don't have any inspiration or backstory, they just appear to you. It's up to you to recognize them for what they are. Also the title of the book is \\"Who I Am\\", not \\"Who They Are/Were\\" and I think Pete has included enough about the other members of the Who for this title.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I was told he likes Bruno Mars and the critics say this is a terrific new album.  He was very pleased.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Telling an outlandish story in a way that is so very believable in the not too distant future. Awesome read
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I havbe never read a book so fast.  An easy read in typical Gresham style that let's you get to know the main character where I did not want the book to end!
0061122416|5.0|If you are frustrated with your life because you still have not reached your goal, you have a major change in your life, a major decision to take, this is the book you need to read.
B007OWRBJK|3.0|I am not exaggerating when I say that Townshend is an absolute genius. He is a master musician, composer and basically invented a lot of the ways that are still used today to edit music. In addition, his writing is generally excellent. I had no idea he was such a brilliant person. His range of expertise blew me away.<br /><br />But here's the problem. I enjoyed the beginning, but about 150 pages into it Townshend goes into minute detail about the technical aspects of studio work and even details about all the different pieces of hardware. I'm sure that there are some music geeks out there who will love reading about that stuff. I'm just a fan. I don't really care to know much about those techniques.<br /><br />I also got a distinct feeling that he understated his substance abuse and frequent fits of rage. He tried to make himself sound like the voice of moderation within the band but every now and then anecdotal stories slip out that lead me to believe he was more than complicit.<br /><br />If he had edited most of the technical music stuff and shortened it by about 200 pages, it would have been excellent.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this is the best zombie show i have seen.  the story line sucks you in and you cant wait to find out what happens next.
B005KELW26|5.0|My daughter loves her case it holds her kindle very nice it looks like a little address book.<br />I rate 5 star because of the quaility of the brand.<br />Great gift.
0446554995|5.0|Preston and Child keep the pressure on and the pace high with their latest offering.  Pendergast is at his lowest but the search for a killer renews his zest for life.  A must read if you're a Pendergast fan.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I've read a lot of romance novels and this one was one of the best. Great read! Definitely worth your time.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A really great and unusual read!  The characters and story was unique.  If you like a good story with a spooky, almost syfy touch, you will truly enjoy this story.
145162607X|5.0|Even though I am told that my writing is enjoyable - a distant relative of Anne Roiphe (and I believe talents are genetic)- I am too old and scared to write 'that book'. However love to read and Phillipa Gregory's (in my eyes) can't be faulted.  At 72 I can only wish that history (such as I was taught it) was presented to me, in my time,  in ways that could make it so deliciously interesting and thought - provoking. At the end she tells you where and how she embellished so no one should fault her for that...I now go on to find out more about this time and better understand the people around me today.  Things haven't changed that much in almost 600 years.
1401223176|5.0|Loeb and Lee create an epic journey for Batman, who must navigate his past to survive his future. There is a Batman versus Superman moment that is worth the price of this book alone! I have said too much! It's time to &#34;Hush.&#34;
B009GIPDQS|5.0|I really loved this book, fast paced and a few good twists. John Grisham at his best. An excellent read
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love this app it's fun to play anytime of day! From the ziplines to the fearsome demon monkey It has FUN written all over!
B0052BZ6X8|5.0|It's not too heavy, special FX are good, and it's just fun! The action was very good, and the evil aliens were excellent.
0091939526|2.0|Found the book too complex - there was only 20 pages worth reading if you are not into all the scientific data which I was not interested in. Loved the 4 hour workweek much better
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Really enjoyed his writing.  The book kept me interested in the outcome, giving me alot of thought to what was going on.  I did not see the xtra bonus short story in my product.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The book kept my interest until the motel era. i cant believe they were there only a couple of days it felt like a week.i get it he is a saint in her eyes but 4 chapters of the same bla bla bla
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book takes you on a journey, often to places you don't want to go. You find yourself pleading with the characters to try and somehow write your own ending for these amazing souls. A great read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Harder then the first one. Thats what she said. Seriously though its really fun except it lags you out of the game sometimes. If it didn't do that it would be 5 stars.
B0006TSSNG|5.0|great product for the consumer, and is beatufull gif for the alla family, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, bye
B0058YPGSY|5.0|The package came fast and in perfect condition. The DVD itself is in excellent shape.<br />Sons of Anarchy is the best show on TV right now. It's the only TV show I've ever purchased.<br />I would recommend this to anyone over 18.
B0053O89JM|5.0|This was a great purchase. Perfect condition and great viewing. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes House.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|I love this movie even throughout its highly unbelievable plot.  Its just wonderful and has a touch of something for everyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a great read. I finished it in no time. I am ready to read the second book! :)
0143038583|5.0|I am a big supporter of agriculture and wanting to learn more about where our food comes from and how we can improve it.  I was reguired to read this for two ag classes and love it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is amazing  I think men and women should read it and people who need some excitement in the bedroom.
B004G600A4|5.0|Got this for my toddler and we both love it! Any one with little ones at home know you get stuck watching their favorite movie a thousands times over, well this one you don't get sick of. No exact to the classic fairy tale but certainly cute and funny. A must have in any Disney collection!
B000I9U99K|5.0|I love this movie the scenery and sets are just breath taking.  The plot is witty and suspenseful. A ton of fun.  Russell Crowe is excellent for this role.  Highly enjoyed the movie.  I wish they had made some of the other books into movies as well.  I would have enjoyed learning more about Lucky Jack and the crew of the Surprise.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After reading the first two books I thought I had an idea of what where this one might go, but even as I read the last page I was wrong.<br />The ending is not what I expected , but none of the book was. It was entertaining and I enjoyed it. Nothing else to say really.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|First off, I am I HUGE fan of this game, so I had to own it for myself. It's complex on so many levels. Every time you play is different, and there are plenty of expansions to change it up. Definitely experience it for yourself!
B002BBJ52U|3.0|i liked the book better, here the girls get the guy at the end, and the book is more about how we read all the signals wrong...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really good book.  You get inside the head of the Nick and Amy.  I absolutely couldn't put it down.  Makes you wonder if something like this could actually happen.  You have to read this book!
B00870Z05U|4.0|Being a fan of all the versions of the Phantom of the Opera be they black/white, silent, horror, or starring gerald butler.  I must say I found this movie somewhat disappointing.  I just can't seem to align with this version of the film.  I like the plot, enjoyed the costumes and inventive set, and quite a few of the songs.  However some of the characters just don't ring true somehow.  Its hard to follow up a sequel that uses none of the original cast, but I think its more of a plot issue than an actor one.  I still can't quite put my finger on what it is and i have seen the movie three or four times now.  Raul I think is the biggest issue for me.  Something about his role in this is just so strange. . . .
B00005JKNC|5.0|A really moving story and amazing acting. I was very surprized by Jim Carrey, he did such a fantastic job.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I am a little dissappointed I thought this would be more of a hidden object game.  I have to hit hint after every move.  Probably will only keep until they want money to upgrade.  The graphics on the other hand are outstanding.  That is the only reason I am still playing.
1401322786|5.0|Mitch Albom is a genius, presenting a perfect balance between dreams and reality. Dor and Alli just may be my favorite love story of all time. I have always loved Mitch Albom, and always will. He can take the simplest story and present it in a way that changes you forever. Mitch can say more in 200 pages than many authors can in 2,000! Excellent work, Mitch. You are absolutely this author's favorite author!!
B005COO1X6|3.0|It was a quick read but short.  This book could have been longer given the circumstances surrounding the car it would have been better
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a lot better than the old one. Ive beaten the score of everyone on my bus. They all tried. No one can beat it though.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to use on all my devices: kindle, phone and laptop. The interface is good and the app has a very short learning curve.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I could only rate 5 stars because there isn't a higher rating. This is so much fun, challenging and the smile goes on my face while playing
030745455X|5.0|Read Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, then must have next two books in series. The girl who played with fire is equally strong and a fantastic look into Swedish culture yet translated for easy adaption for american audience.
B008OOYALE|1.0|ios players get way more then Android users..what they get for free we have to PAY...pure bs....and when you ask team lava about it all they do is flip u the bird
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I have been a big fan of Pink but i only like certain songs till this album came out, man this is a bad ass album i listened to it from begining to end and i am so happy with this cd. I saw the price for this cd and i couldn't pass it up. I have no idea how many cd's i have bought from Cyberzoo, but it won't be my last . Once again you guys sent me a great cd at a great price thank you so very much.
859037985X|5.0|If you are new to Lua, then you don't have this book. If you are not new to the language, then you already have it!<br /><br />Everyone approaching Lua should start with this essential tool as it is, by far, the most efficient and authoritative way to truly understand Lua and its C-API, which is the key to Lua's ability to integrate with system languages. Written as though K&R were in the room, it has just the right amount of instructive insight and tutorials to bring context, without making it hard to actually find what you need to know. You will wear this book out.<br /><br />In the Third Edition, lessons were added to the end of each chapter. Many of the lessons are actually open-ended questions, such as \\"Why is the elseif statement more important in Lua, than it might be in other languages?\\" These lend to a great deal of understanding that I found very helpful.<br /><br />Other lessons and examples highlight how somethings are accomplished in Lua, which might be a specialized feature found in another, more complicated language. Here, I found myself learning about the language, gaining an appreciation of its design, as well as insights into being productive with the it.<br /><br />It's not a huge book, but every section was very dense with knowledge and even after 2 years of playing around with Lua, I found it enjoyable and well worth my time to go through this new edition.<br /><br />Some Editorializing on Lua:<br /><br />Lua is best thought of as an implementation and a language. As a language, it is very small, yet it contains some very compact and powerful semantic constructs that you might not expect. That is, Lua is smaller than Visual Basic, yet it has coroutines, first class functions, closures and some wonderfully done meta-programming features.<br /><br />However, these merits might just be my personal taste. There are other great languages out there, although it's worth noting that, after you remove the section on the C-API, Programming in Lua is roughly the same size as JavaScript The Good Parts. :)<br /><br />Perhaps the feature that deserves the most attention is Lua's implementation, which is focused on its first design goal: an accessible, embeddable scripting language. Lua includes a very clean API written for C, which provides very efficient, controlled and seamless access to and from Lua. It is unique and it is also why, in spite of it being a language less known in web development circles, Mediawiki chose it for their templating system.<br /><br />Finally, Lua is maintained by a small team, in PUC-Rio, a University in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, that knows how to say \\"no.\\" They keep the garden tended and pull the weeds, and otherwise keep Lua small and beautiful.<br /><br />As a result, programming in Lua and working with its implementation is pleasant. Maybe that's the most informative thing that might be said: When I use Lua, I'm having fun.<br /><br />So... buy the book? :)ly the same size as JavaScript The Good Parts. :)<br /><br />Perhaps the feature that deserves the most attention is Lua's implementation, which is focused on its first design goal: an accessible, embeddable scripting language.

B009VB97EY|1.0|This piece of garbage was worse than Showgirls.  I don't see why people liked it.  There wasn't even that much flesh.  Horrible waste of my time.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|great book for a quick read. I am a little slow so it took me a few days, but i really enjoyed it.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Is probably better than the bought apps I had formerly. Create and edit office docs easily and in a familair looking environment.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game except it tends to freeze up a lot and it takes forever to load when you want to go to other peoples stables.
B002NN5F7A|5.0|Some great lines and performances - the Alec Baldwin monologue is one of my favorites. The desperation of real-estate sales to unwilling sellers shines through. Should be mandatory for all up-and-coming sales types.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great character development. The story keeps you interested and is believable without being predictable. The further I got into the story the harder it was to put down. The ending is a bit of a surprise but leaves you feeling fulfilled. Good closure.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Okay, so yeah I saw this movie initially just to see Channing Tatum half naked... But turns out Magic Mike is a great movie, completely on its own! Btw, this movie should win an award on casting alone...
B0049J0DC8|5.0|I'm kidding.  You're not crazy if you don't love it.  But this is a great movie.  My daughter loves it and it is always the movie she asks for.  I never get tired of watching it with her.
B0094M2X6Y|5.0|This movie is one of the most underrated movies of all time! It was really awesome! Disney did a wonderful job! I had no interest in seeing it based off the previews. It looked to me like a Star Wars wannabe, but it really does stand on its own! Terrific story line! Superb acting and wonderful visuals!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Sherlock Holmes has been made many times from multiple angles - this modern-day adaption works really well. Holmes and Watson play off each other to produce a gripping story with some interesting distractions - Holmes's legendary observations are (as always) amazing.
B004JQN364|5.0|Sturdy under rough play. Excellent quality for a child's toy.  A good collectible for the collector as well.  You won't be disappointed with this purchase!
B005LAII1C|5.0|I love this movie! Really shows how diverse Mark Wahlberg's acting ability is. So funny! And really, who didn't want their teddy bear to come alive?
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Beautiful movie.  I love it. Movie was well written except for maybe the part of all the naked men's butts.  That got a questionable look from my 3 year old daughter, but she didn't make a big deal out of it and for me it was a funny part.  She thought it was gross, haha. Your children are sure to love this.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I liked the film, it is the final chapter of this series, the disc worked fine and the quality was good
B00007GZR0|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, Rock Hudson and Doris Day are great together. This is my favorite movie with the two of them.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It is so much fun interacting with your horse. The scenery and the horses are beautiful. I can't get over how real the horse reacts to you.
B000LPS47U|5.0|A nice old fashion zombie making movie, however is interesting because it has a zombie cat, one of these zombies is smart enough to talk and fight, and the intro music still freaks me the hell out! :)
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I downloaded this so my 8year old would have something to Excercise and tire her mind in the evenings. The calming yoga-like music in the background helps her concentrate. The difficulty level is just enough to challenge her without becoming boring. She plays a round or 2 on her kindle at bedtime as a wind down from the day.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think this was the best season of the 3 that are currently out. . . . . . .
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Two thumbs up on this one! Quick and easy read, took about 2 days. Just had to finish and find out what happened!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|This is a classic album by &#34; VanThe Man&#34;. You' ll find different styles on CD, but the sound is basically blues. A five stars album, a &#34;most have&#34; one.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|It's the most unique zombie show ever.<br />I read the the graphic novels and it closely matches them but it has it's own flavor.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved the character Charlie and his sweet, honest insights. The way his friend Patrick described his being a wallflower, allowing him the quietly observe life was perfect. That's what this book was about and I loved to hear the observations of this extremely bright teen in all of his ' innocence<br />'. The epilogue was surprising but helped to understand Charlie's sensitivities. Wish I knew who he was writing to.....did anyone else figure that out?
B007MB5OCE|1.0|This book started out strong, but it couldn't hold my interest.<br />Too many twists and turns for my old brain.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|transformers dark of the  moon my granddaughter really enjoys watching this dvd she especially likes bumble bee she is fascinated by their transformation
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love her books.  I love the complexities of her characters and plot.  I love the twists and how she keeps me guessing to the end.  I am always sorry when her books end.  I hope there will be a new book, soon.
B00005R24K|5.0|This is one of my favorite horror movies as a teeanger and it's still good to watch dusring classic horror movie night.  friends stuck in a cabin find a book made of human skin when read it unleashed a ancient evil that one by one kills them until one remains, his name Bruce Campbell.

B004TI5N38|5.0|The book is on the go from the first page. The main character John Puller ia a no nonsense type of guy but is fair and caring. I have read the other David Baldacci book ( The Forgotten)  with the same character and found it to be the same.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's a great bounce back from season 2 that lagged a bit.  I'm so happy that they are back to making it tense and upsetting again!

0321857895|5.0|This book is a great introduction to the art of Sketchnoting. It was obviously so well planned and thought out with every possible attention to detail from the custom sketchnote font to the thick card stock of the book itself. Well worth the money if you have ever wanted to learn to sketchnote and the basics of drawing concepts.
B00AQ4U6P4|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie! It keeps your attention! And every time you thought you knew what was going on a TWIST!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|You can't put this book down once you start the trilogy your hooked!! I can't wait for the movies to see how good they follow the story line.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love love love this book! The book goes into so much better detail than the movie so you understand what the characters are going through. Love this author.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|Exceeded my expectations! For true fans! Not for kids IMOP! Great addition to my collection will be back for more!
B004HD61KE|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a mystery.  The plot line is a different take on history and really holds a reader's attention.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I never saw this movie in theatres (though I wanted to) so I decided whenever it came out on DVD (and for a good price) I would buy it....and I have NO REGRETS!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE. It's so good: the color, the music, the story, the characters...everything you would want in a movie!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching fire; The three book series is a must read for anyone who enjoy  fun and easy read books. My daughter and wife have all read the books.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Saw the trailer for this movie and wanted to watch it. Could not get it through Netflix, so found it on here and bought it! Love the movie! It was in great condition!
B00865P3AS|5.0|I am so glad to have discovered 2 Cellos on You Tube this past weekend.  There is not a pore in these guys bodies that does not have genius for the musical talent poring out.  You have to hear it to belive it!!!!  Cellos that sound like totally rocked out electric guitars????  These guys play every genre and they are like the Extreme Sports of the music world.  We are living in a great time when music once again keeps gifting us with rare a few and far between genius, these guys belong in that category.  Would love to see them pair up with Lindsey Stirling  that is one session I would not want to miss.<br /><br />If you have never heard of them check them out and get ready to be blown away and overjoyed to have found a super talent to add to your favorites.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So happy to have a new TR to play! Love ziplining....it looks so real and I feel like I'm there! Good job!

B002ZNJXP8|5.0|Great book, great condition, got here very quickly. I recommend this book to anyone, not just those interested in astronauts and the time period.
B000IZQ9CK|5.0|Record plays beautifully other than some faint crackling and a bit of wear on the sleeve but overall great quality and quick shipping.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|Although some people seem to like this sharpener.. I find it difficult to use.  Could only see this handy if I was lost out in the wilderness.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Works for everything I need it for wether at work or home. It is very convenient and always available for me.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I've read all of the Harry Bosch series and I enjoyed this one too. But something was missing for me, I couldn't connect to Harry and I still don't like his partner, I just do't have a feel for him, or if I do, I just don't care about him. The case was interesting and it did keep me guessing, but then in the end I felt sort of let down. I thought really, that's it?
B007V4530A|5.0|This book is great for anyone who wants to make their presentations more persuasive and memorable. I originally bought it to develop a short talk for my forthcoming book.  However, it is broadly applicable and I will use it in many settings.  The author avoids cliches and offers explanations about underlying grammar and sentence structure that results in high impact communication. Yet it is readable and enjoyable!

0061743526|5.0|I read this Pulitzer Prize winning book for the first time as a 43-year-old and was better able to understand the difference between good fiction and great fiction as a result.  2010 is the 50th Anniversary of this Great American Novel and merited a revisiting of Maycomb, Mississippi.  The first reading was a moment set apart, the second reading was a sublime moment, the third (within another seven years has passed) may cause time to move in new ways.  This novel is so good that it deserves to be the standard by which other novels should be measured.<br />Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, daughter of Atticus and sister of \\"Jem\\" and the narrator of this tale set in the mid-1930's in the quaint Southern Mississippi town of Maycomb.  She leads the reader through three years of life in this village filled with wise, loving spinsters; crabby, mean widows; folks seen but not talked about but always respected; bigots, racial radicals and Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, one of literatures least seen main characters.  The story begins with the ending and is filled with how that ending came to be.  Not one sentence or word is superfluous and most are placed for optimum impact.<br />As Scout is quite precocious, she is the best choice to be the observer of the activities and the narrator of this tale.  Her youth prevents her comprehending all that she sees but her naivete enables her to speak of what she sees without judgement, for the most part, as Ms. Jean Louise is certainly NOT without opinion.  For her first day of school, after her teacher has demanded she stop reading, Scout replies, \\"until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read.  One does not love breathing.\\" (p.20).  The three years covered by the book mature Scout, and the rest of the town, it seems, beyond the confines of a mere 36 months.  By the time the facts have been filled in and the reader has arrived where she/he began, Scout three years old and has \\"grown but there wasn't much else . . . to learn, except possibly algebra\\" (p.321) and can understand the power of not allowing a Mockingbird to be harmed, much less killed.<br /><br />This is a story of such power and hope that this present age must read it in order to be reminded of what it feels like to breathe.  The cynicism of the 21st Century is deeply present in the setting of the book (1935) as it was when it was written (1960) but Ms. Harper voices the reality that life is more than the harm, fear and pain to be found in life.  There are neighborly acts, days of play and hard work, families with which to connect (and distance from) and a reality that those events are what keep's one's heart beating.  The story ends with the knowledge, deeply felt, of injustice unanimously enacted but that cannot overcome the possibility of righteousness because people can choose to change, even thought that change may be costly and painful.<br />This is a deeply Christian novel, even though it is not considered as such.  The novel reveals itself to be genuinely so when one of the characters speaks the truth of Maycomb (and of most of us who claim to be Christ-Followers),<br />\\"We're the safest folks in the world,\\" said Miss Maudie.  \\"We're so rarely called on to be Christians, but when we are, we've got men like Atticus to go for us.\\"  (p.246).<br />The story flows from that one passage and it is painfully true, it seems, that it goes beyond the confines of Maycomb.  It is so much easier to root for, or curse at, those to do the right thing for us than it is to take action ourselves but that does not relieve us of the duty to do the right thing as well.  This is a truth so simple a 9-year-old understands it, how and when do we forget it.

0553386794|5.0|Long Ago, in a place far from here, four families are swept up in the Game of Thrones, vying for power.  There is a wall in the north where men take the oath of the black, to protect the kingdom from the Others and the children of the forest.  Winter is returning to a land that has known summer for ten years and the kingdom is swinging out of balance.  Trust no one because you don't know who is your friend or enemy and all is fair when you play the game of thrones.<br /><br />The dragons have been dead for over a hundred years, and the people who ruled alongside them decimated, except for two young heirs, who pine for retribution.  The current King, Robert Baratheon is a unhappy, heavy drinking womanizer with bratty kids.  His wife hates him and wants him dethroned or dead.  The Hand of the King is Ned Stark of Winterfall.  Ned has a lovely family consisting of a wife, four sons, one a bastard, and two daughters.  Stark's eldest daughter is betrothed to the King's heir to the throne.  The Stark coat of arms is a gray Direwolf on a ice white field.  A Game of Thrones opens with the Stark children finding a family of Direwolf pups, near their home of Winterfell, one for each child.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is an epic fantasy that is full of adventure, creative characters, sword fighting, romance, mystery and so much more.  I loved the inclusion of dragon lore, the fantastical creations of animals and human like creatures.  A Game of Thrones has a medieval feel with jousting, sword-fighting and good old fashioned beheadings.  The castles are full of hidden nooks and creepy crannies and halls that echo with voices of conspiracy.  Oh, it is so much fun to read on a dark winter night.<br /><br />My favorite characters are Ned Stark, his daughter Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, the dwarf and the dragon princess, Daenerys.  I also loved the direwolves, especially Ghost.  Of course Martin kills off one of my favorite characters and I am still in shock about it.  How could he kill off one of the best characters?  The are plenty of characters you love to hate and hate to love and many who fight for their story to be told.  I cannot wait to continue reading this amazing saga.<br /><br />There are plots and counterplots, a conspiracy, crazy lords and ladies, sibling rivalry and a storyline that is sure to keep you reading and thinking and wondering, what in the heck is going to happen next.  A Game of Thrones is unique, powerful, fun and I can see why fantasy readers LOVE IT!  I'm so glad I was introduced to this series.  I'm ready to read more and then watch the HBO series.  I'm bubbling with excitement.he kill off one of the best characters?  The are plenty of characters you love to hate and hate to love and many who fight for their story to be told.

0670021652|5.0|When a couple asks me to help them prepare to get married, the first thing I try to do is talk them out of the decision to marry.  At first blush, this idea sounds cynical.  I am not cynical about marriage, I am very much in favor of that institution.  However, ask anyone who has been married longer than the life of a magazine subscription and, more than likely, they will tell you that marriage is the most difficult thing they have ever attempted.  (Most will also tell you there are rewards to this work that far overshadow the work required.)  Typically those who want to get married are more interested in the \\"party\\" (the wedding ceremony and celebration) than they are what happens after the crowd has gone home, the gifts are stored away and the actual living a life with someone else begins.  Should the couple stills want to get married after my efforts (to this point, they ALL have), then we begin an educational process that will end, hopefully, 50+ years later with the death of one of them.  I understand and accept that what we discuss in session will not sink in until much later in their relationship, which does not preclude their need to hear the information NOW.<br /><br />If I could design a premarital \\"preparation\\" program that will cause the couple to reflect upon this decision with as much depth, passion, and commitment as Ms. Gilbert has obviously done and relates that experience in this book, I would.  Until I do, those who want to get married need to read this book.  Herein, she communicates a short history of marriage as it pertains to Contemporary Western culture, what making this commitment means and what is required in order for it to \\"succeed.\\"  The reason for this rather in-depth critique of this long established institution is simple - she is being forced to marry the love of her life by the United States or they will no longer allow him to enter its boarders.  Having survived (as has her fiancé, Felipe) a horrendous divorce, the idea of marryingagain is something both have sworn not to do. They will be committed to each other deeply, passionately, ethically and in all manners, just not in a way that which, should it be required, would require them to sue (legally divorce) each other before they can end their relationship.  Their commitment to each other is going great until U.S. Homeland Security kicks Felipe, a Brazilian who is an Australian citizen, out of the United States because \\"he has visited too much.\\"<br />The following year of petitioning the government for a Marriage Visa (the infamous \\"Green Card\\") is taxing for the couple as he has to stay out of the U.S. and she is committed to staying with him until she is given permission to marry him.  Little is mentioned of the Everest-sized mountain of documents, absurd levels of bureaucracy or the endless waiting they experienced in those ten months (what is said is sufficient to vividly detail their love for each other).  The focus of the book is Ms. Gilbert talking herself into what she has already committed within herself to do - marry Felipe.  While this is not a self-help or a textbook for marriage, it certainly provides an intelligent reflection of a commitment which is too often idealized without coolly examining the actual \\"doing\\" of the commitment.  The id-depth exploration of what marriage is, how it got to be there and what will give a couple the best chance of not divorcing once they have made it offered here is but a recommendation of, not a substitute for, the work any couple wanting to marry need to do.<br />For anyone contemplating marriage, considering the possibility of marriage, is not sure about marriage or who would just like to read a good book, this is a good choice.  There are a few \\"adult\\" words, but no violence or sexual situations are described.  Each chapter is divided into the different foci of marriage, as perceived by Ms. Gilbert: expectations, history, love and infatuation, women's rights, individuality and individuationand the \\"work\\" of marriage in a society.  Well researched, emotionally present, clearly written and delightfully told this is a book worth reading.  It will be included in my \\"Marriage Bibliography\\" I hand out to those wanting to marry (and which they largely ignore, I know).

B004KAB6ZE|5.0|I have had occasion to read a few \\"Young Adult\\" novels recently.  Perhaps it is because I am still undeveloped or too simple in my abstract thinking capabilities or am actually an adolescent only dreaming of being a middle-aged adult, but those books I have read have caused me to think the \\"Adult\\" novels (speaking of process, not pornography) presently offered are sorely lacking in the literary power found in these writings.  It is a very good thing that the writing aimed at an audience poised to be the leaders of tomorrow is good, well-written, challenging to prejudices, asks the reader to ponder those matters seemingly beyond their grasp and is FUN.  This present novel is a prime case in point.  I am better for having read this work of fiction that is mythical in content and accessible in presentation.<br />The first time the reader meets Ed Kennedy, he is face down on a bank floor.  He is there because the bank is being robbed.  Instead of being quiet and letting the robber finish his task, thus avoiding needless death, Ed and is mate, Marv, have an argument, about Marv's car.  Ed stops the robbery and is lauded as a hero.  This is where the world changed for Ed Kennedy.  The action of the book has little to do with the bank robbery beyond that is where the tale begins, so to speak.  Soon after the fanfare of his heroic deed has died down, Ed receives the Ace of Diamonds in the mail.  It is but the first of four Aces that will be delivered to him in the course of the next nine months.  Each Ace has things written on it that Ed must accomplish, just what that is, is left up to Ed to figure out.  These seemingly random missives are: the Ace of Diamonds - has three random addresses, the Ace of Clubs - a cryptic directive, the Ace of Spades - three authors of note, but obscure to our hero and the Ace of Hearts - three old movies.  There is a fifth card that is fitting and lends itself to deepening the plot as well as expanding the mystery, while offering a solution to the tale that will leave the reader in search of a place to ponder what just happened.<br /><br />I was hooked by this book when I laughed out loud three times on the first two pages.  There are numerous points of hearty laughter throughout the book (the average is less than 3-out-loud-laughs/2 pages) but they only serve as an escort to the reader, leading him/her to those lines that cause the reader to pause and think.  While the language was surprising in spots, particularly as this book was written for a younger audience and is on several high school reading lists, it is not offensive or detracting from the reading of the story.  Mr. Zusak is a working man with the heart and soul of a Poet-Philosopher.  Ed, at the hand of this talented author, becomes aware that he is involved in something beyond himself merely by Being.  He is faced with a choice to do something with that awareness or continue to Be less than he is capable of or was intended to become.<br />Being a therapist, I suspected the twists, plot and pacing of this work would lead to the revelation that Ed was: dreaming, delusional, hallucinating, drunk, becoming Aware, being manipulated by an unseen hand for reasons unknown or was becoming an adult intent on living his life.  Could it be possible that I could not have been totally wrong about the ending while being exactly right?  I never experienced this book as having an axe to grind, I did feel close enough to Ed that I wanted to wash The Doorman (a dog of memorable proportions), clean his house and join in with him and his friends in their frequent card games.  Somewhere, in this travel with Ed, I became aware that the language Ed was learning, was the one I long to speak.<br />This is a very theological book.  It is not a book of religion or religious teaching.  It is a book about how we understand our place in the world and what it means to be a part of that world.  One's place in community is shown to be important because one is important to the whole.  The things we experience, \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" are all gifts given toward cementing our place in community by helping us to claim ourselves.  Somewhere, from time to time, we see the message in a different light because we see the Messenger with better clarity.  Those glimpses are moments of true transcendence.

0385532458|4.0|John Grisham was trained as a lawyer.  I suspect he was urged to be trained in a field where, \\"he could support himself\\" by his parents instead of starving to death trying to be a published author.  His success in that arena is unknown, his talent as a writer of fiction is certainly not, he definitely will not starve in that profession.  This collection of short stories adds validation to the suspicion that writing is Mr. Grisham's life's calling.<br />All seven of the stories which make up this book would make a good novel were it not for the reality of expanding a work of perfection distorts it into a parody.  To add one more word to any of these tales is to diminish the stark power each holds in check.  This power is caused in no small part to their succinctness and general brevity.<br />\\"Blood Drive\\" is taken directly form my hometown (or could have been).  Only in such an environment can a community do the right thing based upon gossip and an act of charity result in poverty, incarceration, divorce and ostracization of those who sought to do only good.  What happens to those three men is as absurd as it is hilarious and could only be possible in the South.<br />\\"Fetching Raymond\\" is heartrending in its directness and finality.  \\"Michaels Room\\" and \\"Fish Files\\" offers a glimpse into the world of lawyering that supports the prejudicial ideas held of lawyers and are strangely satisfying in the pictures of justice painted in the story.  \\"Casino\\" and \\"Quiet Haven\\" are the best options for becoming movies and both, it is hoped, will be so developed.  No movie, however, can be as good at bringing to life these characters as can the imagination of the reader.  If a screen play is to be written concerning these stories, Mr. Grisham needs to be the author.  He introduced these characters to us, let him \\"flesh them out.\\"<br /><br />The final story, \\"Funny Boy\\" is from the depths of Mr. Grisham's  (Christian) Spirituality.  This is a tale of living life as it comes while choosing to live according to one's values.  This story brings into focus a question of \\"who is the outcast?\\"  By the end of the story, the definition of \\"other\\" will have been reconsidered, the idea of riches refocused, faithfulness clarified and family defined anew.  As with all parables, particularly those with a Spiritual message, the \\"hearer\\" does not know the message until it is rooted deeply in the heart.  Then, it is nearly impossible to be rid of its teachings.<br />C. S. Lewis noted that meeting another is being introduced to a part of the Self unknown previously.  Reading well-written literature, be it fiction or nonfiction (for all writing is autobiographical) offers the same gift.  What is noted as I read speaks to that part of me that connects with the story being told.  When I reread this collection, I wonder which stories will speak loudest or will touch the deepest within me.<br />This is book would be rated PG-13 was it a movie.  There are no scenes of graphic sex, little violence and few \\"adult\\" words.  It would not be suitable for bedtime reading as one would want to read \\"just one more page.\\"  However, this is a very good read whenever one chooses to visit Ford County.

B004Q7E0TA|1.0|I read the first 100 pages of this poorly written, disorganized, dreary account of a minor television actress whose \\"claim\\" to fame are: four years on \\"Ally McBeal,\\" a struggle with an eating disorder and is presently her partner is Ellen Degeneres.  I was looking forward to reading how Ms. de Rossi overcame a potentially deadly disorder but her presentation was so disorganized that I could not find a place to engage in the story.  She chose to present this tale by injecting \\"scenes\\" from different parts of her life to detail both her struggle with Bulimia and with her coming to accept her sexual orientation.  That style of writing can add depth to a story, particularly a memoir but in this case it caused confusion in the story.<br />I hope the remainder of the book will detail her recovery and successful relationship, now that she has accepted her sexual orientation.  I may return to read the rest of it someday, when I have read the other books waiting on my shelf.

B0037NB6QE|4.0|This book was free. Which is how I came to read what can only be described as a \\"Chick Lit\\" novel.  Let me be brave, clear and honest, I enjoyed reading it, a lot.  Add me to the list of \\"Real Men Don't . . . \\" under the chapter \\"Real Men Don't Let Genre (or Gender) Stand in the Way of a Good Read.\\"<br />This tale, set in Seattle, revolves around the first year of \\"A Good Yarn,\\" a knitting shop being opened by Lydia Koffman, a two-time Brain Cancer Survivor who is learning how to live after existing the last 14 years in the shadow of the Big C.  She offers a beginning knitting class to create a market for her yarn and from this class, the other characters are introduced.  Jacqueline Donovan is a Neuvo-Riche snob whose worth is centered on appearance, as a result, her world is as deep a picture-postcard until she learns to connect with others through the influence of the group.  Carol Girard was an investment accounts manager until she quit working so she could have children, the trouble is she cannot get pregnant; she joins the group because the first project is a baby blanket.  Finally, there is Alix Townsend, a \\"throw away\\" child who has grown up with a major chip on her shoulder that is both merited and about the size of Vermont and  who joined the knitting group to fulfill court-ordered community service hours.<br /><br />The story that unfolds after the characters are introduced is an engaging one.  To see how these ladies' lives are \\"knit\\" together while being included in the current \\"project\\" is a testament to Ms. Macomber's talent as a writer and as a knitter.  The tale is spoken through the voices of the characters, in alternating chapters, as they experience the first year of \\"A Good Yarn.\\"  Lydia's story is the only one spoken from the First Person, the others are from the Third Person, almost as if Lydia is a part of the thoughts of the other three women.  This writing technique is not an easy one to develop but Ms. Macomber does it well.  By the end ofthe book, I was attached to each of the lives I had been allowed to witness.  Luckily (big gasp of SURPRISE here) this is the first of a series of Blossom Street books by Ms. Macomber.  Now I get to visit it again anew.<br />There are few swear words in this book and no graphic sex scenes.  The only mention of sex is in context of the hopes of it creating a child and then it is only alluded to (how refreshing).  The characters are real enough to cause the reader to care about what happens to them, including despising, then loving, them - just like \\"real life.\\"  God is mentioned in a positive manner, having one character fall in love with a Youth Pastor who is real, intelligent, accepting and the kind of person the reader would want to know and who one would not be afraid to leave in charge of one's children.<br />I do not plan on making a steady diet of this Genre of Literature in the future.  I will no longer, however, avoid this section out of hand on my visits to my dealer's shops.  It is nice being a true \\"Renaissance Man.\\"

0385737955|4.0|One of the first books of the dystopian tsunami to come out shortly after The Hunger Games, this first book in the trilogy is an interesting one that does a great job of exploring what a bunch of teenage boys stuck together would be like, how they would act around each other, and what happens to them in dangerous situations.  The Maze Runner is done in the style of Lord of the Flies with a great what if?    Thomas wakes up to find himself in an elevator.  He doesn't remember anything about his past or how he got where he is; all he remembers is his name.  The elevator reaches its destination and the doors open to reveal a strange world filled with a bunch of teenage boys.  They've been here for some time, some at least two years, with no knowledge of how they got there or why.  They have food and shelter provided for them, and each day the mighty gates open up to reveal the maze.  In this society everyone has a job; the runners are the ones who spend their days going around the maze looking for a way out.    It doesn't take Thomas long to make friends, but also to make enemies, and it's always a big competition.  Thomas wants to be a runner, but one can't simply just become one, that is until Thomas makes the decision to help two boys stuck outside at night when the gates close, and there are machines out there and they're hungry; no one has ever made it back alive overnight.  There's also the strange fact that a new boy arrives every thirty days, only now for the first time a girl has arrived, and Thomas has a feeling he knows her; he also feels like he's somehow been to this place before, which just seems impossible.    Dashner does a great job of starting with an interesting idea and building and building on it, to keep the reader completely hooked and wanting to know what's going to happen next, right up until the very last page.  He also plays around with the dynamic of a bunch of teenage boys living together and making decisions for each other really well, where fights often break out, as boys will be boys.

030758836X|5.0|A much favored Uncle suggested this book, hinting that it is the best novel of the summer.  I would remove the hint and boldly state this could be the best crime novel of the year.  Naming this a \\"crime\\" novel is misleading, as there are crimes aplenty within the telling of this stunning work of fiction, but they are an undercurrent.  The story is far more complicated, frightening, surrealistic and down-right mind-bending to limit it to a single genre.<br /> Nick Dunne moved to New York City to take a job as a magazine writer.  He meets and marries Amy, a beautiful, wealthy, only child of successful Psychologists and authors and writer of quizzes for women's magazines.  After they lose their jobs, their house and her Trust Fund, they relocate to Missouri, Nick's home state, to care for his ailing parents.  On their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears.  All indications being she was not healthy when she left their \\"happy home\\" and that Nick is the one who caused her to be missing and probably dead.<br />The first part of the book is routine; I felt I had read this book multiple times: girl is missing, is she dead, husband looks guilty.  The atmosphere of this section is lifeless, rote and predictable.  Then, within two pages, the whole tenor of the book changes and what seemed to be a formatted plot became a mesmerizing excursion into madness.<br />S P O I L E R  A L E R T ! ! ! ! ! ! !<br /><br />Ms. Flynn has captured and accurately described a \\"happy\\" marriage between a Narcissist and a Sociopath.  The battle that passes for their relationship is such that only one of them will survive intact, yet each needs the other in order for each to fully live life to its fullest.  This is not a \\"feel good\\" book, it contains graphic violence, very strong language and, particularly in the second half of the book, is filled with the kind of soul-robbing evil only those in intimate relationship can visit upon each other.  Nick knows he has been \\"had,\\" but only his knowledge of Amy will cause his salvation to occur.  Amy sees what Nick can be and will not rest until that potential is realized and used at all times.<br />Ms. Flynn uses the voices of Nick and Amy as alternating narrators for this tale.  The reader is given the occasion to be \\"inside\\" the head of each as they move toward the resolution that is exciting in its horrible reality.  Keeping the story clear while frequently changing perspectives is difficult, but the author does this so well that the reader feels as if both characters are talking directly to her/him without the interference of a written medium.  These voices are so clear that they are echoing in the mind of this reader - MUCH longer than he wants them to.<br />I dreaded completing this book, as it was so well written and the story so crisp and original that coming to its end would be like saying farewell to a delightful individual with whom you would like to get to know better.  I was so relieved to have turned the last page of this book, the plotline being so possible, the writing so welcoming the reader into the depths of a situation from which one only wants to escape that I felt trapped.<br />After reading McCarthy's, No Country for Old Men, I knew I had visited the mind of a genius, but it was not a location I ever wanted to visit again.  I have the same feeling about Ms. Flynn.  I need a week (or longer) to decide if I want to read any of her other novels.  It will take at least that length of time to leave North Carthage, MO and the Dunne home.  PLEASE don't tell them where I live.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|absolutely amazing ! loved it ! all three seasons are amazing ! and I know people that love the old time will enjoy this . Its like watching pride and prejudice times.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Grabs you from start to finish. Flynn does it again with Mitch Rapp going toe to toe with the bad guys.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I have only used this product for about a month.  I love the color and it's ok if you are using the Kindle on a flat area and not having to move it for any reason.  When using it out, sometimes the Kindle falls out of the slots that are supposed to hold it in.  I don't think I could recommend this to anyone at this time but I haven't tried any others out there to compare it too.
044042321X|4.0|For anyone familiar with George R. R. Martin, his work, and the books and authors he likes, it should come as no surprise that his good friend, Daniel Abraham of The Dragon's Path, was the one chosen to adapt his bestselling first novel of his Song of Ice and Fire series, A Game of Thrones.  In the introduction, Martin gives a brief history of how the epic fantasy series came to be and the various adaptations that have been done, including the now popular and successful HBO series.  He also talks about their long search for the right artist to illustrate this graphic novel and how once they found Tommy Patterson; he was the right guy for the job.<br /><br />In the first volume, the events take readers from the welcoming of King Baratheon to Winterfell, to their return to King's Landing with their new King's Hand, one Ned Stark, who was reluctant to take the position, but also is honor-bound to do what his king asks of him.  It is here that he learns from his wife, Catelyn, who he didn't expect to see for some time, that the horrible accident that befell their son Bran was in fact cruelly intended, and shortly after an assassin was sent to finish the job.  The question now is who is behind this and why would this person wish such ill will against the Starks?<br /><br />After the success of the HBO TV show, it was important that this graphic novel not just copy what had already been done, but come out with a new style and look, and Tommy Patterson certainly does this, with sharp detailed lines and glossy colors, giving the story both the grit and harshness, as well as the beauty and grandeur.  Abraham does a good job of adapting the story so far, condensing many hundreds of pages into just a couple hundred illustrated pages.  This first volume will be a delight to fans and a welcome introduction to people new to the series.<br /><br />Originally written on May 14, 2012 ©Alex C.

0439023513|5.0|Writing a trilogy requires at least three things: a tale that will last for three volumes, characters sufficiently developed that the readers will want to know what happens to them \\"next\\" and a consistent plot.  Each volume of the trilogy must be stronger than the previous, or the third installment will have no \\"life.\\"  When a trilogy's last book is the best of the three, the ending apt, surprising and thought provoking, then the author has achieved a significant milestone.  Ms. Collins has certainly achieved such recognition with this final book in her \\"Hunger Games\\" series.  I am sad not to have a chance to sit with Katniss again, but able to breathe to know she will no longer suffer as she once did.<br />I was introduced to \\"The Hunger Games\\" last year by a friend whose opinion about reading material I respect.  Even though it was written for a \\"Teen\\" audience, it was complex and creative enough to hold this cynic's attention.  Meeting the heroine, Katniss Everdeen, was a moment of quiet surprise, an occasion to be introduced to a character who has all the markings of becoming mythical for the description of war.  The things she suffers, along with the rest of Panem (once America), as the result of Political maneuvering, is a present day cautionary tale.<br />When last the reader saw Katniss, she was being whisked away from the Hunger Games by the rebels as the next Civil War began.  She awakes some weeks later deep underground in District 13, the only district largely untouched by The Capital since the end of the last Civil War, 75 years previous.  The current conflict is in full swing and she is quickly confronted with her role in the struggle.  She is to be the face of the rebellion, an image that gives the rebels courage to continue the fight.  She is to become The Mockingjay.  Her efforts in this role are successful when she is allowed to be herself - the caring, courageous, young lady who won the Hunger Games and the hearts of the nation while showing up the Capital's President Snow.<br /><br />The war is shown in graphic detail to the point that this should no longer be considered a \\"teen\\" novel.  There is destruction on an epic scale, a body count in the thousands (the population of Panem is such that each death threatens its ability to reproduce enough people for it to continue) and the devastation of families that is heartbreaking.  This has the feel of being an accurate account of war.  The result of this conflict is painful but realistic, showing that war has victors but no real winners.<br />Perhaps the message in this novel (if there is a message) is the reality of war.  Therein, allegiances are murky, ethics fluid to the occasion and those in authority do not always have the backs of their soldiers.  Fighting a war comes down to getting you and the person next to you home alive, as they have the same aim.  Once \\"home\\" those who fought try, some with a measure of success, to forget that part of their lives.  Then the next generation has to learn what happened to cause the war and what occurred in it in hopes of never having to fight another war.  To date, we have not learned this lesson well enough.  Now that we humans have the capability to not only destroy ourselves but the whole planet, we seem to be running out of time to do so.
B001V5CIFI|4.0|every time i see it , its heart felt and it makes me cry. THe progression of the film is great and the moral of the story.  Great for children!
B0014DW3OS|4.0|Even though you pretty much can surmise that Denzel Washington will come to a bad end, how his saga unfolds is still intriguing.  The supporting actors are very well drawn and make the movie great.  Eve Mendes has a brief appearence in this film and is memorable.  The so called friend of Denzel's character who is killed by the group of conspirators is very well drawn.<br /><br />I could watch this movie many times and still find something new and sublte that would allow me to appreciate it more.<br />Denzel Washington is vicious and criminal but yet he always is smiling and really does know the streets until the streets turn on him causing him to die in the end.

0385738765|4.0|In the sequel to the interesting Maze Runner, James Dashner takes readers to a whole new level of his dystopian world, where they get to see what's going on beyond the \\"maze,\\" and what state the world is really in.  The Scorch Trials continues to do what its predecessor did so well: build up moments to big surprises, and continue to do this throughout the book so that the reader has no idea what's going to happen next.    At the end of the last book, it was revealed that the whole \\"maze thing\\" was a grand experiment to find out who of these children would be the possible savior of the human race.  Now everyone thinks the work is done and they can finally go back to having a normal sense of life, especially Thomas; also they might finally find out about their families and their past.  But this doesn't happen, as the group soon finds themselves left alone once more, and this time they are challenged to travel a great distance in a specific amount of time.  They are running both against the clock and against the other \\"girl group,\\" where whoever wins will be allowed to survive and live.  They must now travel across this scorched land, which has been blighted over time by sun flares, while the virus known as the Flare has ravaged the population.  There are also these zombie-like people known as Cranks, at a stage of infection far along with the virus, who present a formidable obstacle to the group.  Now Thomas will have to use what he has learned in the maze, as well as the knowledge he already has to get them all through this alive, somehow.    The Scorch Trials does what a good sequel should do, in ratcheting up the tension and the fear, as readers don't know who is going to make it to the end, and who will be left dead in the dirt.  It's a harsh world, and this is supposedly all being done to find the perfect human being who will save them all, at least according to WICKED.  Dashner continues to deliver plot twists and cliffhangers that will have readers gripping thepages to the very end and then anxiously awaiting the conclusion in The Death Cure.

B0011UJMK2|4.0|The cover of this book was deceptive to me.  I saw a sports number emblazoned upon the cover and expected to be reading of the struggle and success of a gifted child athlete in a particular sport.  Upon further reading of the information from the blurb offered, my first impression could not have been further from accurate.  This novel is a crime novel, set in Stalinist era USSR, about the \\"conversion\\" of a KGB agent as he discovers a serial killer in that vast land.  The title refers to the forty-fourth victim of a pitiless killer who preys on the most helpless of society - children.<br /> Leo Stepanovich Demidov, a highly decorated soldier, is now a KGB officer commanded to protect Mother Russia from anyone who may be a threat to her.  In the time in which this book is set, a \\"threat\\" could be, and was, anyone who did anything that was suspicious (read \\"everyone at any time is acting suspiciously\\").  The reader meets Leo as he goes to the apartment of a fellow officer whose son's body was found on the railroad tracks near his home.  The child's death has been officially ruled an accident and Leo's job is to have the family accept this ruling.  Even though there is reason to believe the child was murdered, this could not be true, as \\"one of the fundamental pillars of their new society: There is no crime.\\" p. 20 and crime indicated a flaw in the plans for a utopian communist society.  He succeeds in this task.  As he does in the next assignment, but in that one he begins to make discoveries that will turn his well-ordered life inside out.<br /> As he begins to see what is actually before him, he starts to follow the clues of an obvious murder of a child.  Because of the political atmosphere, any unusual death (that did not occur in Lubyanka Prison, that is) was due to subversives, spies, or other outside agitators but never at the hands of a fellow Russian.  Anyone who suggested otherwise was also considered subversive.  Leo and his wife, Raisa, have to navigate thepolitical structure, are arrested anyway, escape, then have to rely upon strangers to help them find this killer only to learn that the killer is someone even more seditious than the former KGB officer could imagine.<br /> Mr. Smith does a tremendous job of bringing the reader into the world of Stalinist Russia.  The betrayals, culture of paranoia, required renunciations of anyone suspected of \\"Anti-Russian behavior, thought or actions,\\" constant lack of needed items, disparity within the  population are enough to cause the reader to feel the fear under which this culture existed.  There are more twists in this novel than can be found in a bag of Twislers; just when the reader begins to gain some clarity into what \\"will\\" happen, the path turns into yet another unexplored area.  The first section was a bit drawn-out as it is setting the tone of the era, once that is achieved the pace picks up rapidly and is held throughout the rest of the book.<br /> This is a book that is not for: children, the faint of heart or those who do not want to learn anything (particularly about this time in Russian History).  It is a definite for anyone who likes a mystery that is not rote, formulaic or easily predicted.  Once started, this whodunit will divert the reader from any other tasks until it is completed.  Time well spent that will be.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|first off the film is so heart felt and the animation is definitely beatiful. But what caught my eye the most is the moral of the story and how much he loved his wife and how the things that he went threw led him to finally have a real adventure to remember. Great story line!
B0056JJY2K|5.0|I believe the film &#34;Shane&#34; to be one of the greatest Westerns of all time. It evokes the era just after the Civil War and also speaks volumes concerning the opening of the West and the conflict between the ranchers and farmers.  Jack Palance got his start in the film and was great as the villian in the peace.<br />That is why I believe this film deserves five stars.  The only westerns that I would put anywhere near this one is &#34;High Noon&#34; and the &#34;Searchers.&#34;

0525952616|4.0|Bestselling author Daniel Suarez delighted readers with his gritty and hard-edged take on technology gone haywire with Daemon and Freedom, and now he's back with his next techno-thriller, Kill Decision, scrutinizing the subject of unmanned drones that cover our skies when we're not looking.  Suarez certainly seems to be fortifying a bridge between the late, great Michael Crichton and Tom Clancy, which fans of either or both will thoroughly enjoy.    Told mostly from the viewpoint of Linda McKinney, a talented scientist and studier of the social structure of ants, known as a myrmecologist, she is soon dragged into a big conspiracy covering the globe and going up to the very top of the United States government involving these unmanned drones.  Her character serves as an excellent perspective to clue readers in to what's going on, as she has very little idea, but at the same time her skills are still important to the mission at hand.  A Special Ops soldier known as Odin \\"recruits\\" McKinney to his elite group to find out who is controlling and targeting these drones to attack specific locations within the United States and ordering the kill decision; it's up to them to get to the bottom of this and prevent an all-out unavoidable war.    Daniel Suarez has once again managed to take hold of a subject that is featured in today's headlines and spin it into a bunch of what ifs that serve to educate as well as terrify.  Told with skill, tension and drama, Kill Decision is a book that won't leave you sleeping easy at night as you imagine those unmanned drones flying overhead.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|Book seemed a little useless until I learned that the last book went in step with this one just from other characters POV. Was insightful to get the story from characters who weren't the original cast and crew.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|this is not a kid movie at all. so i encourage parents to really think twice. Its a more adult film. I have to say it was hilarious for those that do not take life too seriously and that are ok with any type of language and expression. The story line isnt too bad. but it isnt something i havent seen before.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game it very very very adicting. I play this game so much . I don't think ill ever stop playing it. Ps hope too see a part 3

0385738781|3.0|In the final book of the Maze Runner trilogy, James Dashner brings readers once again to a whole new part of his world, this time a look into an actual city outside of WICKED, where readers finally get to see if what they've been told so far is at all true and how harsh this Flare virus really is.  Just as with Maze Runner and Scorch Trials, Dashner continues to delve out one surprise and plot twist after another, keeping the reader on the edge of their seat with sheer excitement.    Thomas is now on the outside with the Gladers that are still alive, having been told by WICKED that the trials are over and the time for lies is no longer; now it's time to see if all this work was worth it.  But he's sick of waiting around for something that might or might not happen, and will the help of some others, they flee the WICKED confines for a slice of the real, Flare-ridden world.  It is a harsh place of haves and have nots, where society is crucially divided by those who are infected or not.  Then there are those, like Thomas, who are immune and are hated by some, revered by others.  But as the Gladers memories are given back to them, Thomas starts to remember a lot more than WICKED expected, and knows what he was involved in, which horrifies him, as he finally comprehends what WICKED is truly about.  As things come to a climax and Thomas realizes now what he must do, he must make the ultimate decision.    For the first three quarters of The Death Cure, the surprise and action is going at full steam, and as it approaches the end, things wind down a little and the finale arrives and is revealed.  It seems a little anticlimactic, after this lengthy build-up of three books that may leave some readers wondering: \\"Wait, why did they go through all this again?\\"  Nevertheless, for other readers it will feel satisfying and complete.

B009VIZDLI|5.0|The Rosie Project is the first novel by Australian author and playwright, Graeme Simsion. Professor Don Tillman is unmarried, and a consideration of the statistics leads him to conclude he needs a wife. While Don's physical attributes and career should make him an attractive prospective husband, his social ineptitude has resulted in a track record of unsatisfactory dating experiences, the Apricot Ice Cream Disaster and the Pig Trotter Disaster being just two examples. He therefore decides to vet applicants for his Wife Project with a 16-page (double-sided) questionnaire, in the interests of efficiency. When Rosie Jarman sweeps into his life, Don quickly concludes that this smoking, swearing barmaid with punctuality problems is entirely unsuitable, yet, against all his rational instincts, he decides to offer his expertise in genetics in the search for her father.  Soon his regimented, logical life is turned upside down: Don learns the danger inherent in judging a person by their occupation, and that not everything in life follows a formula.<br />Simsion has created a very funny novel which also has the reader thinking about emotion and logic, love and friendship, conventionality and non-conformists, and what it takes to modify one's behaviour. This is a fast-paced love story with an interesting twist. Simsion's characters have plenty of depth and the fact that none of them is perfect adds to their appeal. While Don may be wired differently (mentally assessing the age and BMI of everyone he meets, reacting to stress with a spreadsheet or a schedule), he has integrity, focus, enthusiasm and determination, and it is impossible not to feel empathy with him even while laughing at his missteps. And impossible not to shed a tear when he suspects he is incapable of love and therefore unacceptable. This novel is filled with laugh-out-loud moments: a madcap cocktail party, a dance fiasco and a novel escape from a bathroom, to name just a few. Don's highly embarrassing moment with an instruction book, a skeleton and the University Dean is utterly hilarious. The irony of Don delivering a lecture on Asperger's is quite delicious, and who could guess there would be so many inventive ways to obtain a DNA sample! This is a brilliant debut novel. It is no surprise to learn that it won the Victorian Premier's Literary Award for an unpublished manuscript in 2012, and that the rights have been sold to over 30 countries. I look forward to more from Graeme Simsion.

0765334798|4.0|Most scifi fans are familiar with the curse of the \\"redshirts.\\"  For those who are not, it applies to the original Star Trek show where any minor character in an episode wearing a red shirt ultimately ended up getting killed on an away mission before the end of the episode.  Bestselling author John Scalzi takes this humorous concept to a whole new level in his appropriately titled novel Redshirts.    Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the flagship Universal Union Capital Ship Intrepid, to begin work in the ship's xenobiology lab.  It's a dream come true he thinks, but this soon changes.  He quickly discovers there's something very strange going on aboard the Intrepid.  First there's how strange the senior officers act around everyone, and how every time one of them shows up at the lab, Dahl finds himself suddenly alone.  Then there's the fact that the most unlikely ensigns end up going on away missions, even if they have no experience or skills for said away mission.  Then there's Lieutenant Kerensky who often seems to end up on these away missions and almost gets killed or mauled or poisoned every time and just when it seems like he's going to die, the miracle cure is found.  And then there's the \\"black box,\\" a special device that spits out gibberish which the senior officers are always able to understand.  And finally there's the terrifying fact that an astonishing number of ensigns sent on these away missions end up getting killed.  Dahl needs to put the pieces and clues together to figure this out, but he's not sure he wants to know the answer.    Scalzi clearly had a lot of fun writing this book, playing with the tropes and stereotypes that scifi show fans know all too well, as well as pushing it to an all new level.  When the climax of the book is reached, Scalzi begins his three codas which serve a purpose but lack the drive and enjoyment of the earlier parts of the book.  Overall, Redshirts is a fun read that any scifi nerd will eagerly gobble up.Originally written on July 17, 2012 ©Alex C. Telander.    For more reviews, go to [...]
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A believable and gripping story about possible future events. I couldn't put it down. What you'd normally call a page turner, but being an ebook I suppose you'd have to call it a button presser. If you're into true science fiction without a hint of fantasy or the appearance of any space cowboys, then I highly recommend this book.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|the film is from the books and it was not too bad i have to say. I wish it were a bit more graphic but that didnt change that the characters where picked wisely and actors were great.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is an exercise in patience and logic.  It gets increasingly more difficult.  There is variety in the levels and an ability to speed up or slow down the pace of each level so that you can gain mastery.  I play in on my Kindle Fire and have not run across any glitches.  The music is a little annoying when you speed up (it changes pitches with the speed), but that's the only negative I see. I appreciate that this game makes me slow down and practice the art of patience.
0316069434|5.0|Even though I have read all of Harry Bosch stories, I still get excited reading a new one. All of his adventures, some are excellent, some are ok, are never boring. This book is no exception.  Harry tried to solve a 20-year old murder.  Lots of detective work and Harry peeled off the mystery layer by layer. There were several deaths in the book but they were not extremely gory.<br /><br />The author weaved in many little details that enrich the characters. Harry had to deal with his boss, coworkers, his lover, and his daughter. And these relationships are interesting.<br /><br />It looks like the author is going to introduce a new series with Harry's daughter as protagonist when Harry retires. I am looking forward to that.<br /><br />The end came to a satisfying conclusion but seemed a little abrupt to me. There are several threads left hanging but they probably will be addressed in the next book. It's like saying goodbye to a dear friend and I can't wait to see him again in a few months.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I absolutely feel like I have seen finally seen Led Zeppelin!!....because this is the very last time you will ever see them play this music together. They have pretty much said it themselves. At least, the last time Robert Plant will perform it. This was it.....done! I actually got chills watching this concert. The six weeks of rehearsals paid off big time. The sound quality is probably better than it ever would have been &#34;back in the day&#34;. Definitely get the BluRay version, I mistakenly bought the regular version, at a store before Christmas (a gift to myself!) and returned it, because the video quality was not nearly as good. I really feel as though I own a piece of history. A must have for any true Zeppelin fan.....If only John Bonham was on it, but his son sure did his daddy proud on this one. Jason is definitely a chip off the 'ol block.

I also lost my son and mother last year and it gives me great pleasure to think of what they experience.
0765325950|4.0|Brandon Sanderson took over the series masterfully. Despite his sometimes obvious awkwardness writing a few characters, the series picked up with a jolt when he took over. A Memory of Light is the culmination of his effort... and ties up the book nicely. However, despite thrilling conclusions to the stories of Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Elyane, Min, Lan, and others - the two characters you met at first - Rand and Moiraine - are not as favored.<br /><br />That said, I read it cover to cover in one day. I just wish that Rand's part of the Last Battle was more interesting... it doesn't reach, for me, the excitement of the end of Eye on the World, the raid on Falme, or Dumai's Wells. Part of that is due to the Last Battle taking up the lion's share of the book.<br /><br />But part of that is that Rand's struggle is not given the treatment it deserved in this volume.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|the whole idea that you can side with a seriel killer and it justifies in your head, Is enough said for me.  You actually side with him in this. I love this show!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is absolutely, 100% better than the original Temple Run! I say this because you're turning curves while going straight, and there is more environments to explore:) I also think the tilt sensor is better in this sequel than the original, but that is just my opinion:) All in all, this game is 100% awesomeness:)

B000W9399S|2.0|I have been a fan of Douglas Adams for a very long time, and this was recommended to me by someone who claimed that if you liked Douglas Adams you would love the Discworld books.  I was really disappointed.  There is a bit of an interesting story here but it is buried under so much nonsense that you have to work really hard to find it.  Where Adams uses silliness and non sequitur artfully Pratchet uses it like a 14 year old uses that new curse word he just learned; it's just there for the sake of being there it obscures the story instead of enhancing it.

B0053O89JM|4.0|This took House to a totally different level. You could tell all through the season that it was the end, they were out of ideas and pretty much anything went.  I'm still glad I got it to round out my House collection, but its not the quality that the previous seasons were. Plus (SPOILER ALERT) there was no Cuddy, which is one of the characters that I loved.

B0010X73ZG|5.0|Movie arrived quickly and plays beautifully.  The rear of the plastic case is damaged, but the discs were undamaged and are in excellent condition.  I am very pleased.  Outstanding seller!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|very disappointing especially by a guy who has a top-rated show for several years - &#34;Family Guy&#34;.  The voice change for Ted didn't make any sense as why would a 'toy' change voices.  Glad I did it this way as saved me the cost of a DVD/Blu-Ray.  Would've given it a half star if that option was available.  The only saving grace was the performance by Mila.
B002UPA4ZY|4.0|I saw this show 2 years ago on PBS and thought it was great and we bought the CD. This year we wanted to buy the DVD because it would not have all the PBS commercials for contributions and we wanted it for future Christmas' as there is a lack of good Christmas shows. I would have given it 5 stars except I don't care for one of the guest's singing.
0761169431|3.0|I bought this book for my son as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. He is 8 years old and a voracious Lego builder. I know that origami is a bit different, but the instructions really are too difficult for a boy under the age of 10. I even had trouble with some of the more advanced folds. Great idea, but not expect that a young kid will be able to pick it up right away.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|simplistic, idealist and an inverted Cinderella story, the Beauty Woman which did not do well on screen for a guy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|wooooooooooooh amazayn phenominiall extrordinharry brilliam fabulouis yeah baby!!! I love it! best horse game ever!!! plus its free!!!! one direction forever!!!
B0038M2AZA|4.0|Temple Grandin was autistic with such an amazing gift.  You will just marvel over her work and passions in this movie about her life.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Awesome movie. If you liked the first one you will love Game of Shadows. Robert Downey is his witty self again
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone girl was psycho good! Loved it. Lots of twists and turns in this book! Keeps you reading... Get it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this new app! It's a great way to show improvement when it comes to making a second game or app. It's not a lame second app like some other companies make!!!!! Wonderful and fun!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it so much I am looking for someone to friend me so I can invite you so if I send you a friend request accept it please(I am shetlinlover or sadieaaa)&lt;3
B008CLI4N4|5.0|VERY BLOODTHIRSTY, SEXY, AND FUNNY.EVERYTHING YOU'D WANT IN SUCH TYPE OF SERIES. TERRIFIC CHARACTERS, UNFORGETTABLE VILLAINS, STAND OUT HEROES, BEAUTIFUL HEROINES. THIS SERIES HAS THEM ALL. CAUTION: ONCE STARTED YOU DON'T WANT IT TO STOP
B00881PPTO|5.0|Say goodbye to searching a bunch of different websites to find the best prices on airline tickets. You can search for a specific time, date, and price range. This app is great and I been using it to find plain tickets  for a vacation and I haven't found a better price then the ones I find here. Hope this helps you decide if you want to bye it.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Bought for the boyfriend who loves the show.  Not really my cup of tea but some really great acting in it
B004N622EY|5.0|Wow, I'm so glad I discovered this book.  Sanderson has apparently combined two early manuscripts he was playing with into one very cohesive, very clever, very unique story.  It's refreshing not to be surrounded by dragons and wizards.  Instead Sanderson creates dynamic, intriguing characters in a world with a whole new set of rules.  The plot is rich and intricate, and it unfolds with finesse.  A great read.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Enjoyed the twists that were different from the original and the Special Effects were excellent. The acting was so so but so was the acting in the original.
B009GED3HS|4.0|This has not been my favorite season. Things seem unorganized. However, this is one of the best series we've watched as a family (older kids only). It is funny no matter how many times we watch.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Can't wait for the next season a must watch for season 3 cliffhanger and makes you want more even with all of the blood and violence
146920231X|4.0|Very good audio book, however it seems like a NEW take on &#34;Richest Man in Babylon&#34;.  Still good information and great insight.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is great fun, just like the first one. However, it is a lot less sensitive and not quite as fun. nevertheless, this is a great game I would reccomend to anyone.
1451695195|5.0|&#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; lives up to its title - giving pause to one who might be skeptical, which I'm not, but now have something to recommend to them!
1451662432|1.0|Waste of money.  Arnold realizes he totally screwed up with Maria and this book reads like one long apology to Maria in the hopes of getting her back.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was great to read how the story played out. So happy to see a happy ending. Happy to see Pete and Katniss  end up together.
0007466064|3.0|If you think you're getting the whole story. Just stop here and don't buy this. I assume its half. I don't know i only have this book.<br /><br />I really like this story though and want to finish. Story = 5 stars. Packaging = -2
B00B2V66VS|5.0|H high-tech<br />Fish riff on Zombies and a lot to be able the same time for the word game the same way that good I answered right to get to to the only one of people are going to the same way that is a more of people who want not the only way that good I am a lot of people are going to be
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Saw the Lumineers on SNL, ordered the CD - Love their music.  Will definitely look for more of their work.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely love all three of these books! Fifty Shades is a good reminder that everyone has a past, and that past helps shape who we are. You should always get to know someone and try to understand them before you judge them. You never know what you may gain by doing so. I find the story touching and beautiful.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Easy to charge my kindle from PC or other tablet. Cord flexible and secure does not break and was a replacement for original charger for my Kindle Fire, which broke 3 month later.
B00005JKDR|4.0|I LOVE this movie. very funny. Might take the fear of monsters out of children by seeing monsters in a funny light instead of a scary one...but that didn't neccessarily work for my toddlers. My youngest is 3 and i think it was a little too scary for her.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We love every minute of the show!  Compared to what is on television now days, it is a breath of fresh air!
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|Ordered this movie in HD but streamed in SD. After checking that I had an excellent connection i tried it again. It started in HD and buffered back to SD. We streamed another movie in HD after and that one played just fine.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I bought this for my husband.  He loves it. He is hard to buy for but he has watched this movie 3 times since Christmas.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, especially for being free!! Fun game play and pretty nice graphics. Would recommend for anyone who loves horses.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jetpack joyride is an overall good game but it gets boring after awhile. But if you like to have a lot of fun...GET IT!!!<br />.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Los discos Bluray son multizona, trae cada pelicula un disco de special features, y un libro de imagenes de la producci&oacute;n de la trilogia, me gusto mucho.::aunq el envio a espa&ntilde;a fue muy caro, lleg&oacute; sin problemas
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mincraft is a fun home to play and I like how you can play with friends!!! But you only have  a chests to put stuff in so I'm thinking about a dresser to hold armor. Shade for Windows and bunk beads a different type on door and a window I have been thinking about these so... just wondering if u could get back to new high this popboss12@gmail.com is my email
B003LL3LHO|5.0|This book was amazing and always kept me wondering what was human happen next. I loved the book and enjoyed returning to ascalon
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I thought this was areading - but then I  love what Nicholas Sparks has to say.. It was a love storyand worth the reading. I couldn't put it down.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Simple and complex.  Lots of fun, a little suspense.  Fascinating cast of characters.  A good choice for the book club.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Vsgc:-) f2f hfc gdhchghchvbc jfhdgf2f bn gtv dgCool.  Fun awsome definitly a buy and its free Awsome wow wow wow wow
B006LSZECO|1.0|The novel, is divided into three parts.  Part one was well written and presented in an interesting fashion,  Part two began to be somewhat bizarre but still interesting.  But I hated part three so much that it influenced the way I felt about the rest of the book.  I would never recommend this novel to anyone
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Good quality video stream. The movie tries to show Alien movie beginnings, but falls a little short at the end. Almost like the director Ridley Scott wrote it as an afterthought. I did enjoy it for the SciFi aspect. makes you think what our human past could have been.
B008KGWWL6|5.0|I can only second what earlier reviewers have said about this amazing box set that pretty much contains everything Ravel wrote -- even those Prix de Rome cantatas from early on. The artists included here are a who's who of (mostly) French artists, and don't kid yourself, these French musicians know the ins and outs as well as the spirit of Ravel's music. From the first disc that starts with Jean-Yves Thibaudet playing the S&eacute;r&eacute;nade grotesque, Menuet antique and Pavane pour une infant d&eacute;funte to the last disc that ends with Michel Plasson leading a marvelous reading of Ravel's Myrrha (which won second prize in the 1901 Prix de Rome cantata competition, edged out by something by Andr&eacute; Caplet) there is, amazingly, no loser in any of the performances.<br /><br />As earlier reviewers have suggested, you would do yourself a huge favor not to think about it but to simply order this box. You will not regret it, I promise!<br /><br />Scott Morrison
B003QCCS36|5.0|It came quickly and I love every song on the CD.  The jacket was in excellent shape and I have no complaints about this product at all.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|From Season 1 to the present season the story has continued to evolve well.  All in all, a well written and performed story.
1932907009|5.0|even if you're not writing a screenplay. Also, you'll never watch a movie the same way again. It reads like a conversation, and it better, coming from a screenwriter. Get a set of 4X6 index cards while you're at it (you'll understand once you've read the book).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Captivating storylines, incredible writing and character development.<br />I couldn't wait to see this 3rd season after getting hooked watching the first 2 seasons for FREE on Prime Amazon.<br />I was thrilled to have it available, even if I had to pay for this season of it!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this series!
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Wow!!! I really loved this movie!! Really surprised how well Blake Lively did!! \\"/ now I wish I would have bought it instead :( :)
0670021652|4.0|GOOD BOOK ESPECIALLY TRAVELING<br />YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE TRAVELING WITH HER,  SHE IS TRYING TO FIND HERSELF AND<br />SHE DOES IN A WAY UNBELIEVEABLE.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Very happy with this item.  It was for my son.  It looks great with his other Lego buildings.  I would recommend this to anyone that collects the Lego buildings.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each and every episode to date has been incredibly good.  One of the best programs I've seen!  The acting is superb - Maggie Smith is a force to be reckoned with!  I hope to see more of Shirley MacLaine.
1616550414|4.0|Every fan should have this! Beautiful in every way, but come on!  Every corner on this book is bent to hell and back.  As beautiful as this book is down to the binding, printing, paper is perfection, and such a great bargain.<br /><br />But please for the love of god, gods, goddesses, the great nothing pack this book better!  It should be just as pristine as when it was put into the box!  Bubble wrap on the front and back covers, but nothing to protect the edges.  AHHHHHHH!!!<br /><br />Anyways buy this book, but beware of shipping.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I wish it were easier to change between the versions or compare them side by side. I do like the idea of being able to pull the different translations, and compare them.
B004GF244K|5.0|Excellent product; enjoyed seeing it so much! Brought back many good memories of a musician very important in my life and professional career.
0062082353|4.0|Very interesting book.  There were too many acronyms for me to remember and had to sit and read continuously instead of sporatically b/c I couldn't remember what happened if I didn't. could be somewhat confusing to non-military person
B009FZFONO|5.0|I tuned in every week and still watched it on amazon prime, I highly recommend this show it's cooler than all the other zombie stuff out there
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game guys I think its very addictive you just cant stop playing.but sometimes its just a little hard to turn.but the game is still very good.loveeee it!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This download wasn't anything too special at all and that's why i rated it only 3 starts.  I don't have it on my kindle any more so that's another reason didn't rate higher.
B00637D114|5.0|Great movie.  My 5 yr old granddaughter watches it over and over again.  Good prices on amazon.  Will buy more.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Love the catchy quality of &#34;Thrift shop&#34; combine with the poignant message of being swindled by consumerism. The vocals of Ray Dalton and pure enthusiasm in &#34;Can't hold us&#34; is contagious. An amazing album for 25 to 35 year olds, all the generational keystones are in prevalent in Macklemore lyrics and Ryan's clever spinning.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Much better than first one. The only thing I didn't like was the addition of a &quot;save me&quot; button. It really changes the flavor.
B005HSL626|3.0|This download wasn't anything too special at all and that's why i rated it only 3 starts.  I don't have it on my kindle any more so that's another reason didn't rate higher.
1451695195|4.0|Good book...very comforting to after life.  It is good to see someone from the science field explain about what happens after death.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't particularly find these characters believable.  I understood the flaws of each, but their character and their actions didn't really mesh in my mind.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Reading this book wasn't bad but I just didn't feel a connection. After a hard night of alcohol Megan wakes up to discover she is married to Conner. She wants a divorce, but he doesn't. Persuading her into giving their marriage a three month trial, she agrees. Although, this marriage isn't based off of love, it's based off a partnership, an understanding between two people. Which has Megan a bit skeptical as to whether or not she can trust Conner. But he isn't prepared to let her leave and will use everything he's got to make her give their marriage a chance.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Only had this application 2 days and so far so good.  Just like anything its great for the 1st few days and you use it a ton,  time truly will tell if something else pops better than this.  This is primarily used for my 5 year old son.  At times he struggles as it can move a bit quicker,  would be nice if there were a few different levels of difficulty with it.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I also, enjoy the Hidden Numbers Game, it is easier to find the numbers<br />than the letters.  (For me anyway).  It is another way to sit and relax and have fun.<br />Thank You.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Actually I cannot comment as this was a gift for my son.  He did say he really liked the movie
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a good book but after you find out her secret you pretty much know what will happen. I do like the friend twist that was an added bonus.
1451695195|5.0|This is such an amazing and open perspective that smoothly weaves the writer's past and present life into the experience.
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|My experience with said stedicam, is one of hardship, due to cheap hardware (i.e. the screw that held the weighted section broke, leaving the device useless) I could spend the time and efforts to re-machine it, but what a pain.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Actually I cannot comment as this was a gift for my son.  He did say he really liked the movie He asked for it for Christmas to complete his collection
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft. Is. The. Best. Game.  In. The.  World.  I. Like.  Killing.  Zombies.  A.  Lot . And. I like.  Building. A.  Lot. To
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|Completely black and white, this is a movie that will be most appreciated by those who enjoy classic films. Anthony Perkins is excellent, as are the rest of the cast . The &#34;horror&#34; does not really compare to the horror flicks of today, but it is a &#34;must have&#34; to complete any movie collection.
0143119680|5.0|I haven't actually read the book yet, but it was substantially cheaper and in brand new condition. I am very pleased.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I love this CD!  I can listen to the entire thing, I don't need to skip any tracks on it.  Best album yet!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Lots of fun until the game force quits my Kindle Fire back to the app carousel midgame. Just got booted from a marathon high score breaking run when I tried to use a 2nd Save Me. Lost my coins from that run and now it says I have -2 gems! WTF? Fix this maddening bug and it's easily 4 or 5 stars.
0763644765|5.0|One of the best Patricelli books! Funny, light hearted, encouraging, and tactful. Great little book. One of my baby's favorties.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|I owned this movie on DVD, but needed to have it on Blu-ray, especially with the bonus features- which are awesome. good service. Good price.
B001U887M4|5.0|I love these crocs, they are so comfortable and they work either winter or summer, they keep your feet warm. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants a comfortable shoe, the one thing I did find is, you need to order a size bigger because of the lining.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|With no offense to the author, I found the book to be disappointly dry.  I was expecting a book of retrospective interviews along the line of &#34;Warday&#34;.  The interviewees weren't written in a way that made them particularly interesting.  Certainly, those who had survived such a holocaust would be emotionally injured for life.  Still, I wanted to care, because I wanted very, very much to enjoy this book.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|If you love Andrea Bocelli, you will love love this.  I have the CD in my car too.  But to see him and the other singers in person is awesome. The DVD was shipped quickly and in excellent condition.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|I owned this movie on DVD, but needed to have it on Blu-ray, especially with the bonus features- which are awesome. good service. Good price.
B0054XOMX4|4.0|Cool toy for boys who love to collect these. My son has been playing with this since Christmas non-stop. Lots of fun!
B0042RJWTC|4.0|The Tudors: brutal with interesting historical inaccuracies. Some of the disks have skips and other problems. Wish it had subtitles.
B008UX8G5A|5.0|This was a great and fluid read, Alison really did the history justice by bringing the characters alive.  I recommend this to anyone looking to add depth of knowledge after watching Showtime 's Tudors.
B0059XTUEK|5.0|Saw this film and actually had the DVD, but needed it in Blu-ray. It is perfect and I am VERY happy with my purchase!
B004KKX80A|4.0|The assembly was a bit difficult since the instructions came in a different language.  I had to go to Youtube to figure out how to put it together.  Once completed, my son loved it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is fun because it is more challenging then the first one. And with better graphics and other things to it just feels better. Thx
B0042VJ1PI|2.0|The books are not as entertaining as the TV show. Although the tie-ins are interesting, both to the show and to Nathan Fillion's Firefly character, this book was disappointing.
0316077054|5.0|This book is amazing. The actual book itself was a little worn, but I was so mesmerized that it didn't matter. shipping was pretty regular; not quick, but not the &#34;estimated&#34; millions of weeks of waiting.
B0055SWM08|1.0|Ok this  game is kind of fun but it's REALLY annoying how I have to use my yellow gem things that do not come often  to get a stupid  HINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean really you idiots this is annoying I'm giving it ONE star because I'm soooooooooooooo annoyed
B00B2V66VS|5.0|really awesome game - fun and addictive - love the new features like the coal car and zip lines better and brighter graphics
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love Mahjong games but I wish I could find one that is not timed,  I will be looking for more Mahjong games to play.
B0013ND30W|5.0|I owned this movie on DVD, but needed to have it on Blu-ray, especially with the bonus features- which are awesome. good service. GREAT price.
B000FC12Z0|4.0|I can't say that I'm the biggest Christie fan but she remains a master of the genre and some of her books are still worth reading and even re-reading. Every 3-4 years, usually in the dog days of the summer, I'll pick up \\"Orient Express\\" and reread it. Given repeated readings I know exactly whodunnit and every twist and turn of the plot but it doesn't matter. I still enjoy the hell out of this book and I'll probably read it again once August gets here. In the end there's just something about a murder on a snow bound passenger train that resonates with book lovers everywhere.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The second season was filled with as much drama if not more than the last - it is fabulous to see all the characters go through their individual journey's and how their relationships collide with one another. I think this series is composed of some extremely talented actors. I especially love seeing the historical depiction of the classes of the times and wondering at the dramatic differences in society today.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great fun, new images....fun to run...glad it's expanded and new!!!  Great for my granddaughters as well...we play against each other...very, very fun game!
B00992CF6W|5.0|i loved this game so much on the computer and I love it just as much on my kindel. thank you mojang!
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|This appeared to be a \\"copy\\" or pirated version of the authorized movie. Not sure I'm comfortable with this purchase.<br /><br />However, I also purchased \\"Dragon Tatoo TRILOGY\\" Extended Edition which contains 4 DVDs of the Swedish Series.  This is a MUCH BETTER PURCHASE then the American version starring Daniel Craig.  In fact, they should have released this Series in American theatres! Even though the Series is \\"dubbed\\" in English, you would almost never detect it, as the dubbing is excellently veiled.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This Season is one of my favorites, and even going back to watch it a second time it is still filled with enjoyable segments.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app and it might be a little over priced but I will still pay 6.99 for it because it's entertaining and fun.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a great game! I like how you can play with fb friends!<br />User friendly and phenomenal play on the Kindle Fire?<br />The price is free, to download app.!<br /><br />I just don't like the &quot;energy thing.&quot;<br />That can be frustrating when building. But, I understand the reasoning behind this feature.<br />Still, I absolutely love OT! Once again, Gameloft has hooked me in!<br />Keep up the fantastic game app creations!<br />Thank You!
0307595579|5.0|I am quite Pleased with my purchase and the &#34;Quality.&#34;  I wish all 3 books had been Hard cover, but I knew in advance what I was ordering.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I know many people don't find this show funny - but I do, and I love the characters and their development. I think the actors are talented and create a delightful chemistry, and  I am always looking forward to seeing where the writers take them next.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT IS CHALLENGING AND NOT THAT MUCH CHALLENGING I also loved the um.. you know fun stuff
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book kept my interest and imagination running wild from page 1! It's a Romeo and Juliet type story that meets HBOs show, Carnivale. I would definitely recommend this book as a must read.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Now any time The Queen herself applauds your portrayal of herself, you KNOW this movie has to be a Winner!!
0802473156|5.0|This book has gotten some scathing reviews as being something that could be summarized in a brief article. While that may be true to some degree, it is still a book that holds important reminders to things that of course seem obvious but are so often and easily forgotten and overlooked. People sometimes need reminding about the simplest concepts when it comes to looking at another person with perspective on how they feel and how they interpret our actions. I also thought hearing about the individual situations was touching and inspiring.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Equally as good as The Pillars of the Earth, the &#34;sequel&#34; was a book I could not put down either.  I put sequel in quotes because the book jumps 200 years foward in time.  It does, however, reference characters from the prior book.  I loved this book and would highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun and fast with tons of excitement! Great for any age. Highly recommend it to friends. Gonna play it now! Enjoy!
B003UESJH4|5.0|Not only is the movie heartwarming, dramatic, and powerful, but even the Special Features have the viewer mesmerized!! Dy-No-Mite!! Every actor starring deserves an Oscar!!
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|This was an enjoyable story with likable characters and humorous parts, as well as being filled with plenty of creative plots and characters (such as the determined horse who so loyally serves his soldier-master to a point of obsession).
B006LSZECO|4.0|I recently found Gillian Flynn as an author and have read all three of her books which have all been very good and definately kept me reading! Although I think Dark Place and Sharp Objects had much better endings than this one, it was still a good book and I am glad that I read it. It was a very interesting tale that kept you guess the whole time and just as soon as you think you know what is happening, switcho chango you get thrown for a loop! I would highly recommend her books if you are looking for a little bit darker mystery! I just hope she writes a new one soon!
0151003084|5.0|A little nasty, a little weird and a lot amazing! I loved this although I know people who would think it was in extremely poor taste. The sense of humor and the art are simply wonderful!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|If you've ever found Bristish History boring, this Series will surely Change Your Mind!! The enactment of the Tudor era is thoroughly exciting when viewed thru the lens of this Director & Writers. It took me 4 days of dedication, but I watched this series in it's entirety during the time. Then, I leisurely viewed it again! Each viewing yields some information you missed before. I<br />m generally free with lending my DVDs, but Not this set! LOL
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game is really fun to play but the glitches are insanely annoying. Temple run #1 is about the same thing as temple run #2
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read, and I am not the kind of person who just sits down and reads anything.  You don't want to put it down once you've started reading.  Hope they come out with another trilogy with Christian's perspective.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I liked it but after a while it wouldn't open a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a aaaa
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautifully done and the script keeps you coming back for more. The drama is not made-up Hollywood drama. It feels more like real life drama with normal, real life reactions. I could listen to the opening music all day. And I check my Kindle every morning for a new episode!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Well...this app is the favorate app by many.  Use everyday and most of my ipad time.  Google current is similar one and also good.  But Flipboard has better interface and control....Google current may have better contents? not sure...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great book!  I could not put it down.  I read it in a day.  I loved the characters & story.  The ending was great.  Author made you feel like you were right there in the Hunger Games!  I will definitely recommend this book.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|lots of fun showing your friends a real conversation piece more fun tha rubber dog doo...im sure kids will like it but we had lots of laffs at the office
B009FZFONO|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW! I own every single season out. My only suggestion is DO NOT BUY THIS ONLINE IF YOU HAVE CONSUMABLE INTERNET, such as a tmobile hotspot... BIGGEST mistake ever... the season cost me much more by downloading over that internet, but sans that.... EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT
B0064X7FVE|5.0|great for weather app for iOS, Android platform............there are a few other apps for weather, but I end up using this one...
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down from start to finish.  I could picture the mother and son in their limited environment and hear them speak as I read.  It is definitely a story of love and survival.  The strength of the mother, who protected her son from the reality of their existence and the man who put them there is amazing.  Emma Donoghue has quite an imagination for showing how isolation from the real world causes a unique lifestyle and language, especially on the part of the boy.  I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates fascinating story.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is so much fun, the only problem is that it is addicting!  It stands apart from other games of this style because you accumulate coins faster so you can do so much more without feeling that you have to spend real money to enjoy it.
B000VNMMWA|5.0|I love this movie, so much so that I have the regular and the walmart edition. So when I saw the price on this ultimate edition drop down, I was ecstatic. Box was shiny and new, discs seem perfect and it arrived very fast. For the Hot Fuzz fan that can't get enough of their favorite movie!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|When I was looking for the first Hunger Games I found this, the entire trilogy combined into one book. If you bought each book individual if would've been ten dollars a book. With the trilogy set it cost 18. Basically one book free and one twenty percent off. A great deal.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|Part I was pretty good, but part II was a real blast to watch. I was surprised at the level of violence in this film. This Joker makes Ledger's Joker seem somewhat tame. Definitely worth a watch. Is it as good as Batman: Under the Red Hood? Not really, but it's definitely one of the best DC Animated Original Films I've seen.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is a great app that lets users read the bible on their phones or tablets. You even earn badges!It's really cool!
0345803485|1.0|1 could not finish this book.  My younger friends love it. I felt it went in a dangerous direction. Not safe to trust anyone who likes to inflict pain.

0307700879|4.0|Michael Ondaatje weaves a web of memories with Hana, Caravaggio, Kip, and Almásy in his novel The English Patient. Near the end of World War II, Hana the nurse tends to her last surviving patient. Caravaggio the thief and Kip the Indian sapper accompany her within the deserted Italian villa. Each character searches for their identity through the remnants of war and forbidden romances.<br /><br />Every night, Hana opens a book at any random page to read to the English patient, and Ondaatje tells his stories in the same way: with unconventional yet interlaced narratives. There are multiple realities as the point of view shifts from one character to another, rejecting the idea that only one version of the story exists. Along with the unusual narrating is Ondaatje's beautifully crafted prose. They are lyrical and elegant, flowing like waters over a smooth riverbed. His detailed, poetic metaphors create indelible imagery. The tense shifts back and forth from present to past, and settings change randomly as each character's past unfolds.<br /><br />The fragmented anecdotes are like a mysterious jigsaw puzzle. It begins with a vague plot; the storyline almost unrecognizable and certainly difficult to follow. The novel's melancholic atmosphere may become frustratingly sullen, tragic, or even futile. Readers must have the patience to tolerate and wait: once the narrative smoothes out, a whole new perspective will open. As the identity of the English patient is revealed, so are the inner selves of the rest of the characters.<br /><br />Ondaatje creates a sensuous atmosphere through lush diction and poetic metaphors. The story seems to begin aimlessly, yet ends with an invaluable collection of profound themes. Readers discover the clash between nationality and identity through Kip; the power of love through Almásy; the inescapable destruction of war through Hana and Caravaggio. The English patient is a web of traumatic memories that challenges readers to reconsider the nature of love, war, and identity.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Had no idea this was a story about 2 slutty females trying to have sex with slutty boys.  Must have read the wrong review.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Seems like a pretty great free game. Patience is required and some items require &quot;real&quot; money to get but it's worth trying out.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|Excellent plot line with intricate twists and turns. The action was slow in places, but the denouement was very fitting and satisfying. Very well done.

B000FCK65W|4.0|I haven't read a book in 10 years. My New Year's resolution was to read more books and this definitely didn't let me down. The story is well written and provides great insight into the early 1900's Brooklyn.

B008S4FZHI|5.0|Loved reading the new Kay Scarpetta book. Had trouble putting it down. Well worth the read. Anyone who loves crime/mystery thrillers will love this book.
B002WYH5N2|4.0|This is the very first time, a movie, bring me so many times to a theater!<br />and after i purchased the DVD, i watched it for more than 100 times more...<br /><br />young spirited Keira as Lizzy is very nice,<br />and McFadyen as snobbish Mr. Darcy is totally wonderful,<br />and really handsome too!<br /><br />I watched the Collin ehle version with BBC,<br />what i really enjoy with the bbc version is because it's a mini series,<br />more than 3 hours long in duration, so i really enjoyed the movie flows..<br /><br />the only reason i give this movie P&P 2005 as 4 stars,<br />is because its too short,..if only they can make it 3 hours at least...<br />i'll give it 100 stars...<br />anyway, it is a really really must have movie!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Graphics are good overall, but I did have a few issues at first with freezing. My daughter enjoys petting and grooming the horse.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|wife and i started listening to him a few years ago, great artist and great album. next stop we want to go to his concert.
B005MP28B2|5.0|Meditative and seductive. Some people may not like it for its unique narrative approach, but worth watching for cinematography alone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. Just like playing at the carnival. The best buy is that it is free. I recommend it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I Read all 3 books, and I could not put either of them  down. I would recommend this read to anyone.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Just enough current events to make it seem possible, could not put it down. Not Clancy's best but very good
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The opening page of about two thirds of the chapters were omitted in the Kindle edition and it took a while to figure out what was going on. I hope I can be sent a new edition where this has been corrected. Also the story line was a bit overloaded with coincidences and bravado, especially on the part of Carla Ulrich. Still, it is a good chronicle of the period and Follett's skill as a writer makes it unputdownable.
1416549447|5.0|Excelente. Muy bueno para aquellos que quieren mejorar sus condiciones y aprender unsa técnicas innovadoras que ayudan a evitar lesiones. y mejorar los tiempos.<br /><br />Llegó en ele tiempo adecuado.

I just got to figure how in the world I'm going to come up with the funds to buy the game, so that I may continue on this one and the other one I love so much!! I'm anxious to see how it ends!! I do so recommend this!

B002TLSSXO|5.0|A nice package that includes nearly every kitchen utensils that you need. Loved them so much that I ordered two more sets as gifts.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|had issues with yhd first one..  between limitations of my device and some slow running parts of the game, I got to a point at which I really cant do any more other than sheer luck.  this was is much better in functionality and in acheivable objectives.  Terrain is much improved..  and I like the instant powerups.  so far so good...and much much better than original.

B003ODIZL6|1.0|This is a great Kindle dictionary!! If you didn't know this word then this is the place to come! (-:
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|It's a great book, the only reason I gave this a four star rating is for the amount of detail. There is a lot of detail. While reading, I would get so lost in the detail, I would get disconnected from the characters' conservation and have to go back and re-read to remember what was last said.<br /><br />The overall pace of the book starts out strong making it hard to put the book down, then it slows down; that's when I'm flooded by detail. Afterwards, the book constantly gains speed and keeps you glued to the pages until the end.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver is a great writer and she is very good at painting a scene in your head.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I love Avatar. Could not imagine not owning it. I do wish it was on one disk instead of two. But I will live with that if that is what is necessary to own the movie. A wonderful story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and easy to play with numerous helpful hints. Everything is presented in clear and realistic dynamic graphics. Sometimes the updates are a bit laggy but nothing too bad.
B005V20JKI|5.0|this is a great game. it is very addictive and very fun. my 3 year old even loves playing it!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I rate this a four and not a five only because some of the medical terminology was difficult for me to understand.  The message is clear. Love, hope, and life everlasting. Would recommend to any and all.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely glorious!  A reason to watch television has arrived....and once again, the Brits show us how. Every episode is beautifully written and wonderfully brought to the screen.  This show could run forever...and we'd still want more!

1250007208|5.0|Cinder is one of those books that has been getting a lot of hype since ARCs were first sent out. I'm always a little apprehensive going into a book that so many people have loved but I'm happy to say that Cinder now has one more fan. This is one Cinderella retelling that has not been done before and you won't want to miss out on it.<br /><br />Cinder is a very clever retelling of the original Cinderella story. Cinder is part human, part cyborg, yet still just as much of an outcast as in the original. She has a very nasty stepmother but instead of two evil stepsisters, she has one evil one and one nice one. There is of course a handsome prince but that is only a part of the story. The real story here is the story of the Lunars, a race of people who live on the moon, and whose queen, Levana, wants to take over the earth. It's up to Cinder to save her people and maybe find love along the way. Oh and there's a plague threatening the lives of everyone too. Because, you know, an evil moon queen with mind controlling powers wasn't bad enough.<br /><br />Cinder is a character readers will immediately sympathize with. She feels unwanted, unloved, and kind of worthless. She never knew her parents and her stepfamily has never wanted her. It seems like the only thing she is good at is being a mechanic. Well, that and getting into trouble. She's very good at that as well. Both her skills as a mechanic and her knack for getting in trouble bring notice to her from the prince, Prince Kai. Kai is a very good guy in a very bad place. He's barely an adult and he will very soon be crowned emperor. With this coronation comes the advances of the lunar queen as well as way too much responsibility. He's another character that readers won't be able to help feeling for. The characters are definitely what make Cinder such a good book. Cinder, Kai, Iko, Peony, they were all so wonderful (but especially Iko, the house robot with quite a sense of humor.)<br /><br />The plot is rather predictable but surprisingly that didn't really bother me. There were enough twists to the original Cinderella story that I still found Cinder greatly enjoyable. The fresh setting, the futuristic elements, the wonderful characters, and the completely gripping story kept me interested and by the end I was in love. While the ending is a bit of a cliffhanger I wouldn't call it a terrible one. Fans will be pleased with the ending but I think it will also leave them wanting a bit more.<br /><br />Overall, Cinder is one of the best retellings I have read in a while. It's a fabulous start to Marissa Meyer's Lunar Chronicles and I am very eager to read the rest of her retellings!but surprisingly that didn't really bother me.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was AMAZING!!! Thank you Colleen for keeping my nose buried in this kindle & out of the real world! Haha...so connected to the characters- I LOVE me some Dean Holder, you are one creative, imaginative lady!! Kudos & please keep it up! :)
0743289692|5.0|A very good inside look at the culture and religion.  first hand info that gives information valuable to understanding this and getting a different perspective.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So far so good I'm loving it!! Cant wait to see what else is in store I know I'm gonna hate for this game to end
B005USZYDU|4.0|Best book ever if u like lawyers and stuff like that it's slow paced and not a lot of action but it's suspenseful.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle and Beckett are as fabulous as ever. Great dialog and on-screen chemistry make this show super entertaining. Love it!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Its now one of my favorite books! the characters were lovable and I cared about them. It wasn't a very short read in fact it had substance to it that the huge novels lack really good recommend it to everyone!
B001TKD4ZI|3.0|So this was a cheesy romance with vampires. Nothing wrong with that. I enjoyed the mystery aspect, but the two main characters were too often too stupid to really get behind. I've got no problem believing that characters are fated, love at first sight, etc. But when you take that and then couple it with really stupid decisions that they make, it just makes you think \\"get over yourselves already\\".<br /><br />At one point, Shanna leaves. Roman knows they are linked telepathically. So why doesn't he just ASK HER WHY SHE LEFT? But no, he gets all huffy and angst-filled and thinks she doesn't care for him. This happens more than once. Also, I had a hard time believing that a 500 year old man wouldn't have a slightly better idea of how to treat a woman.<br /><br />That said, this was a good beach read. It's quick, there's action, some semi-hot sex, and a good ending (even if the title does sort of give it away). I would have preferred to see more of Shanna's relationship with her father though. That got glossed over in the ending scenes.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|beautifully written  for any reader over 18. I would buy his books without hesitation. I'm sorry i only just discovered him - but I'll catch up!
B003Y3BMG6|2.0|TL;DR- I only paid 20 bucks and I still feel ripped off.<br /><br />Believe the hype, believe the haters.  I didn't believe for one second that the vinyl would sound as bad as the CDs, but it is in fact worse.  It sounds like someone played the CD, put a wet towel over the speaker, cranked the volume until it distorted, held a microphone up and recorded that to the vinyl.  When I first put it on my player there was so much distortion and clipping that I was sure something was wrong with my needle or setup.  I cleaned everything, realigned, and tried again to no avail.  Then I put on ANY other record and confirmed everything sounded fine.  It's a shame too because although the artwork is ugly (in my opinion), it's a very well done jacket including poly lined sleeves and the vinyl itself is absolutely dead quiet and pressed on center... the pressing is honestly higher quality and quieter than 99% of everything I own.  There is one major mark against the manufacturing however-- all 6 sides have almost no lead-in groove.  Although there is plenty of room, there is only 1 spiral in the whole 1/8\\" space which leaves me completely unable to lower the needle on to the spinning record without having it skip 10 or more seconds in to the first song.  This is true of all 6 sides.<br /><br />Music-wise it's a decent selection in all regards except for Pretty Noose live on SNL.  I watched that episode live in 1996 and remember thinking how awful the performance was, so I'm not exactly psyched to have it immortalized here.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|I had this movie on Beta Max, VHS and had to replace them with the DVD. Can't miss seeing it again and again.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I have not listened to this album, but the person to whom I gave it has repeatedly testified to its quality.  If you are a Bee Gees fan, this is a must.
034580404X|5.0|I love these books.  I will admit that in the first book I did not like  the girl. And in the second, I got to liking her a lot. By the third book I was loving this girl.  People who read these books will get an idea of an alternative lifestyle that is full of fun, adventure, and love. I wish there were more books like these.
B005H29GSI|4.0|Angry Birds is such a popular video game that I thought this would be worth trying.  Most kids love the video game so I think they would like this one too.  The reason why 4  stars?  When trying to set up the game on my carpet in the liviing room the pieces fell over on their own.  I put them on  a book cover then they were ok. If your carpet isn't as think as mine or you have a floor that isn't carpeted it should work fine.  It isn't as easy as it looks to play so adults can find it interesting too.  If you like Angry Birds I think  you will like this game.  It isn't very expensive either. I will have some kids try it too and I will add their thoughts also.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|So well done to expose the problems of the treatment of Negroes, Blacks, Coloured, or whatever other names applied to that situation.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great running app. Good graphics but it takes a long time to do your daily challenge. And the people are pricey but you can get money from the special boxes. This is a great app and will last hours and hours of fun. Plus it's free!!!!!!

B00005JM02|5.0|I saw the movie and made up my mind then an there I had to have it to watch many times whenever I wanted. The voice of Ellen was so well done.

B005M5OSBK|5.0|Yes, I LOVE this CD!! It really is unique and great fun.  I love the Italian, French and Spanish songs the most, but the entire CD is top notch.  Pink Martini would be great to see in concert.
B005775OBG|5.0|It was just as described. Die cast, seems durable like all the other Mattel Cars toy cars. They stand up to many hours of playing.
B000P0J09W|5.0|A really fun movie with the usual antics of kids coping with villains. But this one is really well done with the villains getting their just desserts and the kids saving the day for their parents.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this story so much I read it in one day. It had some very sweet moments that appealed to the romantic in me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These three books were very well written.  They are easy to read and easy to hold your attention.  You can put it down and pick it up and you never lose your train of thought.  I personally loved all of them.
B009GX69RK|5.0|New Girl is awesome. One of my favorite shows. It is pretty much non-stop laughter. All of the characters are awesome.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|I have heard computer people make disparaging remarks about this movie, but they are obviously lacking in knowledge of the early days and don't have the imagination to slip over into the land of pretend. I'm fascinated by it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game makes you think about how to connect the lines.  The colors are nice<br /><br /> and bright against the background.
B000WCDI5K|2.0|not the quality of music that i would expect from this fantastic group. I love this band but this offering was very uninspiring
B009YP9L7U|5.0|So cute. Very unorthodox but adorable! Will read again I'm sure. Great dialogue and graphic scenes are to die for!!
B00003CXC7|5.0|Great cast! Such a surprise to see Raymond Burr in the early days. I finally was rewarded (after watching the third time), finding Hitchcock's sneaky entrance.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|My daughter wanted a Draculaura Doll for Christmas. I didn't want to spend an exorbitant amount of money, so I found this one for a decent price. I am a happy customer.
B003XL6EKS|5.0|one of the most beautiful albums ever. Also Brandon Flowers is a guy who actually know how to sing, not screech.
B0033TJATW|5.0|I actually got this DVD for a friend. She does not have a credit or debit card so I ordered it for her and she had paid me back for it. When she first got the DVD, there was Chinese writing on the front of the cover, she was paranoid that it was in Chinese and having opened it, it could not be returned. She watched it, and sure enough it was in English. Besides the Chinese writing on front, she loves the dvd and is very satisfied and I am sure she would recommend this to anyone out there.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This Mic is great! the only thing I have negative to say about it is that the filter on the mic head never stays on, but other than that it is a great product. I thought I would have problems with the mic being corded, but the cord is SOOO long that i find myself trying to find a place to put it when shooting.
B000641D2Y|5.0|I love the movie, my kids love it...A must see for Christmas! We watched it three times during our two week vacation from school/work!

B00A3DZ61W|3.0|so o fcourse i got it. i play it when im bored, when im trying to find something to do and my task list is all crosses off. so its good but gets boring. but its starwars :)
B008B8A9V8|5.0|I haven't read through all of this yet but it's a great help already for those projects that I make up myself (and I tend to do a bit of that).  I've been knitting for what I thought was a long time and I've only known about a few of the cast on's and bind off's in this book. I can see this as a handy reference for years to come.  The only thing about it as a Kindle book is that I don't have a Kindle Fire.  This is best viewed in color, so I use the Kindle App for my iPad & it's wonderful.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|FANTASTIC THANK YOU NICHOLAS. LOOKING FOREWORD TO YOUR NEXT BOOK. LIKE ALL YOUR BOOKS HAVE READ THEM ALL.THANKS DON  COLSON
B004FP1WX0|3.0|I wanted it to go more in development of the relationship between Nev and Meg. There was little given to that and more given to the end of the story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so well-written and moving. I cried a countless number of times and I cannot stress how one's outlook on life will change after reading this book
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I loved this case from the minute I opened it. I loved the color and its sturdy material. The case works beautifully.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Charming fantasy that takes you away from the ordinary.  Mystery, intrigue, love - it has it all.  You will be glad you tried this one!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|My kids told me to get this game because they are addicted.  But it never did download into my Kindle so I can't say how good it is.  Apparently Amazon screwed up with this one.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Oh my God this is the greatest book I think I have read in a very long time. I think I cured through most of it. Especially the epilogue. It is definitely a must read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love it so much more than temple run 1 I love the big monkey .It Is the best .I think everyone should get it.:)
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is a very good product and protects the kindle from scratches.  I bought it because my sister liked hers.
B0099KDSVK|5.0|My SOn loved these movies as a young child and he was floored I found them on Blue Ray for him to show his daughter =)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I read the book all in one time because I just could not put it down! A wonderful children's book:-)
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Had the first 3 seasons on DVD. Stopped buying them so I could upgrade to BluRay. This was the best TV show on at the time. And I still find it very enjoyable. Wish there were more quality shows like this on now.
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|Everyone recommends this book but I was a bit sceptical about it at first. I thought it was going to be just 'on writing' so I was disappointed to discover that the first half is autobiographical. King talks about his own life and the things that influenced his writing, and contrary to my expectations it is very entertaining and interesting. He comes across as a down-to-earth person who hasn't let his fame and fortune go to his head, and the knowledge gleaned from his years of experience is invaluable.<br /><br />I enjoyed his discussion of themes and symbols, particularly when he analyses his own work. Misery was written when he was in the throes of alchoholism and drug addiction, and in hindsight he believes the character of Annie Wilkes symbolises what drugs and alcohol were doing to him. Fascinating. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in writing or just for Stephen King fans in general. The only downside for me was the fact that this book was written before epublishing became so popular. I'd love to read about Mr King's views on the epublishing revolution and what it means for writers today.
B0099KDSWY|5.0|My son loved these as a child and was so excited to get them now to watch with his daughter
B008X9Z37A|2.0|My kindle would slide out and the corner handles didn't hold it good enough. THAT IS WHY I'M RETURNING IT.
B004YXE438|3.0|This wasn't bad. Some puzzles were challenging. I got this primarily for my kid to play on my Kindle Fire.
B00466HM28|5.0|Good Keyboard!! Good job with FL Studio and Live 8!!!<br />keyboard Portable!!! Tiny!<br /><br />Don't include software!!<br /><br />Sorry for my english!!!!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I brought this movie as a Christmas gift for a 7 year.  She loved it.  I enjoyed it as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Honestly one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Super addictive. You just can't put it down
B003XF1OJK|4.0|An excellent story that describes the process of how the Spartans came to be and how John 117 became the last Spartan. Good, fun read.
030758836X|3.0|I loved loved LOVED this book at least until the last twenty pages.  The entire book pulled me back, again and again.  I HAD to know what was going to happen next.  I loved and hated both Nick and Amy throughout this book, my emotions went up and down along with them.  I LOVED this book.  Then I hit the last twenty pages.<br /><br />I honestly have to say that it seems like the author gave up.  The ending was so dull, lifeless, and just plain horrible.  The writing style changed, everything seemed rushed and as though it was an afterthought. I almost feel like the author either a) ran out of time and had to rush something out b) go tired of working on the book, threw out a few pages and faxed it in or c) couldn't come up with a good ending and let a random child finish it.<br /><br />I hate to only give this book three stars, it deserves five.  However, everyone I have discussed this book with feels the same about the ending: It was a huge letdown.  It wasn't the content that let me down so much as it truly seems the author gave up.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My daughter enjoyed watching this movie, all of her friends were talking about it.  They have been trying to learn the cup song.
B00136JQMI|5.0|Great music, blues and jazz.  Interesting history and a great perfect storm of genius and talent. Each contributor is a stand alone great and combined they are fantastic.
B009O07NBQ|4.0|Songs we received were excellent. We were disappointed that 1 song from the movie was not included: Blunt the Knives.
1607066017|5.0|I just finished reading this; this is the best graphic novel I've read in years. It's even better than Y the Last Man or Ex Machina; Brian K Vaughan is really coming on as a writer. So if you like either of those, and haven't read this, stop what you are doing right now and buy it!<br /><br />This is also more science fiction than the other two (it involves travel in outer space and alien races) making this the best science fiction graphic novel I have read this year. Intergalactic-spanning adventure, interesting alien races, a nice mix of pseudo-technology and magic, really great stuff. So if you're a science fiction buff and haven't tried out Brian K Vaughan yet, this is a great place to start.<br /><br />It has it all; great characters, tension, funny parts, exciting action, really, what's not to like? I don't know how they'd make a movie out of this one, but if they did I'd go see it. ;)<br /><br />Plot spoiler (for those that need one): a man and a woman from opposite sides of an intergalactic war fall in love and have a baby. As they try to make their getaway, alien bounty hunters, military police, and relatives all try to get in the way and or kill them. Lots of foreshadowing, a la Ex Machina, who knows what will happen next. ;)
0307593312|5.0|This book was a gift and was exactly what they asked for and it arrived in excellent condition and was received on time!  Met expectation.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is definitely the perfect sequel. Oh, I love the ziplines, they're so cool! It's definitely a game that belongs on everyone's device!
B00AG51V8E|2.0|Just like the title says, If you are expecting a Bruce Willis movie..you wont get it.  Bruce basically appears in the first 10 minutes of the movie and then thats it.  Looks like the producers wanted to put a big name in it to get people to buy or rent it thinking they are getting a movie where he is the prime star but instead do a switcharoo on you.  The action is ok, the acting is mediocre and the plot is nothing new.  It is by far not the worst movie I have seen but not worth buying for sure and really not rent worthy either.  This movie teeters on being B-movie quality.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app has worked just like it's supposed to without any glitches thus far.  Keepin up to your standards Adobe...
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|This CD was a gift and was exactly what they asked for and it arrived in excellent condition and was received on time!  Met expectation.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Kind of a trashy novel, with no real plot purpose. The twists and turns were mildly unpredictable but so what. I gave it 3 points but that was because I couldn't put it down, however the book club was meeting in 2 days from when I started reading. Coincidence?
B0089EHWQE|5.0|There were tears running down my face when I finished this novel.  It is a simply written story of an unlikely relationship.  A story that begins with trepidation and hostility and ends with a keener knowledge of friendship, knowledge, and love.  At the end you cannot help wonder what would you do under these circumstances?
B003B02O14|5.0|Very captivating from the very beginning, Grabbed me in and kept me like the John Grisham books of old and once again he did not try to educate me on liberal dogma like he was doing for a while.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|She is an excellent writer, however the characters of this book are ages 16-18. Had to read because of book club, not sure if I would have finished after reading about 100 pages but I did finish. And the book got pretty good 2/3 of the way in, sort of had a twist and explained alot even as to why she needed young characters. I would recommend but to age group 25 and below.
B007SSDBBM|5.0|I really love both of these actors.  I enjoyed the storyline and could watch it again and again.  It's great for a rainy day!
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Works....sometimes. The ridge to hold the back needs to be deeper. If you get too aggressive in your kindle controlling you'll knock it down pretty easily.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|wifes book, i couldnt finish book and found the whole series just ego,ego,ego,not guy is this great ever. Do not see hype.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It was a great cost for what I purchased. Delivery was fast and easy. I'm a 19 year old college student and this is probably one of my favorite movies now. Very cute!
2253004294|1.0|I did not read this book.  I did not realize this copy was in French.  I gave it to my French friend.  I am usually more careful when ordering books.  I did not see that it was listed as a French copy.  I would love a copy in English as I read it years ago when it first came out in English and wanted to reread it again.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love it. it wakes me up soooo good.I used to want to sleep in until I found this app
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Classic John Grisham, good complex captivating plot, and he didn't try to make a liberal point like he ususlly does. Pretty good read.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|My son received this for Christmas and loves it!  I would recommend this for any child who loves Ninjago and legos.

B00APUQRPC|4.0|This movie moves swiftly but has a few wise messages for viewers of all ages if they pay attention.<br /><br />The  main message here is that, you might be older, you might feel older- but that doesn't mean you still don't have something to offer the world.<br /><br />In this story, Eastwood is angry. Even on a good day, he is angry.<br /><br />While he has always been an angry sort of guy,  now he is angry because he is noticing the signs of aging that he fears could hold him back or cost him, his beloved career as a baseball talent scout.<br /><br />He might have physical problems- but he is still mentally sharp and for the most part, a mobile man- as long as you don't give him a car to drive. :-)<br /><br />Eastwood's \\"Damn it all\\" attitude, is all about not giving in to things that slow you down or prove to be an obstacle.<br /><br /> Despite his looming health issues, he won't hang up his cap just yet!<br /><br />You find yourself rooting for him and admiring his pride, while feeling his embarrassment just as equally, when he uses tactics( some successfully- some not so successfully) to cover up his physical deficits.<br /><br />In fact, in defiance( and some would say stupidity) he opts to ignore his problems and blow off further medical assistance( at least, perhaps, for the time being ) in order to go scout the latest and greatest out there.<br /><br />He has to see just how authentic these hyped up school baseball players supposedly are- not just because it is in his blood- but because his career is also in jeopardy.<br /><br />And he has to ABSOLUTELY GET THE NEXT DRAFT PICK, RIGHT. He can't afford to make a mistake, especially now.<br /><br />This is a man whose identity is very wrapped up in his career.<br /><br />If forced to retire when his contract runs out in 3 months- you might as well just kill the guy.<br /><br /> He lives, eats, breathes and sleeps baseball.<br /><br />There may be other things he can do- but he wants to remain  a talent scout.<br /><br />The idea of retirement sends a fury through him, so this particular venture of scouting out the players, just 3 months before he could be forced into retirement, proves to be so extra serious for him.<br /><br />It is an understatement to say,the week of scouting proves to be very intense as Eastwood tries incredibly hard not to drop the proverbial ball.<br /><br />His daughter is played by Amy Adams.<br /><br /> She gets wind of his problems thanks to her father's friend( played by John Goodman) and despite her own promising career in a law office, and with the strong chance at partnership on the horizon, she decides to leave everything at work to intervene and attempt to help her Dad out.<br /><br />This means she takes off from her job at a critical time, a time when a major legal case hangs in the balance, as well as the pending decision on whether she makes the cut  as  a firm partner.<br /><br />Eastwood has no idea of the sacrifice his daughter has made.<br /><br /> All he knows is he doesn't want her hanging around.<br /><br />It is not long before he gets a revelation he is forced to accept:he comes to realize, much to his chagrin, he really does need her around.<br /><br />Their relationship has long been troubled and very complex.<br /><br />Despite having a grumpy man for a Dad, a man who seems to disdain meaningful conversation, Adams has compassion for him and his plight.  She makes the decision to tag along with Eastwood for  the week, to check out the talent with him.<br /><br /> She frequently calls into work to make sure they realize that while she has to take this week break, she is very serious about her job, the pending legal case and her partnership.<br /><br />She has worked there many years, putting in long hours, to make her mark, she is not about to give it up so easily.<br /><br />Her office is not happy she is gone.<br /><br /> The veiled threats start to happen. Adams tries to appease them, saying when she gets back, she will have things on track.<br /><br />Yet, despite knowing what she might lose, the priority of her job( and chance at partner) is superseded by her need to help her Dad.<br /><br /> Or perhaps, deep in her heart,she knows it is more than compassion- but love that is making her stay with him-  despite his his cantankerous behavior and personality quirks.<br /><br />Though the phone calls begin to allude her place in the company is shifting on her, she still makes the decision to stay with Eastwood and not yet return to work. This despite her bosses gentle, yet  pressing request to come back to work a.s.a.p.<br /><br />So you have Eastwood, pissed off about her coming along, clueless as to what his daughter might be putting in jeopardy FOR HIM; while she feels a deep sense of obligation to Eastwood, even though her father has failed her in  many ways, growing up.<br /><br />And so the story unfolds: a man desperately trying to hold on to his career, resisting the truth about his health issues, pissed off about getting older, and feeling both resentful -outwardly- and loving and proud-inwardly- toward his adult daughter.<br /><br />They may be blood related but in so many ways they are total strangers to one another.<br /><br />The movie covers the week the two are off on this journey of scouting.<br /><br /> But it covers more than just baseball, even though that is the obvious theme of the movie.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake is a key character in the movie as well, but rather than explain his role, I will just say that he is a part of Eastwood's past and could possibly be a part of Adams future- if she ever decides to break down the emotional barriers she has erected over the years.<br /><br />Barriers meant to keep from feeling rejected and unloved, as she often felt from her father growing up and into adulthood.<br />It is a fast paced movie and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />While based on baseball, there are other themes going on in the movie,  so everyone can watch this and appreciate it, even if they know nothing about baseball.<br /><br />Side note of trivia: Adams has an attorney boyfriend she is seeing.<br />He is seen briefly, but he is played by Mariska Hargitay's real life husband.ave things on track.<br /><br />Yet, despite knowing what she might lose, the priority of her job( and chance at partner) is superseded by her need to help her Dad.<br /><br /> Or perhaps, deep in her heart,she knows it is more than compassion- but love that is making her stay with him-  despite his his cantankerous behavior and personality quirks.<br /><br />Though the phone calls begin to allude her place in the company is shifting on her, she still makes the decision to stay with Eastwood and not yet return to work.

B006LSZECO|1.0|There was too much of the F bomb.  The story did not hold my attention.  It also was unbelievable and a downer.
B005OP7162|5.0|WOW!  STILL WORKING ON VIEWING BUT QUITE DRAMATIC. A TWIST A TURN EVERY EPISODE.  AMANDA HAS A PLAN FOR ALL CARACATERS INVOLVED.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I like Once Upon a Time season 1 and 2 can't wait to see season 3. please let me know when season 3 come out.<br />I already told several people about it.
B0044ZQ8QC|5.0|This is good, good, good.  Lovely music to take a long drive to.  Or cook up a luncheon.  I recommend it to all.
B004KPLVW2|3.0|Great cut of a good movie from back in the days. Wile does not hold up to current movies in terms of looks it is still a fun movie for those who remember it and a good cut.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I WANTED TO HAVE ONE AT WORK SO I DID NOT HAVE TO CARRY THE CORD EVERYWHERE SO THIS WORKS GREAT.  I ALSO GOT THE FASTER CHARGER FOR IT AND THIS IS A MUST OTHERWISE IT TAKES TOO LONG TO WAIT FOR.  IF YOU HAVE THE KINDLE MAKE AN INVESTMENT AND GET EXTRA ACCESSORIES FOR IT.
B007SGM084|5.0|Wonderful Trilogy of books.  Each book was as good as the first book.  Very easy to get caught up in what was going to happen. Sexy books.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Okay now let me start off by saying I'm a big fan of Temple Run. On iOS I really enjoy playing this sequel because of the new trek and the added little extras like the gems and 'levels', it gives the game a new reason to continue playing. But since I don't have an Apple device myself I play TR2 on my Kindle for the most part, and it truly stinks through Amazon. Whenever it ACTUALLY loads, if I try to use the new &quot;Save Me&quot; function it freezes and closes the app. Also whenever I close the app, or it closes itself, most Objectives I have completed somehow reset and aren't completed. PLEASE WORK OUT THE BUGS!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I was so set up by the reviews I read about the book before reading the actual book that I was just asking to be let down, I guess. There are some  books that can be talked up forever and nothing said can affect their potency when they're actually being experienced. This is not one of those books. Read it with an open mind and an open heart, it may touch you. However, I know this girl's entire life story and by the end of the book I'm still not convinced of her or Holder's existence. In the end you have to believe in the characters and Hoover's don't do it for me, talented though she is as an author. And for the record... people are reduced to tears... no deduced. I'm shocked how much this book claimed to be edited for how it turned out. A little... well... a LOT disappointing in the end.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I think this game is awesome  but you may have  a different opinion but this is my review not yours . This is an awesome game  I recommend it to people who are tired  of sort games that end super fast this game may never end if they keep updating it I hope they update it soon.
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|This was a good movie for the whole family. It was funny with no foul language. It had some mild violence.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is great. it is much better than the original. the cart and zipline features are amazing. the temple bends as you run but overall this game is amazing and you FREE. you should definatley get this game
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Movie and sound quality is great on the Blue-ray. I'm a sucker for special features and being that I've always been a fan of Captain America, I couldn't resist.  Looking forward to the movie's take on the saga of the Winter Soldier.
B005PK1G76|5.0|What can I say? It fits the stroller, is easy to put on/take off, holds all our stuff, and is less expensive than the Baby Jogger version. Perfect!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|just simple enough that its great busy work.  just challenging enough that its not a total waste of your time.  bright colors.  smooth.  lots of levels.  love this app.
0062206044|4.0|I grew  up reading these books and after re-reading the first one again I was amazed at how intriguing the storyline is. the vocabulary is phenomenal, stellar character development, truly a great book. Great job Mr. Snicket.. if that really is your name.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I liked trying to solve the same problems Mark was encountering.  Needless to say I never thought of the same solutions as he did.  I guess I would have died on Sol 7.
1452110581|5.0|Can I just say I had a dream where Alan Alda did a dramatic reading of these poems? This needs to happen.  Now.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|First hand account of a seals life leading up to just another mission.  Good quick read without too much commentary... Just the facts.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|pretty awesome game! loved the storyline and graphics! challenging enough to keep you interested but not to much that it would frustrate you. wish it was a little longer though.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Anyone who is a roots for the underdog will love this movie.  A must for Athletics fans.  I really enjoyed it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this show. I was not aware of it until the second season had begun and was so glad I could catch up with it. I am looking forward to the 3rd season DVD.
1451695195|5.0|Outstanding read.  Beautiful story!  I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially those who are skeptics regarding an afterlife or GOD.
B004SBULWE|4.0|This app is a great way to close apps without any extra bells and whistles.  It is extremely easy to use and works every time.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|It took me a few pages to get into this book. Once I did, it was hard to stop reading. I love all the  characters in the book. I hope to read future books like this one.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|This movie is eerie and sensual and definitely a re-watch.  Lots of twists and amazing acting. Would recommend to people who like dark indie films.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Very well written. Full of action and suspence. I couldn't put it down! All in all a great book! 5 stars *****
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love the movie, I bouth this as a christmas gift and I loved it, It came with a digital copy as well
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Appallingly badly written and hilarious/dangerous in it's description of BDSM. Someone must be liking it though. I'm not a woman but I can't imagine her inner monologue is that convincing to anyone past their teens.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|i bought this to sharpen my knives of course and was well pleased that it made them sharp again. made it so sharp i got a deep cut the next day while cutting boxes.. 4 stars because its too small even for a pocket sharpener for me
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Don't know where Lee Child gets all his Jack Reacher story-lines from but this book was up there with the best of them. Another enjoyable read.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Just finished reading Bossypants. I was laughing out loud! It was so funny and so many things really hit home. Thank you for giving me a much needed laugh!
B008K5T5AI|4.0|I always pick up the new Culture novels - it's a series I greatly enjoy. I had a bit of a problem with the pacing at the end (as I did with Matter) but maybe I just wanted it to go on for ever.<br /><br />I do feel that Banks could use a critical eye on some of his Mind dialogue (one or two pieces seem designed to appeal to the spotty teenager in the reader) but on the whole it's a great read.<br /><br />A suggestion for Amazon: the X-Ray feature in Kindle books is great but it really ought to include the ships/Minds as characters. I can't understand how that was overlooked.
0783233477|5.0|I just love this movie so much!!!!  The fact that it shows how you can fall in love with someone and it can come out in a really good light.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its very fun and I really like the curvy turns and hills. wheee!!!! I also love the mine and cart idea. Applause to the creator(s)!!!!
B0030Y11O2|5.0|Moore has his bias, but he is dead on when confronting the myth of capitalism, the tripe we are fed that capitalism and democracy are Siamese twins. They're not. Without Moore's humor films like this would be downers ( tho I'm sure the FOX News Droolers think it is anyways). . .  it is nice and fun to see a bolder, fresher, sharper look at the Money Culture this country worships at and how we all bend over in the name of &#34;free markets&#34; and be violated by those who profit the most and call it &#34;liberty&#34;. PT Barnum was right: &#34;There's a sucker born every minute&#34;. That could be the slogan for the US Chamber of Commerce or Goldman Sachs. FIGHT THE POWER!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was overall a good read.  Although I wanted to punch Megan sometimes, I thought Connor sounded dreamy!  I'd have his baby! :-)
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book is so slow. I continued to read it  by pure determination. It was a huge disappointment and I found myself skimming pages to get through the bordom. Two stars is being generous.
B0006J28BO|5.0|I got this as a gift for my cousin although i kind of wanted it for myself because i love all the movies from studio ghibili. :} You'll fall in love with these animation movies.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These three books are the best books I have read in a long time...please wright more! Sad it's over!<br />Awesome awesome!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I'm not an Anglophile but I do like the series. It's engaging and not violent (no guns, car chases, etc.). The overall production quality and acting is far above what American studios churn out.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Love all the movies!! Shipment went as good as it can get.  Would recommend it for others to purchase. Good price and great product.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The author presents a very interesting situation behind his near death (NDE) experience, thought provoking.  And for me I enjoyed how he wove many personal experiences outside of the NDE, that pulled the entire experience together as a very enjoyable read.
0525952926|5.0|I like Ken Follett's ability to bring accurate history alive but have always been uncomfortable with the explicit sexual content adn therefore have never really recommended the books to others.  This book is different.  He does a good job continuing characters and introducing new ones to the story line.  There is sexual content but not inappropriate in my opinion.  I have read very much history of the WWII and find the history accurate but alive with Follets skill.  You will like this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game for any horse lover.<br />great graphics realistic motion too.<br />if you love horses you must try this out.
0066620996|5.0|shipment went well.  No problems.  The book is pretty dry.  It's informative but long.  If you like business, i'd recommend it.
B000W089XS|4.0|This is a great throw-back movie. And I simply adore Bacall and Monroe together. Very funny movie. If you like Monroe, watch.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|A very simple and unexciting main plot.  Then to the excitement – a bad guy after good guy chase.  The extraordinary chase go on for quite some time on foot, car, motorcycle, etc.  Someone who timed this unbelievable chase told me it took 1 hour and 48 minutes of this 2 hour and 16 minute movie.  (Much longer and not as good as the French Connection.)  I am not sure because I fell asleep during it.  The other Bourne movies are great; this is not.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its not a bad game lots of pop ups though. still pretty fun. some of the instructions are not very clear either.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome for kids but I wish it would update on kindle fire. kids of all ages will love it
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is a heartbreaking book. The terror that Jeycee lived through and survived is commendable. The only thing is the book is somewhat written in disorder, as if from a child. But I suppose considering the lack of education that should be considered. A more in depth examination of Jaycee's deeper feelings and those of her children would have made the book more cerebral. In any even, Jaycee's survival instincts are amazing.  .
B006X5L6VS|5.0|This app works perfectly on my kindle fire 8'9 .It is amazing to look at the sky from inside the house
0439023513|4.0|I titled this review to express the reason for my disappointment with the ending and to compare to other books I have read in the past year.<br /><br />Last spring I decided to read 'Gone With the Wind' by Margaret Mitchell.  It took me weeks to read.  I know that some readers are unsatisfied with the ending, but although it was not 'happily ever after' I thought it was well done and left me free to imagine what would come next.<br /><br />I spent last summer and fall reading the Dark Tower Series by Steven King.  I first re-read the first 4 books which I had read back in the 90's and then completed through the 7th book.  (In doing some research today I just learned that he is continuing the series).  My husband warned me that I may not like the ending as did the author at some point in the book itself).  However, after months of reading, I found the ending to be just fine.  Again it is not 'happily ever after', but leaves me free to imagine more.<br /><br />I spent the last week reading Suzanne Collins' 'Hunger Games' series. Obviously not meant to be a great literary work like Steven King's or Margaret Mitchell's, but still it was as thrilling of a read.  Geared for younger audiences it was a much easier read as well.<br /><br />It took Margaret Mitchell 10 years to complete Gone with the Wind.  It took Steven King nearly 30 years to complete his first 7 books of the Dark Tower series.  I feel that Ms Collins should have taken a little more time to complete the final book of the Hunger Games series.  I'm ok with it not being 'happily ever after', but the poorly plotted ending makes it hard for my imagination to go anywhere.<br /><br />The works I'm referencing in this review, have remarkably similar attributes.  Love stories, wars, manipulations, tragedies.  Gone with the Wind is lacking in SciFi elements, but is full of the almost soap-opera like melodrama like that Katniss experiences.  There is a good vs. evil nature to Scarlett O'hara.  Steven King is a masterat weaving fantasy and scifi into his stories which include love as well and especially Good vs Evil.  Hunger Games is a seried with these elements as well.<br /><br />I think Ms. Collins lost her way as she concluded her story.  The last part of 'Mockinjay' titled 'Assassin' gets a little lost and rushes through its sequence of horrible creatures and deaths, especially compared to the way she incorporated these into the 'Arena' portions of the first two books.  Outside of introducing the character Tigris, the character building is rushed and somewhat contrived.  Katniss frequently loses her grip on consciousness and/or reality whenever the plot calls for much dynamic change in her surroundings.  And in the end, in the midst of her understandable mental instability, the author relents and just tells how it ends, rather than showing us through Katniss' experiences. 21 years ago, when I was 17 (the same age as Katniss), my honors speech and composition teacher,Ms. Bryson taught: \\"Show me; don't tell me.\\"  I think Ms. Collins forgot this at the end of 'Mockingjay'.<br /><br />I believe that as damaged as Katniss was by what she went through, the outcome of the story could not have been otherwise.  But the authors telling of it was almost shameful after the emotion that the reader went through for the first two and two-thirds if the story. Perhaps Steven King, whose acclaim for the books was printed on the back cover, could go back and rewrite it for us.  And hopefully the screenwriters will do a better job for the film version.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|My husband loved this movie as a kid so I bought it for him for Christmas. I gave it to him early and we watched it a few days before Christmas. A classic!
B005PK1G76|5.0|This stroller organizer fits my City Mini GT and my umbrella stroller.  Why pay more for a similar product?  It is high quality, fits most strollers and carries everything I need. I walk in the park with my son every day and it holds 2 water bottles (or cups), my phone and keys.  The price is right!
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|This is one great movie as long as you can take the language and violence.  Watching it I wonder how accurate some of these events might be.  Anyway,  some great preformances from the stars.  Robert De Nero, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone are really great.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I first started watching &#34; The Big Bank&#34; while on vacation last year and now am an avid viewer. I love the combination of Leonard, Sheldon, Penny, Raj, and Howard. Most of all I really like the &#34;nerdiness&#34; of these characters. They balance each other out and with the added character of Bernadette and Amy Farrah Fowler it is a total hoot!  It is a wonderful memory of both my high school and college friends!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is well written and the story line is interesting with a twist that is a surprise. I think it one of John Grisham's best,right up there with The Firm,The Pelican Brief,and The Runaway Jury.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could literally not put this book down! It was sooooo good and I just had to find out what was going to happen next. My only complaint was that it kept me up late at night :) A great quickly read and also a good one to discuss at book club.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I love this film, big fan of Christopher Nolan, can't go wrong with this flick, especially for the black friday price i got it for!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I first saw Susan Boyle on a program where she was on a BBC show. I was VERY impressed at her voice- the power, the melodic tones and her song choice  was so wonderful and uplifting it gave me chills.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I waited to watch the movie until I read this. The book is a lot better. It's definitely a tear jerker.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game!  really fun playing with horses is really fun easg game ' fun for a boring day never seem to have coins though but its ok
B000ZMVAXO|3.0|It does the job, but is very limited. You would be better off connecting your headphones directly to your amp.
B00000JPH5|4.0|It did come used, but none the less it came in pretty good condition for my collection. I wish it would have been marked &#34;new or used&#34; when purchasing.
B0009IW9DE|5.0|Great song writing.  Great Lyrics.  John sings about America.  Tells it like it is life is not always all smiles and laughter.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I found it refreshingly dark and it kept me glued until the end.  This is the first book I have read by Gillian and I have finished the other two and they are as good as this one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|just as described. this app is more accurate than the local news, i use it most every day. many options make this a great free app.
B008MF3OEY|5.0|Despite the title, the cover will fit an HD. It's a little tight getting it in place under the straps, but it still closes and doesn't move around. Pretty outside too.
B0009IW9CK|5.0|This CD is wonderful!  Do I need to say more it's JOHN MELLENCAMP.  i have been a fan all the way back to UHhuh
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had no interest in seeing or reading this book but now that I have I'm hooked!! On to book 2!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing. Even today 6.0 came out! :D I suggest you get it now before it gets pricy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game for horse lovers but of course not a real horse. But it's fun to get task and competitions done. I enjoy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why won't it let me update it, because I want the newest update but I can't figure it out. So someone help me out here
B000002OX3|4.0|Good to listen to Run, Run, Run again. They were good but they would reach the top on Who's Next
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome. I love this app. It is very addicting and I am always checking it. My only suggestion is to allow messaging among friends!!!!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|It is Van Morrison.  There is nothing else to say.  Another great CD by a great artist.  Highly recommend it.
0470449756|5.0|It's a used book but still very new and no marks. And it only cost me 8 dollars. Pretty cool!<br />I love it!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As always Demille gives a page turner full of suspense and excitement. His use of his character John Corey as the subject and narrator makes for a lively, fun filled experience while telling a page turner
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I do love it.  Free cell has been one of my favorites for a long time. I recomend it to seniors and more.  Order one today . You ewon't be sorry.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|BOB Dylan.  He never disappoints.  This is another great CD from the singer songwriter laureate who really has no equal.  How does he do it?  Quite a few surprising ballads about surprising subjects.
0316224588|4.0|. . . and a good thing too.  I understand that some readers can run out of patience with a detective.  The fact that I have, with Wallander, doesn't mean that Henning Mankell became a bad writer of detective fiction.  I'm not tired of Rebus yet.  Maybe the fact that I spent a lot of time in Edinburgh at an important part of my life has something to do with it.  The Scottish Constabulary needs help with cold cases, so some retirees have signed on.  Rebus is one of them, and he's as vain, secretive, ornery as ever.  A girl disappeared about 13 years ago, and now others have disappeared in the same area, so is there a pattern?  So Rankin is working within a good old sub-genre of detective fiction.  To complicate things, Malcolm Fox, the protagonist of Rankin's previous two novels, who works for Internal Affairs (\\"the Complaints\\"), suspects that Rebus is dirty.  After all, he's been seen drinking with Ger Cafferty (Yes, Big Ger is back too!).  But basically, he's just offended by Rebus's apparent sloppiness and insubordination.  To make thing fresh, the crimes have been committed in the north of Scotland -- or so it seems -- up north of Inverness, in the Dornoch Firth area.  This gives Rankin an opportunity for some nice word picture atmospherics.  Some things, however, aren't what they seem.  Is Cafferty setting Rebus up to pay off old scores?  Will Rebus's Saab hold up to all the northern travel?  Will Fox end up on the side of the angels?  Will bodies be found?  How long will Rebus's new superiors put up with the attitude . . .  Obviously, I'm not giving anything away about the typically well-crafted Rankin plot.  Any reservations?  Maybe the final wrap-up is a bit hasty, not because there are plot shortcuts but just because there are some things we would, as readers, like to know more about.  But don't let that stop you . . .  there's much to enjoy here.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great read.<br />Lots of technical information about aeronautics but the characters were loveable. Would like to read more about Watney's character in future books?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have enjoyed this app so far and will continue for now.  I wish that the games didn't set you up to spend more money.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|pretty much the most AWSOME GAME EVERRRRR...BUT it closes on me for no apparent reason...ill be going on the best run and BAM.... force closes! so until this gets fixed..only 3 stars
B001RP1G0U|2.0|I turned it off halfway through...shouldn't have rented it to begin with.  It was boring and unrealistic.  You don't really care what happens to these people.
0307596885|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all the stories.  I had read many of them already in The New Yorker.  I hadn't realized when I purchased this book that so much would be old material.  Of course, they were worth rereading, no problem, but I relished the new ones which were new to me more.  Perhaps a reader could be warned!  Too much to ask of publishers  who want to sell but still!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely loved this book and the way the author writes.  After reading this book I had to go and read all the books by this author…and was not disappointed.  Great story line and a lot of unexpected twists....and loved the main character she had me laughing and crying throughout the book
044022425X|5.0|All of the books in this series are phenomenal! If you like fantasy, romance, history, you'll love Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. 'Nuf said!
B0098460O4|5.0|I was blown away when I accidentally found the youtube version of their appearances on Britains Got Talent. What a musical treat!<br /><br />I have to say that I thought the producer of the album went overboard on the production of most of the songs...really not necessary for a chorus of thousands and dramatic flourishes - his voice was lost in some of the overload and perhaps should have been respected more.<br /><br />Glad I have the album, nevertheless.  I wish both of them well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my kids love I meanLOVE this new game I mean they can't stop playing it I mean when k look at one of them she is playing it when k look at my other one she is playing it too
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Absolutely fell in live with the characters and story line....Love the way the author writes....have read all her books and look forward to reading new ones by her.  I fell in love with the characters and was inspired by them....the books this one and the sequel Point of Retreat left me feeling good!  These are books that I will definitely be reading again and again
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I have played this so many times since I got it.  It is great music from the show.  I wish it would have included Fade into You though.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|This is the funniest movie I've seen in years.  I watch a lot of movies, high-brow and low-brow.  This is just a hilarious, politically incorrect laugh-fest.  Bobby Lee is in his funniest role.  I could watch this over and over again.  People who are uptight and politically correct won't enjoy it, but those people don't have a sense of humor anyway.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeful  love story. Filled with passion, misery and commitment. You  fall in love with the characters and their stories. The love Holder expresses for Sky is what every girl hopes to experience at least once in their life.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It lags at times I can tell it still needs a little work. Other than that it's a great fun game. I love it its way more challenging than the first one. Definitely need to practice to get the hang of it. I love the carts too.
B008602KQI|4.0|This is a good movie, and very true to the book.  Jennifer Lawrence is perfect for the role.  But just a tad of something is missing - the book is better, I couldn't put it down, the movie is not quite up to that level.
0525952926|5.0|AN EASY READ. CHATACTERS ARE A LITTLE SOAP OPERAISH; BUT SO WHAT<br />THERE IS MUCH TO BE LEARNED ABOUT SUBTLE AND OVERT ATTITUDES DURING THIS HISTORIC ERA.
B004IS4038|5.0|I love it! It's everything I expected it to be. I hear a lot of bad things about Croc's but this shoes is great. It fits perfectly and the color matched what is in the web.
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|I wanted something to put my kindle in that gave it 360 degree protection so it's screen wouldn't get scratched when I put it in my purse. This works perfectly. I even have my kindle in the Marware SportGrip Silicone Case and it still fits in this envelope sleeve. Great buy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A fault in our stars is a great read! Definitely made me think about the choices I make in life.
030758836X|5.0|Original, interesting and worth the read.  It's like a James Patterson mystery with good writing and a fully realized story. :)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King does a great job of intertwining history with fiction.  Layering in a love story made the story all the more riveting.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Better than fiction, a great example of a two sided coin!  Fate, not coincidence rules the sky for these flyers.
B006WPWH4E|3.0|The type size needs to be larger. As it stands now, the font is so small that it's difficult to read without glasses.
B00005B36H|5.0|thanks got it on time :) and was in good shape. my laptop was able to read it and everything
