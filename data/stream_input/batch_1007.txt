0446563048|4.0|Delivering Happiness is Tony Hsieh's account of how Zappos became the highly valued and much admired company of today. It is basically a biography of the company, with Tony there for every moment of the often turbulent ride.<br /><br />The best part of this book is how replete it is with stories about employees, vendors, customers, and the investor (Amazon.com) who bought Zappos in 2009. These stories are inspirational and informative, adding yet more color to the already vibrant story Tony tells.<br /><br />In all, this book does a great job of recounting the human side of a currently popular business. It's a fun and interesting read.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|I am generally not too keen on big artists repeating their past successes, nor do I generally like live albums.  This is a very big exception.  James Taylor's voice sounds, to me, exactly as it did 40 years ago - as clear, as sharp, as steady - and I find that amazing.  Carole King's voice has acquired just a touch of raspiness, but it actually gives her more validity of emotion.  When they sing together, as they do on \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\", \\"You've Got A Friend\\" and \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\", their harmony sounds so natural: one expression fueled by 2 distinct voices and personalities.  The arrangements are for the most part very close to the originals, a little stronger and \\"thicker\\", due to help from modern technology.  Their onstage intros and chatter radiate warmth and friendliness.  It is obvious that they still share the musical and personal rapport they had in 1970.  Individually, James's \\"Fire And Rain\\" is very moving, as you would expect, and Carole's \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\" rocks as it never did before;  but there's really not a bad performance on here.  If you miss the singer-songwriters of the early 70's, and especially if you were ever a fan of either or both of these 2 iconic artists, this CD will not disappoint you.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, my husband just got back from afghanastan and we watched it together, he could relate to the movie, thanx
B003CR9BYE|2.0|My wife and I are great fans of Tom Jobim, his music, and its genre, and we are also great fans of Frank Sinatra's magnificent music from the 40s through the 70s. This CD disappoints. It's Jobim's music, which usually is wonderful in its native Brazilian, but poor Frank can't handle it in its English translation. The album evidently was done in an attempt to revive the aging Sinatra's career. We think it fails, but listen to a few tracks before you decide whether to buy or not.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|Set is 1961, this film is about intelligent, pretty high school girl living in overprotecting household.  Her parents are pouring all of their hopes in their daughter's education at Oxford University which brings her high school life to a rigid routine of studing, cello practice and essay writing.  A young woman is dreaming of her future colleage life as a way to liberate herself from the stiffness of her parents' stifling expectations, until one day she runs into a charismatic older man, David, who seems to be able to offer her all of her dreams rightr there, right now.<br /><br />Marvelous cast of exceptional actors in this film and their well developed characters are true beauty of the film.  For any girl who has ever wondered how to achieve her own path to lifestyle she wants this is a must see movie.  For any parent(s) deparate to convince their rebelious, smart kid(s) why education is valuable this is a must see movie.  For any fan of really good art film drama with great script and fantastic 1960s feel, music, hairstyle and fashion this is a must see movie.  Exceptional in every possible way.
B001PR0YGC|5.0|The Informant is very funny and ironic it is one of matt damons best productions.  always get the blueray, blueray compared to normal dvd is 100% better the sound and picture is a huge differnet.  i advise anyone that wants a good laugh to buy this movie and you will be laughing more than once.
B000TP5TOI|5.0|This album has surpassed the majority of music I've been able to ingest in my short life.  It is unlike anything I've heard before or since and is pleasing on many different dimensions.  \\"My Violent Heart\\" is probably the loudest rebellion song I've ever heard.  When you place the lyrics in the world of 'Year Zero', invented by Mr. Reznor, it adds a scope that really doesn't exist in other records.  \\"Me I'm Not\\" is another stand-out track that adds so much to this concept.  If one claims that they can manifest human sex into music, this record will be the test to the truth of that.  There are so many hugely-layered phat beats in this album that you will probably always hear a sound that you did not hear the time before.  Not to compare or contrast two completely different bands, but musically, this album reminds me somewhat of  Radiohead's 'Kid A' on steroids and filled with a lot more angst and insurrection.  This is one album you should buy and not steal.  It is worth every single penny.
B0015DROBO|2.0|De gustibus, of course, but I found this quite boring. I suspect if I had read all of it I would have found it incredibly boring, but fortunately I stopped in time. Since it isn't even well written it was all a bit of a[n unpleasant] surprise, after all I bought the book based on reviews.
B003N5VOUO|4.0|I echo the other reviews.  This is a GREAT movie.  Shahrukh Khan brilliantly portrays a man with Asperger's/autism.  The overall message of the film is so beautiful.  While parts are simplisticly done, the message stays true.  Unfortunately, the negative in this film is the entire Mama Jenny subplot.  I'm hoping that the Indian filmmakers just did not realize how incredibly racist the whole segment is.  From a child that almost perfectly mimics \\"Buckwheat\\" from Our Gang, to exaggerated southern African-American dialect, it just left a huge bad taste in my mouth.  There are a hundred other ways they could have told the story without using racist stereotypes.  In this day and age, SOMEONE should have alerted the filmmakers during production how WRONG that whole sub-plot was, and how distasteful it would be to American audiences.  Unfortunately, it may turn away many who need to hear the message of the film most.  Having said all that, however, SRK's acting (astonishing) and the fantastic message of the film make this a film worth seeing, and owning!
B001KZVQJI|5.0|3 hours and 20 minutes!!! But all of it totally worth it. I wish they put more into the exploration of the island into the movie, even if it meant a 4 hour movie. BD quality was awesome. Buy it.
B0013POLS8|4.0|This is a very enjoyable concert as Mariah performs all of her previous hits.  To say that Mariah looks amazing in HD is an understatement. This blu ray is a definite treat for all MC fans.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved this book, and wish that it wasn't the end of the series.  All three of these books are books that I will definitely read again.  Well written, and kept me waiting for more.  The twists and turns were great, and I have recommended these books to all of my friends.
0452295548|3.0|This book has a lot to recommend it.  A stroke from the perspective of a brain anatomist is fascinating.  She provides invaluable insights into the subjective experience of stroke and the requirements for rehabilitation that make this a stunning work of compassion and healing.  It is a must-read for anyone interested in those things.  However...    In her attempt to tie her technical knowledge to her spiritual project she does damage to both her profession and to those who agree with her religious perspective.  She presents the whole \\"Left Hemisphere/Right Hemisphere\\" metaphor (and make no mistake, she WAY oversteps the scientific understanding of the brain to arrive at what can only be a metaphorical position) as though it were a) something new, b) scientifically valid and c) having a connection not just to the brain but to the external reality of the world.    To claim that the right hemisphere has access to a differently reality than the left makes as much sense as suggesting that the part of the brain devoted to seeing is somehow less authentic than the part devoted to hearing.  Ideally you will combine information from both sound and light to construct a more accurate view of the world.  Obviously blind people are not in anyway less than sighted people, but just in terms of trying to get as much data as possible about our world, sight plus hearing is preferable.    The division of modes of categorizing thought by hemispheres is not yet fully understood.  It's way too soon to start inferring metaphysical import from this system.  So, if you want to feel one with the universe, just go and do it.  You don't need the permission of brain anatomy.
B001HN694K|5.0|A clever family film in which the 19-year old Alice returns to the world which she had originally visited at the age of six but had convinced herself was just a dream.  The story fuses elements of Lewis Carroll's original books \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Alice through the looking glass\\" as well as the poem \\"Jabberwocky.\\" It is more of a sequel than a re-interpretation though there are elements of both.  This film is significantly darker in tone than, say, the classic Disney film or even the original books, and I would not recommend this for a very young child who might find certain scenes frightening. However, my two eight-year-olds enjoyed the film and had little difficulty with it (they hid their eyes or behind mummy once or twice). The story appears to be at least as much intended for the adult members of the family as for the children, and the saccharine sweetness of many interpretations of the Wonderland story are almost wholly absent.  In places this film is very funny, exquisitely beautiful, or very exciting, and often several of those things at once. The first thing which makes it fun is the many excellent performances by the star-studded cast.  Mia Wasikowska is delightful as the 19-year old Alice, and Johnny Depp suitably manic as the Mad Hatter.  Helena Bonham Carter's character, the evil queen, is an amalgamation of the Queen of Hearts from \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" with the Red Queen from \\"Alice through the looking glass.\\" Helena BC and Tim Burton appears to have modelled this character on Queen Elizabeth the First as played by Miranda Richardson in the second series of the British TV comedy Blackadder (link: [[ASIN:B00004YN70 Blackadder 2 - The Entire Second Series [1986] [DVD]]]). The mannerisms, style of speaking, even the voice are a direct lift of \\"Queenie\\" from Blackadder but it works brilliantly. Crispin Glover is very funny as her evil henchman Stayne (the Knave of Hearts).  The Red Queen's sister and antithesis (the White queen), is played by AnneHathaway, who comes over as a somewhat irritating goody-goody but one who is still far preferable to her sister as a ruler.  Much of the show is stolen by the CGI characters, particularly the Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), Absalom the blue caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman,) and the Doormouse (voiced by Barabara Windsor). The latter is not the soporific character of Carroll's original, but more like a female Reepicheep on steroids.  The Jabberwocky is a looming threat for most of the film but when it finally appears for the climax, a combination of superb special effects and a marvellously threatening voice provided by Christopher Lee make the beast magnificently scary.  Other cast members worth a mention include Tim Piggott Smith who has a charming cameo as Lord Ascott, the business partner of Alice's father: Geraldine James as his ghastly wife who wants Alice to marry their equally ghastly son Hamish (Leo Bill), and Tim Spall as the voice of a bloodbound called Bayard.  The artwork was stunning: in places \\"Underland\\" (apparently the six-year-old Alice slightly misheard the name) is incredibly beautiful, in other places it looks ruined and devastated for reasons which are soon revealed in the film but which I don't want to spoil the story by giving away.  These days the viewer is used to films with special effects of such a high quality that we tend to take them for granted, but the special effects were particularly brilliant in this film. The manner in which Alice is seen to grow to much above her normal size or shrink to be far smaller, the manner in which the Red Queen's soldiers look like playing cards while those of the White queen look like chess pieces, the ruined landscape of Underland, and particlarly the way the Cheshire Cat fades into and out of existence, all made impossible things look as real as you could hope for.  Overall I think this is the best Tim Burton film I have seen
B003DRWX9I|3.0|This is pretty much standard issue blues-metal that successfully showcases Slash's chops if not his versatility.  The strongest tracks in my opinion:    \\"Crucify The Dead (Feat. Ozzy Osbourne)\\" - A melodic and passionate rocker   \\"Back from Cali (Feat. Myles Kennedy)\\" - Good arena power rock with a modern flavor provided by Myles Kennedy.  Actually reminds me a bit more of Buckcherry than Alter Bridge.  \\"Watch This (Feat. Dave Grohl, Duff Mckagan)\\" - Good arena ready power-rock  \\"Nothing To Say (Feat. M Shadows)\\" - A driving rocker/anthem that showcases Slash's chops    Also notable and surprising - as I am not a big Fergie fan - is the fact that she puts some great pipes on display on \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\".    The downside?    There are no out-and-out horrible tracks but the album as a whole feels more like a collection of singles than a unified entity.  Also, the slower Chris Cornell track, \\"Promise\\" is surprisingly forgettable, and the Kid Rock nth attempt at dunderheaded mullet-ballads like \\"I Hold On\\" is predictably bad (or great, depending on whether you're one of the 5 dedicated KR fans left).    All in all, a solid addition to any blues/metal collection with good musicianship and many strong moments.
0156030306|4.0|I had read this book 20 years ago while in school, and decided to pick it up when it came on sale at Audible.  While I did remember the story and thus knew what was happening, I had forgotten most of the details and enjoyed hearing it again as an adult.  Keyes does an admirable job describing the emotional struggles of Charlie Gordon as his IQ triples.  While the dialogue sounds a bit dated at this point, it was not distracting.  I found the book touching and enjoyed re-reading it.
B002E01LL6|1.0|This movie typifies Hollywood. They see a trend in America (Fighting, UFC, MMA) is appealing to young people and they try to cash in on it as cheap as possible by throwing together a crappy movie.    Nothing in this film struck me as anywhere believable. The acting might have been good, but the script was so bad it made the actors look bad. I wanted to turn it off and watch something else, but have you ever had a sour cream and cheddar bag of chips that tasted so bad you couldn't stop eating it? That's what watching this movie was like.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I can not say enough about this CD.  It is by far the BEST Alicia Keys CD to date.  I can not stop listening to it.  I buy tons of music and this is probably the best CD I have bought in years.  Don't miss it!
0446691437|5.0|Fantastic !  To the point, no babble!  Anyone who could use an understanding   of what's going on in their head   and how to get beyond it   must read this book!
B00012BSHG|4.0|Pool would fit 2 adults and 2 kids \\"cozily\\" or 1 adult and 2 kids comfortably. I'm impressed with the sturdiness and comfort of the product. My daughter is 30\\" tall and when she stands upright she can just about hang on to the sides and look over. Because the sides are transparent, she doesn't feel trapped inside as she might with a solid color pool. Good buy and lots of fun. I would recommend it.
B000002U9L|4.0|Cd was in excellent condition. The covers hinge was broken, but overall a good product.
B001FB563E|3.0|No, I never read the book, nor have I read any of the other reviews.<br /><br />I found myself somewhat intrigued by the lack of actually spelling out what \\"this catastrophe\\" actually was as well as any response to it by the rest of the world.<br />In doing so, I found myself caring about the two main caharacters and what they were going thru.<br />The characters had the \\"look\\" of someone that would have been in thier position; filthy clothes and lack of the normal hygiene, which helped the viewer believe  thier ordeal was real.<br />I was let down though by the ending, which seemed to be lacking in any drama or some type of ending statement trying to be made by the film. It almost seemed as though the movie was instead an installment in a series; \\"Stayed tuned for previews of next weeks \\"The Road.\\"<br />With that being said, I would still recommend this movie to rent.
B000R8YC1S|5.0|DVD was in excellent condition, plays with absolutely on skipping. It was still in its original plastic wrap. Thanks.
B00004XQ8E|5.0|This has to be one of Decca's crown jewels! Ferrier's wonderful performance, directed by Bruno Walter, who knew Mahler personally, is obsolutely outstanding; no serious lover of Ferrier's singing and Mahler's music should be without it. My only regret is not having bought it decades ago! Having having taken a dislike to Julius Patzak's voice in a work by Franz Schmidt, I was concerned that he would disappoint me in the Mahler. He did not; he's in fine voice, and he delivers a strong performance that complements admirably that of Ferrier. Mahler-lovers - snap up a copy of this CD before they're all gone!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|MJ is in my opinion the greatest entertainer of the 20th century, being a gifted vocalist, dancer, lyricist and producer as well as a deeply caring humanitarian.  This video show Michael at the top of his game.  Excellent video quality and sound make it an essential part of the vast repertoire of MJ's music and performance videos.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I was very pleased with this product. The sound quality is quite good, and I liked the song mix. The only downside I had was that I mistook the song Coming Home for Home, which was my fault

0385523386|4.0|i wasn't knowing what to expect based on the reviews and vibe about this book, however after reading it, you find a woman who seemingly had it all and made a mistake,but then again maybe there was a lesson that needed to be learned and to challenge her and the directions she truly needed to take. this book got my attention from details and her encounters and the pacing was well written. very good book and read.

B00275EHIM|5.0|Wow!  I LOVED it!  Just saw this one in the theater. It was about 2 hours of practically non-stop adventure.  Disney flicks have come a long way!  Thank you, Walt, for paving the way.<br /><br />Our story begins in ancient Persia.  The king has a couple of sons already when he comes upon a young orphan boy who displays unusual courage to help another boy.  The king admires the orphan and adopts him, making him another son (and another prince.)  He is raised as a brother/son/prince.  (Pardon me if I misspell any of these names.)  Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the orphan.  Prince Tusk is the eldest son and the future heir to the throne.  Ben Kingsley plays an advisor to the king and the trusted uncle to the sons of the king, including Dastan.<br /><br />Dastan is a very spirited, street-smart young man.  He does not act snooty and he is not afraid to fight.  When Prince Tusk receives information that the Holy City of Alamut is making weapons to be used against the Persian kingdom, the sons decide to attack.  It is in Alamut that we see Dastan's bravery and fighting skills and we meet the beautiful Princess Kamina (Gemma Arterton). We also learn that the Princess is the guardian of a very special dagger, one that is capable of going back in time, with the potential to alter events of the past. (You can surely imagine that the bad guys would want the dagger.)<br /><br />There are lots of acrobatic stunts, CGI, tons of practically non-stop action, adventure, betrayal, assassins, impossible odds, mystical happenings, treachery, greed, power, and destiny with a little love and spirituality to boot.  You even get to see ostrich races.<br /><br />Great story!

B00000FC5H|5.0|Bought this disc to go along with my Elements of Love - the Ballards which I have owned for years.  Now I have a complete collection of all the songs I loved best by Earth Wind & Fire.  They sound as good today as when I first heard them.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|quite a few good songs on this cd. the second one of the double disc leaves one feeling what was it for. if this was a concept cd, i am not sure of the purpose. i am giving them a try as a new follower although i have known about them for many years.
0525421580|4.0|I had pretty high hopes for this one-two huge YA authors, a great premise, and possibly the most entertaining musical ever written. I've read John Green's books before, I've never read anything by David Levithan, but I had a good idea their writing styles would blend nicely. And they did. I listened to this one on audio because I'm a big fan of one of the narrators (Nick Podehl) so the writing seemed more seamless to me. In the print copy one Will Grayson is written in capital letters and one is not, but that doesn't come through on audio, so the book felt very cohesive in that format.<br /><br />David Levithan's Will Grayson starts out pretty moody and I found him obnoxious, he grew on me and I really liked him. I'm actually interested in reading more books written by David Levithan after reading this one. John Green's Will Grayson is typical John Green-nerdy, somewhat awkward and doesn't really know much about girls, but he tries. I almost wonder if John Green can write anything other than nerdy boy characters, yet I don't want him to try because he writes it so well. Together, I thought their Will's worked well and the storyline flowed and I liked how everything came together.<br /><br />I love and adore Tiny Cooper and if Tiny Dancer was a real musical, I would go see it in a heartbeat. Tiny really is the star of this book and I really felt this was more his story than it was the Will's story. That fact sort of threw me off and made the book not work for me so much. I also really liked both Will's parents. While they started out with me not really liking them, I really appreciated how Will's dad and will's mom have great conversations with their kids. Sure the Will's find their parents annoying, but they also still love them and that shows and I really liked that aspect of the book.<br /><br />I did think the ending was somewhat abrupt-I wasn't ready for it to end and I thought there would be just a bit more and then the credits started playing on my audiobook. It just seemed too sudden to me.<br /><br />While, I can't comment on David Levithan's books, I don't really think this is John Green's best book. It's still great and I think Tiny Cooper might be one of the greatest character ever written. But I guess after having such high expectations for it, I was left feeling a little disappointed.<br /><br />As a side note, I remember reading an article about someone who was offended and shocked by the content in this book. There is a lot of language, which I think always surprises me more on audio than when I read a book, but I wasn't really shocked by that. Maybe I wasn't shocked because I've read John Green's books before. Nothing else really stood out to me though and I would give this one to high schooler's no problem.o me.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Larsson deftly created unusual and yet believable characters as part of an elaborately layered story.
0385736002|4.0|About the book: The three titles already released in this series are: The Alchemyst (2007), The Magician (2008), and The Sorceress (2009). This series is a contemporary fantasy that travels the globe. Have you ever wondered why almost every different belief system and mythology have similiar circumstances, similiar monsters, and similiar heroes?. And have you ever wondered what it would be like if those heroes, monsters, and other legends still lived in secret in the world today? Josh and Sophie, twins from the modern day city of San Francisco are about to find out in a whirlwind adventure from which they will never be the same.<br /><br />Mr. GreenBeanSexyMan says: A nonstop adventure from page one, The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel series is an awesome guy read, but also has enough strong female characters to make any girl wish she was traveling with Josh and Sophie too. As a fantasy fan and a history buff, these books grabbed me. The most famous people from history and mythology leap off the page, just as noble or as nasty as the history books say they were. (or perhaps even nastier in the case of some of the bad guys.) Michael Scott pulls from mythology from around the world and around each twist in the story is another hero or monster waiting to be discovered. Some we all know, some I am sure most readers will be introduced to for the first time, but all of them are real characters with individual motivations, weaknesses, and character flaws. As the story is about a fantasy adventure taking place in present day the only flaw I have found is that there are moments that the reader must suspend his or her disbelief with how large scale the action is without the military of several nations getting involved, but as a whole Michael Scott creates a great fantasy adventure that is accessible to everyone yet still grounded in historical mythology<br /><br />This series is scheduled for 6 books and the Internet Movie Database has the The Alchemyst movie listed as in developement for 2012. There is also an Alchemyst Game website narrated by Michael Scott which is a lot of fun. You can find it here.<br /><br />Book 4 The Necromancer is due out May 25th 2010 and you can bet I will be in line to buy my hardcover and have it finished in one night. (I hope!)for 2012.

030726999X|4.0|First of all, if you haven't read Larsson's 2 previous novels in his Millennium trilogy, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire,\\" I urge you to read them first.<br />I did, and I was still confused for the first 200 pages of this 600-page book. Then it began to all hang together.<br />This reader longed for a list of characters, a la Tolstoy or Dickens. The unfamiliar Swedish names do not resonate. It's hard to tell first names from last names, male names from female names. And there are literally 50 names to keep track of. I went back to the beginning and made my own list of names, and that helped.<br />The last third of the book is so thrilling and moves so fast that you won't care about names. Larsson did a fantastic job of wrapping up this trilogy. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I gave the first two books 5 stars and this one just isn't as good as the first two.
0446563048|4.0|From his first attempt at worm farming as a young boy to the billion dollar sale of Zappos to Amazon in 2009 Tony Hsieh has been an entrepreneur for most of his life. Tech savvy and naturally hard working Tony (failed worm farm notwithstanding) has a sense for what worked in business.    Delivering Happiness - A Path to Profits, Passion and Purpose is part autobiography (with a narrow focus) and part business manual. Hsieh talks about his early businesses selling burgers and pizza in college, his small business investments and attempts leading up to investing in and becoming CEO of Zappos.com.    It seems the biggest success at Zappos is the company culture. Zappos would hire the second or third most qualified candidate (though still highly qualified for sure) if they were a better personality fit into the Zappos culture (to many employees it seems to be a way of life). This book made me want to work for Zappos.com - too bad they're in Las Vegas!    This is not a \\"how to make money\\" manual by any means, but any business owner could learn a lot from the story of how Zappos went from the brink of failure to their billion dollar sale to Amazon by focusing on making both customers and employees HAPPY. It's a \\"bottom-up\\" not a \\"top-down\\" culture that really believes every employee is as important as the next.    A great, quick read for anyone - you don't need to consider yourself an entrepreneur to get something out of this book. It contains not just business lessons but life lessons as well. It's no wonder that both Tony Hsieh and Zappos have become as hugely successful as they are. It's about people, not profits; a lesson 99% of business owners could learn a lot from.

B00102F5WK|5.0|I like Reese Witherspoon, and Jake Gyllenhaal so when I saw this movie at the library I quickly checked it out. Great movie. Great acting. But very disturbing. The thought of this kind of thing going on is inconceivable, yet I have no doubt that it does and that's what so disturbing.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|I am a latecomer to the Phantom, I did my best to ignore it from its' debut on. However, I decided to do something nice and take my mother and fiance to a stage production of the Phantom in April. I was in love within the first 20 minutes. By the end of Act 1 I already wanted to see it again! I took a chance and bought the full screen DVD edition and watched it with the same two people. It's fairly faithful to the stage production. Of course, film allows for much editing and more elaborate sets, but it didn't bother us. What did bother us was Gerard Butler's singing. It wasn't the same quality as the other principals in the movie, and nowhere close to anyone who has done the Phantom onstage. It was bearable, and we got used to it. I definitely will watch it again, while waiting to see a stage production of the Phantom of the Opera again someday.
0812548094|1.0|I had some hope after the first book in this series, as it seemed that there were some interesting ideas floating around in what was essentially a soup of derivative fantasy (think Star Wars/Matrix in a fantasy setting). Toward the end I was waiting for Darken Rahl to say, \\"Richard, I am your father. Together we will rule the world as father and son!\\" Anyhow, unfortunately the second book was the same type of derivative fantasy, only more shallow. It gets wrapped up \\"deus ex machina\\" style, or what I also like to refer to as \\"Dumbledore conversation.\\"    This is a 300 page book that was dragged out over 900+ pages. There are a number of interesting questions that are raised in the first 100 pages, but are answered (mostly) in the last 100 pages. Everything in between is hackneyed, repetitive filler. I found myself skipping 3 and 4 pages at a time. I'll try to put some context to this. There is a big long section in the middle of the book where Kahlan gets involved with an army that is fighting against hopeless odds. She spends a lot of time with them when she should be going to Aydindril to tell Zedd how she sent Richard with some strange (possibly untrustworthy) sorceress to teach him how to be a wizard and that, oh yeah, the veil to the underworld has been torn which could lead to the Keeper destroying the world of the living. This entire section of the book served no purpose other than giving Kahlan something to do. When she finally gets back on track she practically says something like, \\"Oh yeah, I guess helping Richard and saving the world is probably more important than saving a few small towns from this army I spent the last few weeks defeating. It must have been the Keeper distracting me. My bad.\\"     Also the characters are incredibly brilliant and powerful world leaders and heroes, yet they do the most stupid things. Kahlan, for example, spends a good while fighting Keltons, as mentioned above, then just strolls into Aydindril to find some Kelton sitting on her throne. Later that evening she catches him urinating in her bed and for some reason does not confess or execute him on the spot for treason. She then goes to the council meeting the next day without having a plan or even suspecting a trap. The new leader of the council whizzed in her bed the night before and she thinks nothing of it. She is portrayed as a brilliant military strategist and all around badass, but she doesn't bother to come up with a backup plan... how about she goes and finds a convicted murderer, confesses him, then instructs him to attend the meeting, as regular citizen's are allowed to be in the audience. OR she could have gotten the highly skilled assassin and the soldier she already confessed that were just outside of the city to go as well. When things start to go south she could order them to attack or at least cause a distraction so she can get away. I literally just thought that up on the spot, and I am not a brilliant military strategist, or a successful fantasy author. I think that exemplifies what is wrong with this book. The character's personality, intelligence, and abilities are changed at will by the author to facilitate plot points.    Even though I have mostly focused on Kahlan in this review, there are similar issues with Richard and Zedd. For instance, everything that happened to Richard, throughout the entire book, was invalidated with two \\"Dumbledore conversations\\" at the end of the book. After the big reveals, which were incredibly predictable and formulaic, I was left feeling like the author tricked me into reading this awful literary abortion.    This book is a derivative, repetitive, and poorly written soup of meandering fantasy cliches.
0385341008|5.0|I absolutely adored this book! It was a little slow at first and a few parts may have been predictable, but aren't most books? I borrowed this from the library first and then bought it for my Kindle afterward. This is one book I will read over and over.
0679428895|5.0|Great story. Great setting. Beautifully written. Get the hardback. The cheap paperbook is unworthy of such a great novel.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This was an excellent film. I had no desire to watch it. I am not into sci-fi movies but heard such ravings by my grown kids. So I bought it so they could watch it in blu-ray. Since we bought it my husband and I figured we'd watch it and we were pleasantly surprised. We really loved it. Very creative storyline. Top notch technology. Beautiful computerized world. We loved it. Wasn't what we expected.
1857885082|4.0|\\"WATCHING THE ENGLISH - The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour\\", by Kate Fox, is a wonderful tour-de-force, which explains the quirks and foibles, (and delights!), of modern English civilization and customs, often also explaining their origins.  As in many books, this one features snippets of raves from professional reviewers.  The pro review snippet that caught my eye, is this nice little succinct nugget from 'City Life', Manchester.  It reads:    \\" It's a fascinating and insightful book, but what really sets it apart is the informal style AIMED SQUARELY AT THE INTELLIGENT LAYMAN \\"  (My emphasis).    So, you WON'T find pages and pages of boring, sociological-babble here.  Nor will you find pages and pages of statistics.  Nope.  Just good, interesting, and truly fascinating writing!  It is insightful and delightful!  Humour comes up on many pages, and althought the writing style is not exactly the same, this book has the same TYPE of style and intent as the wonderful book \\"CLASS\\", by Paul Fussel, (for which I wrote my very first Amazon review!), which explains -- with similar good clear writng and wonderfully (and sometimes painfully) accurate humour, the often-hidden, rarely-spoken-of, but very very real, AMERICAN class system. (Buying -- and reading -- both of these books, can give one quite an education!)    Reading this book, one can also come to see the simularities and differences, not only between the USA and England -- but also the differences betwwen the American character, in general, and one's own ethnic background.  For instance, I asked both an aunt of mine who lives in Canada, and a computer technition, born in Sweden, who came to my home to fix my computer, what the main difference was, as they saw it, between Americans and Swedes, (and Americans and Canadians.)  The answer, in both cases was the same -- and also, it seems, is the primary difference, (or one of the primary differences), between the general Culture of the UK, and the general Culture ofthe USA.  And that is -- in the English, (as described in this book), Swedish, (and probably most other European), Canadian, (and probably many other non-USA cultures), MOST PEOPLE ARE MORE CIRCUMSPECT IN THEIR BEHAVIOUR.  quieter, that is.  not as boisterous.  more privacy-minded.  you get the idea.    The English, have many idiocincracies and habits NOT shared by many of their European neighbours.  Such as extanct class-dictinctions, still fueled by an EXISTANT aristorcracy.  (Italy -- and many other European countries -- may have noble families....but offially, Italy -- and the other countries are, of course, now REPUBLICS, with PRESIDENTS, and no longer have a king -(sad for us Royal-watchers....but that's one reason why England continues to have such a pull on the imaginations of so many romantic and romantic-Indigo types, like me!)  And unlike in the US, (and many other countries), the \\"go-getting\\" attitude of so many entrepreneurs, is somewhat frowned upon, and \\"lower-class\\" people who want to rise by their own intitiates, are still, (very unfortunately in my own, American-raised opinion), often told that they are: \\"Getting above themselves\\". (To me, this truly is a waste of talent.  Puttting \\"working-class\\" (ie: low-income), people down may serve some temporary upper-class aims, (keeping the \\"riff-raff\\" out, continuing a feeling of exclusivity and privilege -- and probably, in England, ACTUAL exclusivity and privilege, as well) -- but at what cost to progesss, and the ultimate prestige, (from the discoveries and accomplishments that these put-down and discouraged lower-class \\"go-getters\\" could, if encouaged, ultimately make?)  Thankfully, such things as scholarships, (and \\"The Princes' Trust\\"), DO, in fact exist in England, so all is not lost.    However, this is all my own opinion --- and not necessarily discussed in this book.  \\"Watching The English\\", is absorbing, full of examples of what people of various classes believe and why, and, most importantly, is eminently, delightfully READABLE!  The print size, while slightly smallish, is nonethess very well spaced, making it easier to read.  Margins are adequate -- especially near the binding side, which is important in any paperback book, (mass-market, or, as in this case, trade-paperback), so that the reader may enjoy the book whilst not afraid of breaking the binding!      The only criticism I have of this book -- as I have had, recently, with so many books, both hard-back and paperback -- is that the paper used is almost a crime!  It is of sulfite, and of SUCH poor quality, that, even though the British Empire might, as Churchill said, last for a thousand years, the paper used in the printing of this book certainly is NOT of \\"the finest\\".  It will definitely not last for the number of \\"hours\\" a book printed on non-sulfite paper would last -- far, far from it.   I doubt very much that the publishers wanted to send a message of the accellerating decline of British customs and ceremonies by printing this book on such paper, (which will last, perhaps, 30 years before it turns to dust) --- but that certainly is the impression given, when opening this book!  (And better paper does NOT cost more to use -- the only cost involves the ONE-TIME expense of replacing the paper-making EQUIPMENT, which is different for sulphite and acid-free paper.  Acid free paper not only looks better and brighter -- but   (especially in the printing of THIS book), gives a sub-conscious, but very definite impression to the reader of the timeless, and ever-continuing values of English Civilization, which, though they do change a bit through the years, remain basically the same ones that people of taste and style continue to still look up to, throughout the world.    This book is for English people who better want to understand their culture, for Anglophiles who also want, (desperately!), to understand it -- and, perhaps, as a gift to those people who are \\"anti-English\\", whom you might, (dearly!)wish to understand it  and come to deeply admire it, as you yourself do.      But then, giving this book to that type of person would not be so circumspect, would it?   : )
B001FB5634|5.0|This is a very well executed and faithful rendering of a powerful story.  It's been a few years since I read the book, a riveting and unrelentingly grim experience.  I was dubious about the potential for a film and hesitated to see it.  But am very glad I did see it and recommend it highly.  The film is a two-hour immersion into the dreary landscape rather than the several hours it takes to read the book.  In the film the humanity and enduring devotion of the father and son were even more touching and front-and-center, I thought, a credit to the actors.  The ending was poignant and hopeful.  The sense I was left with was that the world of The Road was seriously wounded but not dead and that there were good people left to fight for a better future.  The Road is well worth seeing and reading.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I have been waiting for this day for some time.  I never believed we would be seeing a Two Steps from Hell CD released to the public.  Now that it is here, it is everything I hoped it would be.  I'm not a music collector and I'm not really that into movie scores, but I am one of those people who heard a few clips of their music in trailers, looked them up on youtube and was very disappointed to find that I could not legally own any of these songs.    Anyone who doesn't get chills while listening to some of these songs must not have a pulse.  They are rousing, grandiose, and tell distinct stories.  I don't really have to sell this album, just preview freedom fighters, heart of courage, protectors of earth, almost any track.  I'm not really sure who wouldn't like this, especially at this price.
B003ELOQD4|2.0|Long time fan since early 80's. Own it all. Seen them on several tours. I like the band. Seen their concert films. Was particularly moved and impressed with the U23D I saw at imax. This U2360 Blu-ray is very hard to watch. Put simply. How does the biggest band in the world. With the biggest stage and production in one of the biggest venues in the US not consider the home viewer of this DVD? One needs to capture the concert experience. The majesty of the set. The narrative of the songs and flow of the show. They have done this before in their other video releases. Other artists like Peter Gabriel and countless others get this concept. Apparently the director and editor of this production did not. Jump cuts and shaky footage can be useful for effect and to make visual points and are great when they are used sparingly. But when not a single shot lasts more than 3 seconds and there are jarring zooms and pans in them...You get a mess. We have split screens. Super imposed shots. Quick shot of Bono's shoes to a quick shot of the back of Larry's head. Those things work in a 4-5 minute song video..But a live concert has to take you there. I think of New Years day at Red Rocks. I think of Exit in Rattle and Hum. I think of Origin of Species in U23D as amazing moments of u2 on video. This concert film does not have those moments and it is not because of the performance, the sound, or their material which is great...It is because the editor and director approached this like a communication student that just got final cut pro. I will watch it again because I own it. Maybe dig around on the disc menu for alternate shots. Or just treat it like a really expensive live CD.
B00004XPPB|3.0|Other critics have said this is nothing compared to Goodfellas. This is the worst mafia movie from the modern era I've seen. Casting Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone in The Godfather, in this film may have seemed like a good idea at the time, but he's so lame compared to Corleone! The Godfather is considered the best or one of the best movies of all time (according to online votes at imdb.com). It's the gold standard of mafia movies. Making Pacino the lead character for DB raises your expectations, but they aren't fulfilled, unfortunately.    Donnie Brasco is very uneven. The start is very slow and very weak. I'd rate the first half of the movie two stars and the last half three to four stars. The first half hour is slow and boring; it felt like a homemade movie. The way it was so easy for Donnie Brasco to get accepted by Pacino's character was silly. It wasn't even accurate to the history, apparently. So why did the screenwriter change the story to make it so much less credible, and far worse. Brasco spots a fake diamond and sort of beats up a guy. Let's make him part of our inner mob circle.    Through a good portion of the film, the mobsters seem more like a lame street gang than major mafia criminals. They are clowns. Later on, however, it gets really nasty and graphic with lots of blood and nasty visuals.    A glaring weakness and mistake in Donnie Brasco was how poorly it conveyed the importance of Brasco's work. At the end with the credits they tell us that Brasco was responsible for 200 indictments and 100 convictions and still has a $500,000 price on his head. Until then it seemed more like he'd taken down a few people in a little street gang of mafia wannabes.    The screenwriting was very disappointing. Paul Attanasio screwed it up. How somebody who'd written police drama for many years could f this up is unbelievable. The producers made the mistake of choosing a screenwriter whose experience was crime tv, not crime movies. This movie could have been so much better. Hopefully it will be remade one day by people who know what they are doing. A true story like Donnie Brasco deserves a five-star movie. The man is a legend with balls of steel.
B00000AF95|4.0|Still clinging to the original vinyl copy I bought when it came out, the album still has the same fun appeal it did 20+ years ago.      Full of funny and politically uncorrect lyrics as was the norm for Kiss (\\"Let me put my log in your fire\\" \\"Let's hit the highway doing 69\\" etc..,) and the great guitar work of Mark St. John, who came up with a slew of great riffs, along with Paul Stanley's great work, to create a complete album from start to finish.    Not really a weak track on this one, and it's in the same class as Kiss' 80's classics, Creatures Of the Night, Asylum and Lick It Up, and is probably right behind Creatures for best 80's Kiss albums.     Suprisingly one of Gene's best songs, that I like any ways, is \\"While The City Sleeps,\\" and the single \\"Heaven's On Fire\\" is silly fun you can look back and laugh at, and St. John's guitar and Paul's lyrics overcome any lyrical cheese, as they are completely unique and outstanding.    How sad to think St. John was denied a future because of arthritis, he is really impressive on this album.      \\"Get All You Can Take\\" is another standout, \\"Thrills In The Night\\" is a classic Kiss single, \\"Under The Gun\\" \\"Lonely Is The Hunter\\" and the single quality \\"I've Had Enough (Into The Fire)\\" all carry Animalize, but \\"Burn Bitch Burn\\" (horrible sexual analogy still makes for funny song that's likeable with Gene's overtones) and \\"Murder In High Heels\\" represent what I guess you would say are the weakest tracks, but both fit-in very well here and Gene is top notch on \\"Heels.\\" So I can't even call them weak, they're great Kiss songs, the whole album is good, ecspecially if you like Gene and prefer their heavier material, mixed with a bit of 80's era pop metal.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Can't ask for more for less than $30! Installation is painless and includes instructions in a plethora of languages. Without a doubt, the Hyper 212+ performance easily bests many of its competitors in terms of price and performance.
B00008CLOA|2.0|Probably one of the most recognizable titles in the music industry.  Too bad the only tune I consider passable is \\"Money\\".  The rest of the   music on this CD stinks.
B001W63DXC|5.0|I've got into Iron Maiden maybe 8 or 9 years ago, but I own all of their live albums and DVDs or VHS tapes (and all their studio albums as well).<br /><br />I have got to say that this is without a doubt my favorite live Iron Maiden album to date.  Not only because it has my favorite tracklist which I will mention later, but it's the best recording and best performances yet - yes, even better than Live After Death which is all I need to say about how top notch the performances on this live album.  Any Iron Maiden fan knows how awesome Live After Death was!<br /><br />And I nearly had an accident when I saw the tracklist.  Four of my favorite Iron Maiden songs are Moonchild, Aces High, Rime of the Ancient Mariner and The Evil That Men Do, the latter being the only one that stayed in their setlist past 1990ish.  The other three tracks made their way back into the setlist and onto this recording, as well as several other songs that haven't been on the setlist in some time (Powerslave, The Clairvoyant, Wasted Years, Heaven Can Wait, Revelations) as well as some of their most popular and some of their mainstays (2 Minutes to Midnight, The Trooper, The Number of the Beast, Run to the Hills, Fear of the Dark).<br /><br />To be honest, if I made the setlist the only thing I would change is I might try to get Afraid to Shoot Strangers, Man on the Edge (which is a great song, especially when Bruce sings it), The Thin Line Between Love And Hate and possibly The Evil That Men Do and/or Infinite Dreams in there somehow.  I'm happy enough having Moonchild, Aces High, Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Powerslave.
B001GM28HO|5.0|This is a really great album, typical gaga!  If you like gaga, you'll love this album
B001W63DX2|5.0|The film itself is motivating and lifting, watching these six guys flying around in an airplane doing what they love.<br /><br />The concert footage includes three of my four all-time favorite Iron Maiden songs, all of which are rarely performed anymore (Aces High, Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Moonchild -- the song not included is The Evil That Men Do, but they almost always play that).  Additionally there are some other songs that you don't get to see live too often, like Powerslave, The Clairvoyant, Can I Play With Madness, Wasted Years, Heaven Can Wait, and Revelations.  They also play some of the more common songs like 2 Minutes to Midnight, The Trooper, Hallowed Be Thy Name, The Number of the Beast, Fear of the Dark and Run to the Hills.<br /><br />Overall the track selection in my opinion couldn't be much better and I strongly believe that this is possibly their best live performance recorded to date -- it's definitely on the same par as as Live After Death -- I would have to say a little better.  They sound really good!
193413712X|3.0|I chose this book because the author won a Pulitzer Prize for writing.  After reading the book I wonder how in the world Paul Harding won such a notable prize.  He is a good writer, with several memorable sentences, but the book was disjointed, difficult to follow and as far as I was concerned did not have a purpose, plot or story.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|Let me start off by saying I'm far from Nightwish's biggest fan.  I don't dislike the band (okay, maybe I do now that they have a total pop sound and a new, less-talented vocalist that shouldn't even attempt to sing any of the older material live because it's far above her skillset) -- but I'm more into progressive rock and thrash metal.<br /><br />In 2001, Nightwish released their first live album, From Wishes To Eternity which was all around a very good recording and good performance.  This album contains material from their first three albums, which I had always preferred over Century Child and Once -- until I got End of an Era.<br /><br />End of an Era contains material mostly from Wishmaster, Century Child and Once.  The entire band's performance is very good and most surprisingly Tarja gives her best performance on many of these songs on this live album (talented vocalists almost always have the hardest live. Not being able o hear yourself makes singing like playing a fretless bass after driking a bottle of Jack Daniels).  Many of her best performances recorded are on this live album.  Tarja's performances on Sleeping Sun, Bless The Child, Dark Chest of Wonders, Nemo, and Ghost Love Score absolutely put her studio performances on the same songs to shame.  Her performance on Wishmaster blows all her other performances, live or studio to shame.  Tarja's voice has never sounded better.  And the entire band hits every note.<br /><br />I would recommend this DVD & CD set to any Nightwish fan.  I would also recommend that anyone looking to get into the band picks this up and Oceanborn rather than one of the various \\"best of\\" compilations out there.  The best tracks from Wishmaster, Century Child and Once albums are included, and the performance is better.
B001FB5634|4.0|The Road was a great film, though not the most original I've seen. 1981's The Road Warrior (aka Mad Max II) dealt with very  similar issues and I think was a better film, as it had a bit more action and humour, and also dealt with a lot of the issues  in this film but didnt linger on them as long. One of scenes with Max and The Gyrocaptain pretty much summed up what this movie  is all about, when Gyro is saying how good things used to be in the world - that comment had about 5 seconds screentime.  The Road is a beautiful, dark and probably the most depressing film I've ever seen. Viggo Mortensen really is a glutten for punishment,  after wrapping on three Lord of The Rings films which involved a LOT of walking, here we see him make another movie which pretty  much is more walking than anything else. However, I was impressed that John Hillcoat (The Proposition) chose to film this movie in locations  all around the world that had been touched by enviromental disasters rather than cram it full of CGI, the result works and the movie pulls  you into the world like a recurring nightmare. The best thing about this movie is the music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, it is simply  stunning and without it I doubt the film would have had as much impact - the sense of utter hopelessness at the end of the world breaks your  heart - especially when Viggo's character stands on the freeway and throws his girlfriend's image to the wind because it hurts him too much to have  her in his heart anymore, its truly heartbreaking. This is a wonderful film but do not watch it in periods of despair or with razorblades close at  hand.
0307455874|3.0|Before I read the book, I thought the book The Audacity of Hope by Barack Obama was basically a very well written advertisement for Barack Obama. I thought its sole purpose was to portray him as 'the good guy' and appeal to the average American's values, and boost his popularity within the political world of America. I was party right and party wrong. Now that I've finished the book, I believe the goal was right. however, the intended audience isn't the average American. Some of the political detail he talks about is beyond the grasp of the average American. 'Left Wing', 'Right Wing', Democrats, and their expected baviours. Despite that, the book was an interesting read.    Overall, there were good points and bad points in the book. The personal stories were the most interesting parts of the book. Everyone loves hearing stories about other people's lives. Maybe because its the gossiper in everyone at work.    The political sections of the book were boring, and didn't add much value. If the purpose of the book was to communicate Obama's hopes for the future, the details of politics dindn't seem entirely relevant, except to give background information.    The sections about what can be done to improve America was quite average, and seemed reused. But Obama's reflections from the perspective of a black American was refreshing.    Obama can sure talk the talk. He's smooth, passionate, and honest. And all this is accurately portrayed in the book.
B001HN6940|1.0|When in God's name is Johnny Depp going to star in a GOOD movie?  He's being wasted on these Tim Burton films.  I didn't enjoy this movie at all.
030726999X|4.0|If you liked the first two books in the Girl series (and if you didn't, you are unlikely to be reading this), you will find Hornet's Nest a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.  On the plus side, the sexual violence was kept to a minimum, all the loose ends were wrapped up, and the pacing was almost uniformly strong.  Salendar is also more a part of the action than in the first book, and the more Salendar the better!  I did find the number of good guys working against the bad guys a bit ridiculous; it rendered the \\"threat\\" from the bad guys not very suspenseful and the portrayal of the evil and danger they represented overblown.
030726999X|5.0|To say the book and story, completing the trilogy, is excellent seems an understatement.  It is just one of those special works.  The reader's patience is richly rewarded after the first third of the book introduces a complex back-story, multiple sub-plots, and a dizzying number of characters with foreign names that can at first be challenging to keep track of and allow for an easy reading rhythm.  Many of the characters express an individual intelligence that contribute to their attractiveness and enjoyment.  So - great, unforgetable characters, interesting dialogue, intriguing situations, outstanding plot and drama, and masterful writing with a satisfying ending.  The book is a bit of a time machine - hours simply disappeared as I read!  It's a great loss that the author did not have the chance write more books, but Larsson has left a powerful and lasting contribution.  To a new reader, my recommendation is to read the trilogy in order, quickly following with the next book to best savor this compelling story.
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|All Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) wants is to make enough money to open the restaurant her father always dreamed of but died before he accomplished his dream. But when spoiled Maldonian Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) comes to New Orleans and has a run in with The Shadow Man Dr. Falicier (Keith David) that turns him into a frog, Tiana gives him a kiss to turn him back into a prince only to find herself a frog as well. Now they must find The Shadow Man before his greater plot of New Orleans domination unfolds.    It seems like it's been forever since the last time we've actually seen a hand drawn animation from Disney, or course part of the reason for that is that the last hand drawn feature film from Disney was the forgettable Home on the Range. After that Disney closed the doors on hand drawn animation, that is until the new president and chief creative officer of Disney Animation reopened the doors in 2006. After reassembling the animators who were laid off or left the company they started work on a movie idea that borrowed from E.D. Baker's novel The Frog Princess and The Brothers Grimm's Frog Prince.    The Princess and the Frog is a welcome return to form for Disney animation, which outside of Pixar hasn't really had a great animated movie in years. Basing the style of the film on Bambi and Lady and the Tramp gives the film a physical style that recalls the greatest era of Disney animation, while using a mix of jazz and blues in the musical arrangements for the film gives it a fresh flavor and distinction from previous animated musicals created by Disney. Also the story and script for the film also gives off a very old fashioned vibe, fitting in superbly with the more innocent times of Disney animation, but with fresh locales as well as strong characters that are very modern also give set the film apart as something new and exciting.    Another great thing about the change in locale is the chance for many of the voice actors to experiment with the various types of accents that you can hear in and around New Orleans during the period the film is set in. Even John Goodman, who won't be heard using an accent in his new show Treme on HBO, uses an accent that perfectly suits him for the role. Stealing the show is the firefly from the bayou Ray, who has that quirky role that can be seen in most Disney films (think Rafiki from The Lion King) who's crazy, but wise and fun to watch whenever he's on screen.    While the music in the film is great, and fresh for a Disney film, nothing seems to hit the ear the way songs like \\"Whole New World,\\" \\"Be Our Guest,\\" \\"Under the Sea,\\" or \\"I Just Can't Wait to be King\\" did in the late 80's and early 90's animated musicals from Disney did. Also, I felt the moral of the story was a little to \\"in your face\\" something I can't really say that I felt with Disney's previous offerings. Fortunately, these minor quibbles don't detract from the film, and most likely just stem from me being overly critical based on what I expected from the high standard set from Disney's last golden period of animation.    Overall, if you enjoy a good Disney animated feature (and I know your kids do) I highly recommend this. It has all the earmarks of a classic Disney film: great music, great characters, comedy, great story, and a moral for the kids. Even if it is a little bit on the lite classic side, it is still a very enjoyable film, and definitely one that can hold it's own against Disney's earlier films. Welcome back Disney!    4/5
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I was skeptical when I first heard of this movie. I figured it was going to be another cheesy alien movie. Boy, was I wrong! Everyone in my family LOVED this movie from our teenage boys to our 10 year old daughter. It was a terrific movie to watch. The graphics were utterly amazing and the storyline was like nothing we had ever heard of. Definitely a unique movie and a definite keeper. I am one that usually doesn't watch a movie more than once - this one is an exception!
B000AP04OM|4.0|Maria Rainer (Julie Andrews), a candidate to become a nun at the Nonnberg Abbey in Austria, is a bit of a problem for the nuns. So to help her determine if she's truly ready to become a nun she's sent to be the governess for the stern Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children, who've driven away all of their former governess's. Soon they warm up to Maria, though, as does the Captain, and together they change the way the von Trapp household is run.    Based on the true story of the von Trapp Family Singers, The Sound of Music was the last musical written by Rodgers and Hammerstein as Oscar Hammerstein II died of cancer in 1960. Originally conceived as a Broadway musical that opened up in 1959, the rights changed hands several times before the film was eventually made. Since then The Sound of Music has become the third highest grossing movie of all time when it's grosses are adjusted for inflation (just behind Gone With the Wind and Star Wars respectively) and saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy after the flop of 1963's Cleopatra.    Surprisingly, considering I'm not typically a big fan of musicals with a few exceptions, I actually have to say that I did enjoy The Sound of Music. Of course, this has less to do with the music than the fact that the characterizations are full and complete, allowing you to lose yourself in the characters and feel for their plights and passions. The plotting is also quite taut for a film that's almost three hours long, keeping you on the edge of your toes with the character's personal crises as well as with the outward crises that lands in Austria with the Nazis in the latter parts of the film.    The acting is very well done, as that's what really gets you invested in the characters. At the time The Sound of Music went into production Julie Andrews was largely unknown as Mary Poppins hadn't been released, but she nails the part of the innocent and free spirited Maria. Christopher Plummer, who famously didn't enjoyworking on the film (later referring to it as The Sound of Mucus) doesn't let on on screen his displeasure with the film, and still you feel the characters distaste for the Nazi regime and his love for Maria as well as his transformation from stern father figure to hands on patriarch.    The biggest problem with The Sound of Music is that its a little too sweet, dripping with saccharine. This also means that some of the musical sequences can come off a bit to extremely cheesy, but even through that the film still feels genuine. And while I understand the need to make changes to a real life story in a film, every once in a while a filmmakers choices of change can be a little insulting to the subject of the film. The real Captain von Trapp, as stated by his children and his wife Maria, was not a stern man, and did not run his family like a military platoon as depicted in the film. Despite the pleadings of Maria and his children, the filmmakers decided to keep the characterization in the movie, which seems to me a little insulting to his memory.    Overall, though, I do have to say that I enjoyed this movie. It gives an interesting depiction, especially towards the end of what Austrian citizens had to go through after the Nazi invasion. If you like musicals, or want to be transported to a more innocent time I highly recommend this movie. Just be careful after watching the movie or you could find yourself humming Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs for the next several weeks!    4/5
1601251505|4.0|There's really not a whole lot to say about this book. They basically combined the D&D 3.5 PHB and DMG into one large book, altered some rules and things, put some better, more consistent art in it, and decided that was worth 40 or 50 bucks. Now, I'm not saying this book is a waste of money. Personally I love the changes they made to the original 3.5 edition rules. I just think maybe they could have printed the stuff they changed and left out the stuff they didn't change. They could have released it as a much smaller book of alternative rules and saved a lot of time and money.
B000062YAZ|5.0|I was having a ball reading all the negative reviews. This album is \\"overrated?\\" King and Hanneman suck? Really? Well, guess who's got the last laugh? How many bands can you name that have been consistently releasing albums for 27 years, with nary a dud in their catalog? Name them!<br />I can't really say much about this album that hasn't been said. It's a masterpiece of metal. Razor sharp in its vicious attack, relentless in its thrusting power. A magnificent display of calculated aggression that almost no one can rival.<br />You whiners are a laughable bunch. Tsk, tsk.
1400076943|5.0|Ms Adichie's writing style is captivating, like poetry, or a song...She is a breath of fresh air...<br /><br />Purple Hibiscus is deep and real. Even though I am Nigerian and can thus relate to a lot of what she writes about, being from another tribe and not being catholic still made me have some \\"Aha\\" moments.<br /><br />I have to say I was a little shocked by the ending. It was somewhat unexpected and I was even a little sad but it just goes to show how real the story was.<br /><br />It was definitely not a predictable outcome though very plausible.<br /><br />I intend to read all of Chimamanda Adichie's work. I want to write like her when I grow up!
B001EN71CW|5.0|I'm not big into sci fi movies or shows... I like some of the older (circa mid 90's) star trek movies, but not enough to own them... that being said, I was flipping through the channels about 2 years ago and caught 5 minutes of Serenity.. I was hooked!  I kept it on my DVR for about 6 months (until my wife promised to buy me the blu-ray)...  not being a sci fi person, I had NO IDEA about the fire fly series, so when someone lent them to me at work, it was like a kid discovering ice-cream for the first time...  I just ordered them on bluray and I can't wait until they come..

B002BWQ6H6|4.0|I purchased this book based on a recommendation, and I suggest you do the same. Each character is so completely realized, by the end of the book you feel as if you've known them your entire life. I did not want it to end, but when it did, I was overwhelmingly satisfied with the result. A full meal, for sure.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|[[ASIN:B001U0HBQ0 The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]]Few movies evoke deep emotion within me, but when they do, the effects stay with me long after the final scene plays out and the credits begin rolling down the screen.  I have been aching to watch this movie ever since it first came out in 2008, but I never got the chance to see it at the theatre.  Then, the other day I found the DVD at a deep discount on Amazon.com for a mere $2.00 plus shipping.  It was used, but it was in good condition and quite a bargain, if you ask me.<br /><br />It arrived in today's mail and it was just in time for a lazy Saturday afternoon of entertainment.  After watching the movie, it is understandable that it won three Academy Awards.  Based upon an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story, the producers, directors and actors brought an astounding presentation to the big screen.  Brad Pitt, of course, did an amazing job with his portrayal of Benjamin Button, but then Brad Pitt could just stand there and look gorgeous and I would say he was magnificent, no matter what the movie was about.  Cate Blanchett, as Daisy, the woman he was destined to love forever, was his perfect co-star.<br /><br />Yes, the premise of the movie is odd in that a baby (Benjamin) is born in the unlikely state of an eighty-year-old man with severe health issues, who then grows younger, healthier and more handsome as each year passes by, but I found so many similarities between this story and real life.  You know...all that Cougar stuff - older woman with a younger man - and even the older man with the younger woman, which is more common.  A mother's love for her child was also played out in several different scenarios.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for tear-jerker movies that bring to the screen the true emotions of real life, though, so this one was right up my alley.  My only complaint was that many of the scenes were just too dark...not enough lighting or something...or maybe I need to adjust the brightness and contrast on my television screen.  Other than that, I thought it was an absolutely brilliant screenplay.  If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest you do.  It is well worth your time.nd contrast on my television screen.  Other than that, I thought it was an absolutely brilliant screenplay.  If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest you do.  It is well worth your time.
B000B589JI|5.0|Some reviewer mentioned that the fuel spilled. Mmm, perhaps s/he has something wrong on the unit s/he got, because that has NEVER happened to me! I have used my Zippo fuel canister SEVERAL times and it works perfect! It's a very well sealed unit!<br /><br />Just keep in mind it gives you just 1 load. But that's enough don't you think?<br /><br />One thing I love is about the appearance of this Zippo fuel canister; in my opinion this is an awesome piece of art! Very, very beautiful indeed!<br /><br />So if you're a Zippo user/lover like I am, this product is for you!!!<br /><br />Great product, great quality, great look. I recommend it highly!!!

B002CAAO5M|5.0|Honestly - for those who had the good sense to stick with Prince after he broke the commercial barriers and won an Oscar for 'Purple Rain', this is one of those albums that deserves a second, third, and fourth listen. As a teenager when this album came out, I had the LP which came with fancy artwork and an LP sleeve that had the song lyrics (in different fonts!) so I could be as close to Prince's message as possible while memorizing the lyrics and melodies.<br /><br />'Condition of the Heart' is to this day one of the most romantic and heartfelt love songs ever written. A classical song on a Prince album? Yep. This is the one. That '3 Chains of Gold' so called opera on the 'symbol' album has nothing on this. Gave up trying to interpret that one.<br /><br />'Paisley Park' of course later proved to be the inspiration behind Prince's Paisley Park Studios where he does most (all?) of his current recordings. 'Raspberry Beret' was the breakout hit - complete with his head to toe cloud print suit for the video - but there are definte standouts here (in addition to the ones mentioned above) that were overlooked. 'America', 'Pop Life', and the irony that is the placement of the last two songs- 'The Ladder' ('everybody wants salvation...of...the soul..') and then 'Temptation'(purple electricity whenever our bodies touch...') is pure vintage Prince. Party like it's 1999, but be sure to go to church and repent on Sunday.
B000092T6M|4.0|Well, the story is simple.  Robin of Locksley returns from the crusades to find the Sheriff has mismanaged the King's lands.  With help from characters like Little John, Will Scarlett, Marian, Hazim (sp?) he \\"robs from the rich and gives to the poor.\\"  The scenery is beautiful and there are some funny parts.  Liked the movie alot.<br /><br />Special extended disk has a featurette, the Bryan Adams music video for the theme song, and interviews with main cast members.  If you are into this type of thing it's ok.  The featurette appears to be made around the time that the movie itself was made.  Contains a few interesting facts but nothing super special.  A young Pierce Brosnan narrates it, and is kind of cheesey and entertaining in itself.  There is also a behind the scenes section, which is disappointing.  It contains four topics of subjects for you to READ about.  In the whole special features part they never address why Kevin Costner never used an English accent, which to me did not at all affect my enjoyment of the film but none the less should have been explained (I suspect he just couldn't pull it off convincingly).<br /><br />If you have not seen the film, it is in my opinion a great version of Robin Hood.  The special disk, in my opinion is always worth owning but in this case should have been done much better than it was.
0340896981|5.0|This book must be one of the most lovely modern tale. You'll find yourself thinking about it long after you've finished it.
B000BZISTE|2.0|I bought this movie because my fiance is addicted to the TV show.  However, even though it follows the same train of thought...doctors during the Korean conflict, who don't want to be there and drink and don't follow rules etc, it lacks the charm of the TV show by far.  Donald Sutherland does nothing with the Hawkeye character but make him kind of creepy.  However I don't understand why in the TV show they took out characters from the movie such as \\"Duke\\"??? It is worth watching if you like the TV show because you get the contrast and you have a better understanding of how everything started for the show.  But overall this movie was a disappointment for me.  And it ruined the theme song (do you know it has words???)
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|I have always been a big fan of Disney's animated films, but there was a time when they had seemed to be making less than magical films. 'The Princess and the Frog' is a vibrant and colorful joy ride through Nawl'ins with some very endearing characters(Raymond the Cajun firefly is one of the best comic relief characters I've seen in a long time).<br /><br />It's actually nice to see a hand drawn 2 -D cartoon again, especially when it's Disney doing it with a full passion. I can tell you honestly that the film looks beautiful and the Blu Ray makes it all that much better. I love CGI animated films, but there is a nice old fashioned quality that these hand drawn 2-D animated films have, that is lost in CGI films.<br /><br />The 3 discs Blu Ray is really nice with a great Blu Ray transfer, a equally nice standard DVD, plus a treasure trove of goodies on the bonus disc and of course the new standard digital copy(who really needs this?) In closing, if you're looking for some good old Disney fun, 'The Princess And The Frog' delivers the goods, it may not be their best of all time, but it's a welcome return to what made Disney the animation giants 70 plus years ago.

0307454541|2.0|isn't that how lifetime stays on the air? all of their sexual violence movies? this book is terrible and im questioning weather I; should finish  reading it? or sell it too the used bookstore for 2 dollars?<br /><br />i also find slander's character extremely unbelievable, if she can hold a job then why does she have a guardian? if she can live alone, drive a motorcycle, get tattoos without permission then why did they give her a guardian!?! it just doesn't make sense. this book is a wash and i wouldn't recommend it..BUT im still gonna finish it..cuz i bought the damn thing.

B003L0V758|5.0|My review will not be long, but suffice it to say I am a complete and total convert to Janelle Monae! Would you believe that I first became aware of her JUST YESTERDAY from reading the 2 page review in NEWSWEEK...her profile picture was mesmerizing....I immediately went to YouTube to see her work.....and was struck by lightning! I havent felt this kind of affect since 1977 when I first discovered Philip Glass. After sending links to these videos to all of my friends I immediately purchased her cds. The best thing I ever did. Her work is musically and visually arresting! Her stage presence pays homage to James Brown, Michael Jackson, and, dig this, Gene Kelly! Do yourself a favor and get this music, listen to this music, watch her videos, and follow her career!
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Story line is ok.  Movie is a bit long.  Visually, amazing on Blu-ray.  No regrets...
B001C4AFOY|4.0|As the story opens, we meet 17-year old Princess Victoria (Emily Blunt), the niece and heir-apparent of her uncle, King William IV.  The girl is controlled in every way by her selfish mother (Miranda Richardson) and greedy advisor, Sir John Conroy, but is still spunky and strong-willed.  She meets Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, well-aware that their marriage would be politically advantageous and at 18, becomes Queen.<br /><br />This movie is first and foremost a visual feast, with sumptuous costumes and elegant sets that make us feel we are truly peeking at royals behind closed doors.  The script itself is rather episodic and choppy, with an endless parade of characters that we don't have time to know or care about, and the endless political wrangling among her advisors is sometimes tedious.  The  relationship between Victoria and Albert is handled discreetly and they are shown to be a very happy couple indeed.<br /><br />Emily Blunt makes a beautiful, passionate, and poised Victoria and Rupert Friend is fine as the reserved young Albert.  The DVD extras on wardrobe and Victoria's life are informative and enjoyable.  All in all, it's pretty enough to make any girl want to be a queen.
1416562605|5.0|I love all books written about India.  I find it to be a magical, dangerous, romantic, heartbreaking, and exciting place that only exists for me in books (I am dying to go, but who can afford that on a teacher's salary?).  Anyways, like my subject states - I absolutely could not put this down.  I formed an immediate love-hate relationship with the narrator.  He commits despicable acts, but for some reason you find yourself justifying them.  Throughout the book I felt such a range of emotions and feelings:  disgust, pity, respect, pride, fear, guilt, anticipation, and finally acceptance.  I loved this book and would recommend this to anyone interested in an easy read with substance;)  I do not share the opinion of the review that stated the novel was too long (and pretty much all other negative comments) - I believe this novel was perfect!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I still believe this should have won the Best Picture award.  The storyline is well developed, like the characters - the imagination and visuals are astounding.  Upon watching this movie i have to remind my children about the movies that were made when i was growing up, Bambi & Bednobs & Broomsticks - great movies for sure - but, nothing like the \\"world\\" that is brought to life in Avatar.  There is definitely a sad part of this story - how militarized we humans have become and how we sometimes steal from the mother earth that which may be more well served by more primitive times/beings - but, even that message is delivered well and with forthought and care.  One of the best of all time!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This fascinating film reminds me of the powerful lines in Thucydides's \\"The Peloponnesian War\\" (here an Athenian is speaking to the Spartans): \\"Take time then in forming your resolution, as the matter is of great importance; and do not be persuaded by the opinions and complaints of others and so bring trouble on yourselves, but consider the vast influence of accident in war, before you are engaged in it. As it continues, it generally becomes an affair of chances, chances from which neither of us is exempt, and whose event we must risk in the dark. It is a common mistake in going to war to begin at the wrong end, to act first, and wait for disaster to discuss the matter.\\"    Thousands of years show us how there is nothing new under the sun, but it is still my hope people view this film for hundreds of years to come.
B000UJ24SC|5.0|Nocturnal: Best metal album of the 2000's  wow. I was very surprised when I heard this, I had only previously listened through Deflorate a few times and Miasma once, and then I listened to this all the way through and was totally sold on this band, This album is AWESOME. I think its the catchyness I like the most, some of the guitar hooks and vocal hooks are just awe-inspiring. Deathmask Divine is my favorite track I cannot get enough of it but that is definitely not the only good song. Some people say that this album is boring and I really don't understand how you could think that, each song stands out and it is very easy to pick favorites. It is just as heavy as Deflorate and Miasma so there is nothing lacking in that department, and its' tracks stand out more than both of those albums, I found Deflorate pretty boring and the same with Miasma (although I have only listened to it once through.)  get this album now.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|I think that Michael Lewis did a great job with the \\"Big Short\\".  I was fascinated by the subject matter and at times I could not put the book down.  Near the end of the book I was terribly saddened by the outright greed of many of the players at the Wall Street firms.  I beleive this book describes an attitude that is pervasive throughout society...hooray for me and screw you and everyone else.  When I reflect on the whole subprime mess I realize that the Wall Street Bankers weren't the only ones who lacked the moral discipline to act responsibly.  The borrowers, mortgage originators, lawyers, and real estate sales people, were all part of the Big Short.  I fear thier actions will be paid for over many years by retirees and our children.      I reccommend this book to any person who plans to participate in the world of finance.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|The item got here quicker than I expected.  Great service and great product.  Thanks.
B001NLKT60|5.0|As if this book needed yet another great review, here I go.  Simply put this is just a ton of fun to read.  Perhaps better than the first, this takes you deeper into the lives of the main characters, and keeps you in a perpetual state of wanting to read more.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|I loved Daria when it was on the air, and was so pleased to hear it was coming to us finally on DVD.<br /><br />The episodes are all there in their glory.  The original music is gone, but the replacement music fits just fine 99% of the time.  I loved every second of watching this wonderful series again, and was sad when I finished the set.<br /><br />There are special features but not enough, and not interesting enough.  There are character sketches with some captioning that seems to be aimed at teens (don't they realize the teens who watched this show ten years ago are nearing 30 now?).  There is a bit called \\"Cast and Crew interviews\\" which is merely a 7-minute featurette of which 2 minutes are clips from the show.  The interviews are new, but needless to say: SHORT.  There are no commentaries at all.<br /><br />One final bit - the series is only \\"almost\\" in chronological order.  The movie \\"Is It Fall Yet?\\" falls between \\"Dye! Dye! My Darling\\" and \\"Fizz Ed\\", but the movie itself is located on the final disk.  There are no instructions for new viewers to go to the final disk for the movie.<br /><br />However that's all a small price to pay to get the entire series on DVD, and the ONLY reason I bumped it down to 4 stars.  The series itself is TOTALLY 5-star, and every bit as wonderfully snarky as I remembered it.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Michael Lewis does a great job of telling the story of a few of the people who actually made money from the economic collapse by seeing what so many others could not.  However, these are not the top people at Goldman Sachs, creating products they would later bet against; these are quirky fascinating characters who possessed a morality that was sadly lacking in many of the peripheral characters of this real life drama.  Very insightful into the causes that led to the great recession, and a ton of fun to read.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|While I enjoyed the first one more, this sequel was still quite good and if a third is ever made I will definitely get it as well!    I wish this BD had more deleted scenes, but overall it was okay, and I enjoyed the comicon panel.
159448385X|4.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle to read during a recent vacation. It is a fairly long book and I expected to read it over the course of a week or so, but it was such a page turner I couldn't put it down and finished it in a couple of days. Beautifully written, with good character development. It also gave me great insights into life in another time frame, in another culture. Very moving.
B001EO748M|2.0|I recently read \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" followed by \\"The Boleyn Inheritance.\\" I was very into the Tudors and the whole Henry VIII wives genre. I saw great reviews on this show and paid $16.99 for a Season. I wasn't impressed. It wasn't nearly as interesting as \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" which is the same timeline as this season. To be fair, I've never seen Season 1 so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it.     If you are interested, start with Season 1 to give it a fair chance. And definitely wait until the price is low enough.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|This book took me awhile to read and some parts I didnt quite understand. But it is one of my favorites. I love all the characters, espcially Joe. I love the time it's in and the story its self. All I have to say is WOW!

B00328G4XE|1.0|When I purchased this album, I really thougth I was buying a 2010 remastered version of the album. I have purchased the first CD version of the album and re-purchased the 1997 remastered version when it was made available. I own a audiophile quality audio gear and can affirm without no doubt that there is no audio difference between this 2010 and 1997 version. In fact, the remastering credits are exactly the same as the 1997 CD. It is a shame that the Hendrix family is trying to cash in on Jimi's legacy by replacing the album jewel casing by a replica of the cardbord album and adding a few photos to cash additionnal dollars with Jimi's fans.

1400032717|3.0|For a kid as smart as Christopher, I don't really understand why he'd give the train conductor 50 pounds to buy a train ticket (all of his money that he took from the ATM, -- the machine dispersed 5 notes of 10 pounds --). He could just give him 2 notes of 10 pounds and still got the change (the price to go \\"one-way\\" to London is 17 pounds according to this book).<br /><br />Is this an error in the writing of the novel, or the author really wrote it in purpose?
B0037A4ILC|5.0|The drama of this movie, to me, was the human aspect of it. Ruthless german reporter melows at the end and guess what? he becomes human after all. And the though decision to descend after conquering more than half of this diabolic mountain was a real eye watering moment.  Yes, difficult to watch at times, the dialog is very good considering that is a translation from german language. Educational, family movie. A+
006621131X|5.0|ditto for all positive reviews so far - just want to add that I only had a fleeting knowledge of Patti and Robert beforehand....so finding out what they were really about was quite an about face for me.    dedication, poverty....and I found them both very sweet!   that was a surprise.    just loved the book - felt a profound honesty and can't wait to listen to more of Patti's music....now I'm going to look for a negative review because I cannot imagine what they'll come up with!

B001HN6940|4.0|This movie was well done. It is not what the majority of people expected, but I believe that's because it seems every bad review I see is mainly centered on disappointment that this wasn't a re-run of the original. This is a Tim Burton film. It's just going to be \\"different\\". I believe that regardless of what \\"Burton\\" has his hands in, he is simply not going to do the \\"Copy & Paste\\" routine, and is definitely going to create something that is pretty much unthought of by anyone. Sometimes the outcome is good, and sometimes not so much. He did do a pretty good job on this. It's just, I always look back at \\"Edward Scissor Hands\\" and just imagined his material would just begin to get even more fascinating, but again, this is not always the case.     A lot of things that I thought would annoy me to death...they just didn't. The \\"Queen\\" was my main concern. Love the Actress (always have), but I thought they were just going to run that character in the ground and make it extremely stressful to view. They honestly did an excellent job with the editing etc... I just don't know how much better this film could have been pieced together by an editor.    I LOVE watching Johnny Depp act absolutely nuts, and so I thought his character was hilarious, because his character is deifintely nuts, but funny, all in the same. Depp has such an interesting sense of humor, and a seemingly very humble man behind the scenes.  I cannot remember if they explained the true meaning to what a \\"Mad Hatter\\" is or not. It is a name created because back in London (I believe) everyone used to wear these top hats. The way the people creating the hats were able to give a hat it's firmness was to take and feather \\"Mercury\\" on the hat (interior). Even a lot of people who simply wore the hats were going crazy because they would of course sweat, and they were constantly absorbing mercury into the scalp. This lead to the entire business creating these hats to go insane. A Doctor (whom I believe is still living) was determined that he find out what happened to these people. Well, he spilt Mercury on himself. He wound up in the sane asylum as well. He kept trying to explain to them that he wasn't crazy, and that something caused this. I think it took him somewhere around 10 years to prove that \\"Mercury\\" was the cause to all of this, and so he has spent the rest of his life teaching people about \\"Metal Fillings\\" (urging people to have them professionally removed) in their teeth, and they have to use Mercury in order for metal fillings to harden properly. Well, you can get a sensor put on that filling & it will read a scale of how much Vapor of Mercury is constantly being released and absorbed into the roof of the mouth, and into the blood stream. They stopped giving babies a certain vaccine some years back, which was 50% mercury by weight. They said as soon as they stopped giving that vaccine, \\"Autism\\" immediately dropped off by right around 50%. Anyway, I have Mercury poisoning, and I really was hoping they would have elaborated on the true meaning of what \\"Mad As A Hatter\\" truly means. It could have been a quick explanation, but it could have also destroyed this entire \\"Imaginary World\\", and so maybe it was best that I kept my thoughts out of thinking I could be someone to have the right to say that Tim Burton wrote this incorrectly. For what this films is, and was, and what it is supposed to mean....everything is Extremely opened, and so you just really have to do the \\"Im just going to run & jump in the pool, because I know it's cold, and I'll just freeze more if I crawl into it\\". Try not to have expectations that could destroy your ability to enjoy this film. Just jump in, and try to \\"Appreciate\\" some \\"relief\\" by not seeing something that just seems like the same old things we see day after day. I was happy to se something \\"Wacky\\". It eased my nerves quite a bit, and let me rest my mind away from the worlds other Legions of anxieties we have to deal with.    Last, but not least. This film was a bit \\"all over the place\\", but my brain tends to be all over the place. So, I guess this film just fits my awkward train of thought. I think anyone could at least enjoy giving this film a watch, but I definitely suggest to not expect a re-run of the original, because this is far from it. View it with an opened mind, and enjoy watching Depp, and 'Helena Bonham Carter' do what they do best. Act a little crazy, and make us laugh. I say, give it a try, but whom should trust my point of view completely is beyond me... :)

031606792X|2.0|It's fairly amusing to scroll through the many, many rows of furious, flaming one-star reviews that talk about how terrible \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is. And though I completely and utterly agree with that, I have to say, I don't feel like this was the very worst book I've ever read. Before all you obsessed Twi-fans attack my review, bear with me.    The \\"Twilight\\" books shock me with their overwhelming popularity. Alike to their brother \\"Harry Potter\\" series, I believe it was the fresh, cool idea about the book that sold it, not the actual writing. Because Stephenie- like good old J.K- is not an amazing writer. The stories are fairly flat and predictable. Painfully cheesy and a little bizarre, the series grew from \\"Twilight\\", the best of the series, to the yawning \\"New Moon\\", upon the scraggly \\"Eclipse\\", and finally here, \\"Breaking Dawn\\".    It saddens me more than angers me that Stephenie ruined the series. To me, the \\"Twilight\\" saga is made up of the three books only: I consider \\"Breaking Dawn\\" to be separate from the actual books, a sad insult to the magic \\"Twilight\\" wove. I feel like Stephenie had this \\"dream\\", got incredibly lucky, and got in over her head. When her obsessed fans begged for a final chapter in the series, we should have all known it would be the Death of good old \\"Twilight\\". After creating such a huge, wildly popular and magical series, it's near impossible to top it off with a truly great climax. We all knew Bella would become a vampire and marry Edward, but what else could Stephenie possibly stuff into a 700-page finale to the epic \\"Twilight\\" saga?    Answer: a LOT.    For the first hundred or so pages, \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is a pretty good book. It's the old Bella we all know, the foolishly in love Edward, wolfy Jacob, and all the other familiar cast. The wedding was a charming scene, yet poorly handled. The whole thing was only happening because Bella wanted Edward to make love to her. Uhm, does anyone else think that's screwed up? (No pun intended).    But marriage is one thing. Pregnancy and birth to a semi-vampire kid is a total different thing. After the marriage, I think Stephenie went into her happy place, and was like, \\"Okay, I need something big to pull off. Something to make this book amazing. Something to-\\" And then she got it. A baby. Oh, of course. Let's give the married teenagers a baby that nearly kills Bella. Why not?    It overwhelmed me with its ridiculousness. What the hell was Stephenie thinking? It transformed this beautiful series into a strange, poorly written, annoying fanfiction-like story. It truly reads like a girl in love with Edward and obsessed with Twilight wrote this on a fanfiction sight. It's just that ridiculous.     The other thing was... the change. Bella becomes Vampire Bella. And I believe it was this that utterly totaled the story.    Bella becomes a perfect human being. For the first time in her life, she thinks herself as pretty. But it grows from that. She becomes disgustingly vain, and literally everyone- and I mean EVERYONE- around her falls in love with her. They all describe the new, beautiful, sexy Bella as just that. And Bella loves it. She is transformed into a shallow, pathetic character none of us recognize in the least. It's a true pity, because Bella was the flat, dull character we could all insert ourselves into; now, she's a vampire who's literally perfect, breaking all of Stephenie's earlier rules about vampire-ism. With that gone, there's nothing to the story. And I have to say, Stephenie certainly got a kick out of describing Bella as goddess-like nearly a thousand times after the change. Yeah, she's gone from plain, innocent Bella to a beautiful seductress Bella who's obsessed with having sex with Edward all the time. We got it the first hundred times, Steph.    But it doesn't end there. I think Stephenie blew Bella up over and over, ignorantly and childishly. One moment Bella is shy and awkward (don't get me started on the over-use of adjectives in this book: if Bella says another too-long, confusing word, I swear I'll march into the book and jab sticks into her throat), another she's over-reacting and furious. Perhaps Stephenie thought it was amusing, but no. It just further pushed Bella away from us.    One of my final criticisms of this sad story is how painfully long and cumbersome it is. 700 pages? Really? Stephenie should be charged with capitol murder for all those poor trees she killed to print all these impossibly-long books. She got carried away, which makes me annoyed. Splitting the books into three parts was hardly necessary (why did she randomly insert Jacob's point of view? It was pointless. Why not Edward instead, if she had to insert somebody?) and I spent many chapters just flipping through, desperate to find something interesting. Which I did not, might I add. Lastly, when she throws in literally twenty-or-so new vampires towards the end, it wrecked the story further. I didn't bother to keep track. She'd list a new name, and I'd just be like, \\"Screw it\\", and skip over that part.    The final \\"climax\\"... or rather, the depressing lack of one... hurt the book, too. The Venturi pose a fake threat, and walk in, threaten to kill Renesmee (Bella's and Edward's child, which I hope you know by now), then Alice appears and shows them some old vampire, somehow proving half-vampire children are fine. And they walk away. I was like, SERIOUSLY? I wanted action. I wanted something! But no. Another stupid let-down.    Alright, so I know my review is just another that will mingle with the thousands of annoyed readers on this site, but heck. At least I got my voice out there. And I am really unhappy that this book was such a waste. Stephenie could have done so much with it, yet she did nothing, and lazily created a bomb that murdered the series of any charm it earlier had. I truly think she should have stuck with just three books. By the time I was done reading, I desperately wanted to write it myself, to make it right and do some justice to the series. I believe if Stephenie had simply written a much shorter novel describing the wedding and then left it at that, finishing it before Bella changes (and no baby in the equation), this book would have been much better. But no. It's ruined.    It's a waste.     So I'm sorry for the long review... I couldn't help it. There's just so many things to hate about this book. Period. So basically, go ahead and read it, to get your own opinion, because some people loved it. I truly don't know how, but they did. So give it a go, but I promise you, it's a shallow, pathetic disappointment that should gave been burned the instant Stephenie handed it to her editor.

B000TJBNFI|5.0|Paul Sheldon (James Caan) crashes his car during a hard-hitting blizzard, and ends up being cared for by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), a former nurse who lives alone in her cabin. She claims that she is Paul's #1 fan, and she just about proves it to the extreme. She berates him about his latest novel called \\"Misery's Child,\\" in which the main character (her favorite character) dies. She orders him to rewrite his upcoming novel and have the main character return from the dead. And you know that she'll do anything to make it happen.<br /><br />Kathy Bates is so convincing as the painfully crazy nurse that you instantly forget that she's playing a character. She IS Annie Wilkes. And BOY did she deserve the Oscar for Best Actress! James Caan is also brilliant as the helpless writer who finds himself in Annie's dangerous little world. Director Rob Reiner has done a wonderful job with this movie, and even though I have never read the original novel by Stephen King, I'm sure it's a great adaptation. This is one heck of a psychological thriller, and I easily recommend it to anyone who loves Stephen King and thrillers in general.<br /><br />Grade: A-
B00260HH3K|2.0|Talk about absurdity, but of what I'm not sure: was it due to the most powerful being on Earth going to high school and getting ridiculous by hand-me-down bullies, or was it that I watched that scene straight-faced?  In actuality, the thing that crossed my mind was, \\"how could a high school in the suburbs be close to a secluded hut on top of a hill where Goku lived\\"?  I don't understand the inclusion of having a high-school setting in the first place; as a Dragonball enthusiast, that seems more suited for a character like Gohan.  Gohan went to high-school and he goes through the same awkward stages like Justin Chatwin's character.  In fact, Chatwin acted more like Gohan than Goku: Goku has always been a naive but kind-hearted character with a large appetite, not nebbish and cowardice towards girls like Chatwin portrayed. His love-interest, Chi-Chi, is more of a flirt than a hot-tempered lady of the original and thus is a lot less interested.  The actors don't seem too thrilled with their performances, with the exception of Chow Yun-Fat who manages to mantain his Muten Roshi character with most of the original perversion and radical temperament intact.<br /><br />If anyone doesn't know what the Dragon Ball series is about, the you'll be completely flabbergasted by how contrived and ridiculous the whole movie sets up, but even if one's an avid Dragon Ball fan, the plot for \\"Dragonball Evolution\\" still wouldn't make sense.  It narrates about an evil nemesis named Piccolo who's a destroyer of planets alongside a giant ape, until he was locked in a cage but he was uncaged and is off to follow his clich&eacute;.  The film never bothered to explain how he got out, it's just an excuse to drive the \\"stop the big big\\" plot for Goku to go on the merry journey, as well as finding the dragonball with help of his allies. Who is that woman Piccolo's hanging with and how did they meet?  There's an explanation among elders about Goku's eighteenth birthday and how it relates to the plot, but how would the elders know about it?  How come the missing dragon balls are so close to each other in the search?  Other plot-related questions that I can't spoil, but the point is almost every situation seemed to be set-up simply out of convenience without any kind of logical explanation behind them.<br /><br />If I have anything good to say, the fight scenes aren't bad, although the climatic showdown between Goku and Piccolo ended on a total letdown.  But when it comes to a paper-full-of-holes plot, boring characters, and cartoony effects, saying \\"fights aren't bad\\" isn't good enough.  It's just another lousy effort on a live-action anime adaptation.ould the elders know about it?  How come the missing dragon balls are so close to each other in the search?

030745455X|4.0|Note: I'm trying to write this as a review of the entire Millennium trilogy, broken into three parts. For those who are wondering how the trilogy should be read, my opinion is to read them in order and back-to-back. Although Larsson does a fine job of re-introducing recurring characters, it helps to know their back story; and back-to-back because Larsson's cast of character is HUGE. I've written up a list of characters for the trilogy, which you are free to use and distribute as you wish [...]. I also made a more condensed version [...] that removes all the minor or non-recurring characters. If you do read this trilogy and you're unfamiliar with Sweden (as I am), you might want a map of Sweden on hand or have Google Maps handy. It's not necessary, but it did help me picture things better in my head. This is especially true of the latter two books, which  explores Sweden a lot more. Google Maps is especially great for this because you can use Street View for many of the locations.<br /><br />THE MILLENNIUM TRILOGY (Part 2 of 3)<br />The Girl Who Played With Fire<br /><br />PLAYED WITH FIRE begins about two years after the events of DRAGON TATTOO. The first part of the book covers what Salander has been up to during this period, and focuses on the time she spends vacationing in Granada. At this point, she has become fairly well-off, and is able to buy, travel, and do everything she wants. She has very little attachment to the people in DRAGON TATTOO, including Blomkvist.<br /><br />Most of this book is about Salander. Blomkvist, who was the protagonist in the first book, takes a back seat role. However, Salander, being a curious person, inevitably gets caught up in the intrigues around her. This book goes deeper into her back story, including the \\"All The Evil\\" event that was hinted at in DRAGON TATTOO. Towards the middle of the book, Salander disappears from the narrative, and Blomkvist returns to the  focus of the story. A series of murders has occurred, and Blomkvist has to uncover the events that linked seemingly disparate people and events together.<br /><br />My thoughts on this book:<br /><br />1. Salander is an interesting character, no doubt. It was hard for me (and, I imagine, others) to compared her to a kind of female Hannibal Lecter. She is unimaginably smart, and incorruptible, to the point of being nearly superhuman. She has her own system of morals that makes sense to her, and she can be lethal if she wants to be.<br /><br />2. There were scenes in the book that reminded me of the ethics of torture, which seems to work in context. It's particularly interesting in light of the fact that Larsson is so vocal on social matters, especially those pertaining to violence. He speaks out against real-life crimes that has happened in Sweden, and yet he puts the reader in the position of wondering about his position about \\"extreme interrogation tactics\\" when it pertains to people who don't have our sympathies.<br /><br />3. PLAYED WITH FIRE (and HORNET'S NEST) feels distinctly different from DRAGON TATTOO. Those who were expecting a similar structure might be surprised. Although there is a murder to solve, the reader more or less finds out the answer well before the end of the novel. As such, it's not so much a murder mystery, as it is about how people from different parts of society piece together evidence.<br /><br />4. The Granada episode was out of place. I suppose Larsson included it to inform readers about what has been happening to Salander, and to give some insight into her character. Perhaps this episode would have had significance in the future novels that, unfortunately, won't be written. It wasn't that it was badly written--Larsson is an excellent writer--but that it was jarring to be taken from one context to another so abruptly. Maybe it was there for foreshadowing or symbolism or something to signal a coming storm.<br /><br />5. I'm unfamiliar with Swedish politics and history, and I wonder whether there are aspects of the book that someone who is familiar would see. For example, whether the characters are real-life people (good or bad) that Larsson is trying to portray.<br /><br />6. I do get lost with the number of characters in this series. Again, I suspect this is because Larsson, from what I understand, had been planning a longer series.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I'm enjoying this series, and I highly recommend it. It's exceedingly well-written. As I mentioned in the review of DRAGON TATTOO, book two and three of the Millennium series feels like a single volume separated into two books.

I've written up a list of characters for the trilogy, which you are free to use and distribute as you wish [...]. I also made a more condensed version [...] that removes all the minor or non-recurring characters. If you do read this trilogy and you're unfamiliar with Sweden (as I am), you might want a map of Sweden on hand or have Google Maps handy. It's not necessary, but it did help me picture things better in my head. This is especially true of the latter two books, which  explores Sweden a lot more. Google Maps is especially great for this because you can use Street View for many of the locations.<br /><br />THE MILLENNIUM TRILOGY (Part 3 of 3)<br />The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest<br /><br />As mentioned in my earlier reviews for the Millennium trilogy, I think readers ought to have read the other two books of this series (at least PLAYED WITH FIRE) before reading this one. Readers who pick up this one first might have a tough time picking up the story; plus, this book gives away much of what's happened in the other two books, and those reading out of order risk ruining their reading experience.<br /><br />I'm not sure how to categorize this book. I suppose I would call it a thriller or mystery of sorts, but usually those genres are written as: 1) Mystery emerges; 2) Protagonists connect the dots; 3) Mystery solved. In HORNET'S NEST, the reader is given the answer to the mystery fairly early on, and is reading to find out how the characters figure it out for themselves and how they respond to it.<br /><br />Compared to the other two books, HORNET'S NEST comes across as slightly weaker, mostly because it tries to tie up loose ends that had been unraveled in the other two books. There is slightly less action and more problem-solving. Unlike PLAYED WITH FIRE, the focus of this book is more on the other characters, including not only Blomkvist, but Berger, as well as new characters. Salander is mostly bedridden or confined to a prison and isn't able to do much, so readers who are looking to see her in action might be slightly disappointed. She isn't completely useful, of course, but her role has been somewhat reduced.<br /><br />In reading this book, I had to wonder whether Larsson had dreamed of becoming the international sensation that this had become, and whether he would have written it differently. I am also saddened by the fact that we would likely never hear more about these characters again. Even though I read that Larsson had written notes for a planned ten-book series (if Wikipedia is to be believed), I doubt that someone else would pick it up; and even if someone else did, I doubt it would have the thought and care that Larsson has put into this series.tie up loose ends that had been unraveled in the other two books.

B000MGUZ5W|5.0|BABEL tells four interconnected stories in four languages. The link for all is a Winchester rifle that once belonged to a Japanese businessman. Perhaps the most compelling of these situations involves that man's teen daughter, a chronically depressed deaf mute who's obsessed with a police detective.<br /><br />Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu gives us enough information along the way to hold our interest, revealing facts when necessary or timely. For instance, we don't learn of the rifle's origin and its chain of owners until well after an unintended injury occurs.<br /><br />There's troubling events in all of this film's locations: Morocco, Japan, Mexico, and to a lesser extent, California. A mostly unknown cast give naturalistic performances, some of which will haunt you long after the credits start to roll.<br /><br />Highest recommendation for a brilliant motion picture.
0307454541|5.0|Note: I'm trying to write this as a review of the entire Millennium trilogy, broken into three parts. For those who are wondering how the trilogy should be read, my opinion is to read them in order and back-to-back. Although Larsson does a fine job of re-introducing recurring characters, it helps to know their back story; and back-to-back because Larsson's cast of character is HUGE. I've written up a list of characters for the trilogy, which you are free to use and distribute as you wish ([...]).

It's not necessary, but it did help me picture things better in my head. This is especially true of the latter two books, which  explores Sweden a lot more. Google Maps is especially great for this because you can use Street View for many of the locations.<br /><br />THE MILLENNIUM TRILOGY (Part 1 of 3)<br />The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo<br /><br />I heard of this book years ago from my mom. She had read it in Chinese, and I believe it had came out in Chinese before English. Since my mom has recommended me some dubious books in the past, I was wary of reading it. Then I saw \\"Stieg Larsson\\" and \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" popping up all over the place, and decided to go for it. I'm somewhat glad that I didn't pick this book up till now because that's allowed me to read the trilogy back-to-back. While that isn't necessary, it certainly makes it easier to keep track of things.<br /><br />DRAGON TATTOO reads like a \\"whodunit\\" mystery, and reminded me of the movie \\"Gosford Park.\\" The protagonist is Mikael Blomvist, the gutsy financial reporter from Millennium magazine, who, in the beginning of the novel, has just lost a libel case against Wennerstr&ouml;m, a businessman he had been investigating. As he ponders his fate for the near future, he gets a visit from a lawyer representing Henrik Vanger, a former mogul, who wants him to write a biography of his family. This writing job, however, is really just a pretext to allow Blomvist to do some investigation into a dark history of the family.<br /><br />Then there's Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, who is a freelance researcher for a security firm. She is portrayed as a mysterious, introvert, and strong-willed woman who has her unconventional means of getting information. Salander's and Blomvist's worlds will soon converge and become the key focus of the book.<br /><br />Here are a few things of note about Larsson's writing:<br /><br />He keeps the action going without putting in tedious descriptions of unnecessary details. He does enough to give life to the scene, but focuses on the important elements.<br /><br />He writes with a point of view, which is to say that, this isn't just your regular mystery novel. Larsson, himself a journalist, seems to know the inner workings of many Swedish institutions. Each of his book seems to broaden the focus of these institutions. For example, DRAGON TATTOO focuses mostly on independent journalism and the corporate world; PLAYED WITH FIRE focuses on the media, academia, and law enforcement; and \\"Hornet's Nest\\" focuses on secret government agencies (at least as far as I know; I'm still reading it). Larsson also has strong opinions about things going on in Sweden, in it comes through in his writing (most obviously in Blomvist's voice). It's a refreshing take on a traditional genre that I find really powerful.<br /><br />The cast of characters and the institutions can get overwhelming, especially if you really want to understand the connections between everything. Larsson also has the tendency of referring to his characters by their last name, the first name, and their nick names, so it helps to have it all fresh in your head. I would suggest being patient, because the payoff is well worth it. I was a bit stumped inthe beginning of this novel, mostly because I had thought it was \\"light reading,\\" the type of book that you can read in small bits before you go to bed, or when you're on the subway. It turned out that, for me, it was easier to read it in large chunks, because it helps keep the information intact.<br /><br />Despite of the cast, the characters were all well-written, including the minor ones. Lesser authors would have reduced them to caricatures, but Larsson doesn't pull that here.<br /><br />The twists in this book were AWESOME. Several times I would say out-loud \\"Oooooh\\" and have to get up and take a breather (and I only do that when I'm excited by a book).<br /><br />Evidently, coffee is big in Sweden. :)<br /><br />So far, this is my favorite of the trilogy. It seems more like a standalone novel, and might even be seen as a prologue to the latter two books.reading,\\" the type of book that you can read in small bits before you go to bed, or when you're on the subway.

B002ZG98VE|4.0|I went to see this movie with my dad, a huge Robin Hood fan (who's read way more on the subject than I will ever get around to doing).<br />The story opens with Robin Hood being a part of the army of King Richard the Lion Heart as they return to England from their exploits in the Crusade.  The King dies while sieging a castle.  Robin and his band (including Will and Little John) leave to return home.  They meet up with Robert Locksley, who was killed as he was trying to return the crown home to England to unworthy Prince John.  Robin takes a vow to return dying Robert's sword to his father in Nottingham...and thus begins a masquerade.<br />This is much different than [[ASIN:B002VWNID6 Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]].  It is more of a beginning story than in the midst of thieving Robin's exploits (and yes, it does set up for a possible sequel in which Robin can undermine the Sherriff of Nottingham).<br />The acting is absolutely brilliant.  Russell Crowe was a magnificent choice for Robin (even if he is Australian and not English), totally blowing my expectations.  His Robin was interesting and well-crafted: he is a soldier, he keeps his promises, he saves a woman's inheritances.  All in all, well done.  I loved Little John and the troup (they brought some laughs), but my most favorite was Cate Blanchett as Maid Marion.  WOW!  Cate made Marion fiesty, stubborn, but emotional and compassionate at the same time.  Watching Cate as Marion was a pleasure.  And I even enjoyed how Robin and Marion fell in love (the one with Costner made me cringe).<br />The action is well done.  It is a bit gruesome, so if you are squeamish, you've been warned.  I know one complaint my dad had and I share as well is that there wasn't much of Robin's infamous archery skills.  It is alluded to in the end, but it is what he is best known for and should probably have been seen more prominently.  Instead, we have a siege against a castle and a large fight between the English and the French on a beach.  Talk about water-logged.<br />The story is pretty interesting.  I thought it would be about Robin Hood at his height (when he was robbing and thieving), but instead, it is a \\"prequel\\" or \\"beginning\\" of sorts.  This was kinda disappointing, as it isn't what you expect going in, but I did like how it was different than most incarnations and the story of redemption, embracing the past, and heroism was unique.  The ending does set it up nicely for a sequel that will actually be Robin Hood (if they can get money for it).  At first, I thought it would be dorky for Robin to pretend to be Walter's long lost son, Robert, but it was pulled off really well.  I am sure there are anachronisms all over the place as well as medieval stereotypes (boiling oil and flaming arrows, anyone?), but I enjoyed this enough not to notice.<br />Would I recommend seeing it?  I had a really enjoyable time.  Maybe if you know too much about Robin Hood, it might not be the same, but I would at least give it a chance by watching or renting when it comes on DVD.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B002WY65W4|5.0|Zombieland is a movie that is constantly juggled around my top 5 favorite film list.  It did amazing things for its genre and justified zombie movies for the future.  It even had a top secret cameo in spirit of being one of those great movies that actually suprise you and do not litter the spoilers in the trailer.  Cloverfield was one such film that I support for its secrecy, and Zombieland follows in those brilliant footsteps.  Hopefully more filmmakers will realize how rewarding it is for moviegoers to be genuinely suprised these days.<br /><br />It's hard to cram all the good praise about this film into a couple short paragraphs.  It's an amazing film, beside all of its hilarious jokes.  The rules of Zombieland take a worthy stab at bad horror filmmakers and demand reality within these cliches.  Things like \\"buckling your seatbelts\\" and \\"check the backseat\\" are not stupid jokes.  These are brilliant criticisms of bad zombie stories.  We laugh because it's so true how lacking this genre is of some sort of reality.  Zombieland created the reality with the rules.<br /><br />The comedy exceeds beyond one's expectations of a comedy.  It is all due to excellent writing and acting.  There's barely any slapstick and an absence of cheap gross humor or fart jokes.  Zombieland, although it may not seem so, is all about wit and performance humor.  Woody Harrelson gives a shockingly great performance in this film, as does Jesse Eisenberg.  The writers of this film are intelligent individuals with their hearts attached to their work.  I know this because they built so much great comedy in the script, while also maintaining a general emotion level during the film.  One part of the flick nearly made me cry, before they softened me right back up again with an appropriate joke for the moment.  In the commentary they stated how proud they were that they could generate an emotional scene and then non-abrubtly ease the scene into a hilarious moment.  I am proud as well, and have the utmost respect for the writer and director.<br /><br />I have to stop going on, because I could rave about it all day.  The editing, the stylized action...I love everything about Zombieland.  I believe some people disagree with all the hype, because the film seems to be made for my generation.  I don't believe that middle-aged to older folks will enjoy this film.  It is a film that appeals to geeks and nerds, and it is our general consensus that the film straight rocks.  On my last note, it makes a great blu-ray.  The picture is awesome and the extras are all watchable.  Picking up this blu-ray will give you something in your collection that has more replay value than most films out there today.utmost respect for the writer and director.<br /><br />I have to stop going on, because I could rave about it all day.

030726999X|5.0|Unlike some other reviewers, I thought Mr. Larsson brought this thriller to a fine finish. We see further character development of our dear heroine (Lisbeth Salander), who finally sees some justice done, due in large part to efforts two additional heroines. Larsson features strong women in this book. Journalist Blomqvist is still doing his part, but the big stars in freeing Salander turn out to be an amazon policewoman (Blomqvist's new girl friend), and a shrewd woman attorney, who happens to be Blomqvist's sister. and who, with the help of massive evidence that Salander's hacker friends supplied, completely destroys the case against muder suspect Salander. As the book neared the close, I was willing to say good enough, having forgotten that one more of Salander's enemies, her psychotic and dangerous brother, was still at large. In the last few pages he appears and again almost gets her killed. How she survives and turns the table provides a good strong conclusion. But a little more is still to come. She still had to make up with Blomqvist, and this was done. - One of the lose ends of book two is that just before Salander was shot in the head, she believed she had proved Fermat's Final Theorem in her head. This book brought out that she had lost a small amount of brain material in the math processing area due to the head wound. Consquently, though she thought she had solved it, she could not remember, and had no desire to. In fact, she had lost some math, but gained some heart. Read all three in order, it is worth it.

B002DKGWSE|5.0|I admit I orignally had no interst in seeing this '09 remake of 1972's \\"Last House on the Left\\", which involved the rape/murder of two girls and the ensuing revenge by the parents of one of the girls (loosely based on Ingmar Bergman's \\"The Virgin Spring\\" from 1960). Why not? Because the original \\"Last House\\" was just so dumb. I know many hail it for being \\"disturbing\\" due to the vile, sadistic villains and the humiliation, rape and gorey murders -- but I didn't find it disturbing at all. Why? Because the preposterous storyline accompanied by the goofy music and bumbling cops made it impossible to take serious. Consequently, just like I don't consider the violence in, say, a Road Runner cartoon disturbing -- because it's impossible to take seriously -- so I didn't find \\"Last House\\" disturbing. Dumb? Yes. An interesting early 70's curiosity? Yes. Disturbing? No.<br /><br />Apparently director Dennis Iliadis and writers Adam Alleca & Carl Ellsworth understood the blatant flaws of the original because this remake overcomes them all and is a near masterpiece of filmmaking.<br /><br />Without knowing what it was, I stumbled upon this remake last weekend while channel-surfing in a motel in the heart of Nebraska; the opening caught my attention and I became engrossed. About an hour into the story it dawned on me that this was the remake of \\"Last House on the Left.\\" Although I couldn't finish the film, the first thing I did when I got home was order the dvd.<br /><br />What makes this remake so good?<br /><br />For one thing, the filmmaking itself is top-of-the-line -- the cinematography, music, cast, acting, mood, suspense, etc. all work together to make a superior piece of cinematic art -- yes, even though it's \\"just a horror flick.\\"<br /><br />I was particularly impressed with the way the film juxtaposes the beauty of nature & people/family with the hideousness of human evil. Take, for example, the opening scenes of the beautiful woods & music followed by the thug's murderous escape and the later sequence where a fleeing girl is shot while swimming through a lake. The film was incidentally shot in Helderberg Nature Preserve, Western Cape, South Africa, of all places. Gorgeous locations, to say the least, and a fine stand-in for somewhere-in-the-sticks, USA.<br /><br />The character of Justin was another great element. Through no fault of his own he's the teenage son of the main scumbag. It's clear that Justin hates the perverseness and hypocrisy of his \\"family life\\" and craves normalcy and genuine love. He's in torment but is too afraid of his father to overtly act (and understandably so), but he does what he can, when he can. The message of Justin is that people are not cursed to follow the wicked/foolish ways of their bloodline. Simple wisdom and force of righteous will breaks the curse. Redemption is there, if you want it.<br /><br />I also liked the way the film depicts the duplicity of the thug gang, particularly the leader Krug (Garret Dillahunt). He's the ultimate POS but watch him cover-up his intrinsic wickedness with his knack for social acclimation -- a fake smile, innocent smalltalk and a well-placed \\"Amen.\\" The film successfully shows how some people aren't what they appear to be; they're the express opposite! Not to mention the flick is a good reminder to always be on your guard. Don't be naive; not everyone's like you or me. Some people will happily abuse, rape and kill without a second thought. They're scum, pure and simple (by their OWN foolish choices). If you have daughters make sure they view this, even though some parts are hard to watch.<br /><br />Also, the numerous preposterous elements of the original story have been fixed (see my review of the '72 version for details). The family is vacationing in a wilderness area and there's only one town nearby. The daughter successfully steers the criminals close to her home, unbeknownst to them. The thugs aren't dressed-to-the-nines when they show up at the parent's doorstep, not to mention they have a legitimate reason (\\"There's been an accident\\").<br /><br />The goofy elements of the original -- the silly music and bumbling cops -- have been eliminated altogether. The film has a serious, realistic vibe and therefore the horrific events are taken seriously.<br /><br />There are a couple of cliched horror aspects I could do without, specifically the scenes involving a garbage disposal and a microwave. They're a bit silly and needlessly stretch the believability. But then it struck me that they're types of universal/divine judgment and justice; so that's cool.<br /><br />Another aspect that improved upon the original involves one of the victimized girls, but I don't want to give it away.<br /><br />The theatrical version runs 110 minutes and the unrated version four minutes longer; both versions are featured on the dvd (I haven't seen the unrated version since the theatrical was more than enough for me, if you know what I mean).<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: This '09 remake of \\"Last House on the Left\\" is vastly superior in every conceivable way and proves that remakes can and should be made when/if appropriate. In ways it's even a masterpiece, a brilliant showcase of beauty and the beast. Don't miss out just because you thought the original was a POS.ere's been an accident\\").

Mr. Grisham is a wonderful story teller, his writing transport me to the place where the story is happening. Great entertaining book to read in a class room full of 4,5,and 6th graders. This will help young students to learn about things that only adults talk about, Court cases, helping to do research and use it to help others. Teach young people that sports is not everything, books are a magnificent way to expand your horizons which will bring you knowledge, take you places that you will like to go some day.    Thanks John Grisham for telling us those stories that we the public can only hear from you thru your books.

The 360 stage was an amazing spectacle which U2 put on some of their best gigs since the Elevation tour yet the creators of this concert dvd didn't feel that was enough. Instead of leaving some stationary cameras and inserting some dramatic angles etc they delude the entire concert with over the top camera cuts, fades and special effects.<br /><br />The ZooTv concert VHS/DVD was similar in which the film maker added some on screen effects etc but even that was mild compared to the 360 dvd.

0446563048|4.0|Yes, nice guys can finish first. This is the overarching theme of Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh's new book Delivering Happiness, a Path to Passion, Profits, and Purpose.  Delivering Happiness chronicles the rise of Zappos from a half-baked notion to multi-billion dollar pinnacle of high touch customer service.    The book is presented in three sections. In the first section, Hsieh recounts his personal story, including his early childhood and nascent entrepreneurial adventures, including a misguided effort at worm farming. The details of his somewhat haphazard education at Harvard, and his kismet kissed co-founding of LinkExchange (ultimately sold to Microsoft for $265 million) are downright fascinating.    As befits the CEO of a company built on a wide-open corporate culture, Hsieh is remarkably candid about his successes, failures, and fortunes throughout, and this first section is the strongest in the book. He writes in a breezy, accessible, invigorating style that makes Delivering Happiness the rare business book that is also a genuine page turner.    As a long-time Zappos customer, and admirer of Hsieh and his customer-first mantra, I thought I had a handle on this tale. But, I was shocked by the number of times that Zappos narrowly averted ruin in its early days. Hsieh and his co-founders' went to truly extraordinary lengths to keep the company alive, including housing employees in their homes. Each harrowing near death of Zappos makes you cheer that much louder inside when the company eventually succeeds on a grand scale.  The middle section of the book is devoted to Zappos' legendary corporate culture, especially its 10 core values. Hsieh is refreshingly candid in his admission that the core values were not created soon enough, and were partially developed as protection against the cultural malignancies that plagued LinkExchange. While Hsieh cautions that Zappos' core values are not a playbook that can be copied by other companies (because they both shape and reflect the unique culture), you can't help but wonder why more companies don't try to adopt his concepts of building long-term value through the short-term smashing of middling customer expectations.    While interesting as a concept, the inclusion of employee stories to accompany each of the 10 core values unfortunately slows the momentum built in the book's first third. The personification of the principles helps clarify how they are utilized day-to-day, but the shifting tonality that stems from multiple contributing authors inexorably weakens the focus and urgency of Delivering Happiness.    The third section of the book covers Zappos' sale to Amazon.com (for $1.2 billion), and the founding of the Zappos Insights program (where companies can receive training on Zappos' customer and culture-centric methods). This component is most noteworthy for Hsieh's admission that the Zappos board of directors was unhappy with his metamorphosis toward long-term success at the expense of short-term profits. The word-for-word reprinting of Hsieh's emails to employees regarding the Amazon acquisition are also priceless.    The book concludes with a few pages about the science of happiness, and how personal and business happiness can be inextricably linked. Hsieh acknowledges that the study of happiness is a personal hobby, and while his passion for the subject is apparent, a clear theme or call to action is largely absent.    And ultimately, that's the challenge with Delivering Happiness. In parts, it's one of the best business books I've ever read, but most of those are the elements that are driven by a narrative and timeline. And in truth, an entire book devoted to Hsieh and the history of Zappos would have been a terrific read.  And, a book devoted solely to Zappos' philosophies and core values would also have been a terrific read.    But instead, we have a little bit of each, and unfortunately, 1 + 1 does not equal 3 in this circumstance. It doesn't really feel to me like one book, but rather like parts of three books fused together.    There are some excellent takeaways in Delivering Happiness, especially around the thin line between success and failure, how to treat business partners and vendors, and ways in which Zappos continues to build a family-like culture among hundreds (perhaps thousands) of employees. My favorite is the \\"Face Game\\" whereby every time an employee logs on to the Web, he or she is presented with a photo of another employee, and a list of names. Whether or not the employee guesses the correct identification, the bio of the team member is shown, building familiarity in the ranks. Brilliant. Also, the discussion of Zappos' talent development and nurturing program (called Pipeline) is detailed and fascinating.    But ultimately, I finished Delivering Happiness wanting more. A lot more. A playbook. A mission. A mantra. Reading Delivering Happiness will convince you that there is a better way, that success and happiness aren't mutually exclusive, and that Tony Hsieh is a special person. Did Delivering Happiness rock me to my core? No. But the stories and nuggets of insight make it well worth the purchase price and then some.
0307454541|4.0|there is so much hype about this book, it is hard to live up to expectations.  This book starts off slow, but then is hard to put down.  A really good story and amazing character development that is severly lacking in many of todays novels.  Can't wait to read the second one.
B0001GMIOE|1.0|Ordered this Canon brand name (OEM) battery. The order was filled by Eforcity. The item I received was a knock-off brand with no manufacturer name on it. I contacted them asking for the item I ordered. Instead they just apologized for the \\"inconvenience\\" and processed a refund.  If I use this battery then I void the manufacturer warranty. There's no way I'll take a risk like that. This is false advertising aimed at fooling those that don't know better. I already left seller feedback but since this item is still advertised I decided to include my feedback here. Buyer beware.

The price was remarkable and the shipping was a lot faster than expected.  This DVD is probably a true clasic in Foreign Films.  A movie that EVERYONE should watch at least once in thier lifetime.

B0000A1HQP|5.0|I was amazed at how quickly this dvd was sent to me. I was leary about purchasing from a supplier other than directly from Amazon and their products.  But it was better than I expected and cheap!!  This was the first time I have ever used Amazon.com and now I am hooked.  This has got to be the funniest foreign film I have ever seen.  You must get it!

0446563048|4.0|I saw Tony speak at a keynote for the SXSW conference in 2009. The key components of that talk have stuck with me ever since. He basically argued that companies should act more like people. Since they're made of people, they need to act more holistically while considering more than just revenues. His company, Zappos, has the goal of delivering WOW experiences through service. Basically it's to make people happy through unbeatable customer service.<br /><br />I was glad to see that Tony decided to distill that talk (and much more) into book form a little more than a year after his SXSW talk.<br /><br />The book is mostly a narrative about Tony's path to becoming an entrepreneur, angel investor, and eventually CEO of Zappos and getting bought by Amazon.com. I say this book is mostly narrative because about halfway through it starts becoming something else. The narrative is funny and quirky, something I'd expect from a guy whose company has a core value of \\"Create Fun and a Little Weirdness.\\" He talks about buying worms for a worm farm, then starting a mail order button empire as a kid, which led to selling pizza in college and then creating LinkExchange (which I totally remember using) while working for Oracle.<br /><br />The narrative section goes up to about the point where Zappos finally ends up getting an important loan and relocates to Las Vegas. After that, the book takes a turn and starts feeling more like a business book. Tony starts including lots of email memos to show what was communicated to the employees at certain points, like when the company had to lay off some employees or when they were sold to Amazon.<br /><br />Different Zappos employees start writing entire sections like \\"Vendor Relations by Fred.\\" This makes the book feel much more fragmented and difficult to follow. The book becomes less about Tony and more about a shared experience. The problem is that it's riddled with asides, lists, email memos and more. There's really no organization towards the end of the book and it feels very much thrown together. While the lessons at the end of the book might be useful, I feel as though there could have been two separate books. One from Tony's perspective that stays as a full narrative, and another book for business people on how to make sure their company's culture doesn't poison its employees.<br /><br />Delivering Happiness is a good book. I believe in its author and in the principles contained within. While I feel it could have been organized better, I still think everyone should read it. It's an extremely quick read and very entertaining most of the way through. I hope that Tony Hsieh's message of the importance of company culture reaches more people, and that people have better work experiences as a result.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a free review copy of this book.

B001E45XT4|2.0|I purchased these headphones to cancel out background noise. And based on the reviews I read, this \\"closed ear\\" style would do just that.    The reality is that I get very good quality sound when there's some audio coming into the headphones, but it doesn't block out any other outside noise.    I use them for phone calls and listening to music, and the quality is good on both. The biggest drawback is how ridiculous I look with the Princess Leia-sized headphones.    -----    Update two months later - the microphone broke, so now I can only use it as a headset. The sound is still great, but I can't use it as a phone headset ... and I still look like an idiot with this huge thing on my head. Plantronics won't let me replace it with a model that would work better -- just another one of the same. Not worth the shipping.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Really enjoyable movie. Great actors, interesting script - it's a movie that holds your attention throughout. Excellent!
0446563048|4.0|To be honest, it's a little hard for me to write an objective review of this book.  Why?  Because in the spring of 2009, I visited the corporate offices of Zappos and was WOW'ed by Tony Hsieh and the other masters of happiness there.  When it comes to happiness, I've seen how Tony Hsieh delivers.<br /><br />In Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion and Purpose, Tony Hsieh shares his quest for conscious success with authenticity and insight.  From his unsuccessful stint as a child worm farmer to the days of \\"torture\\" at Link Exchange to the financial uncertainty of the early Zappos days, Tony doesn't pretend that profits and purpose came via a magic wand.<br /><br />Instead, Tony shows us - in detail - how he journeyed from the land of the disheartening corporation to the promised land of purpose and profits. And along the way, he helps us remember that it's OK to have fun and be a little weird.  For instance, in a section of his life where he is trying to figure out what makes him happy, Tony says:<br /><br />\\"Pickles make me happy.  I'm still unclear why.  I think it's just because they are obviously delicious and I enjoy saying \\"pickles\\".\\"<br /><br />Transparency reigns in Delivering Happiness.  One examples is when Tony shares exactly where the money to grow Zappos came from as well as the times when they weren't sure if it would come at all.  Another example is the company's internal newsletter called Ask Anything.  In it, employees are given the opportunity to ask whatever is on their minds - from \\"Where do you see us in 3 years?\\" to \\"How much does Zappos spend on shipping in any given month?\\" to \\"Do vegetarians eat animal crackers?\\"<br /><br />This book is an honest and compelling look at the journey to conscious success. I highly recommend it to anyone who cares about making a profit while living their purpose.

1416914307|5.0|Really enjoyed this series..there are some \\"touchy\\" subjects throughout these books, so be aware of that..I would suggest parents read the first book, before giving it to their young teen to read.. but other wise a clean, well written fun series. I'm really looking forward to the fourth book City of Fallen Angels and the prequel series Clockwork Angel (The Infernal Devices, #1).
0446563048|5.0|Upon initially receiving Tony Hsieh`s new book, Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose, I was excited that [...] had been given a chance to review a pre-release.  However, it did come along with the simple pre-condition that I write a review, good or bad, but that's what we do!  Even better, [...] has an extra copy to giveaway!  What a way to kickoff a new week for adellelijah!<br /><br />Tony Hsieh blasts right off by giving you a very short and dirty introduction to his success.  Reading the first paragraphs, it is simply amazing to how much he has accomplished in his relatively young life.  Starting around the dot-com era, living through the tech bubble and rising triumphantly, the [...] CEO believed and persevered.  Following him every step of the way through his journey from his first endeavor as a young teenager to his latest and greatest accomplishment gives wonderful insight to the passion within his entrepreneurial spirit.  With his honest, conversational writing style, Delivering Happiness transforms a stack of bound paper to a dialogue with Tony Hsieh.  In my opinion, he should release an audio book.  It's like reading a book, then watching a movie, then reading the book again; you associate the characters with the actors faces instead of your own.  In this case, you'll be able to actually hear the passion that Tony speaks of.<br /><br />As he progresses through various projects, one grows with him not only as a reader but as a friend.  Sacrificing his entire material life, to have it pay off in a truly rewarding way and then finding out that it is within passion that true success comes from, makes for a beautiful story.  Fairytale as it may be, happy endings do happen and it is to those that really put forth the extra 10%.  Tony expands that further by saying that improving yourself by 1% on a daily basis, at the end of a year, you can be THAT person; the person you always wanted to be.  Change doesn't happen overnight, but overtime through trials, tribulations, parties and rewards.<br /><br />Little anecdotes sprinkled throughout the book make it a keeper sure to be with highlights splayed across its pages.  Hints geared to any future CEO or Management Department on how to please it's employees, and take risks by exposing internal flaws coupled with a proven outline on how to create a better company culture make Delivering Happiness an essential guide to those willing to adapt and change for the better.  Personally, I want to take the ideas from his book and introduce them to everyone in the world but even more specifically to those within my industry.  Perhaps Southwest Airlines might have an amazing turnout or perhaps they already have a company wide Culture Book, but I'm willing to bet other airlines would be a little hesitant to go all out and create a Culture Book of their own.  That might explain those successful versus those stuck in between a rock and a merger!<br /><br />The wonderful `End Game' Chapter gives you a cut and dry outline to determine the proper steps and ways to maintain a constant stream of happiness.  Through questions and recognition, one is able to set out the final goal and realign his or herself.  True, most persons lie within the garnering aspect of wealth, but those lucky enough to understand the commitment, not only in mind and body, but spirit as well, are the ones who truly rise above.  You could say that Tony has reached this enlightenment or maybe he was born with it.  Read it, you won't regret it!<br /><br />\\"...pursue the highest purpose first... - [...]<br /><br />If you want to win a copy of Tony Hsieh's new book Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose, leave a comment below and we will select a reader at random and announce the winner this Friday, June 11th 2010.

0393072231|2.0|I've read and enjoyed other Michael Lewis books, but this one disappointed me.  He's a great writer, and his ability to bring characters alive on the page kept me at least vaguely interested until the end.  However, the story was often confusing and sometimes redundant.  How many times did we have to read that the principals of Cornwall Capital wanted someone to prove them wrong?  Meanwhile, I would have appreciated more explanation of how the subprime lending market got so out of control.  Who was writing all of these loans, banks or brokers?  Was subprime just a tiny portion of the overall mortgage market, or did it become the major piece of it?  And what about all of those empty condos now littering America's landscape?  They were a major factor in the housing crash, but I don't remember seeing the word condo anywhere in this book.      An inside look at one of the mortgage originators would have been helpful.  Also, with Lewis's credentials, I can't believe he couldn't have gotten somebody at Moody's or S&P to explain what was going on behind the scenes of the regulators.  I don't like reading suggestions of idiocy and corruption without at least a hint of a smoking gun.  The research behind this book seemed rushed and therefore skimpy.
B002ZRPQ5K|3.0|I admit it took some time for this CD to grow on me but it has. There are songs that work and others that don't. At first, like several other reviewers, I was taken back by the rap (not being much of a rap fan). However, the rap employed here isn't gangster rap and works for me. Give Keane some props for trying something different. I would go as far to say that Looking Back with K'NAAN rapping is the catchiest tune of the collection. This song will stick in your head for the rest of the day, even if it is based on the \\"Rocky\\" theme song. Back in Time is a classic Keane song, heavy on synthesizer, and arguably the best tune on the CD. Clear Skies and My Shadow are also great Keane tunes. My Shadow's banging piano cord is very reminiscent of a popular Coldplay tune. In addition, the instrumental Hopelight also borrows from a recent Coldplay intro. song. Unfortunately, unlike Coldplay, this instrumental doesn't work. Similarly, Ishin Denshin is a failed experiment. Tigarah's quiet voice is lost and barely audible at times. Overall, there is music to appreciate on this CD; if there was a 10 point rating system, I would give it a 7/10.

B000002P6R|5.0|It's kind of hard to realize sometimes this album came along a decade after one of The Who's classic albums [[ASIN:B000002OX7 Who's Next]]. The interesting thing about this album to me is I've often used it as an example of an album that's been issued a lot when a lot of other albums that are truly lost classics remain just that-lost. Now that doesn't exactly change my opinion of this album within it's place in The Who's catalog.  It's hard not to hear this album and realize that the last time they hit the studio and the record racks with [[ASIN:B000002P2V Who Are You]] Keith Moon was still alive and still with the band. Well by now he was gone and Kenney Jones,who'd been working with the band live for the past three years or so finally joined them on their first studio outing since Moon's passing. More than a member of the band had passed;an era had too. In the early 80's any pop music form perceived as extravagent in any way,from disco to progressive rock were more or less being frozen out of the mainstream in favor of new wave and other,more sussinct styles of music. Weather or not one chooses to look at The Who as a prog rock or hard rock band is beside the point;this just wasn't really the time for any of that. One thing in their favor was both Pete Townsand and John Enstwistle's abilities at crafting great pop songs and coming up with musical ideas that rocked with a sense of genuine emotion,intelligence and creativity. What's interesting here is that while their are some harder edged guitar rockers here such as \\"The Quiet One\\",\\"Don't Let Go The Coat\\",\\"How Can You Do It Alone\\" and \\"You\\" (Pete has to have something to smash guitars to,right?) actually have just the amount of emotion to make their link to their 70's sound a little easier to take for more \\"keep it real\\" 80's underground rockers who were looking to laugh The Who off the planet by this time as a dinasaur band. Pete Townsand provides two excellent pop/rock tunes in \\"You Better You Bet\\" and \\"Another Tricky Day\\" and other songs such as \\"Did You Steal My Money\\",\\"Daily Records\\" and \\"Cache Cache\\",via musical references to people like Todd Rundgren and Hall & Oates such as tight vocal harmonies and stop/start rhythms actually owe something to a kind of modernized version of The Who's R&B roots. For a band that once proudly covered Motown hits in their early years the disco freeze out made anything that smacked of R&B dance music as \\"unhip\\",even if rock stars were doing it. Well at least The Who had the balls enough not to forget where they came from on those songs. The bonus tracks feature the likeminded \\"I Like Nightmares\\",the more dramatic \\"It's In You\\" and the strong,Stonesy rocker \\"Somebody Saved Me\\". All these songs were unreleased from these sessions and all written by Pete Townsand. The bonuses round off with hard rock live versions of \\"How Can You Do It Alone\\" and \\"The Quiet One\\",both edgier and more guitar solo oriented than the studio versions. This is definately not The Who's greatest album but it's certainly a very strong and actually pretty inventive album for something from a re-imagined group lineup making a comeback album in an entirely new decade.You Bet\\" and \\"Another Tricky Day\\" and other songs such as \\"Did You Steal My Money\\",\\"Daily Records\\" and \\"Cache Cache\\",via musical references to people like Todd Rundgren and Hall & Oates such as tight vocal harmonies and stop/start rhythms actually owe something to a kind of modernized version of The Who's R&B roots.

B003HE2BKS|3.0|Well, I may be a little biased because I LOVED \\"Rated R\\" - thought it was one of the best albums of the decade. This, to me, just seems superfluous and adds crapped-up \\"club\\" arrangements that negate what makes these songs great: the melodies, the lyrics and, of course, Rihanna's delivery.
0891419063|2.0|E.B. Sledge's memoir of the Okinawa and Peleliu campaigns was vaulted from relative obscurity to Dreamworks heights by the recent HBO television series, \\"The Pacific\\", whose producers (Spielberg, Hanks) relied in large part on this book as foundation material.  Its author conforms perfectly to the modern stereotype of a young man of the \\"Greatest Generation\\" at war:  simple, honest, moral, duty-bound and patriotic. No nuances are acceptable, allowing, of course, for religiously motivated and humble American moral qualms, which can be occasionally voiced about the necessity of killing.  And so it is with this book from first to last pages.  Note that this is a review of the memoir itself as a literary effort, not my commentary on the justness of the cause or on the character, competence, motivations, dedication of the serving personnel, the author's character or anything else.<br /><br />As in \\"Band of Brothers\\", Sledge's story begins with an idealistic young man from a quintessentially American small town background who ardently responds to the call of duty, in this case by abandoning Officer Candidate School and volunteering for Marine Corps combat training.  After the usual \\"hard love\\" tour in boot camp, the self-described ingenue Sledge is sent to the Pacific for an uneventful and boring interlude:  this juxtaposition sets the scene as it was before descending into the inferno. Sledge's campaign notes, reportedly written inside his ever-present New Testament were, in his later years, transformed into a newer testament, one which supposedly was prepared to depict the horrors of war for his family circle: learn ye well from my experiences as many veteran warriors have warned!  The memoir circulated to great acclaim (at least amongst military history buffs and fellow Greatest Generation soldiers) and took final form in this book.<br /><br />Once on Peleliu, Sledge emphasizes, virtually ad nauseum, the slime, grime, general nastiness, unfavorable terrain, miserable weather, lack of sanitation, smells, ever-present fear of death and unrelenting fatigue that were the combat soldier's lot.  Curiously absent from all this are any meaningful insights into the character or motivation of any of his confreres in the foxholes.  Judging from this book, his contacts, friends and acquaintances are uni-dimensional and startlingly lacking in insight  In fact, they display none at all.  They are stereotypical models of rectitude.  Their complaints are mostly trivial, annoyingly vague and phrased in such a way that nary an eyebrow would be raised if their dialogue was repeated verbatim at a Daughters of the American Revolution tea party or a church social.  Presumably, by juxtaposing  sterile and occasionally daffy dialogue to stark violence, Sledge is trying to make a point (\\"When good people are forced to do Bad Things\\"), for surely it begs credulity to imagine that anyone (then and certainly not now) could avoid using even a single epithet or Anglo-Saxon curse when expressing the misery of combat life.  This is in especially glaring contrast to the dramatic and excruciating depictions of combat violence which lard almost every page. This makes for an almost Hollywood wartime movie ambiance and is quite distracting.  Sometimes, the author's repetition became frankly tedious. However, in this case, the \\"Hollywood\\" depiction (\\"The Pacific\\") is much more nuanced in its depiction of the Marines, it explores, develops and places characters in an interesting and believable context and it makes for much more believable storytelling.<br /><br />I was perplexed by one aspect of the campaign as Sledge portrays it:  evidently, there was an abundance of rear-echelon troops who lazed about and made occasional forays to the front lines in quest of battlefield trophies, this while front-line troops were decimated by fatigue, disease, wounds, death and inadequate nutrition.  If this is, in fact, an accurate depiction, it amounts to criminal abuse of combatpersonnel.  As before, according to Sledge, aside from the occasional, laconic gripe, the combat Marines seemed to placidly accept this manifestly wasteful and unfair situation. And, as before, \\"The Pacific\\" portrays the matter much more convincingly.<br /><br />Allowing for all that, this book (and the TV series) will hopefully focus public attention on the Pacific Theater.  Lacking the dashing evil, sophisticated urbanity, great hair and nifty uniforms of the Hollywood Nazis, the battle against Imperial Japan (an entity equivalently evil in comparison to the Nazis) deserves more attention and its veterans more sympathy and acknowledgment.  Hopefully, this book will contribute in some measure to that laudable goal.personnel.

B001GCUO5M|5.0|This eerie neo-noir, mystery, madness movie reminds me a bit of Scorsese's other foray into madness, \\"Taxi Driver.\\" but the hallucinatory nature of Shutter Island is cinematically more interesting to me, although the DeNiro character may be slightly more powerful than DiCaprio.<br /><br />Having worked for the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health as a psychologist in the 1970's, the authenticity of the settings is amazing (not surprising in that some of it was filmed at Medfield State Hospital where I worked). The brick exteriors and the institutional green interiors brought back some unsettling memories. Although this transpired in a more gloomy period of  psychiatric history in the early 50's, where lobotomies were still in fashion and the applications of ECT (aka shock therapy) was almost equally as gruesome.<br /><br />The delusional world of Teddy Daniels  was quite convincing, and extremely well done. The concentration camp sequences, the visions of his wife, the psychiatrist in the cave- psychiatry was very primitive then gave an excellent representation of full blown paranoid schizophrenic. And DiCaprio pulled off this arduous scenario very well. Ben Kingsley was also well cast as the psychiatrist/superintendent, with his aristocratic airs and the pictures of the more grizzly bygone days of psychiatric torture adorning (e. g.screws in the head to let the demons out) his sumptuous abode. Seeing one of the finest actors of all time, Max Van Sydow, of Ingmar Bergman film's fame,as Kingsley's colleague was a real treat.<br /><br />However, the idea that DiCaprio's law enforcement ordeals where part a vast psychotic psychodrama, initiated by Kingsley, seemed a bit nutty, and pushed the idea that cinema to be effective to the audience requires a \\"suspension of disbelief\\" to the limit. Nevertheless the mystery and suspense was excellent, and Scorsese came of looking like Bergman, orchestrating masterful shifts between fantasy and reality. Sure Martin overdid it a bit, on one hand, by having Shutter Island resemble a semi-gothic Alcatraz,and, on the other, having Shutter Island seem not nearly as scary on the inside as Bridgewater State hospital, the Massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane, memorialized in Joseph Wiseman's classic, and gruesome, documentary, \\"Titticut Follies.\\" To reach that level would have required a character like Anthony Hopkins' chilling characterization as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, the gold standard of the criminally insane leading man. The criminally insane patients who, for the most part, seemed remarkably subdued, a symptom of the then new, chemical straight jacket, Thorazine.<br /><br />Anyway I think the official Amazon reviewer who saw this as one of Scorsese's lesser works is crazy, or at least needs to get his head examined. I think this ranks up with \\"Taxi Driver\\" as one of Martin's finest movies. Also, I thought its portrayal of the Bostonian mindset was way better than in The Departed,\\" in which DiCaprio was excellent but, as usual- like in last year's \\"Revolution Road,\\" not fully appreciated. He won an Oscar as a young, developmentally challenged character, in the second rate \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape,\\" However, he will surely be passed over here because a \\"madman, who's frightening behavior,won't appeal to the pseudo liberal, PC, tastes (\\"Hurt Locker,\\"\\" Milk\\") of the Academy Award's self congratulatory, aesthetically challenged, voters. Maybe my somewhat scattered  review is a bit delusional as well, like one the guard's said: \\"madness\\" is contagious in the madnouses, and I certainly did my time as a member of a front line treatment team in my own Shutter Island.y having Shutter Island resemble a semi-gothic Alcatraz,and, on the other, having Shutter Island seem not nearly as scary on the inside as Bridgewater State hospital, the Massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane, memorialized in Joseph Wiseman's classic, and gruesome, documentary, \\"Titticut Follies.\\" To reach that level would have required a character like Anthony Hopkins' chilling characterization as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, the gold standard of the criminally insane leading man.

Also, I thought its portrayal of the Bostonian mindset was way better than in The Departed,\\" in which DiCaprio was excellent but, as usual- like in last year's \\"Revolution Road,\\" not fully appreciated. He won an Oscar as a young, developmentally challenged character, in the second rate \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape,\\" However, he will surely be passed over here because a \\"madman, who's frightening behavior,won't appeal to the pseudo liberal, PC, tastes (\\"Hurt Locker,\\"\\" Milk\\") of the Academy Award's self congratulatory, aesthetically challenged, voters. Maybe my somewhat scattered  review is a bit delusional as well, like one the guard's said: \\"madness\\" is contagious in the madnouses, and I certainly did my time as a member of a front line treatment team in my own Shutter Island.
B002HWBS96|5.0|It is different.  This gives one a new perspective on the opera.  I need to watch this opera some more to make a futher assessment.  Give it a try.  This is the idea, not better not worse, just different.  Thank you.
B001JFZ118|4.0|The movie is of course, a classic.  This DVD edition is bare-bones, which is ok for the price being charged.  The only extras are 2 original movie theater trailers and some written (outdated) bios of the cast.  I'd love to see this movie given its due and reissued on bluray with some cast/director/producer interviews and some other sort of extras.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I consider myself to be in shape.  I run about 20 miles per week and weight train.  I started this on level 1 as per Jillian's recommendation.  I'm definitely sore, so I know it is working.  I'm not going to use this to replace running, but add this to my workouts, and not every single day.  I am sore!!  It's an 18 minute high intensity workout that seems to be effective.  I've struggled through level 1, so even if you are in shape, it will work.  She combines small and large muscles in one workout to be more effective.  She explains throughout why you are doing what you are doing and she tells you the correct way.  There are 2 other people to watch, and one is modified for a beginner.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get in shape!
B003Q5CO6Y|5.0|This episode went very differently from what I imagined.  I am delighted to say it was handled so much more masterfully than I could have ever imagined.  It was perfect.  I don't want to give the surprise away here so all I'll say that is that enforcer we've seen used throughout (the bald guy other than Walt) comes to see Walt.  He tells him a story about when he was a cop and used a half measure and someone ended up getting killed.  He concludes the story by saying that was the end of his not handling a problem the whole way and seeing it through.  He has come to tell Walter this story because he sees Jesse as a huge problem which needs to be resolved in no half way measures. Walter takes this advice and there flows the whole rest of the episode.  Just terrific stuff.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is a musical masterpiece!  Each song just continues to get better every time I listen to it. It's obvious from some of the juvenile negative reviews I've read that not everyone's into listening to albums like this from beginning to end (as intended, over and over again). No shuffling and superficial listening here! Insanely complex vocals, lyrics, and instrumentation all add up to a musical experience unlike anything else I've ever had. To those who prefer to keep things simple and straightforward (not that there's anything wrong with that!), don't waste your money. This material just isn't for you and probably never will be. That's the nature of art. There's no objective measure of what constitutes greatness. I'm just happy I have finally \\"discovered\\" OK Computer and Radiohead in my old age (58). I'm now totally immersed in the unbelievably complex, thought-provoking world created by Thom Yorke and company, having purchased everything ever recorded by them. Everything else is on hold now, including my decades-old addictions to Pink Floyd, The Moody Blues, and, more recently, Coldplay. Well, \\"Paranoid Android\\" is playing now, sounding even better than the last time, so I've gotta' go!! Thank you, Radiohead.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|I recently read Strengths Finder 2.0 on my Kindle. The information was very interesting and was definitely worth a read. After taking the test and finding out my 5 strength themes, the site creates a custom PDF for you. The PDF contains your themes, descriptions, and an action plan on how to play to your strengths. If you are interested in learning more about your strengths and what areas you influence naturally, this is a great book. I am giving it a 5/5. While I wouldn't say that it is an information intensive book on it's own, it does exactly as described and has plenty of content online once you have taken the test.

This is the best movie I've seen all year.
B003BZXI6E|4.0|As a Streisand fan, I would have purchased anything she released.  This one was a little disappointing.  The selection of songs performed was adequate, but she was uncomfortable in this particular environment and her voice was not up-to-par.  However, I am not sorry I purchased the DVD. I needed it to complete my collection of her work and performances.  A must for serious Barbra Streisand lovers!

B003E48AYC|5.0|Finally! A visually striking and mind blowing version of Alice in Wonderland! My family consistently enjoys Tim Burton's work, and this movie is no exception. The film very craftily captures the randomness of Wonderland while still telling a great story.     My favorite character in Alice and Wonderland is the Cheshire Cat, and Burton's imagery hit that character spot-on as far as I am concerned!     My husband bought me the 3-disc combo as a present, knowing that I would absolutely LOVE it! And he was right!     I hope they package many movies with the 3-disc combo! Now we can watch the movie anywhere, without making sure a blu-ray player is available. And, we can allow the kids to watch the DVD version, saving wear and tear on our blu-ray disc.

030726999X|5.0|I have been a longtime reader of Scandanavian mysteries, and when I picked up The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, maybe 18 months ago, it was just one of them.  I liked the book well enough, but it wasn't until I read The Girl Who Played With Fire (in about two sittings) that I realized the magnitude of the Larsson's achievement. I just put down The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, and I feel a sense of loss that the saga is over, and that there will be no more to look forward to.<br /><br />Some comments:<br /><br />The world of these novels is astonishingly complete and full, with lots of texture and credible complexity.  Dozens of distinct characters who behave believably and consistently, doing the work of the world.  This work is one of those that surpasses the thriller genre, like Graham Greene's novels, or John Le Carre's. They have literary merit -- despite their marketing labels.<br /><br />Anyone who who hasn't read the novels is in for a special treat -- 1,000-plus pages of rich, engaging, enjoyable reading.  You will enjoy the privilege of reading them as a seamless set.  And, while you won't have the pleasure of \\"discovering\\" this now-renowned oeuvre on your own, you will have a much better chance of  retaining the details and the damned Swedish names as you motor through the pages. Berger, Brednorr, Enkstorr, Endorff...  I couldn't remember their names, even when I \\"knew\\" them well in context.<br /><br />Lisbeth is a wonderful character, unimaginable in any previous time in history.  Eccentric, brilliant, weird, annoying, elfin, beringed -- she is the new Sherlock Holmes, the new James Bond, the new Marlowe -- an antihero with a capital A \\"Anti\\" and a capital H \\"Hero.\\"  She could hardly be more cynical, more disempowered, and more of an outcast.  Yet she could hardly be more heroic, with nothing short of Godlike omniscience and power.  And sat the core, she is utterly human in her Aspergerish mannerisms and distance. Her saga marks a psrticular high point in popular fiction.  Yes, there will be other high points, but I grieve, knowing that we are unlikely to discover a popular literary phenomenon so new, so unexpected, and so complete, for many, many years.ere will be other high points, but I grieve, knowing that we are unlikely to discover a popular literary phenomenon so new, so unexpected, and so complete, for many, many years.
0446563048|3.0|FRIDAY, JUNE 4, 2010    My Review of \\"Delivering Happiness A Path To Profits, Passion, And Purpose\\" by Tony Hsieh, CEO, Zappos     I rarely read non-fiction books. So why was I so hungry to devour Delivering Happiness A Path To Profits, Passion, and Purpose by Tony Hsieh, CEO, Zappos? I heard Tony speak at a conference I attended last Fall. He was the reason I was there. I had heard of this 20-something guy who had sold his first company, merely 2-yrs old, to Microsoft for a gazillion dollars. Who invested in a second company and then took a longer and bumpier road to success. I wanted to know how he shot an upstart through the economic firestorm of 2008 and succeeded when so many more established companies crashed and burned.    When Tony was introduced to speak, I was surprised to discover he had been sitting at the table next to me. There were no flashbulbs, no entourage, no trumpets blaring as he found his way to the platform. He stood before us a very humble, forthright guy willing to share a personal story of how he built a second, very successful company based on the idea that happy employees will attract happy customers and that happiness will deliver success.    I was fortunate to receive an advance copy of Delivering Happiness A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose with the promise that I would post an honest review, so read on.    Tony says that he \\"decided to write this book not only to help people avoid making the same mistakes that I've made. I also hope that this book will serve as encouragement to established businesses and entrepreneurs to defy conventional wisdom and create their own paths to success\\".    \\"Delivering Happiness...\\" is written as if you were sitting down with Tony at a bar, sharing several drinks and life stories. I finished the book in one afternoon!    I won't share any of my favorite stories (the face game, the pizza order, the random acts of \\"WOWness\\", Bald & Blue day, or the transcript of a live chat-hilarious!). And, I won't go through the individual Zappos Core Values, though I love the employee and customer stories that support many of them.    You will have to pick up your own copy at amazon.com and discover those stories and so much more for yourself.    You also won't find any of those overused corporate buzz words or phrases I hate like diversity, paradigm, value-added, going forward, or my all time most annoying drinking the kool aid.    But, I will tell you about the section that had the biggest impact on me.    Tony admits that Zappos \\"didn't hire a lot of talented people who would have made an immediate impact on the company because these same people were often also egotistical and would affect the culture of the company\\". The company was \\"willing to make short-term sacrifices, including loss of revenue or profits...\\" because protecting the company culture is a long term benefit. (What a concept, and very brave!)    I worked for a publicly traded company lead by a man whose management style best resembled that of a feudal lord. There was always an entourage, trumpets blaring (or was that his voice bellowing?) and some serious ring kissing. The work environment could best be described as an \\"off with their heads\\" if we didn't drink the kool aid or kiss enough...rings! The only corporate goal was to make the shareholders happy no matter what the cost to clients, vendors or peasants!    No wonder so many of us suffered from that Monday morning dread. In \\"Delivering Happiness...\\" a Zappos recruiter describes it best: \\"I think when people say they dread going into work on Monday morning, it's because they know they are leaving a piece of themselves at home. Why not see what happens when you challenge your employees to bring all their talents to their job and reward them not for doing it just like everyone else, but for pushing the envelope, being adventurous, creative and trying new things?\\" Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't...so what? (Again, what a concept...and very brave!)    Who wouldn't want to hop out of bed and go to work if that's the environment they could look forward to spending time in. The culture at Zappos and their Core Values encourage personal as well as professional growth. You'll enjoy reading about how their Core Values were eventually developed since Tony admits he resisted the \\"corporate\\" thing for years.    Delivering happiness is the key to the Zappos success story. Customers have even described a Zappos delivery as \\"happiness in a box\\". I think we all agree that we will drive farther or pay more for a great customer experience. And, who delivers a happy customer experience? Happy employees!    In 2009, [...] made Fortune magazine's \\"100 Best Companies to Work For\\" list. It was the highest ranking debut in 2009. In 2010, [...] moved up 8 slots and was ranked number 15.    But, there is also a bigger picture Tony wants us to look at. He asks the reader to actively participate in discovering their own path to happiness. He refers to a \\"Happiness Framework\\" and Maslow's Hierarchy and geometric fractals so I kind of glazed over this chapter (and almost spun off the bar stool). I get it but this is why I don't usually read non-fiction. Graphics + charts = textbooks & school!    In closing, Tony highlights a few \\"Tweets to Live By\\" and my favorite is a quote by Harry S. Truman: \\"It's amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit\\". How humbling (and Zappos Core Value #10).    In the Epilogue, Tony invites readers to \\"be a part of a movement to help make the world be a happier and better place\\" and invites you to join by clicking on [...].     Though not usually a joiner of movements, I clicked and hope you will, too. Because, I think happiness is like giggling...its contagious!
0321127420|5.0|This is required reading if you are doing enterprise development.  Even for it's age, POEAA is still THE foundation of the patterns that will be used daily.  Some of the material, particularly the object-relational mapping patterns, will be a little to low-level to actually be practically useful (considering the existing frameworks available today) - but still it provides a good background on how this stuff actually works.  That is - you probably won't need to implement your own Unit Of Work, but it's still essential that you understand the motivations of the pattern and the problems it solves.

1586217194|4.0|Blink by Malcolm Gladwell is a fresh and innovative way at looking at how people across a number of disciplines make decisions intuitively.  Decisions that are made quickly are often looked at negatively because they lack the depth and research necessary to make what is perceived to be a well-informed decision.  Gladwell makes the case that human intuition is a real and valuable tool that may be used along with other information gathering processes when finalizing decisions.  Gladwell coins the term `thin slicing' and works to convince the reader that snap decisions are an effective decision making tool, that rapid cognition is at times faulty, and outlines how rapid cognition can be used effectively.  The secret to `thin slicing' is in developing the ability to separate what information to pay attention to and what information to discard.  The author points out that we are inundated with information and learning to filter that information is key to `thin slicing' successfully.     Blink is an entertaining and easy to read book that is worth the short amount of time it will take to read.  A little bit of knowledge may go a long way.
0446343129|5.0|First read this 30 years ago and it's had a profound, positive effect on our (my husband and myself) health and lives.  It is the answer, in a big way, to the bulk of American's health problems today with diabetes and obesity, to mention only a few problems that are deeply aggravated by sugar addiction.    It is based on personal experience, not theory, and the self portraits on the back page (William Dufty, sugar addict compared with William Dufty, recovered sugar addict, tell it all.
0446563048|5.0|My name is Meredith and I am a recovering shoe dog.  What is a shoe dog you say?  It's a person who sells shoes.  I also have voluptuous feet (translation: wide with high instep, challenging to fit).  That being said, I often dread shoe shopping because of (1) lack of selection and (2) feel hideously guilty sending salespeople back and forth to the stock room to pull pair after pair to no avail.  I've been there, it's not fun and I end up apologizing profusely even if they only pull one pair.    When I discovered Zappos, the world's greatest online shoe store, I rejoiced!  I could spend hours browsing the seemingly endless selection and they would arrive on my doorstep ridiculously fast.  If I had to return a pair because they didn't fit it was no problem.  They even send me a reminder once a year when it's time to replace my husband's work boots.  Their service exceeds all my expectations,    When I read about CEO of Zappos Tony Hsieh's offer for free advanced copies of his new book \\"Delivering Happiness\\" in exchange for a blog with my review I was all over it.  I wanted to know more about the genius behind this marvelous company.      Right from the start of the book I was impressed by Tony's openness and honesty; he's not interested in impressing the reader with his business acumen or his education or the amount of money he's made.  Clearly he wrote this book to talk about his desire to live his life passionately surrounded by a tribe that mutually supports each other.  Also, the importance of having the strength to walk away when you lose the passion for a project and it's clearly not working.    What strikes the biggest cord with me is Tony's true desire to create a work experience for himself and his employees that is nurturing.  He isn't afraid to have his employees to better themselves and encourages them to express their true feelings about the company, both good and bad.  In fact, each year Zappos publishes a book of blurbs written by employees and othersthat express their experiences with the company for all to read.    I really enjoyed the tales of personal journey to where he is today.  There's no Gordon Gekko \\"Greed is good\\" mantra here.  The theme is PLUR, which stands for \\"Peace Love Unity Respect\\", the credo that Tony learned from the rave community.  A credo by which we can all live.

I don't see that happening.  I think the worst case would be what happened in Argentina during an economic collapse.  But look where they are now.  Everything back to normal.
0446563048|5.0|Happiness? When was the last time you heard of a CEO speaking of happiness, let alone writing a book about it? And it's not a self-indulgent piece on how he found happiness; rather, it's how his company, Zappos, delivers happiness to his customers, employees, and suppliers.    Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos, wrote \\"Delivering Happiness, A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose\\" \\"... to contribute to a happiness movement to help make the world a better place.\\"    Tony's learning points made him who he is today: from the failed worm farm as a child to the two-man team that made up LinkExchange (sold to Microsoft for over a quarter billion dollars) to the rave shows in San Francisco to his poker insights to his reflective lists--happiness continued to evolve within him and around him.    Zappos is a great business case study. It almost crashed and burned several times in its early years; but time and again it hung on while it grew. Tony has a refreshing style of openly sharing the errors he made along the way.     Tony's teaching points include Zappos' core values, call center methodologies (no \\"average handle time\\", no measure call times, no upsells, and no scripts--rather a Personal Emotional Connection, PEC), culture book(you can request it with a simple email), pipeline(Zappos employee education and promotion system), and alignment with investors and board members.     The cool thing about DH is Tony uses Zappos employee first-hand accounts to help tell the story. One gets a sense of servant-leadership. It's not all about Tony.    Lost in DH is the product--shoes. Zappos sells shoes online. A lot of shoes. That's a lot of happy feet walking the planet.     DH is a movement. Join it--yourself, your company, your community. I have.    By the way, while I received a free advanced copy of DH to write this blog, you can pick up a copy at Amazon.    Check out other blogs written by me at [...]

B0038BBA4I|5.0|Of this raucously honest debut offering from Britain's Marcus Mumford & Co., one UK reviewer remarks:<br />\\"What's missing here, apart from an antidotal dose of Dawkinism, is a modicum of self-restraint. Sigh No More is so earnest it weeps holy water, from theatrical drum rolls to jiggedy banjo riffs to trumpeting fanfares that are too bloody obvious to swallow. Pomp and pop are common bedfellows -- but with Jesus squeezed between them, three's too many for your average proverbial duvet.\\"<br /><br />To say I disagree might be both too simple and too mild.<br /><br />Mumford and gang's consecrated tears flood the record with the gorgeous fusion of transparent self-criticism and burly assurance that the Avetts have long patented. If England doesn't know what to do with this sort of thing, we'll take their export in this case.<br /><br />From the opening Sigh No More to the closer (perhaps the strongest track on the album) After the Storm, the album breathes hope, transparency, and surprise (see Roll Away Your Stone). The odd thing about this hope is that it is indeed incarnated in \\"jiggity banjo riffs and trumpeting fanfares.\\" Perhaps more complicated and possibly unpalatable to some audiences is that this hope also manifests within the desperation of a string of self-flagelating F-bombs in Little Lion Man. It is only in the recognition of this despair and the accompanying realization that to come out of such a \\"Cave\\" might actually require walking on one's hands in order to see how things actually are and need to be.<br /><br />In this way this disc is brilliant and disorienting. Perhaps the final brilliance comes from the fact that we are left re-oriented. Pointed towards something or at least shown glimpses at the joy and peace and grace available.<br /><br />\\"Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all<br />But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall<br />Lend me your eyes I can change what you see<br />But your soul you must keep, totally free\\"<br />-Awake My Soul
B00004VVND|4.0|I've been intrigued by \\"Westworld\\" since I first saw it many years ago, but I could never find it on home video. Stores tend to carry plenty of recent science fiction releases as well as  old, B-movie bargain titles, but \\"Westworld\\" seemed to have slipped through the cracks. It was therefore a nice surprise to finally find the DVD available on Amazon.com.<br /><br />  If you've never seen \\"Westworld,\\" you've probably seen works that have been influenced by it, including \\"The Terminator,\\" \\"Jurassic Park,\\" and even \\"The Simpsons\\" (the episode featuring \\"Itchy and Scratchy Land\\"). \\"Westworld\\" tells the story of a high-tech, adults-only amusement park where guests can explore expertly crafted re-creations of various historic periods (such as -- you guessed it -- the Wild West), which are populated by robots who look and act just like humans. The big draw is the realistic level of interaction that the robots have been programmed for. If a guest wants to have a shootout with a robot gunslinger, he can whip out his six-shooter and fire away... and he doesn't have to worry about losing, because the robots have been programmed to never harm the guests. What could possibly go wrong?<br /><br />  Ah, but things do go wrong, of course, and this is where the excitement really begins. Yul Brynner's relentless, robotic gunslinger easily steals the show, though Richard Benjamin earns the viewer's sympathy as a first-time park visitor, just beginning to enjoy himself, who's suddenly forced into survival mode. The special effects are a bit dated, though it's wise to remember that this is a movie from the early 1970's that didn't have the nine-figure budget that has become the norm for today's sci-fi extravaganzas  (interestingly, \\"Westworld\\" actually includes one of the earliest uses of computer-generated imagery ever seen in a movie: pixelated \\"point of view\\" shots representing robotic vision). However, \\"Westworld's\\" effects are more than sufficient to effectively tell the story.<br /><br />  The film, while only about 90 minutes long, takes its time to get going, and I think writer/director Michael Crichton could have shown us a little less of the human characters' adventures in Westworld before the machines went haywire (a slapstick, bottles-flying bar brawl which doesn't advance the plot is just one example of what could have been cut) and a little more of what happened afterwards. Also, it's best not to think too much about the details. For example, why are the guns loaded with real bullets? Even though it's explained that a sensor prevents the guests from shooting other humans, couldn't bullets easily go astray during a shootout? And wouldn't it be prohibitively expensive for the park to have to constantly repair all those shot-up robots?<br /><br />  While certain plot points might seem a bit unrealistic, they do make for a more exciting movie (after all, if the guns were of the harmless \\"laser tag\\" variety, how threatening would that be?). If you can suspend disbelief, you'll find \\"Westworld\\" to be a truly fascinating film, a disturbing depiction of a futuristic \\"dream\\" vacation to the past that quickly becomes a living nightmare.while only about 90 minutes long, takes its time to get going, and I think writer/director Michael Crichton could have shown us a little less of the human characters' adventures in Westworld before the machines went haywire (a slapstick, bottles-flying bar brawl which doesn't advance the plot is just one example of what could have been cut) and a little more of what happened afterwards.

0060887303|5.0|Often described as a mix between I Know What You Did Last Summer and Desperate Housewives PRETTY LITTLE LIARS by Sara Shepard promised to be an exciting and suspenseful read.  Sure enough, it met and exceeded all of my expectations.<br /><br />The first thing that I will say about this book is that I was really expecting something a little more superficial and juvenile.  I had never read anything by Ms. Shepard before, so I didn't know what to expect.  What I received was a book that would be great for any teen and most adults I know.  Ms. Shepard's writing is far from juvenile and made for a story that had me hooked from the first few lines.<br /><br />Allison, Emily, Hanna, Aria, and Spencer are best friends.  Okay, maybe they're really good friends.  Well, wait.  What definition of friends are we using here?  Allison is wildly popular and completely gorgeous, so it's no surprise when Emily, Hanna, Aria, and Spencer practically fall over themselves trying to be her friends.  Although Allison can be mean at times, she's their friend, right?  Sure, she may not a few dirty secrets about them, but she'd never tell.  Friends are in it until the end.  All bets are off, however, when Allison goes missing.  First torn apart by their grief and the awkward rebuilding of their personalities that follows Allison's disappearance, the girls later discover something deeper within themselves; an almost pleasant acceptance of Allison's disappearance.  At least now, each of their dirty little secrets is back to being safely hidden.<br /><br />Sounds good right?  Girl goes missing and eventually her friends get on with their lives.  Well, if this were the end of the story, the book would be about seven pages long. No, Ms. Shepard isn't going to let you off that easily.  Tossed into the chaos right from the beginning of the book, the girls each separately start to receive mysterious text messages signed by \\"A\\".  As they attempt to figure out who \\"A\\" is, the messages get more and more disturbing, some hinting at secrets that only the missing Allison knew.<br /><br />Cue the suspenseful music!<br /><br />So really though, if I could have had a suspense soundtrack playing while I read this book, I'm fairly certain that I would have jumped out of my seat in shock a few times.  This was a beautifully crafted book with a well thought out plot line that easily hooks readers and then draws them in.  The complexity of the story was what really made this a great read and I can't imagine the amount of time and planning that went into crafting the various plot twists and turns that pop up throughout the pages.  Think you know something about someone?  I can pretty much guarantee that by the next page you'll be proven wrong.  When everyone is suspect, who can you trust?  Ms. Shepard answers that one for us - nobody.<br /><br />One part of PRETTY LITTLE LIARS that may trip a few people up are the varying points of view throughout the story.  Each chapter is really told from a different girl's point of view although they all aren't necessarily labeled by girl.  Still, I found it fairly easy to figure out who's chapter we were in and didn't really notice too much of a disconnect between the four stories when reading.  Ms. Shepard does an amazing job with her consistency; although each girl's chapter takes place in different places and settings, they tie together well and occasionally we even see just a little bit of overlap.<br /><br />The last part of the book that I briefly need to discuss is the character development.  In a book like this, especially for the first in a series, character development is vital to a successful story.  Ms. Shepard did this wonderfully.  My proof is in the way that the characters, Spencer especially, still roam through my mind, picking at my brain when I have little else to do.<br /><br />I highly recommend PRETTY LITTLE LIARS to any fans of drama or YA fiction out there.  Looking for a good thriller?  I would definitely point tothis book.  Although filled with topics that young adults can relate to, I don't see much here that would turn an adult off from the book.  Indeed, I think adults too will very much appreciate the adrenaline rush this book provides.can relate to, I don't see much here that would turn an adult off from the book.

B001PKHS68|5.0|This classic Cary Grant movie is sensational!!  I'd advise this selection for your personal movie library.
B0028IDXDS|1.0|I bought one of these for our little guy since it was the same paci he had used at the hospital and it looked very cute. He really seemed to like it for the twelve hours we had it before my dog got a hold of the paci and chewed it (new mom, still learning:). To my dismay, you can't change out the paci...so you are stuck. Basically, you are paying for one REALLY expensive (albeit cute) pacifier. There are other brands out there that allow you to change out the pacifier. We returned this (excellent customer service) and bought a paci-plushi monkey and are very happy with it.
B000002KHB|4.0|Along with The Doors, Deep Purple are notable in being a band which made memorable music featuring the organ. Whilst I don't think that this album surpasses their \\"In rock\\" album, it's not far behind it.      The iconic song:      Smoke on the water - iconic for both the guitar riff and drumming. Apparently some music shops have banned guitar browsers from playing the riff...it's been done so ofen. Did hear within the last year or two that the world record for most guitarists playing at one time, together, had them doing this song's riff. Musically, this song has a cool organ, great guitar solo, cool bass guitar and I like the 'chopping' sound effect later on in the song. A flatmate once taught me how to play the riff just using notes on the sixth string...even though I don't play guitar and haven't attempted this 'feat' for years, I'm pretty sure I could quickly rediscover how to do that again. Iconic for a reason.      Next best:       Highway star - has that rock'n'roll syntax which becomes heavy metal at times. Good riffing, bass, organ and operatic (soaring) notes from the talented lead singer, Ian Gillan.  More coolness lies in the baroque elements to the song, like the lead guitar and organ parts, at times.       Then:      Space truckin' - the organ intro to this song reminds me of an Australian pop song, actually (released years later though)...The Rockmelons' \\"New groove\\", I think (as far as the keyboard and bass guitar goes). A song notable for its drum solo. High concept lyrics with a cool tone to the drum later, and the solo, like I said. A rocking song with a Gothic riff on the keyboard.      The rest:      Maybe I'm a Leo - maybe a Cream like blues song, but I find it more engaging that Cream's efforts in that genre early on in their career. Mid-tempo track. Features the organ.    Pictures of home - frenetic drum intro and outro. Expressive lead guitar (mid-tempo). Features the organ. Has a \\"Strange kind of woman\\" vibe to it...another Deep Purpletrack, from the previous year.     Never before - bluesy rock.  Bass, with some interesting drumming at times. More organ features. Riff and licks at times aren't bad.    Lazy - mostly an instrumental...for over half of its running time, in any case. Starts with an organ which sounds over the top, then gets boogie, then rock'n'roll syntax later. Nice keyboard parts at times.         Recommendations:        Deep Purple - In rock    Black Sabbath - Paranoid    Led Zeppelin - IV    AC/DC - T.N.T.    AC/DC - Back in black    Midnight Oil - 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,3,2,1    Midnight Oil - Red sails in the sunset        For something different:      Deep Purple - Concerto for group and orchestra.   Has well known Deep Purple songs performed live, but also new classical compositions by members of the band.  If you like interesting drumming, some of the drumming on the classical pieces are good. I've reviewed that album on this site.
0446563048|4.0|Are you interested in a book about customer service?    Would you rather read a book about leadership, communication and its impact on corporate culture?    Or, perhaps you're intrigued by the entrepreneurial growth story of  [...]?    If you said \\"Yes!\\" to any of the above, then \\"Delivering Happiness\\" is the book for you.  Written in an easy to read informal style by Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh, the book feels like Hsieh is sitting across the room from the reader, sharing life and business lessons over a cup of coffee.    Wow.  That simple word is the key to Hsieh's success, Zappos' growth, and delivering happiness.  Wow your customers.  Wow your employees.  Wow your readers.    For me, the whole book was an interesting and enjoyable read, but what really wowed me started in Chapter Five, Platform for Growth: Brand, Culture, Pipeline.  Here is where Hsieh parts from the historical background narrative and moves into practical information about developing a culture of service, the details of the Zappos core values and what each means, and how each of us can find the path to \\"delivering happiness\\" in our own lives.    To pique your interest, here are the 10 core values described in detail in the book.  Making these values a way of being helps every employee meet the Zappos mission, \\"to live and deliver WOW.\\"    *Deliver WOW through service.  *Embrace and drive change.  *Create fun and a little weirdness.  *Be adventurous, creative, and open-minded.  *Pursue growth and learning.  *Build open and honest relationships with communication.  *Build a positive team and family spirit.  *Do more with less. Be passionate and determined.  *Be humble.    This may be stating the obvious, but these values don't just apply to the workplace.  They are behaviors and practices that aren't turned on when someone walks into the office and turned off at the end of a shift.  Readers learn from the descriptions of these values how to apply them to all of life.  Delivering Happiness, indeed.Delivering Happiness will be a great addition to any library.    = = = = = = =    And now, the legalese...I agree to disclose that I received free advanced copies of the book, and I agree that my statements are my honest opinions of the book.

B001LF347E|5.0|I missed half the first season of Merlin when it was on NBC.  But I was hooked from the first show I watched.  I can't believe that NBC is so stupid as to not pick it up for a second season - but haven't missed an episode since it was picked up by SyFi.  I was happy to get the first season at a good price - BestBuy was $10 higher.  Now I can watch the series anytime I want - even though the legend has been drastically changed for television.
B001JHVTEE|4.0|Great album one of their best and sounds fantastic on vinyl. came in 100% condition.
B0018BXMXW|5.0|Like everyone and their brother, I was first exposed to Focus by their hit song \\"Hocus Pocus\\".  It's a great song, and it's hard to believe it was actually popular in America at one time.  I sure as heck never heard it played on the radio.<br /><br />By the way, it sure seems to me like Black Sabbath stole the main guitar riff from that song and used it for their \\"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath\\" title song a few years later.  Maybe I'm alone with that opinion and nobody else hears a remarkable similarity.<br /><br />\\"Hocus Pocus\\" is a highly unusual song.  Bands like Queen and 10cc must have been really impressed!  I wouldn't be surprised if either of those bands WERE in fact influenced by \\"Hocus Pocus\\".  It's a really strange song.  It sounds like, to be completely honest, *nothing* I've ever heard before.  What genre of music would a song like that fall under?  Practically anything!<br /><br />Other highlights include \\"Focus II\\" which is an early 70's slice of soothing guitar rock, similar to Carlos Santana's style (if you're looking for a comparison).<br /><br />\\"Eruption\\" is brilliant.  It's definitely an epic track (MUCH more epic than everyone going around calling everything \\"epic\\" all the time, at least on the internet people tend to do that- I hope THAT phase is finally over with!)  It ranges from a blistering heavy guitar jam to a fantastic keyboard jam to a soothing flute solo somewhere in the middle... it's 23 minutes of pure awesomesauce, baby.  My favorite part is probably the keyboard jam.  It absolutely rules.  Or is that a church organ I'm hearing instead?  Who knows!<br /><br />A great album by a band that should be remembered these days for putting together some really interesting and creative songs, not to mention implementing some creative weirdness from time to time.

B00070DK1E|5.0|Jethro Tull often suffers from the \\"But is not Aqualung\\" paradigm.  When you have a monumental album early in your career it is tough to have subsequent album reviewed independently.  This is a solid cd with great songs start to finish.  No it it is not Aqualung but, really what else is?  If you are looking for a great rock album from a classic rock band look no further, Crest of a Knave has hard rocking tunes and slower ballads.  Lyrics are deep and tell some interesting stories, especially Hot Night in Budapest and Said She was a Dancer.  Whether you are a dedicated fan of Tull or just a fan of classic rock this is a can't miss choice.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Sometimes, schlock borders on art.  In the hands of Martin Scorsese, it not only becomes art--it becomes a whole new kind of art entirely.  SHUTTER ISLAND is equal parts thriller, noir, mystery, and horror, a darkly humorous and atmospheric film filled some outstanding acting and truly stunning visuals.<br /><br />The film revolves around a very simple premise: U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his partner (Ruffalo) are going to Ashecliffe Island on Shutter Island, outside Boston, to look for a missing inmate.  She hasn't escaped: she's on the island somewhere.  But where?  And what exactly goes on at Ashecliffe, what mysterious activities have really drawn Daniels there?  And the ultimate question: will he escape with his sanity?<br /><br />The film is very closely based on Dennis Lehane's spectacular novel, with a few minor twists (and one not-so-minor twist near the end).  DiCaprio is a wonder in the lead role; he has really grown into his own as an actor, and this film gives him a breadth of range he hasn't yet seen before.  As for the rest of the principle cast: Ruffalo is in traditionally fine form; it's nice to see Ben Kingsly actually acting again (as opposed to just treading water in a bunch of slop); Michelle Williams is amazing as Daniels's deceased wife (viewed in flashbacks/hallucinations); Max von Sydow is chilling (if underused); Emily Mortimer turns in a haunting performance in her limited role; John Carroll Lynch doesn't have much to do, but does it well; and Jackie Earl Healey, in his small role, is fantastic.<br /><br />The level of the performances, and the solid script by Laeta Kalogridis, aside, the reason to view this film--repeatedly--is for Scorsese's atmospheric directing.  Remember CAPE FEAR, his slight misfire of a horror film (though still far better than most horror films of the 90s)?  SHUTTER ISLAND doesn't misfire, not once.  And it's filled with some absolutely stellar visual shots, scenes and imagery that borders on performance art.  Haunting in its breadth and emotional resonance, SHUTTER ISLAND ranks among Scorsese's best.  Watch it to see what a noir/horror film should be.s breadth and emotional resonance, SHUTTER ISLAND ranks among Scorsese's best.  Watch it to see what a noir/horror film should be.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|In it's first year, \\"Community\\" has earned a place on the shortest lists of great TV shows.  For me, it's already up there with \\"Arrested Development,\\" \\"30 Rock,\\" \\"The Larry Sanders Show,\\" \\"The Simpsons,\\" \\"Seinfeld,\\" etc.  In commercials it seems to blend together with \\"Parks and Recreation\\" and \\"The Office,\\" and they do look similar, but \\"Community\\" is much smarter, sharper, funnier than those shows, and it is better in it's first year than \\"30 Rock\\" was at this point.

0446563048|5.0|While I'm not necessarily interested in being an entrepreneur like Tony Hsieh, I found his book to be a great read that was hard to put down.  I really enjoyed reading about his childhood and college adventures leading up to his adult pursuits.  He was a true go-getter (and still is!) who wasn't afraid to take risks.  He made mistakes along the way, but learned from them, as is evident in his great success with Zappos!      I especially enjoyed learning about how Zappos spends so much energy on customer service, good vendor relations, and maintaining a vibrant compnay culture.  The Zappos culture is based on 10 core values that everyone is wholeheartedly committed to.  Honestly, after reading this book I nearly wanted to head to Vegas and work for Zappos!    Yet this book is not about convincing you to work or buy from Zappos (though that could very well be a side effect).  The goal is to share tips and pointers for running a successful business and living a purpose-driven life full of happiness.  I honestly believe that anyone who reads Delivering Happiness will learn something new that they can take away and apply to their life.      This book is well-written and easy-to-read.  Read it and be inspired!
B002MR908M|1.0|Manowar is obviously a band of dangerous hoodlums.

Please, keep your children away from this type of unwholesome influence.  If you listen, your soul will be closer to hell.
B0000524CY|5.0|There have been so many reviews written on this movie that I won't give a detailed review. Read the other 800+ reviews for a more thorough analysis of this classic movie and its plot, etc. However, I just want to make a few observations and give some personal opinions.<br /><br />The Exorcist is referred to as \\"The Scariest Movie Of All Time\\" on the DVD cover. Well, perhaps it may well have been up to that time (1973), though that of course is debatable (personally, I don't think it is at all). I can think of 20 + other horror movies that I feel are scarier than The Exorcist. To me, this movie is more bizarre and twisted than it is scary. A demonically possessed 12 year old girl who demonstrates increasingly bizarre, twisted behavior certainly is scary, but I find humor in a lot of her comments and scenes in general. Every time the scene comes on where she delivers a left hook to her mother's face and spins her head around, I laugh.  That is laugh-out-loud funny.  I find her filthy language humorous. To me, the viewer shouldn't be laughing during a movie that's supposed to be scary. I'm sure these scenes were meant to be scary, but they come off as funny sometimes, to me, anyway. Another thing - she's confined to her bed most of the time, so she's only scaring people who visit her room.<br /><br />Another thing about this movie is that it has a lot of slow moving and boring scenes. Had a lot of these scenes been cut down or eliminated, the movie would retain a more consistent horror feel to it. Instead, the movie kind of meanders around at a slow pace, showing everything from boring conversation over a cup of coffee to a man jogging around a high school track. What's really bad is whenever the movie seems to be gaining some momentum, suddenly it slows down again with some of the above mentioned things.  I know that the goal of the director is to have a gradual buildup of tension/suspense, but again, this buildup is inconsistent.  One positive to the movie is the fact that it's fall and it's late October (one scene shows some kids running along the sidewalk dressed in their Halloween costumes with the Tubular Bells song playing).  That's pretty creepy.<br /><br />The Exorcist Tubular Bells theme song is one of the classic horror movie themes of all time, but it's hardly ever played in the movie. Its absence lowers the scare level. A great musical score can make a movie scarier than it normally would be without the music. It can make all the difference in the world. Think of movies like Psycho (1960), Carnival Of Souls (1962), The Haunting (1963), The Omen (1976), Halloween (1978), The Amityville Horror (1979), movies like these. Also, to me, one of the elements that a scary movie needs is a lot of darkness. A lot of nighttime footage, both indoors and outdoors. The use of shadows, dark shades, and low lighting. The Exorcist lacks this. Most of the scenes are during daylight hours. Some of the daylight scenes are pretty creepy, though. I also value suspense and psychological horror, such as in The Innocents (1961), The Haunting (1963), and The Changeling (1980). I know that The Exorcist is a different kind of horror movie, but it lacks these two important qualities that I feel qualify a movie to be considered very scary.<br /><br />In 1973 there was another movie that was released that had to compete with The Exorcist, and that is The Legend Of Hell House. This movie is scarier than The Exorcist, in my opinion. But it got buried as a result of The Exorcist's popularity. There have been many other movies since 1973 that have been scarier than The Exorcist, such as The Omen (1976), Burnt Offerings (1976), Halloween (1978), Salem's Lot (1979), The Changeling (1980), The Shining (1980), etc. Many movies that came before The Exorcist are scarier, such as Psycho (1960), The Innocents (1961), The Haunting (1963), etc.<br /><br />I first saw The Exorcist back in 2000 and was expecting it to be the scariest movie I've ever seen. It wasn't. Not even close. It does have its moments, though. I rank it maybe the 23rd scariest movie I've ever seen. I have an arsenal of horror movies. Whenever I want to watch a really scary movie, I never make The Exorcist my first choice.<br /><br />As a side note, I watched an interview with Linda Blair where she was saying that a lot of people are afraid to approach her because they think she is the Devil.  I laughed out loud when seeing this because it shows the mentality of people.  People can't differentiate between fiction and reality.  She's acting in a movie.  She's in heavy makeup, basically a costume...a Halloween costume if you will.  Yet, these very same people will see their next door neighbor dress up as a devil for Halloween and think nothing of it.  Then three weeks later they'll invite that person over for Thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />Stupid people.<br /><br />Do I recommend this movie?  Yes. It's a horror classic with a memorable theme song. It's a brilliant mix of horror and religion. It should be in everyone horror fan's collection. This movie is a classic, well made, good cinematography, has a memorable theme song, and has good acting.  Based on these things, I give the movie 5 stars.  But I hardly nominate it as \\"The Scariest Movie Of All Time\\".  Therefore, as far as scariness, it's 4 stars.  So, 5 stars for the acting/cinematography/theme song.  The scare level gets 4 stars.  These two things average out to 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5, so it's a 5 star movie.t. Not even close. It does have its moments, though. I rank it maybe the 23rd scariest movie I've ever seen.

0393061310|3.0|I finished Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel. I did so only by skimming a lot  of the later chapters. Did you read every line? It is an awfully large book and I just didn't feel like  plugging along through every portion. As to the depth of material, I had two thoughts.    1) I was most impressed by how much material he brought together. One example was     his lengthy description of the populating and the populations of the islands in the     southeast Asia (e.g., Australia, New Guinea). Another was his almost-as-lengthy      description of the various peoples of China. Although I skimmed a lot of this, I now     know where I can go to get a lot of historical information on peoples of the world     (Europeans, Asians, Americans). I know from my attempts at writing my book that it     takes an enormous effort to find and bring together this much material.    2) On the negative side, the mass of information made it hard to follow his main points - that     elements other than genetic differences caused some areas of the world to progress faster     than others. Out of all of his material, however, I understood:      a) Europe had more large animals (pigs, horses, cattle) to domesticate;      b) Europe had more high-value plants (wheat, barley, peas) to domesticate;      c) Europe is laid out along lines of latitude so that plants and animals domesticated       in one part can be then transplanted to other parts (North and South America       are laid out along lines of longitude - plants and animals viable in one part       may not be viable in another; and      d) because Europeans developed in long contact with a lot of domesticated animals, they       were exposed to many diseases (small pox) and had a degree of immunity that       was lacking in other areas such as the Americas.    3) a-d are important points but I think it would have been easier to have absorbed them if the     book was 1/2 as big - it was awfully hard to dig out these points because most of the time     you are slogging through other matters.    4) Diamond made it quite obvious that he felt these points where why Europe developed faster     than other areas and he made it equally obvious that he rejected the notion that it had anything        to do with intelligence or adaptability.       On the last point, I'm not convinced. As I understand it, he feels that New Guineans, American Indians  or Australian Aborigines could have done the same as Europeans had they had a-d as did the Europeans. However,  I think it is pretty obvious that people of American Indian descent have, to this day, failed to mould into modern  society - they are missing in the Universities, missing in high-tech businesses - they tend to stick to reservations.  From what I know, the same it true of Australian Aborigines and, the last I looked, not much modern production  or innovation comes from New Guinea. On the other side of the coin, I believe it apparent that orientals (e.g., Chinese)  have notable aptitude in the sciences and engineering. So although one does not like to believe that some peoples  are more capable in the modern technological world than others, I believe it is a fact.    I do believe that what has given America its prominent position in the world, is a lot of land to develop  in, separation from older countries, and a substantial mix of peoples.

The last significant change was the advent of the 40-hour work week, which was intended to protect employees from being overworked by their employers.<br /><br /> Over the last 100 years, we've moved away from an industrial economy into an informational one, but the rules haven't moved with it. Where we work, how we work and when we work... the status quo has gone unchallenged for far too long.<br /><br /> The rules need to change.<br /><br />Authors (and founders of 37signals) Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson get this. They know things need to change, and they want to show you how in their new book, Rework.<br /><br />Rework is a series of essays encouraging you to rethink how you work. Covering topics such as start-ups, marketing, meetings, planning, hiring and more, this book will be a breath of fresh air for some--and a slap in the face for others.<br /><br />Fried and Hansson don't shy away from speaking their minds in this book. They're out to provoke a reaction. And they succeed spectacularly. A few standout examples:<br /><br />Staying late to put in extra hours--<br /><br />Not only is this workaholism unnecessary, it's stupid. Working more doesn't mean you care more or get more done. It just means you work more. . . Workaholics aren't heroes. They don't save the day, they just use it up. The real hero is already home because she figured out a faster way to get things done. [pp. 25, 26]<br /><br />On mission statements--<br /><br />There's a world of difference between truly standing for something and having a mission statement that says you stand for something. . . . Standing for something isn't just writing it down. It's about believing it and living it. [pp. 47, 48]<br /><br />On standing up for something--<br /><br />Strong opinions aren't free. You'll turn some people off. They'll accuse you of being arrogant and aloof. That's life. For everyone who loves you, there will be others who hate you. If no one's upset by what you're saying, you're probably not pushing hard enough. (And you're probably boring, too.) [p. 43]<br /><br />These examples fly in the face of a \\"keep your head down and your mouth shut\\" work culture. We're generally not encouraged to have opinions, but we are expected to stay late, even when there's nothing to do.<br /><br />That's not to say the book is perfect. The essay \\"Four-letter words\\" has a great point--that words like \\"can't,\\" \\"need,\\" \\"easy,\\" or \\"fast\\" discourage helpful conversation and getting real work done. However, I felt that it was hindered somewhat by the use of some of the other four-letter words that you might here just as frequently at your office. (Unless you work at mine. Usually.)<br /><br />While I understand that they were using them as examples of what they weren't talking about, their use didn't quite fit. It reminded me of a teenager deciding to \\"sound\\" grown up by cussing.<br /><br />There were also times when I felt Fried and Hansson didn't go far enough in their assessments.<br /><br />Their ideas are good--even great--but I would have been very interested in seeing the authors explore the idea of when work happens in greater detail. The most I saw in the book was an understanding that working stupidly long hours all the time might mean you're bad at your job, and their acknowledgment that no one works a full eight hours in a day anyway, so we don't need to freak out about people having diversions. On this subject in particular, it would have been great to read more of their opinions.<br /><br />Perhaps most meaningful to me in Rework is the encouragement to \\"sound like you.\\" The authors write:<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with sounding like your own size. Being honest about who you are is smart business, too. Language is often your first impression--why start it off with a lie? Don't be afraid to be you. [p. 262]<br /><br />As a writer, this is something I can't hear enough, particularly when doing corporate work. People don't care about a faceless corporation's message, but they do care about what a person has to say.<br /><br />Rework is one more voice in a growing chorus demanding change. Cali Ressler & Jody Thompson at [...], Seth Godin, Timothy Ferriss and Daniel Pink are just a few business thinkers challenging the status quo. Fried and Hansson are in good company and Rework is a welcome addition to the conversation.on't care about a faceless corporation's message, but they do care about what a person has to say.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|All I can say is WOW. I have yet to become a 'verified purchaser' as can be seen, but I will be, you can count on that! Perhaps the best advice I can say is: If you make one change to your family room for 2010, get yourself a brand new LCD HDTV. For dad, add a Playstation 3 if he plays games, otherwise a blu-ray player. And for your eyes, mind, and dear GOD EVERYDAY THOUGHTS WHILE SITTING IN YOUR CUBICLE NOT LISTENING TO THE other person on the other end of the line and staring at the huge ikea sign, or the GE Capital sign know darn well that they do not own that ENTIRE building, they just paid for the top floor so as to be able to place their sign there and make it appear so.... OH GOODNESS I NEED MORE OF THIS SHOW! IT IS LIKE THE EARLY NINETIES IS HAPPENING AGAIN!!!!....er... yeah....
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I loved this movie even though it was quite different from the ones I grew up with.  I grew up with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.  I think it was great that Dr. Watson was not such a bumbling nit wit like he was betrayed before.  It was also nice to see Sherlock with a love interest.  Robert Downey Jr. was great as Sherlock.
B0007PALRU|5.0|If you like awesome graphics, with a good story line, this is the movie to watch.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Ranks alongside 'Godstone - The Kairos Boxes' and 'Scrooged' as my favorite Christmas movies and books.
B00333NCTM|5.0|this book was a quick and fun book. you dont need to be a fan but when you get to the last page you will find you are.  dont try and read without laughing  it is not possible.  Best read in a long time!
B003E48AYC|4.0|Loved the Movie...and I couldn't wait to get it. I purchased the \\"Deal Pack\\" were I got $10 off if I purchased another movie with Alice in Wonderland, this turned out to be no Deal...Walmart had the Alice Triple Pack (BlueRay, DVD, and Digital Copy) for $15.99
B003E48AYC|3.0|Not being a remake was a surprize, but little else was. The preview clips were the best parts of the film. It started, ran and ended rather dully. Over a minimal sound system, or TV, the voices were muffled in the sound track. It was very lack luster for a Depp movie.
B003AYPMBU|5.0|I bought this mainly for the concert DVD and it didn't disapoint.  I grew up listening to these guys and even though they're older, they still have thier chops.  The twin leads are great and Halford's voice is still acceptable.  I enjoyed it.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I have not seen the whole series yet but to a gunnut they showed the following which is hardly ever seen in war movies: The browning water cooled machine gun, the REISING submachine gun, and the 1897 Winchester 12 gauge riot shotgun-it may have been the trench gun but I only saw the back end. As far as the rest of the movie, it does seem to focus on the Marines and not the whole picture. One other item, the way I test a movie like this is to see it with a friend who is a Vietnam combat vet and if he has flashbacks, I know the movie is real. In addition, my father was  Merchant Marine taking supplies from Australia to New Guinea.

6300274187|5.0|Thanks for sending it punctually and in such perfect condition! We enjoyed this movie a lot!
B000E1155E|5.0|It may well be that you have to be English to really \\"get\\" this, but I have to say that as a (nearly) 40 year-old music snob who mostly listens to the Stones, Zep, The Clash, Dylan, etc., that this is geniunely one of the greatest albums I have heard. It's essentially a concept album about being a youth in Sheffield and its attendant dramas (clubs, girls, drink, drugs, police). Lyrically spot-on; sharp, insightful, witty. Alex Turner's voice may irritate those not used to northern English dialects, but it's very endearing and perfectly suited to the material.  Probably my favourite thing about this album is it's almost total lack of pretension. I doubt I will ever tire of it. For once, all the hype was justified.
B002RAREAK|3.0|I love usher and have most of his CDs but I guess I wasn't paying attention that this CD is edited...  Really brings down a bunnnnch of his songs and it frustrates me.  BUT he is still a wonderful artist who knows what he's doing, he keeps up with the times extremely well and I have no issues with his actual music
B000BO0LLS|5.0|After two consecutive albums bombed, I, along with many other people, wrote Mariah Carey off as finished. Luckily, this wasn't the case. Her 2005 album, The Emancipation of Mimi, propelled by the stunning success of \\"It's Like That,\\" \\"We Belong Together,\\" and \\"Shake It Off\\" on radio and iTunes, debuted at number one and went on to sell millions of copies world wide. It was an amazing comeback, and everybody hailed the \\"Return of the Voice.\\"    This album is almost flawless beginning with \\"It's Like That\\" and stretching all the way to \\"Fly Like A Bird,\\" or \\"We Belong Together (Remix)\\" if you're lucky enough to own the deluxe version. While some tracks are only average (cough cough... \\"One and Only\\"... \\"To The Floor\\"... \\"Your Girl\\"... cough cough), the other tracks MORE than make up for it. My personal favorite is \\"Don't Forget About Us,\\" which also happened to be Mariah's 17th number one, but after that, it's hard to pick a second favorite.    I highly recommend this album, which will surely be a classic someday, along with her album \\"Butterfly.\\" 5 Stars.
B0013BNY2Q|1.0|This release is one of the worst recordings I have ever listened to. The music really could be amazing if they would not have turned it up so loud during mastering. If you are the typical MP3 only listener than stop reading this review right now as you are not a real music listener. Go away and listen to top 40 and crank it up until your ears bleed. I personally still listen to music in my car and on my home stereo and I only listen to uncompressed formats such as LP and cd. This cd sounds so bad. The mastering tech is catering to the MP3 crowd and trying to take part in some sort of loudness war. Loudness comes from turning up a stereo not from turning it on. If you try to turn this recording up past half way it will distort and ruin nice speakers over time. The music itself is wonderful if you see them in concert. They need to remaster this again from the original  master tapes and tone it down a lot. What happened to the days when if a stereo wasn't loud enough you went and bought a bigger amplifier? Now kids throw little cheap buttplugs in their ears and cranking it up. Maybe the hearing loss and crashed hard drives that erase whole music collections will make them mad enough to demand better from bands and record labels. Bring back the LP and CD!
B00003CXSM|1.0|A total waste of time watching this mess. Just dumb. And it's obvious they were trying to put them together. Just a stupid movie.
B003L1OACO|1.0|I agree with everything the other reviewer said. The Cale Mixes are messed up bad! You will notice the way the alternate vocal version of I Wanna Be Your Dog on Disc 2 comes to an abrput end at approx. 3:26? On the 2005 remastered version it fades out. What gives?  Also, where is the alternate vocal version of Real Cool Time that appeared on the 2005 set? The \\"takes 1+2\\" version on RCT is just the instrumental track. Does anyone have an explanation?
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I recently purchased this for my mother as a mother day present and she loved it. Great gift for a James Taylor and/or Carole King fan!
B003JLA4KS|5.0|I was lucky enough to get to see a screening of this film in Boston at the Regent Theater on June 6th, 2010 (and I also plan on buying the Blu Ray for the extra footage.)  This documentary is very well done (even better than the previous two by these guys, and they were really good too.)  Rush's story is incredible, interesting, and, at times, funny.  Even my wife, who is not a Rush fan, was engrossed and entertained by this movie.  It's very interesting to see all of the musicians that Rush has directly influenced comment about the band.  If you had any doubts that Rush is one of the greatest and most influential bands of the latter part of the 20th century, you won't after you see this!
B001DDBCUA|5.0|\\"Sex and the City: The Movie\\" is exceptional and a film that met with its audience's expectations. Released in May, 2008 the movie has made so far over $400,000,000 at the worldwide boxoffice and led to a sequel that was released in 2010 that was far superior. In this outing Carrie is engaged to Big; Miranda deals with Steve's infidelity with another woman; Charlotte is happily married to Harry and have adopted a baby girl; and Samantha is living on the coast with Smith, but she is having cravings for sleeping with other men. The movie is funny, witty, daring, and most of all similar to the scripts in the TV series. New York is used as well as the backdrop to the film as the movie was shot at many different locales around the Big Apple. The movie, like the series, expresses what life is like for women past 40, their troubles and hardships, and the fact that nothing is as hard as it seems as long as you have nice shoes to wear and good friends to associate with.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I saw the movie in the theater in 3D.  I liked the movie in the theater in 3D, but all I wanted was a basic DVD of the movie with no frilly froo-froo extras that I could play on my home theater system.  This is your basic Avatar.  No 3D, no frills, no games, no director's cut, no \\"Making Avatar\\" documentary, no interviews with the director or stars...nothing extra; just the basic Avatar movie.  I LIKE my basic Avatar movie and I recommend it to anyone who just wants to see the movie without all the frilly froo-froo stuff that too many people think you have to have when you buy a DVD these days.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This \\"Sex and the City\\" boxset is the ultimate collector's item for fans of the series that followed the lives of four women living in New York City between 1998-2004. Many know Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and the sex-craved Samantha as being four best friends who search for love while maintaining great careers and facing life's obstacles while realizing nothing is too hard to conquer as long as they have each other to rely on.<br /> This spelndid box set features all 94 episodes of the long-running HBO series on 20 dics. One of those discs is a bonus DVD that features interviews with the cast, behind-the-scenes clips, and more. The two \\"Sex and the City\\" films are not a part of this set as the films themselves were released after this set arrived in stores.<br /> Many have complained of the way the DVD's were packaged as they slip into folded covers in a book, not being housed in the hard plastic that most DVD's are kept, so keep that in mind when purchasing this item. You can also purchase all six seasons of \\"Sex and the City\\" individually like I did. As of 2010 HBO has rereleased all six years separately in new, neat packaging with new art work.<br /> This Emmy-winning series is simply a must-have for lovers of classic television shows, no matter how you purchase the episodes. Sit back and see what true friendship is all about!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Loved following the main characters....Fabulous ending.<br />I found myself skimming thru a lot of pages as there were too many details and background on too many characters.<br />When the story stayed with the main characters I found it riveting and am just so sadden by the early loss of this great writer.<br /><br />I do believe as others have stated, that Mr. Larsson did not have the opportunity to edit this fine work.<br /><br />Rest in peace sir. We will also all miss the drama of Lisbeth's life.
0307454541|5.0|I had read some reviews of the three Millennium novels by Stieg Larsson and so I took the plunge and read the first one.  This is one of the best mystery novels I have read in years.  The characters are well-crafted and interesting, especially the heroine, Salander, who will go down as one of the more uniquely satisfying creations of this genre!  She is an admirable example of a deeply wounded and psychically injured woman that has managed to get a real poetic justice on one of her tormentors while being an astonishingly intelligent and resourceful researcher and advocate for justice...even if it is with relentlessly original methods.  I saw the Swedish film version of this novel the week after I finished the book.  It is an excellent transfer so do seek it out before the American film industry makes what I assume will be an inferior, less adult movie.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|How does James Cameron make movies with obvious plot and ending (Titanic would inevitably sink and Avatar would help Navi battle the humans and win) and make them so gripping and entertaining?<br /><br />After watching this movie twice, I am convinced the secret is in the amount of attention paid to the details. It is the amazing voice recordings of Zoe Saldana (leading female character) with perfectly pitched and timed \\"hiss\\" and primordial yell of \\"Eywa has heard you!\\" It is a Marine losing his hat because of a wind generated by a helicopter, and the leading character checking the native vegetation with child-like curiosity. When an antagonist kicks a door open, a blast of air is seen.<br /><br />This movie is like an art. Watching it is a pleasure in its own. The obvious storyline is not a hinderance but only serves to make the audience eagerly anticipate for the next sequence to take hold. Avatar reminds us that it is how well the story is presented and holds our interest with meaningful characters that are most important.<br /><br />The criticism that this movie has a racial tone (white man comes and saves the helpless indigenous population to overcome their racial limitations) is hardly evident and certainly not central to the story.<br /><br />A more valid cricism is that this movie has tree-hugging theme in which foul, polluting, and warloving humans destroy nature for the sake of avarice and to fulfill their wanton need to destroy and kill. It is also critical of George W Bush's Iraq policies (antagonists says \\"we need to fight terror with terror\\" and his strategy is described as \\"shock and awe\\").<br /><br />The only thing I didn't really care for were the \\"floating mountains\\" which blatantly violates the very basic law of physics.<br /><br />I can see why many people would want to watch this movie more than once. There are hundreds of little worth-noting details that people would miss in the first viewing. You will like this film and probably would want to watch it more than once.
B0038KHTI0|3.0|The music on this release has received detailed analysis in other reviews. Both albums are great, and I think they will grow on me over time. Since I discovered Tobi's music last year, I've purchased almost everything he's done - Edguy, Avantasia, other side projects, and guest appearances. I love the guy.<br /><br />I just wanted to warn folks to avoid cheaper versions of this package. I thought I'd found a great deal on the Deluxe Edition (\\"12 new from $29.99\\"), but what I recieved was 2 cheap digipacks and no code for bonus content - NOT the hardbound deluxe edition that I was expecting. I don't know if it was a bootleg, but there were glue strings from the digipacks stuck to the faces of the CDs, and the carboard was very thin with visible scoring marks on the edges.<br /><br />While I would have purchased both of these CDs separately, I wouldn't have paid $64 for the fancy version anyway. Once I removed the glue, I was mostly satisfied.<br /><br />I got what I paid for.<br /><br />For anyone who DOES need the hardcover books and bonus material, stay away from the $29.99 version!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Even though Wikipedia said the \\"xD\\" picture card is officially obsolete as of 2010, there are still many thousands and thousands of \\"Olympus and FujiFilm\\" cameras that these memory cards can be used in.    We recently upgraded from our 7 year old FujiFilm FinePix A340 to a Canon PowerShot A3100IS because of the smaller factory installed 64Mb memory card.. and the limited number of pictures/movie length (along with having NO sound capabilities with the A340), that was limited on the A340.    Instead of throwing our old FujiFilm camera away, I decided to use it as our bumming around/backup unit.. and as such, upgraded the camera's \\"firmware\\" to allow the use of the larger/faster \\"xD M+\\" card memory.    \\"Read/Write\\" speeds increased from the old 64Mb \\"M\\" memory of 1.3/5.. to that of the replaced \\"M+\\" memory of 3.75/6.  Picture capacity and movie length increased from 33 pictures and less than 60 seconds of movies to that now being available of 4,264 pictures.. and a much longer movie time!      That's right.  Picture capabilities increased a additional 4,231 shots.. all for less than a \\"$14 Dollar\\" bill.  Now how can you beat that!?    P.S.  So the question is.. \\"Why did we purchase a new Canon when all of the above was done for less than $14.00?\\"  What can I say?  As a camera nut, what's one more to the several that we already own? (wink)
B0011DZN6G|4.0|The Scarecrow CD has received 30 reviews on Amazon (21 of them 5 stars). However, there have been no reviews of the CD+DVD version, so I thought I'd chime in. First of all, the album is fantastic. I was familiar with the music before I bought it. I don't often feel the need to physically own records these days, since they wind up being listened to much more on my computer, mp3 player, or phone than in an actual CD player. However, the Scarecrow is an album that I needed to TOUCH. To see on my shelf. Buy it.<br /><br />I purchased the CD+DVD because it was only a few dollars more than the CD alone. I wasn't expecting much from the DVD, so I wasn't disappointed in the purchase. I just wish that there was more to watch. A few videos, a few interviews - that's about it. There's nothing that can't be seen on youtube, and nothing that I feel the need to own. The content is not bad (the \\"making of Lost in Space' video, for example, is very cool), there's just not enough. I would have liked to see some live performances (Jorn!), tour diary stuff, band-fooling-around footage, etc.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase the Live Scarecrow Tour DVD if it's ever released. For now, there is no real reason to purchase this CD+DVD version of The Scarecrow - but you do need to purchase SOME version, folks. The title track alone is worth the dime.
142312166X|4.0|Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Demigod Files, by Rick Riordan<br /><br />\\"The Demigod Files\\" is a cute little book, perfect for younger fans of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. There are three short stories, interviews with a few campers, color pictures of the main characters, and a crossword and word search.<br /><br />I say this is perfect for younger readers mainly because it is short, and the content beside the short stories didn't really catch my attention. The three short stories are gems, though.<br /><br />The first, \\"Percy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot,\\" features Percy and Clarisse, as he helps the daughter of Ares retrieve the war god's hijacked chariot.  The second, \\"Percy Jackson and the Bronze Dragon,\\" is about a very dangerous game of capture the flag, complete with gigantic ants. And the third, \\"Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades,\\" reunites Percy, Thalia, and Nico for an Underworld adventure. The stories all have that \\"Percy\\" feel, and I really enjoyed each one. They reminded me of my love for the series - I want to read all the Percy books again now!<br /><br />My only complaint about \\"The Demigod Files\\" is that it's far too short, but it was intended to fill in the gap between \\"The Battle for the Labyrinth\\" and \\"The Last Olympian.\\" I also would have liked the illustration of Annabeth's trunk to be in color, as I found it hard to see all the details in black and white.<br /><br />4/5.

B000021Y77|5.0|I have not watched a lot of foreign films so I thought I'd grab Run Lola, Run.  It's a surreal film in a lot of ways.  Even before we get to the star crossed lovers who get in over their heads with a fencing mob operation, the film wobbles through crowds of people asking about Man, the way he questions, the answers leading to more questions, in a circular philosophy.<br /><br />The camera focuses on a few of the people who will later play larger roles later in the film.  Finally, a security guard says \\"Scheisse\\" happens and kicks a soccer ball high in the air!<br /><br />We fly with the ball, and then come down to Lola's world.  As you've read in other reviews and synopses, it's basically about Lola's boyfriend, who explains that during a fencing operation with some diamonds, he sold the diamonds to a fence for 100,000 Marks, and now he only has twenty minutes before meeting the mob boss who will kill Manni (her boyfriend) when the boss finds out Manni lost the money on the subway.<br /><br />\\"And it's all your fault for being late!\\" he yells at her which was really not fair, being the irresponsible dork that he really is.  But I digress!<br /><br />Hitchcock has always said that rather than having a bunch of talking heads in a film, that one should use the cinema as a way of communicating (or words to that effect) and Lola definitely delivers.<br /><br />First, Lola actually has a power or two.  First, she can run for miles without being hardly out of breath.  And two, she can scream with such intensity that she can break glass.<br /><br />There are actually three scenarios or 20 minute clips that show the various fates of Lola and the people she runs across.<br /><br />In the first one, she screams and shatters mirrors!  Then she throws the phone up in the air and it lands flawlessly on the phone cradle.  Then she runs!  There is some animation in here too as well as some cool electronic music to keep us moving.  A few seconds difference in running into a neighbor's dog makes a woman who was delayed by this now win the lottery.  Makes a bike thief become a bum.  And so on!<br /><br />Manni wants to rob a store to get the money.  Lola fails with her cheating father and helps Manni rob the store.  She comes to a bad end.<br /><br />In the second one, much as the first, she throws the phone into the air, lands flawlessly on the cradle, but this time (to make a long story short) Manni meets an untimely fate.<br /><br />In the third one, when all parties are more or less behaving themselves and are doing good for others, things turn out the best.  At least for Lola and Manni.<br /><br />The DVD has French and English subtitles if you want, as well as voice-over English and French.  I chose the English and it went quite smoothly.<br /><br />Interesting too that the credits roll UP as opposed to American films rolling down.  Wild stuff.  Understandable why this film won the Audience Award at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.<br /><br />So run, do not walk, to your favorite DVD store and pick this up!<br /><br />Other Franka Potente (Lola) Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005U8EN The Princess and the Warrior]]<br />[[ASIN:B000BQ5J8G Creep]]<br />[[ASIN:B002ZHKZCO Bourne Identity (Single-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]'s dog makes a woman who was delayed by this now win the lottery.

Quite possibly a little bit of both, but what comes through chapter after chapter is that he is an inspirational business leader that has a different way of approaching business.It also talks about the mistakes he and the business has made and what the lessons they learned were.    For me this is a brilliant book for anyone with a entrepreneurial streak in them or anyone who is looking for inspiration for improving the culture of the company that they work in. Highly recommended.

B00003CXCW|3.0|While I am grateful for the extras like the features on Edith Head, Franz Waxman, and the making of Sunset Boulevard. Two things bothered me about my DVD. First, I wanted to watch it with French subtitles. It started out okay but it stopped. Not that I had a problem with it. Second problem was the volume. I had to turn it up so high on my television.    Apart from my two problems and I deducted two stars from a five star review, I loved the film. I loved the characters of Norma Desmond, Max, Joe Gillis, and Betty Schaefer. They don't make films like this anymore. Billy Wilder who wrote, produced, and directed this film was a genius. Gloria Swanson's performance as Norma Desmond is just irresistible. She commands the attention and rightfully so. She brings out Norma Desmond as both a tragic and comic figure and a talented performer. The wonderful Edith Head designed the costumes. Franz Waxman composed the music.    This isn't just a film but a masterpiece of art! Sadly, I'm putting the newer edition on my wishlist. I was glad to see Nancy Olson who played Betty Schaefer appear on the making of Sunset Boulevard documentary. Unlike most DVDs, this DVD did show the extras including a map of Hollywood with points to the addresses. There was the original script pages available about the film's beginning as well.     This film was controversial in Hollywood for it's depiction of life in tinsel-town. Norma Desmond was huge with an ego to match but she was discarded when she was only 30 years old. Still true in Hollywood today, Norma was seeking a return not comeback to the silver screen where she felt at home.
B002QSTTOM|5.0|This was a gift for my young cousin who was graduating from high school. Serendipitously, one of her teachers had just been talking about the book to her. I read my copy that I've had since I was in high school about every five years (I'm 56 now). It reminds me why life is worth living even when hard times come and makes me savor the good times all that much more. Viktor Frankl's life was indicative of his philosophy. It is a simply written book with an extremely powerful message. This seems like a particularly nice edition.
0446563048|5.0|I was honored and excited when the good folks at Zappos sent me free advanced copies of CEO Tony Hsieh's new book Delivering Happiness - A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose to review.  I have been a completely satisfied customer of Zappos (major online shoe and clothing commerce company) for quite a few years.  I previously read of the uniquely people-pleasant, family culture that Hsieh creates for his employees and was curious about his philosophies.  Hsieh's new book sets out to reveal how this young executive created such a phenomenal success - not only is the online retailer achieving over $1 billion in merchandise sales each year but it is one of Fortune magazine's top companies to work for.  From my experience, the company's success certainly shines through every single time I talk to a customer service representative . . . Zappos has the only service department in which patrons can actually hear representatives' smiles over the phone.    Delivering Happiness is NOT another quick how-to-improve-your-business book.  This book reveals secrets and ideas about (as the sub-title hints) increasing profits, igniting passion, and identifying purpose in personal life as well as work.  Anyone looking to create or build upon current business or personal goals would benefit from this book.  Through Hsieh's anecdotes and quirky thought-processes, the reader gets into the head of someone who's been there, someone who's taken a dream and turned it into reality.    Hsieh begins by illustrating his work experiences - from grade school worm selling to creating and selling study guides in college to his first major success with co-founding LinkExchange - an internet advertising cooperative.  He provides snippets from old letters, journal-like recollections and lists that illustrate the thinking behind the success.       You know you are in the right field when you go to work and it doesn't feel like work; that's the impression I get of the Zappos employees' attitudes towardtheir jobs.  Hsieh intriguingly reveals how he brought the company from start-up to last year's acquisition by Amazon valued at over $1.2 billion.  Some interesting strategies along the way include creating a company \\"culture\\" book, a very interactive weekly employee newsletter, and the WOW factor (a new verb part of the company's everyday vocabulary!).    Read this book and some of that WOW factor just may rub off into your own way of thinking.  Indeed, the 10 core values of the Zappos culture apply to conducting life along with conducting a business . . . you may be surprised what some of those 10 values are!     **These are my honest opinions after reading this book!!  Grading Girl gives Tony Hsieh an A+ for unabashedly honest thoughts, unique ways of looking at the world of work, and a frankly fun read!**
1439153663|5.0|The book was incredible.  I suffered from lack of sleep during the week I read this book because I couldn't put it down and read well into the night.  This book is extremely detailed and gives a visible picture of every character, piece of clothing, home, and conflict. Loved every page!!!
0446563048|4.0|In Delivering Happiness, Tony Hsieh shows you what it would be like if a kid ran the world--a smart kid. Reading his book is like being on a rollercoaster ride. Half of me thinks, \\"How is this guy not completely broke?\\" and the other half marvels at his dedication and pure genius and sees exactly why he is so successful. His story made me laugh out loud at times and shake my head in wonder at other times. Most of all, for me, it delivered inspiration.     It's inspiring to see that a CEO can run a company based on real values, not boilerplate ones that are made for show. In a time where more and more companies take advantage of their employees, who work in fear of losing their job in a bad economy, it's refreshing to see a company that gets it right. And it's proof that you don't have to do things the way everyone else does to be successful.     At the start of the book when Tony said he insisted on writing the book himself, I rolled my eyes and braced myself. As a writer, I was skeptical. But it couldn't have been written by anyone else. Once you read the book, you'll see why. Tony is genuine and didn't want one word to sound like it didn't come from him. Except for a few spots of awkward writing and redundancy--and an ending that while matching his intention, strays from the path--the book is written well. And it's a fast, informative and entertaining read. Cynical people might not like the book. Positive quotes appear throughout and Tony can lay the happiness stuff on a little thick at times. But that is the point.     Tony Hsieh is an idealist, a venture capitalist, a realist, an adventurist, an entrepreneur, and now an author. Most of all, he's a fearless humanist. That is what makes him and this book special.
B003ELOQD4|5.0|I was at this show and I am so glad it was put to film. I was shocked to see all the negative reviews of the Blu-Ray editon. I am a little disapointed they didn't start the film from the Bowie song Ground Control to Majior Tom from David Bowie when U2 entered the staadium into Breathe. Other then that I truely enjoyed watching the show again and again. Anybody that enjoys live music, especially from the best live band in the world will love this film. The stage is unbelievable and it's cool to see it from all angels in and outside the Rose Bowl. Buy this vid and you will be truely happy....no doubt in my mind

0446563048|4.0|Cowboy up! The Idiots. Tessie. Pink hats. Red Sox Nation. These mottos have defined the relationship between the Boston Red Sox and their fans. A relationship that has had its share of highs and lows, taking the fans and the team to new places in ways neither party thought could be possible. For better or worse, the Red Sox are more than a baseball team theses days. They are a well-oiled baseball machine, a culture, and a corporation with essentially one goal: keeping the fans happy.    A Tale of Two Industries    In Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion and Purpose, Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos takes readers on a journey through his life and the experiences that brought him to the online shoe store [...] as well as the philosophies that guided the company from the Internet boom of the late 90s to its successful sale to Amazon in 2009. (Full disclosure, I received an advanced copy free of charge). As he guided Zappos from scrappy startup to household name, Hsieh (pronounced Shay) realized that business success wasn't just about sales and product and personnel. These are all important, but having a unified company culture and a focus beyond just staying in business and profitability is just as essential to a company's success.    Customer service is the central pillar of Zappos' business strategy. At one point, Hsieh suggests that service is to Zappos what hip and cool is to the Virgin brand. A bold statement to be sure. Their goal is to create a \\"WOW\\" experience in every customer interaction. From surprise overnight shipping to knowledgeable and friendly staff to a phone number that is heavily advertised - they want you call so they can help. The Zappos model is to be front facing and friendly, like a bear hug for each customer.    Bringing a World Series to Boston was only part of the plan for John Henry. Having Janet Marie Smith on board as Fenway's chief architect, Henry set his sights on improving the entire ballpark experience. With the addition of theMonster seats, renovations to the inside and outside of the park, and a dedication to the farm system and free agent signings, which have yielded more hits than misses, the Red Sox build their brand on being fan and family friendly. Fenway Park is more than a place to watch a good baseball team, it is, partly with the help of a good marketing team, \\"America's most beloved ballpark.\\" Even the food selections aim to please; how many restaurants can offer veggie burgers and dogs as well as steak burritos in addition to the host of traditional ballpark munchies?    In terms of their employment strategies, Zappos and the Red Sox are amazingly similar. Just like the farm system, Zappos has a \\"pipeline...filled for every department...anytime a single individual ;eaves he company...there will always be someone right in front of him and someone right behind him in the pipeline to take over his responsibilities.\\" Sounds an awful lot like Theo's `$[...] million dollar development machine.'    But Don't Take My Word For It    If you are looking a book that is part autobiography, part entrepreneur handbook check out Delivering Happiness. Anyone who grew up fascinated by those ads for vacuum hovercraft kits will see a lot of themselves in Tony's stories. As for Zappos itself, their focus on customer service has created a following that would be right at home singing \\"you know we couldn't live without you\\" about their `team.'
B0039TD7PY|5.0|truly wonderful, beautifully recorded and the picture it's fantastic   the magic is there forever
B0035G9ABQ|2.0|I'll be honest, the 2nd star I've given this release is me being polite. I thought Gorillaz, Demon Days, G-Sides & even D-Sides were great. Nothing really caught my attention for long here. The whole thing is flat. I'm afraid without Danger Mouse, Dan The Automator or the many previous guest musicians/talent the Gorillaz just don't have the atmosphere or the beats. I would recommend getting \\"Broken Bells\\" ( Danger Mouse & James Mercer ) you'll get more of a Gorillaz fix out of that release than here. You too will see how important Danger Mouses' input was on some of the previous Gorillaz releases. Plastic Beach for me is a BIG disapointment.
0446563048|4.0|\\"Envision, create, and believe in your own universe, and the universe will form around you.\\"<br /><br />Early on, someone actually said that to Tony Hsieh and it appears that's just what he did with Zappos - a company that owes both it's survival and growth to his philosophy surrounding company culture. In his words...<br /><br />\\"To keep our culture strong, we wanted to make sure that we only hired people who we would also enjoy hanging out with outside the office.\\"<br /><br />Interesting idea, huh?<br /><br />This past month, I had the opportunity to read an advance copy of Delivering Happiness: A Path To Profits, Passion, And Purpose, by [...] CEO, Tony Hsieh (Amazon link). Overall, it was a quick and fun read, though at times a little disorganized and chaotic - skipping from childhood businesses to poker playing to internal Zappos e-mails, employees chiming in with their take on Zappos company milestones.<br /><br />That said, Delivering Happiness is definitely not your typical how-to business book, and after reading it and learning a bit about Mr. Hsieh, I believe that was the goal right from the start. Zappos didn't conform to an existing template when building their business and this book does a great job of reflecting that and capturing the famous \\"powered by service\\" culture that Hsieh and Zappos have become famous for.<br /><br />Written in a very candid style, at 244 pages, the book reads more like a memoir of Tony Hsieh though his early career - though remember: he's only 35. Besides his Harvard background and entrepreneurial spirit, his youth seems to have served him well in his role as CEO, as the book outlines some risks taken that other, \\"more experienced\\", CEOs may not have considered and a strong focus on company culture, having fun and enjoying what you do.<br /><br />Much can be learned for how Zappos got through the rough, early stages of its existence and how they continued to grow and be as successful as they are today and this book does a great job of telling that story.

0446563048|4.0|The promoter sent me a couple of advance copies of Delivering Happiness ([..]) by Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos, and asked me to write \\"an honest review.\\"    The request alone made me happy.  There is so much horrible writing out there, and it's so much fun to criticize.  I was really hoping to hate this book.    Unfortunately, I liked it.  You take a shine to Tony as a kid, and come to admire the selfless, tireless leader as an adult.  Though I've never sold a company for $265M, as he did with LinkExchange, or gambled it all for a chance to sell another company for $1.2B, as he did with Zappos, I feel like I did.  I feel like we did it together.  His story-telling is that good.    But the real value, and the reason I'd recommend the book to business folks, is Chapter 5.  There you get 70+ pages on how to move your business forward with Zappos' structured \\"Pipeline\\" for connecting customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction.  It makes sense.  Everyone gets happier the happier they make others.    Everyone, that is, but Tony.  His happiness is temporary.  He's thrilled at the moment of conquest, or \\"checking it off the list,\\" like the time he risked his life on Mt. Kilimanjaro, an important experience, for sure.  But he doesn't seem to experience the other kind of happiness.  The sustainable kind.  Intimacy.    It's a business book, not a romance; I get it.  But as a man, Tony seems to have no interest in that stuff.  No wife, no kid, no dog, no prospects.  He's so busy working, no one really gets close, and in the end, you feel that this amazingly successful, super positive businessman is unfulfilled personally.  Which is a bummer.  You love him too much to see him to fail now.  Yet all you can do is close the book and hope it turns out that Delivering Happiness is only half the story.  Maybe the title of his next book will be Receiving Happiness.    If so, on that day, I will give an honest review.  I'll stand up with tears in my eyes and cheer.    (Read my blog at[..])
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I honestly can't say I remember all the original music that was featured in the Daria Series, after all, I was around 40 at the time. It was the characters and dialog that I fell in love with. I was not disappointed with this DVD set. The music they put in it's place was a bit generic but I didn't mind it at all. Watching the whole thing in the proper sequence was a treat since I didn't experience it that way the first time. If the sales of this release allows them to acquire the original music and re-release it, I would buy it again.
0446563048|5.0|My review will be simple and to the point, not a comprehensive Cliff's Notes version that I've seen floating around from others. The whole point is to get you to read the book.

It's about innovative thinking, not being afraid to fail, and having fun in your career.    It's about culture, people, and ultimately customer service. We all have customers.

They weren't even listed the previous year.    Zappos has created a culture of their own, taking customer service to the next level.

B002ZTQVGQ|2.0|I am a big fan of  anime, and I consider Hayao Miyazaki to be a genius. That is why it pains me to not rate this film higher.  I didn't really like the characters or care about the story that much. I guess it is because the story was geared for a younger audience. But Spirited Away was made for a younger audience, and I thought it was fantastic it is one of my all time favorites. And I don't know if it is because he is getting older, but the animation didn't look as sharp as say Howl's Moving Castle, or Kiki's Delivery Service which are all fantastic films by the way. Once again let me say I am the biggest fan of Hayao Miyazaki, and I would highly recommend any of his other films just not this one.
0670034711|4.0|Reading a lot of these reviews I detect more than a little JEALOUSLY AND ENVY. I admit when I first started reading this book I felt a bit of it as well. However, once I got the section on prayer, the book was very moving and actually made me think a lot about God/the infinite/the universe.    So stop whining. No one made you read the book. Are you so self-centered and judgemental that you can't appreciate another's personality and quirky charm? Yes she is self-centered. And yes, many of us are SPAZZES. What's wrong with people these days???? So much anger. Perhaps halting your holier-than-thou attitude might help some. Sure most of us can't all afford to travel for a year and look for our authentic selves. But don't be so peevish about it.
0061914177|3.0|Book was inspiring but not completely accurate in a couple of things. Lacked enough information in some areas. Book needed more detailed examples of how people became successful using the methods he promotes. Extreme conciseness is good for newspaper articles, but not for books that promise \\"how to\\" techniques. I definitely would recommend the book as an inspiration to get started but with the caution not to count on it as a true \\"how to\\" book.

There is no chapter that gives you a series of training schedules to choose from. It's about the length and size of a college economics textbook - NOT what I needed.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I will say that when this show first came out, I wasn't very interested in seeing a story pan out that was about a serial killer.  But, I finally sat down and rented the show.<br /><br />I was immediately addicted.<br /><br />\\"Dexter\\" follows the life of one Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood-splatter analyst for the Miami police department...at least that's what he does during the day.  Dexter's position with the police gives him the opportunity to do his night job.  That is, to hunt down murderers who got off on some sort of technicality...and kill them.<br /><br />This show leaves you torn between two reactions.  The moral side of you is saying, \\"This guy's a serial killer and you shouldn't be rooting for him.\\"  But, then there's the other side of you that is saying, \\"But, he's only killing bad people.  People who have killed other people.\\"<br /><br />This show is just plain amazing. And I was so happy when Michael C. Hall FINALLY won a Golden Globe (2010) for his role as Dexter.  Definitly worth checking out at least.  You may be surprised.

You also get to realise the sheer level of ingenuity, verve and nerve he possesses [ ... check out how he skived off music practice to read `Boy's Life' for example at an early age or his successful crowdsourcing technique for getting through his Bible class exam at Harvard! ].    You also quickly begin to get a very strong sense indeed that you have come across a business book that is far from dry and fusty and far more like one of those fast-paced novels you can never put down. Perhaps this is because the tale is both gripping and entertaining, spoken in the ever-present authentic, passionate - and non-ghostwritten! - voice of Tony Hsieh.    \\"... I wanted the writing to reflect how I would normally talk, and partly just to annoy all my high school English teachers (who I appreciate dearly)\\"    Very soon you find you have romped through Tony's entreprenuerial pizza empire days at Harvard and moved on to how he came to found his first empire LinkExchange. Fairly soon after that you get to understand how he then sold it two years later to Microsoft for the not insignificant sum of $265 billion and then set up VentureFrogs, an investment fund and incubator. Already, the story so far is incredibly impressive and yet you know you haven't even got on to the beginnings of Zappos and the service concept around `delivering happiness'.         With Zappos, it's clear that Tony Hsieh's path to his ultimate and current day CEO position was entirely driven by his restless, entrepreneurial spirit. He could easily have chosen to sit comfortably on the sidelines and dabble successfully in start-up investments for the rest of his working life. And he did start out doing just that after LinkExchange. His entrepreneurial spirit, as it turned out, had other ideas, further influenced by the lessons he learned after an intensive post-LinkExchange bout at the poker tables. \\"It was time for him to change tables\\" he realised. The alternative for Tony would have been to remain forever unfulfilled by dint of sheer inertia and the frustration of sitting on the sidelines.    \\"I wanted to prove to the world that I could do it again ....so I decided to take off my investor hat and put on my entrepreneur hat again\\"    The next few chapters of the book get down to the very real business challenges and hairy moments that Tony and the Zappos team had to handle as they faced operational challenges, cultural upsets, economic downturns, reluctant investors and strategic disagreements and misalignments at board level. It becomes clear that the Zappos success story has been no easy ride and the ultimate denouement of the Zappos tale - its `definitive agreement' sale to Amazon for $1.2 billion in late 2009 - is due entirely to Tony's force of character, and extraordinary passion for customer service and strong cultural values.    The Zappos chapters are well worth re-reading several times to glean the valuable business lessons that Tony has to impart. Check out the Culture Book concept [which looks to be well worth any company investing time in producing their own bespoke versions] and the Top 10 Core Values in particular. Here's the Top 3 Values. Each one gives some indication of how Zappos reached its current level of success! :    Core Value No 1 : Deliver WOW through Service  Core Value No 2: Embrace and drive Change  Core Value No 3 : Create Fun and a little Weirdness    Once you understand Tony Hsieh's sheer passion and innate understanding of the power of aligned cultural values and outstanding customer service - andhow it can drive business success - you realise the importance of the last chapter aptly entitled `End Game'. In this chapter, Tony challenges you to open up to his challenge to do some thinking about `What is Your Goal in Life' - and open your mind to what he has to say about the `happiness factor' in customer service and why Zappos' ultimate vision and purpose is `about delivering happiness to the world'.    The best way I can sum up the book is to cheat and refer to Chip Conley's own summation of the book in his recent review of the book.    \\"Keep an eye out for Delivering Happiness because there's no better example of how an engaged company culture creates a brand reputation that can lead to a billion dollar business\\" Chip Conley    One thing is very clear. Tony's Zappos journey has taken him a long, long, way on way from his early failings with the worm farm! And, what's also clear, that while his is not the end of the Zappos story, it is definitely the beginning of Tony Hsieh's `Delivering Happiness' movement in the widest sense.

0446569895|5.0|I recommend this book for hard-core Ozzy fans and/or those wondering how this man is still alive considering how he's taken every drug and booze available to man (and then some) while those who simply experiment a few times are dead or a vegetable.  If anything, this book reiterates the fact that life is not fair.  There is no way that someone could abuse substances like he has and still be alive.  Like one of the doctors he had once said, \\"how are you still alive?\\"  The book might need a disclaimer:  \\"Kids, don't try this at home.\\" Seriously.    Ozzy is genuine, honest, and humorous - those are the main strengths of the book.  I have compassion for him (in spite of his being a \\"arsehole\\" - which he freely admits many times over in the book) because he has a host of behavioral and learning difficulties  - things that were never diagnosed until well into his adulthood.  He apologizes to the people he's hurt along the way, he apologizes for his pride/ego, basically he's \\"grown-up\\" but has taken the long way home to do it.  He IS a music genuius, there is no doubt about that. He's been misunderstood, that's true too.      The book was not disappointing, although to me (personally) it was very intense on the whole booze, drugs and sex part. All of it is on so much \\"overload\\" that you quickly become disensitized to all of that and just gloss through it when reading. It's like \\"what else is new\\" and you move on to reading the rest of the story.  Overall, it's a good read, it's basically a read about a man who overcame his \\"lot in life\\", his \\"station in life\\" so you have to give him credit for that, but he did some pretty disgusting, vile, and just plain insane things alone the way.  That's just his story, pretty or not.

B003JTHRQO|5.0|I wish this book had been around and found it's way into my hands when I was 20.  Chapters 10 and 11 hit me like a TON OF BRICKS.  Heck, for that matter, the entire book did.  Young people, please read this book.  It will save you a lot of heartache and misery in the area of dating and relationships, no doubt.  The contents of this book made clear to me, in stark detail, all of the mistakes I made in the past.  So much I could have done differently, so much that might be different now.  Knowing these things would have prevented me from aimlessly wandering from so-called relationship to so-called relationship over the years.  You will view past relationships through an entirely new prism, and will have the tools to truly love in the present and future.  It will no doubt be painful for you if you read this right after a failed relationship, as it was for me.  Before reading, I tried to remember to read it looking forward, not back, but that proved to be very difficult.  However, it was a process that needed to happen in order for me to grow and learn.  You may find a good portion of this book's content to be something that deep down you probably have always known, but either haven't thought about for a long time or lost somewhere along the way.  Read this and wander no more.  As another reviewer said so well, it truly does prepare you to love.  I know I have pleaded with young people, but any single adult would be incredibly served by reading this book.  Thank you for writing this, Gary Chapman.  I am in debt to you.

0547258305|4.0|Surprisingly engrossing story. Despite what others have said I did find Katsa to be a likeable character. She was simply a product of her environment. Yes, there is violence and some racy scenes. Since I am not a teen I didn't find anything wrong with that. Even if I had kids I would let them read this. The love story was very sweet and I was glad of the happy ending. I am looking foward to reading the next book.

1400082773|4.0|This is on the whole a very interesting book. When it was first published it was not such a big seller as it is now, as clearly people are now really curious about the background of the first black president of the USA.    In many ways President Obama's background is very appropriate to the head if the USA, which has often been called the melting-pot, into which all different cultures and nationalities come together; the result is the unique American. Perhaps more than any of the ordinary American's the President's background is  very varied, both culturally and geographically. This must make it possible for him to relate to the ne3eds, the desires and aspirations of all Americans.    This is a good read because you get the feeling that he is being very honest about his life, his earlier work whereby he began to formulate his idea of change and political philosophy he adopted.    There is some imbalance in the book. There is very little about Michelle; but this may be deliberate. There is perhaphs too much detail about his relatives in Kenya. After sometime the reader gets lost in all the different names and connections. It was obviously important to the President, but perhaps a little boring for the reader.    I wanted to know a lot more about the development of his thoughts on race. When he took his white friends to a party, and politely they left early- what did he make of that? In many ways we can see he is telling us what he is thinking and experiencing, but I think we would have liked a little more about the conclusions he reached about race.     The book helps us to reflect upon and understand how the world is changing.

B002SJIO5E|4.0|\\"District 9\\" is a remarkable film from a first-time director. It is so thoroughly professional and /assured/, from beginning to end, that it looks as if it's the work of someone with a lot more experience.<br /><br />It's such a finely crafted and rousing piece of movie-making that I was reluctant to give it only four stars. But I had to, because of serious plot and script problems. Even while you're watching, you're all-too-aware that none of it makes any sense. Why are the aliens unable to leave at the beginning, but suddenly able to do so at the end? Why does Christopher spend 20 years accumulating \\"fuel\\" to power the shuttle, then suddenly be able to move the mother ship by remote control and use a tractor beam to enter the ship? Why does the \\"fuel\\" cause Wikus to mutate (other than to make him the p[r]awn of MNU and the Nigerians)? Most of all, why were the aliens taken from the ship before anyone determined whether they could have been helped /without/ removing them?<br /><br />I'm often criticized for being overly rational (see my \\"Up!\\" review) -- \\"It's only a movie!\\". But I expect writers to think things through, rather than using whatever pops into their heads. The writers -- one of whom is the director -- supposedly came up with a dozen possible storylines. Peter Jackson apparently didn't bother to tell them that this one had Queen-Mary-sized holes in it.<br /><br />\\"District 9\\" is ultimately a drama (though a shallow and not well-developed one) about beings alien to each other learning a degree of trust and respect. It's a modest success on that level, despite failing to tell us much about the aliens' psychology and motivations. It /could/ have been a better film -- though it would have been even darker and more pessimistic than it is.<br /><br />The Blu-ray's image quality is exceptional. Most (if not all) of \\"District 9\\" was shot on Sony and RED equipment. Though the BD looks like film, I suspect it's the composite digital \\"negative\\", graded to look like motion-picture film. It is of absolute demo quality.absolute demo quality.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|[some time ago] This is just a couple of discs in a box. No extras of any kind, just the movie. If you're one of those people who really likes special editions of things, skip this.    Why purchase the DVD version when it's included for free with the Blu disc? [hand on chin]    [revision] So now they have a new release with all the ridiculous extras. Personally, I don't care to partake of such intense fanaticism. I can't be the only one still satisfied with the original Blu/DVD combo release...
B001C09KD0|1.0|Don't waste your time in this book thinking you will find something to fill a void you have in your life. This woman's retelling of her \\"spiritual\\" experiences and everything else is nothing but childish and narcissistic. She likes to conform GOD to a box, not realizing that GOD is bigger than she is and that HIS thoughts are higher that hers.    I can't believe that people love this book. It's absoluteness worthless. Once she comes off this honeymoon she's in with her gross narcissism she's going to be back at square one realizing she didn't find anything at all and that she has lead thousands if not millions astray with her book.    You want to find God? Get a Bible.    Jesus said to them, \\"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father [GOD] except through me.\\" - John 14:6
0439023491|4.0|WOW!! I'm totally hooked on this series. Catching Fire goes more in depth into who the people of the Capitol truly are and the constraints in which they live. I felt that the story repeated itself in certain parts but overall, it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I LOVE and HATE the ending... Collins left me with so many questions. What's going to happen to Katniss, will Peeta be rescued? No one knows, AAAHHH!! I truly can't wait for Mockingjay to be released and all my questions can get answered. I'm team Peeta all the way!! :)
B003ELOQD4|2.0|The editing is such that you will get a headache if you watch it too long. No shot is stationary everything is panning around the entire time and when it isn't it is a montage of multiple angles. Then no shot lasts for longer than one or two seconds. It is best to just listen to it and not watch. I had watched it on youtube the night when it was live and I can't remember it jumping around so much.  I did manage to catch the tour when it was near me. I had expensive seats that where behind the stage. I left feeling very disappointed that I pretty much only got to see the backs of their heads for the entire show. I had gone in thinking I had great seats since they where so close, how wrong I was. Sooo if you are planning to get to one of the future shows, don't bother buying seats in the back because the only thing 360 about the show is the video board.  Long time fan here.   I was at the Joshua Tree show at RFK in DC. Been to many other shows even multiple times on the same U2 tour. I am pretty sure the 360 will be my last.
0446563048|4.0|Tony describes to us his life up until present-day and the challenges he's faced in finding meaning to the projects and tasks he's taken on.    In his childhood he was always figuring out different ways he could make money. Fast forward to him graduating college, he has a job most people would be happy with. One that's comfortable, easy, and a good income.    However, boredom ensued leading him to work on a side project. Similar to his childhood ventures, he was creating something. This is how much of the book unfolds.    We see many of the difficulties he faced and how he tackled them. While the company is very successful now, it was hardly like that before.    This is what creates the book, how he approached these problems The decisions he made serve to enlighten us in interacting with people ourselves.    Pros  The book is a light read and easy to get caught up in. At 240 pages, it took me two and half weeks to finish.    More importantly though, next school year I'm president of a nonprofit organization and this is exactly what I needed to get a better idea of things I should be doing myself.    It's practical, it makes sense, and I saw a lot of these qualities in our last president.    Cons  I don't think this book is for everyone. I think individuals who simply want to be an employee somewhere with just enough money for the essentials and certain luxuries won't care much for it.    Although, it's a great book to better interact with people.    All in all, I enjoyed it.    I finished up my 3rd year of college and related to everything up to Tony's college years since that's what I've gone through myself. I'm sure in the years to come, a lot of the post-grad things Tony did will hit me.

030726999X|3.0|For a story line covering three books and the length of the 3rd (it took me two and a half weeks to finish) and with such an excellent build up- the ending failed to impress as it was almost like a predictable fairytale. Still the book is very well written and the complex plot keeps the reader concentration. Some really interesting bad guy characters were opened on but never fully developed. Quite frankly I was expecting the book to be darker than the 'Girl who played with fire'- but it sadly turned into a bit less believable happier story :(
6303593135|5.0|Jump-cuts,abrasive dialogue,panning shots,the use of real locations filmed on the run,recalls the moment of A bout de soufflé,50 years ago this month.Starring Jean-Paul Belmondo,a handsome broken-nosed actor and the iconic Jean Seberg,protégé of Otto Preminger.Its director,Jean-Luc Godard,was part of the nouvelle vague,including Truffaut, Melville,Chabrol,Rivette and Rhomer.This was Godard's debut-formerly a Cahiera du Cinema critic-,still looking so fresh and modern,the epitome of cinematic invention, vitality and cool.Shot in high contrast monochrome,rapidly edited, interspersed with quotations from literature,art and philosophy.Belmondo plays the Bogart-imitating Michel,the swaggering,mysoginistic petty criminal anti-hero,who steals a car in the south of France and kills a policeman on the road to Paris,where he takes up with an old girl friend,the well-healed Patricia(Seberg),the young,New York Herald Tribune-selling American in Paris.     Chabrol,who served as supervising producer on `Breathless',famously warned that great subjects rarely make great films.And Godard gnomically said:\\"All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl.\\"This was the basis of the brief scenario that Truffaut,an admirer of film noire and pulp fiction,provided for Breathless.The couple talk of lifeand literature in a seedy hotel,make love and visit the movies while he tries to get money owed to him by criminal associates.The police close in,Patricia betrays him.The style is everything,a calculated destruction and remaking of traditional film grammar.The camera is hand-held,the editing is abrupt and inconsistent.Raoul Coutard's masterly monochrome photography is harsh,hard-edged,reliant on natural light.Melville,director of existential gangster pictures,makes an appearance as himself,the first of such cameos in a Godard picture.He evokes other directors,Fuller,Preminger,Aldrich and Bogart's image looms.We are kept at a distance by Brecht's alienation effect,told that we are watching a film,but also that movies,like our lives are halls of mirrors.Godard deliberately created confusion to `achieve a greater possibility of invention',shooting in the busy streets of Paris.This film,like 400 Blows,is a must-see for any true lovers of cinema.In cinemas this June and DVD in September by Optimum Releasing

The video portion was O.K., but the band is way overdue for a greatest hits collection that is produced by someone with a little bit of imagination.

B002NPUCIA|5.0|This type of DVD/CD is what I, as a musician, would like to see. It's always great to watch the interaction and interplay between the musicians which often gets lost when simply listening to an audio CD.     Try watching the song \\"Do you really love me\\" on the DVD and later listen to it again on the audio CD. Even though it is exactly the same recording, the audio-only version doesn't sound as funky. (Eric D you the bomb, man!)    And as a bonus, you get so many great musicians all in one CD: Eric Marienthal, Michael Lington, Dave Koz, Eric Darius, R Parker Jr etc.    Great idea, Brian.

B002IDDRT8|3.0|The movie is fine, the amazon viewing experience was miserable.  It took three hours to watch the two hour movie, with the player stopping every few minutes in the middle of the action and at every other opportunity.<br /><br />Having selected &quot;view it now&quot;, the player blocked us from downloading the movie and so we had no solution to the problem.<br /><br />We also once bought a movie from amazon. I thought i was buying a copy of the movie for the kids to watch in the car.  But nothing could have been further from the truth.  You cannot burn it to dvd and you cannot watch it without an internet connection.<br /><br />In my opinion, the paranoid approach to protecting the material produces a service that is utterly unuseable, and frustrating in its stupidity.<br /><br />I think it is more practical to go to a blockbuster or a walmart and buy or rent the dvd.  you will have a better viewing experience, you can watch it whenever you want on whatever device you want, and without having to having to get permission from amazon to watch the movie you theoretically already paid to own or rent.<br /><br />My advice, don't do it!  Go to your local video outlet.
0434019259|4.0|I'm always on the hunt for a new mystery writer and Don Winslow is my latest find. Part of what I think of as the California noir set of writers (James Ellroy, Robert Crais, Charlie Huston, Seth Harwood, etc.) Winslow is probably my new favorite. This is the sequel to \\"The Dawn Patrol\\" and probably not the last Boone Daniels novel. Hope not, anyway. It, like many of his other books, is essentially about the dusk of the California Golden Age and the transition into a new California that is better in some ways and worse in others. The phrase that keeps popping up in my mind as I write this is \\"Surf Western,\\" as this is novel is essentially \\"Shane\\" with surf bums, skinheads, lawyers and cops. Great descriptions, memorable characters that seem more than a little plausible, smooth dialogue and plenty of action. The one criticism I would make is that, at times, like any great story teller Mr. Winslow can meander and spend what some would call a little too much time on a tangent (this is especially true of another of his novels, \\"The Winter of Frankie Machine\\"). However, the tangents always relate to the story being told in some way and I often found myself wishing to know more about the tangent storyline! That's proof that Winslow is a strong, interesting story teller. If you haven't read \\"Dawn Patrol,\\" check it out first as you will have a much better grasp of what Boone and the Dawn Patrol are and what they stand for. You'll also have a good grasp of Winslow's idea of the California Golden Age. Highly recommend anything by Winslow (except that \\"Bobby Z\\" movie; it's not terrible, but the book is 100% better).
B00000F14B|5.0|A timeless family film that has great music, (much of the same music you hear on Main Street in Walt Disney World).  Recommended highly!  Loads of good, clean fun.  (My shipment arrived early and in perfect condition also).
0446563048|5.0|I've always made an effort to follow retail business news just because it combines two of my favorite things. At Lehigh (and I'm sure every other university) there are always those select cases or companies that YOU ALWAYS talk about in business class. From accounting to management to marketing, one of these companies is always a talking point: Walmart, Target, Amazon, Disney, Merck... and now more recently Apple, Google and NetFlix. Honestly, it's like every professors \\"fall back\\" topic.    Slowly but surely Zappos is creeping on that \\"list of companies that professors talk about to show examples of business things.\\" Their specialty is their culture and is a model for entrepreneurs and companies to learn, achieve and grow from.    Zappos' CEO Tony Hsieh's Delivering Happiness delivers exactly that. (Please pardon my corny joke!) But honestly, it's an amazing read. The book flows seamlessly and is a fairly easy read--I started it during my senior week. The thing that actually makes the book successful was Hsieh's personal stories that he recounts all throughout the book. He also has a bunch of stories written by Zappos employees that are surprisingly heartfelt. (And it's hard to move my emotions.) There was one in particular that got me laughing my ass off--and my roommates on senior week ask me what actually was so freaking funny.    Hsieh writes about how when he was younger, he was \\"forced\\" to play the piano. He goes on \\"explaining\\" Asian parents: Harvard is the best college, being a doctor or getting a PhD was the highest accomplishment, and the more instruments you knew how to play, the more legit your kid was. (Note: I was laughing my ass off because he had nailed it spot on... and I could totally relate) Hsieh gives a prime example that demonstrates just how smart he is. As a child he didn't see how learning how to play piano would benefit him in any scale. Thus, at 6 a.m. (while his parents were still asleep) every morning he would go \\"practice piano\\" by actually playing back a tape recorder of a 1 hour piano practicing session he had recorded earlier.** He would then sit in his room reading magazines.    The book continues on following him through college, his first job and his trials and tribulations about not being happy at his first job because he wasn't excited, challenged, or happy. He quit with his best friend and the rest is history.    I really don't want to summarize the entire book or give my favorite sections because that would ruin it. The writing and tone is absolutely hilarious. It's clean, sharp, to the point and heartfelt. Plus, everything I learned in business school was covered--which goes to show that I guess Lehigh teaches \\"real life\\" business. I knew all the terms he was using and these examples I hope to keep in mind when I find something passionate about. I WISH I could actually meet him in person and see if he actually is how he is in the book and whether it actually translates. He's someone I'd love to take a shot of Grey Goose with (book reference) and talk business with.

B003ELOQD4|2.0|I'm giving this a bad review based solely on the technical aspects of the disc. The video quality is absolutely terrible. For a Blu-ray I expected so much more. The video is grainy, overexposed and all-in-all very sub-par. At first I thought maybe the look was an intentional effect that would pass. I even checked my Blu-ray player settings just to make sure it wasn't my machine. Having seen the other comments on here about the video I have to sadly accept that's the way it is. It's too bad. Having seen the 360 tour and the spectacular stage show it's a real shame this is how they chose to capture it. My standard definition DVD of the 2005 Vertigo tour looks much better than this disc. Someone else said the streaming YouTube video looks better and they're right. It does.    Some have commented about the editing looking more like a music video than a live concert, and I agree it does. It doesn't bother me too much, although I would have preferred just a straight-forward approach as opposed to all the overlays, dissolves, composite images, etc.    The concert itself is good. Bono and the boys sound good (although Bono's voice isn't what it used to be) and the set list is varied, although why they chose to leave the opening song \\"Breathe\\" out of the main concert and make it a \\"bonus feature\\" is puzzling.    I wish Bono a successful and speedy recovery from his recent injury and I hope to see U2 back out on the 360 tour soon. It would be nice to see them live again since the Blu-ray does a real injustice to the experience I remember.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|Having upgraded my 10 year old Toshiba DVD player after the laser stopped playing DVDs, I decided to treat my new Panasonic BD60 to Blade Runner The Final Cut as my first Blu-ray purchase (BD60 is a lovely quality, great value player BTW).     As a UK customer, I decided to purchase the US 5 disc edition as I don't think it's available here. When it promptly arrived (within a couple of weeks of my order) I ended up with one of the problem batches of the film, where disc 1 is a duplicate of the 'workprint' version on disc 5. Upon further searching on the internet I discovered that this was a common problem, and emailed Amazon. To my delight, they sent out another package for free, told me I could keep the existing discs to do with as I pleased and assured me the replacement would be perfect. A couple of weeks later it arrived and was indeed free from any duplicate issues.    It goes without saying that the Final Cut print on Blu-ray looks and sounds absoultely stunning (I managed to catch it at the cinema a few years ago when it was on limited release, just one week if I recall, and remember being blown away on the big screen as well).    Although not always the absolute cheapest option, I find the customer service with Amazon (UK and USA) an important factor when buying on the net, and it's the main reason why I return to them over many other sites. An extra pound or two cheaper is less valuable than a shopping site I can implicitly trust.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|My Masters Thesis was based on the events and causes of the crash of 2008. Research of news sources and related interviews led me to most of the same conclusions as Lewis. A key factor that I refused to accept that could only be teased out and confirmed from an insider's perspective is that the big money on Wall Street ignored all the structural problems in the mortgage related bonds and CDOs. I refused to draw that conclusion even though research indicated that was exactly the issue. My problem? I thought there was simply too much money invloved for the big investors to be asleep at the wheel. I was wrong on that point; Lewis exposes why.
0446563048|5.0|This book explains how Zappos and Tony got their start, fumbled and stumbled then began gaining traction. I'm a fan of Tony and a bit biased. I have to admit the writing could be tightened up, but I was ok with its someone loose focus. It was written in Tony's words and he explains why he didn't use a professional writer to help him with the book. It felt much more like a conversation then a well told story.    The book answered most of my questions:    1. How did Tony develop Zappos?  2. Why is happiness so important in business?  3. How can a company use Zappos' techniques to become smarter, stronger and more profitable?    The book was an easy read and worth my time. If you love business books I suggest you read this book. If you love personal development books I encourage you to read this book because you will learn Tony's techniques for developing happiness through a career.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|The movie started off slow and directed like it was a documentary.  A mothership of aliens comes to Earth and stays hovered over  South Africa.  A military orginazation (NMU) sends a team of helicopters and moves the aliens to live in District 9, a hovel fillled area.  The aliens are called \\"prawns\\" and like to eat catfood.  The aliens also bring very advanced weapons that NMU is very interested in.  Unfortunately only the aliens can fire them because the weapons have sensors that only work with prawn DNA.    The NMU decides that the aliens are to be relocated to another area a few miles away.  They send a team headed by one guy who seems like a \\"Monty Python\\" comedian.  He makes the aliens sign eviction notices.  I never could understand his name because most of the movie is spoken with very heavy South African accents and it was difficult to understand a lot that is said in the film.      The spokesman discovers a viles of liquid that he tries tasting and it makes him sick.  He takes the liquid with him and then the liquid starts to change his body.  The changes make NMU very interested because his metamorphasis makes him able to use the alien weapons.  He goes on the run from the NMU and he has to stay alive while they are chasing him and also gets involved with some very bad Nigerian mafia.    From this point the movie changes away from the documentary format and is very exciting and has a lot of tense moments.  The difficulty in understanding the accents does not matter and the action is excellent.  There are also some poigniant moments as he befriends one of the \\"scientist\\" prawns and the two team up to help him and also help the scientist prawn get back to the mother ship.    I almost gave up on this movie but it turned out to be very good.  The special effects are similar to the Robocop movies but the great action and tense moments make up for the older effects.
B003CH8WZS|4.0|After folowing Mr. Hackett all these years since \\"Voyage\\" and actually conversing with him. His new CD  \\"Out of the Tunnels Mouth\\" becomes an interesting listening. I think Steve has a small \\"hook\\",where he plays real nice and quite ,then all of  a sudden the band burts in with everything they have and it comes back down again.  He does this through about 3 songs. I guess its trying to hold on to the earlier years of Hackett,when he could actually write some nice tunes. I spoke to him about his change like going into \\"Dark Town\\". This was a very very dark album for him. And all he said was \\"wanted to do something different\\" I have waited a long time to get the   double cd ,that has Chris Squire playing. Its still always not worth that wait. I must commend the man  for still playing and keeping those Genesis song out there. The man has not stopped playing,while the rest   rest of Genesis has faded away like a \\"wind and Wuthering\\". Thank you Steve for giving us something to listen  to ,dont stop playing my friend. This man is now on tour,please go see him and support him. He was always the favorite underdog anyway.
B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|Well first of all i want to stress that this is an EP not an album.  If it was an album i'd be very dissapointed.  This is really just some songs created during their Perfect Symmetry Tour.  Stop For A Minute has some good parts but is definetly not the Keane sound that I love.  I'm hoping they don't continue in this direction.  Your Love is a good song but has an unfinished feel to me.  I think Tim is a good singer but really they should have had Tom do it.  The highlight of the EP for me was My Shadow.  I really love this song and think it's one of their best.  Clear Skies is an ok song but House lights and Back in Time just seems like average B-sides too me.  Looking Back I think is the worst song they have ever done.  Overall it's dissapointing but i'm looking forward to the next Keane album and hoping they won't go in the direction of Stop For A Minute.  I do however think the album is worth getting even if it's just to get My Shadow.
B003FXXNBW|4.0|First its a fight movie, so this ain't gonna be an oscar contender. So in the line of such movies as Bloodsport, The Quest, Best of the best, and other fight tournament movies this is pretty good. The fight scenes were well done and the story never got in the way of the fact that we want to see the fights. For this genre this is pretty good not the best of the bunch but it never tries to be more than what it is.
0446563048|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo333SG301UKT0B]]Delivering Happiness is a manifesto that needed to be penned. Tony's personal recount of early life on the internet and the belief that it would change and engage our lives is poignantly written and articulated well. It made me laugh and remember the early days when I too pledged my heart and soul to the internet and forsook the path my parents would have chosen in my career choices. Delivering Happiness is now a choice that we are all making internally as a result of reading this book (I believe we've always chosen this but now we will proceed in a very obvious manner.)<br /><br />I have a library of books that are available to my staff and this one is on our must-read list as we align ourselves to creating a culture that delivers happiness for the good of all concerned. Thanks Tony for writing this book and inspiring me to take action and do it early.<br /><br />@digitalgodess on Twitter and LinkedIn
B001FB5634|5.0|As someone who has read the book and seen the movie I can say that this film is quite faithful to its source material. The book is quite an emotional journey as is the film, and let me just say that if you're expecting lots of action and adventure then you will be dissapointed, you should probably see The Book of Eli then, as that is a much more action oriented film and comperable as it has the same theme of the end of the world.
B002SEW5WW|4.0|I really like OneRepublic.  I remember when I first heard `Apologize' and I was instantly hooked.  I love their style and their sound and Ryan Tedder's voice is magic to my ears.  He has the perfect falsetto, yet he never comes off as anything less than masculine in his delivery.  Lyrically, they have a nice repertoire, and just when I think that they can't one-up themselves I hear the next track and I'm engaged all over again.<br /><br />All of this said, they have yet to produce an album as universally complete as I know they are capable of.<br /><br />In parts `Waking Up' is a great album.  Sadly, OneRepublic winds up tied down by the one thing that makes them so unique; their sound.  When you hear any of the songs on this album it is instantly obvious that it is a One Republic song.  Even before Ryan starts serenading us, we know that his voice is about to be broadcast.  OneRepublic has a signature sound that they drench each and every track on this album with to the point where their songs start to run into one another.<br /><br />It's a shame, I know.<br /><br />The eleven tracks on this album range from great to mediocre, with only really one song standing out as unappealing to me, but then again only three stand out as truly amazing to me.<br /><br />The album opens with a gigantic bang, the first three songs basically setting the bar SO high that the only way to go from there was down.  `Made For You' is a fantastic opening track, perfectly fusing the pop beats with the soft piano and that chorus is just hauntingly hushed yet loud with emotional merit.  `All the Right Moves' keeps the energy high with a chorus so energetically engrossing you can't help but become a part of the song.  Still, `Secrets' is even better.  The musical opening is stunning and instantly grabs the listener.  The lyrical content is pure and poignant.  When the songs snaps into attention less than 40 seconds in with that stunning chorus you know that you have found this bands opus.<br /><br />And then the album starts to spiral away from itself.<br /><br />`Everybody Loves Me' is rich with satirical content, but it just doesn't manage to be anything more than a Beck soundalike.  `Good Life' is `happy-inducing' but it is also a tad lazy.  It just sounds so familiar for them, with no real newness to it.  That said, I really like the song.  In fact, I really like the entire album, it just doesn't wow me like I expected after that one-two-THREE punch right off the bat.  `Marchin On' has grown on me, if not for the fact that it shows true ambition.  It can feel a tad long, but no where near as long as the title track, `Waking Up', comes off as.  In fact, that song is the one that I just DO NOT LIKE.  It is just really bland and it carries on for far too long.  `Missing Persons 1 & 2' is nice and subtle, yet it doesn't leave a major impact.  It is pretty to listen to, but Ryan's voice does seem to strain in parts.  I do like the haunting quality to the song, but it just doesn't live up to potential.  The shift in song structure is also odd.  Why didn't they separate this into two tracks?  `All This Time' sounds like something they've already done, with no real spark or anything to remember.  In fact, it actually sounds a tad dated.  `Fear' is simply forgettable.  It almost feels like an afterthought.<br /><br />The closing song `Lullaby' would have been less disappointing had the rest of the album been more impressive.  It isn't a bad song at all, and it would generally be a great way to end an album (soft, sweet, serene) but instead it just becomes another seemingly dull song.<br /><br />In the end, I still give this album a B and recommend it if you are a fan of the group.  Ryan Tedder is going to stick around (highly in demand as a song writer and producer as well) so I don't expect this band to go away anytime soon, which is a good thing.  I want them to release an album that lives up to what I know they can create.  They have the goods and they have a unique and signature sound that I really wish they would use to the full instead of allowing it to defeat them by rendering them seemingly `one-note'.<br /><br />Here is my ranking for those interested:<br /><br />1) Secrets<br />2) Made for You<br />3) All the Right Moves<br />4) Good Life<br />5) Marchin On<br />6) Everybody Loves Me<br />7) Lullaby<br />8) Missing Persons 1 &2<br />9) All This Time<br />10) Fear<br />11) Waking Upo the full instead of allowing it to defeat them by rendering them seemingly `one-note'.      Here is my ranking for those interested:    1) Secrets  2) Made for You  3) All the Right Moves  4) Good Life  5) Marchin On  6) Everybody Loves Me  7) Lullaby  8) Missing Persons 1 &2  9) All This Time  10) Fear  11) Waking Up
0393337170|4.0|Very entertaining intro to game theory.  Some of the materials can be little confusing but overall, they are easy to follow and understand.
B0000549B0|4.0|Walking into `Harvey', I didn't really know what to expect.  I wasn't sure if this was a drama or a comedy or both.  It's both.  I think it is more of a dark comedy, one that is superficially light and cheery but that packs a wallop if you are willing to sit back and take it in for what it is `really' saying.<br /><br />There is definitely a darkness here.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Elwood P. Dowd, a drunk who has been left everything by his late mother.  He is now taking care of his eldest sister and her daughter.  Elwood's sister Veta and her daughter Myrtle Mae are at their wits end with Elwood.  You see, since moving in they have been introduced to his imaginary friend Harvey, a 6 foot, 3 ½ inch white rabbit who seems to be Elwood's closest companion.  Elwood's outlandish behavior (in their eyes outlandish) has humiliated them for the last time.  Myrtle Mae is on the verge of becoming a spinster because of it all and so Veta finally decides to have her brother admitted to a psychiatric hospital.<br /><br />I think it would be safe to say that Elwood has a guardian angel by his side.<br /><br />The film dips into hilarity as a mix up at the hospital leaves Veta admitted and Elwood on the loose.  As the hospital attempts to rectify their mistake it becomes obvious to almost everyone that Elwood is as normal as he needs to be.<br /><br />The Pooka (Celtic folklore come to life) that illuminates Elwood's life is left an enigma for the audience.  It almost appears as the film draws to a close that we are to conclude he is not a mere figment but an actual reality, but then again that would almost be too easy.  The real center of this film has a lot to do with the way that we as humans deal with trauma (the loss of a loved one) and how we deal with change.  Looking at Veta and Myrtle Mae's situation, basically being cared for by a relative they deem unfit, they are reacting aggressively to the idea of change.  Their acceptance of Elwood hinges on how it will affect them, not how it is affecting Elwood.  In fact, Elwood has countless friends and is relatively happy with his life, and yet his close relatives are determined to change him to fit their needs.<br /><br />For me, the film almost nails it.  Some scenes seem to be a little too unfocused, but overall I was very pleased with the film.  I think that this is a film some will really enjoy and others will find preposterous and a tad corny.  It can come off rather silly at times, and the films eventual conclusion could have used a little more direction, but a sign of the times lies in the wholesome endings seen in films of this nature.<br /><br />That said, James Stewart's performance is impeccable.  When the film started I actually felt he was overdoing it, but as the film progressed I realized that this was that man he was portraying and all his quirks seemed natural.  Stewart was one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big screen, and this is yet further proof of that.  The character of Elwood P. Dowd is one of the best I've ever seen, truly fleshed out and entirely alive inside.  He is unique and yet relatable in all the right ways.  Thanks to Stewart's flawless performance, this delusional man (is he?) becomes someone we know and love and feel.  Josephine Hull won a deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Veta, the exasperated sister who doesn't fully understand what it is she is expecting of her innocent little brother.<br /><br />In the end I definitely recommend this film.  It is a great slice of entertainment with a poignant message we all do well to pay attention to.g Elwood.

B001HN6940|2.0|A totally joyless experience. I shut it off after an hour. The one saving grace is Helena Bonham carter. The rest of the film is truly a misguided mess, with an interesting cgi look but a horrible script. It's one of director Tim Burton's worst films (an honor I gave previously to 'Planet of the Apes\\". Yes, its THAT bad.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Obviously this set is what you want to buy if you're looking to buy anything \\"Daria\\" related. Has all the episodes (without showing the introduction every-time which is a major plus) and in perfect clarity! The audio is great, the sarcasm is crisp...just get it already!

B002TVQ4HG|4.0|Though nominally a horror movie, Triangle isn't particularly scary.  Instead it's a puzzle-box film which solid cinematography and acting lift out of the B-movie realm.  (It's more like a B+.)  But really the only thing that matters for this kind of movie is if the rules of the game it lays out are intriguing enough to draw you in, and on that account Triangle is a success.  It does lurching plot twists, intricate chronologies, and retroactively important throwaway details with style and precision.  [[ASIN:B0036EH3WU Lost]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXZ4 Memento]] fans should feel right at home.  After a viewing or two, you can cruise on over to the comment threads on the IMBD page to read elaborate theories as to what really happened.  Until then the usual spoiler cautions apply: avoid the trailer, reviews (including ones on this page), and all promotional material apart from the back of the DVD box.

B0036R92V2|2.0|There's a note before the film begins that the original negative was badly damaged in some sections of the film and that one should try to enjoy it anyway. It seemed to me that throughout most of the movie, there was such an incredibly high level of grain that it caused a very drastic shimmer effect. It was extremely distracting. If this is the best they could do, they really shouldn't have bothered at all in my opinion.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I'm sorry to say I was disappointed in that as well. It was many years ago that I first heard of Django, back when the Thrones were covering the Django theme song. I asked them where it was from, and they described what sounded like one of the coolest spaghetti westerns ever made, starring an awesome antihero who drags around a coffin with a Gatling gun concealed within. That was about 15 years ago. I suppose there was no way anything could live up to high expectations that lasted that long. As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the downright *silliest* spaghetti westerns ever made. I tried to convince myself that it was intentional tongue-in-cheek parody... but I really don't think that's the case. I could easily see Mystery Science Theater 3000 giving it a highly deserved send-up. Quite surprising considering what I'd heard about it over the years.<br /><br />If you're a hyper anal-retentive purist who demands a 100% accurate transfer regardless of how badly damaged and flawed the original source was, and don't take the movie as seriously as I did, perhaps you'll be able to enjoy this turkey.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I too am a son of the new generation. I grew up around R&B, Rock, Alternative, all that good stuff. I didn't have much taste for, as I called it, \\"Classical Crap\\". Until recently. I went and saw HTTYD about a month after it released (in 2D) and completely fell in love with it. I have seen it 3 more times since, but it wasn't until view #3 that I actually listened closer than before. I heard the music score in the background and realized that there was even more to the movie than Toothless, if that was possible. I downloaded a couple of the songs to my PSP from Youtube to see how I'd like the music, and I completely fell in love with the soundtrack. I finally bought the soundtrack from Amazon.com and after 4 agonizing days full of disappointment when I checked the empty mailbox, I got the CD. And I listened to it all the way through.    Now to cut to the chase. This soundtrack is the epitome of amazing. From the upbeat music of \\"Forbidden Friendship\\" (Hiccup meets Toothless up close and personal), to the sad, suspenseful \\"Where's Hiccup?\\" (Not gonna spoil it...), this soundtrack will take you back through the movie.    I have now had this CD for six months. I still listen to it, and am simply stupified that one man can conduct music so well, so BRILLIANTLY, as John Powell has. Take the time to sit down and listen to how smoothly the string instruments flow with the woodwinds and brasses, while cellos and base drums are thumping in the background. It is amazing, through and through. If you buy this, you won't regret it for one second. Buy it. Hear it. Love it. 5 stars hands down
193413712X|2.0|THIS book won the PULITZER PRIZE for fiction??!! What were they THINKing? What did they SEE here that I didn't? Because I saw a mess. There were the makings of perhaps several novels here, none of them realized or developed. While it's true there are some beautiful lines wrapped throughout the \\"novel,\\" none of them ever really come together to create an aesthetically pleasing whole. I put novel in quotation marks here, because I'm wondering if maybe this is some \\"new\\" kind of experimental fiction - ??<br /><br />I bought this book because a couple of friends told me about it - about how it was about this old man dying, and that it had just won the Pulitzer. I had immediate visions of a book equal to, or perhaps even better than, Peter Pouncey's beautifully wrought novel about an old man, Rules for Old Men Waiting. And I also thought of last year's Pulitzer fiction winner, Olive Kitteridge, by Elizabeth Strout. Both of those books have become favorites of mine that I recommend whenever I can. Perhaps I should have been suspicious when one of those friends added that it had never taken her so long to read such a short book. Because she was right. Tinkers is perhaps the loooooongest 191-page novel I have ever read. In fact, after nearly a week of picking it up and putting it down, I became afraid it would never end. I wanted to just chuck it and be done with it, but I kept thinking, \\"This book won the Pulitzer; it must get better.\\" I was wrong. It didn't. But it finally did mercifully end, and in a not very interesting fashion. I'm sorry. This book is simply NOT Pulitzer material. I just lost faith in that selection committee. - Tim Bazzett, author of SOLDIER BOY: AT PLAY IN THE ASA
0446563048|5.0|In his new book, Delivering Happiness, you get a deeper look into how Tony's curiosity and willingness to stand with rather than above those who'd eventually help build his empire formed what he views as the essence of success.<br /><br />It's not about the product, systems, logistics, branding or positioning, but rather the culture.<br /><br />Actually, it IS about all these things, but the culture and the mission define how each of these elements is brought to life. Delivering Happiness is chock full of business nuggets, but it's not a heavily tactical book. It's not a how-to book, full of checklists and strategies (there are some), but rather a look at the bigger picture core drivers.<br /><br />You won't learn to write copy, set up a marketing funnel, design systems or persuade customers to buy. But, you will learn how to focus on the deeper stuff that lays the foundation for doing all those things on a level that drives cult-like loyalty, evangelism and eventually, success on a much larger scale.<br /><br />And, to me, that's worth many times the price of the book.

B000UG78NG|5.0|This is my first foray into fantasy, magic, swords, etc.: I'm more of a space-opera sci-fi kind of fan. But, this landed a good review from Penny Arcade, and I figured it'd be worth picking up.    I was right! This book has amazing heart, a rich protagonist, and a compelling supporting cast. It doesn't seem to break any great plot molds -- orphaned kid, a rite of passage, etc. etc. -- although the frame narration works pretty well. Can't wait to see the \\"present\\" and \\"flashback\\" plots converge in the next works.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I jumped on the bandwagon and had to start watching this series, so I bought Season 1.  Loved it!  The price is a lot cheaper than the stores and the show is enticing from the first episode. Sookie, a mind-reading waitress at a Louisiana pub, meets Bill the vampire when he comes into the pub one night.  Bill happens to possess the only mind she's not able to read, which only heightens Sookie's interest in him. Their attraction to each other catapults them into a \\"mixed\\" relationship that is met with disdain and apprehension by all of their friends and/or loved ones. As time goes on the viewer is introduced to various vampires and the \\"rules\\" and \\"laws\\" they live by. Highly recommend it.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|There are two things in the world that everybody loves. The first one is of course Raymond and the second one is this movie. This movie was basically created to to turn grown men into giddy little fanboys. It has it all! You turn away for one minute and you will probably regret it. It gives a hold new meaning to the term action packed. Yes, I still think that Micheal Keaton was the best Batman ever. However, Christian Bale comes in at a close second. That's just my opinion so don't go there. This movie made a gazzillion dollars at the box office. I thought that it would be pretty good but i was still very impressed. I only have one complaint. Why the H-E-DOUBLE HOCKY STICKS is this movie so long? Everytime you think its going off somebody comes flying out of nowhere. I'm sitting there like where this fool come from. Even bats need to sleep sometime. I promise this movie went off at least three times and came back on. I actually saw Christian Bale's hair start to turn grey. This movie is so long after awhile The Joker just gives up and tells Batman that he'll catch him in the next movie. It's very long but still it's one of the greatest all out action flicks of all time. I give it 2 FLYING HIGH THUMBS UP! Buy this one on blu ray. Holla

B000957O82|4.0|I love this movie. Will Smith can do it all! He proves once again that he can take any role and make a great movie out of it. I never really saw him as the romantic comedy type but it works for him. I don't think i've ever seen a bad Will Smith movie. I was a little aggravated by the way they pumped up the movie Hancock. Hancock was definately no masterpiece but it was definately funny. We need more good romantic comedies with black people. I'm tired of watching Matthew Mcconaughey make a fool out of himself. Let someone else have a chance. LOL, Hitch is a very funny movie that anyone should be able to enjoy. I give it 2 HUGE THUMBS UP. You better buy this one. HOLLA!

A History of Violence is one of my favorite films of all time. Once again he shows off his true depth as an actor. He delivers a performance that will not be soon forgotten. This is not one of those movies that you forget about 5 minutes after watching. This is the type of movie that stays with you. I only wish that i could have seen more of Charlize Theron. She was the main reason i decided to watch this. We only get to see her during flashbacks. She still does alot with the small amount of screen time she is given. This movie will be a permanent staple in my dvd collection and it should be in yours. I give this one TWO INSPIRATIONAL THUMBS UP! Holla
0446563048|5.0|Delivering Happiness is a must read if you want to get away from the stuffiness of corporate America! It shows that you can be successful, profitable and a little weird and love what you do all at the same time.  The culture and joy they get out of their work is a model that every business person should examine.  Do you enjoy what you do, or do you hit the snooze alarm 3 or 4 times before you force yourself out of bed? This book can help you understand how to reclaim your core values and become excited about getting up and going about your work.  I highly recommend it.
0307389839|5.0|As a runner and a big fan of Murakami's bizzare yet captivating fiction, I couldn't wait to read this book. Who would've guessed that one of my favorite authors is also an avid runner? As its title suggests, this book is a memoir of sorts. It is organized in the form of essays written over the course of almost two years about Murakami's meditations on various aspects of running. Presented in chronological order, readers follow Murakami's training for his annual winter marathon.    I enjoyed reading Murakami's personal musings on his running and training schedule. As someone who always runs by myself, I always wondered what goes through other runners' minds. It is quite fun and feels quite voyeuristic to get an insight into my favorite author's thoughts while he's running and to find some similarities between his and my routine. The essays are rather slow-paced and relaxed, which I enjoyed thoroughly.    It is refreshing to read Murakami writing in the first person. Readers may get a sense of this intensely private and guarded writer's personality through this memoir. Although the main topic is his running, readers also enjoy a view into Murakami's view of life and how it changed or evolved through the years with his running. I loved this book as it inspired me in not only running, but also in trying to be happy with life. I will definitely re-read this gem again in the future!
B002ZTQVBQ|2.0|I am a huge Anime fan. I love all of Miyazaki's works up until this film. I am qualifying the review with those statements because their are a lot of anime fans who dislike his work for various reasons and I am not one of them. As A Miyazaki fan this was movie was very disappointing to me. Normally there is a very strong story driving his amazing art that make it all fit together in a way that grasps you and pulls you in, with Ponyo this is not the case. The entire time I watched this film I found myself wondering if this was really a Miyazaki film. It looked like one and thanks again to the master Joe Hisashi but id didn't feel like one of his films. None of the characters were particularly likable or dislikable for that matter they were just simply there. The attempts at cuteness wroked for about the first 20 minutes after that it just took time away from what could have been used for a better story or more characters development. The only reason this is a two star review as opposed to one is because of the great soundtrack and amazing visuals. All in all the movie while nice to look at for a short period of time ended up being just plain boring with a weak story and even weaker characters and character development. If you must see this movie please rent it first, if you like it more power to you. I would not suggest this as a buy though for fans of Miyazakei or Anime in general without watching to see if it fits your tastes first.
078624495X|5.0|I bought this book for my husband and he can't put it down. In fact, he often will describe to me the page turning events as they unfold.  It is beautifully written even down to the last gory detail (which there are many of).  We have owned the movie since it came out and since my husband's been reading this book he will often go and watch the movie \\"again\\".  For all history buffs, this book is a must have!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is the best James Taylor CD I own.  To have him and Carole King on the same CD is so good I decided I had to see them together live so bought a concert ticket for the \\"live at the Troubadour\\" tour. It is such a value to have both the CD for my car and to be able to watch the DVD with the same music I have loved for 40 years.
B0036EH40Q|2.0|The black levels are HORRIBLY crushed to an embarrassing degree.  The entire movie is way too dark and there's zero detail in any of the darker scenes.  Watch 5 minutes of The Dark Knight and then 5 minutes of this and you'll see what I mean.  I saw this recently in HD on a cruddy and compressed satellite movie channel and I think it looked better than the Blu-ray. The only positive is that sound is pretty solid, but since this if one of my favorite movies and I'm clearly upset about the picture quality it will probably collect dust on my shelf next to Point Break...
B001EN71CW|5.0|I didn't see this series when it first came on television, nor am I a Joss Whedon fan, but having watched it recently I've got to say it's a fun and brilliantly written show that was WAY ahead of its time.  The story is smart, fast-paced and the acting and dialog and timing are top-notch.  The series is very wittily and funny without every resorting to cheap laughs.    I've never seen any cast of characters that immediately had SO much chemistry together; usually that takes a couple seasons, an opportunity Firefly never had due to the not so brilliant people at Fox.
0307476154|5.0|Brilliant as the first book<br />Sad there are only three<br />See the film with subtitles from his native country not the American gloss one -wait for it on DVD if necessary !
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I bought the single DVD version, since I don't have a Blu-ray player or HD TV. I have a big digital 27\\" 200-lb. CRT TV that I will not replace until it wears out, because even without the new technology, watching Avatar on that screen was awesome. I did not see the theatre 3-D version because I believed the reviews that called the story 'predictable', and said that the 3-D gimmick was the only thing it had going for it. But NOT having seen it in the theatre, I enjoyed the DVD very much. There was enough depth to the motion for me--I did not need creatures appearing to jump out of the screen towards me at my age! And the 'predictable' story was different enough to hold my interest to the very end.
B001JYD6U2|2.0|Oh yeah, now I know.  The book was very well marketed to a segment that does not enjoy the material presented.  I found the book to be grotesque.  The author drives me deep into a worthless event only to emerge far from entertained.  Coversations about a possible hand job from truck driver is not my idea of what I want going round and round in my mind before I shut my eyes for the night.  Though I may not like the book myself, you might, the subject matter had me disturbed.  Yes, the book does include his sexual intentions, but up until page 98 he never was \\"nasty\\" and this is not the reason why I put the book down.  The book is very well written and Sedaris tells his stories very well.  Plus the name Sedaris has to be one of the coolest last names anyone could have.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I first read \\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott almost twenty years ago and it remains one of my favorite coming-of-age stories. The story of four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and their trials, tribulations, joys, and life with their beloved mother Marmee appeals on so many levels. These young ladies go through so much, and bear it all stoically, especially with their father being away during the Civil War.<br /><br />Jo, the protagonist in this story is a strong-willed, independent-minded young woman and the character that appeals to me the most. She chafes against the strictures imposed against the women of her time, and struggles with her losses whilst trying to establish herself as a writer. The themes in this novel are varied - poverty, family, friendships, grief, and female emancipation and are deftly dealt with. This will always be a classic and one I hope to share with my own young daughter in the near future.

Aligning the company culture with a lifestyle of good work and good life.  The insightful new book Delivering Happiness written by Tony Hsieh CEO of [...] the online place to by shoes and much more.    The book is written in Tony's voice. An easy read starting from his growing up and through the growth of his companies and experiences. The first  part of the book focuses onTony Hsieh`s childhood and background before Zappos. To understand Zappos you have to understand Tony, and the book certainly gives a greater insight into him as a person. Unlike the stereotype of a what a businessman should be, money is not his prime motivation.    \\"If we want to continue to stay ahead of our competition, we must continually change and keep them guessing. Others can copy our images, our shipping, and the overall look of our website, but they cannot copy our people, our culture, or our service.\\"    I first learned about online shoe buying back in early 2002 from a friend who works at Apple. He mentioned where he bought his shoes and the customer service he got every single time he bought shoes. So I decided to try them out - the website was easy to navigate and I found my brand and size and  like magic Zappos upgraded my shipping to overnight I had my shoes the next day - I was sold and always talked up Zappos to all my friends. This simple concept of customer service is one of the many core values in the company culture of [...]    Get the book you will love it!
0446563048|5.0|As someone very interested in business and technology I did enjoy this book for Tony's story on how he made Zappos what it is today: one of Fortune  magazine's top 25 companies to work for. But I also enjoyed it because of the personal story he tells about his pursuit for happiness. In his case it is to spread the word of HAPPINESS, which he does through his company, his friendships, and now this book. I learned some valuable lessons from Tony's, and many of his friends, words in this book.
B002WPVNZM|4.0|I would def recommend this cd.  I do not have their first cd but I have heard most of the tracks.  I will say this, if you have not heard much of OneRepublic and know you love \\"Apologize\\" and \\"Stop and Stare\\" don't buy this cd looking for the same kind of tunes or anything like the ballads the lead singer writes for other artists.  This cd is totally different and in my opinion a lot better.      The music is very powerful in lyric and in notes.  The violins are beautiful and you find yourself dancing to even a slower paced song.  I suggest you buy this version that has the remake of the Duffy song \\"Mercy\\"  The original is way better but it's still a cute little cover.    Perhaps try these downloads first before buying the whole cd?  Too bad Amazon doesn't credit down the price when you guy a few and go back for the rest the way Itunes does!    Best tracks:  Secrets, Made for You, All the Right Movies, Matchin On and Passenger.
B0033QC0WY|5.0|If you're at all interested in Mahler, this is the compilation for you.  Bernstein works the music for all it's worth.  What a pity it doesn't include \\"Das Lied Von Der Erde\\" and the 10th.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I am so happy to own this Susan Boyle CD. She has a great voice. There are a few songs on it I don't care for but it doesn't matter. Most the songs are made even better by her voice and style. I hope she does more CD's in the future. She deserves a chance and hope she continues. I will be looking for what she does in the future and wish her the best. Thank you Susan for sharing your beautiful voice and Dream. I'm very glad I purchased this.
0385736002|5.0|Excellent!! This book is not just for young adults. It is a story for anyone who loves fantasy and magic. I am on book four now the Necromancer and cannot wait for the next episode.  Nicholas Flamel, if you remember was the creator of the Scorcerers stone in the Harry Potter books. I love the mythology, leegates, shadowrealms, Elders, Immortals and all the historical reference. You just have to read this book. Leave it to an Irishman!! Wonderful!!
0783219695|5.0|I have always loved this movie. Owned the VHS tape but never purchased the DVD until now. I think it's a great movie with a great cast. So many good actors in this one and Tom Hanks is first rate with his acting as always. And Ron Howard does great directing and just gets better and better over time. This is true history that I never knew happened even when I was a teenager at the time. I never saw or heard anything about this incident until this movie. It is amazing everything that happened to them and that they made it home at all.     Well done movie and story telling. Loved the extras with this. This is a movie well worth purchasing and to have in your collection for viewing in the future. As well as being an historical event. I am so glad I now have the DVD of this wonderful movie. I highly recommend getting this movie.
B003EYVXYG|5.0|As a zombie and Romero fan I recommend this movie! I saw it at the theaters after reading all the reviews ( which most of them were negative) and came out very much satisfied!!! It has a feeling of Dawn of the dead and Day of the dead but with out the mall and the underground facility and with a better explanation of what is going on! I have to say that the continuing method (from Diary of the Dead and of the zombies in all his movies) was very imaginative and I really enjoyed how Romero took a character from Diary of the Dead and created a movie including him(the national guard guy), this way relating one with the other. I say if you are a seriuos ghoul movie fan and a Romero fan you should watch and include this movie in your collection! (one must remember,every time you're watching a Romero movie that the ghouls he has in his movies, always do things that they remembered from their past life!) A Must Have!!!
0375507256|5.0|\\"Is it better to be savage'n to be Civ'lized? What's the naked meanin' b'hind them two words?\\" So asks Zach'ry, one of six narrators in David Mitchell's sestet novel, Cloud Atlas (2005). The novel takes the reader on a spectacular journey crossing time, genre, and narrative voice, all the while questioning the value of human creation and our capacity for absolute destruction. Structurally the novel's six sections work as an interrogation of genre and style. Thematically, it examines questions of consumer culture, technology, the uncanny, surveillance, and human nature. In these two short questions we see Mitchell's masterful linguistic experimentation at work. The questions form the driving force of the entire novel: is technology, is knowledge worth the cost? What values do we put on `civilisation?' What has civilisation meant throughout history and what are its far-reaching consequences? Six narrators ask the question in six ways and find answers in very different generic structures. Mitchell also experiments with language: his style changes through the novel as he composes six narrative voices, six revisions of genre, six arresting views on human technological creation and its implications.    The novel opens with The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing, the travel narrative of a 19th century American lawyer making his way across the Pacific to the gold mines of San Francisco. He encapsulates 19th century imperialism through Ewing, who pompously pronounces judgement of the indigenous peoples of the Chatham Islands while condescendingly praying for the divine salvation of their immortal souls. The next sections range from a one-sided, rambling epistolary section from a cunning confidence trickster, to a pulp crime thriller to a bizarre story of mystery, surveillance, and violence set in a home for the elderly.  The novel reads itself as each character comes across their narrative predecessor.    As the novel advances technology plays a progressively more sinister role:at first nuclear meltdown looms large, then much more disquieting uses of marvellous technology surface. Mitchell's language is slowly is infused with subtle corporate words, a sort of linguistic product placement. An Orison of Sonmi ~ 451, set in a futuristic, corpocratic Korea, presents a horrifying world of complete corporate greed, where the integrity of the human body is no longer important. The final section of the progression is entitled Sloosha's Crossin' An' Ev'rythin' After.  Mitchell takes great liberties with English in this section, making it nearly unrecognisable. This section takes place in a distant, post-apocalyptic future in which the civilisation Adam Ewing so admires has crumbled and technology is either unknown, not understood, or destructive. From this point, the novel works its way backwards in time, narratives and themes are revisited and revamped, and Mitchell ends with questions about time, emancipation, civilisation, and human progress.
0446563048|5.0|I loved every page of Delivering Happiness by Tony Hsieh of Zappos. I loved this book and read it straight through. It may have been the honesty with which Tony told his life story or perhaps I could relate because his childhood, education, work history (the $1.2B sale to Amazon and $265 M sales of LinkExchange aside, sadly) and philosophy really resonated with me.<br /><br />You will be entertained for 4 hours (I read it within a 24 hour period) and learn a bunch in the process. Here are some of the things that I learned or liked that I found valuable and entertaining.<br /><br />  * Like many kids, Tony had several small entrepreneurial successes and failures before high school.<br />  * Tony worked (I use the term loosely) for Oracle for 5 months but was bored so left to start a web development firm with a buddy.<br />  * Tony ran Venture Frogs I knew of Venture Frogs and almost attended parties in loft 801, but never made the connection that it was Tony Hsieh.<br />  * I like how Tony made his decisions down to first walk away from the first LinkExchange offer from a suitor and then to go on to sell it later. I won't get into it here but it's a simple yet detailed view of the thinking behind those decisions. I'll be posting a video discussion with Tony in a couple of weeks and will dig into this. You might consider subscribing to this blog so that you are notified of the posting.<br />  * Tony invested in Zappos through Venture Frogs and the company nearly folded, a few times. Tony made financial commitments to keep it going as he got more deeply involved.<br />  * Tony loves poker. I'm glad that I didn't sit down at the table with him at TED - I would have easily dropped $1,000.<br />  * Two huge lessons that Tony learned from poker which he applies to business are 1) sitting at the right table is the most important decision you make and 2)the importance of making the right decisions versus individual outcomes.<br />  * When things were dire at Zappos, tony went with his gut and his heart and sold 801 (the club) because he knew it was the right thing to do. If he hadn't, Zappos would not exist today.<br />  * Tony learned that outsourcing core competencies is a bad idea.<br />  * Zappos had a minimum of 3 near failure experiences but Tony and his team acted fast and did what they needed to for survival.<br />  * Tribes are important to Tony - college was a tribe, 801 was a tribe and Zappos is a tribe.<br />  * Tony learned that chasing passion and finding happiness are much more important than money.<br />  * It's important to think bigger than oneself or even the company.<br />  * Zappos benefits from employee, customer and vendor (partner) crowdsourcing and has done so for years.<br />  * Zappos is incredibly open, as you will read through the emails that are shared in the book.<br />  * First customer service, then culture and today, Zappos is about spreading happiness - that's quite a mission.<br /><br />This is a book that will provide you with value immediately. Whether you are an employee, investor, job seeker, CEO or searching for your next big thing - you will learn something to apply immediately after reading. I don't feel that way about all books but I do about this one. If you want to see the 3 minute interview with Tony, that I'll post next week. You can find it through the twitter here @mwalshand sold 801 (the club) because he knew it was the right thing to do. If he hadn't, Zappos would not exist today.      * Tony learned that outsourcing core competencies is a bad idea.      * Zappos had a minimum of 3 near failure experiences but Tony and his team acted fast and did what they needed to for survival.      * Tribes are important to Tony - college was a tribe, 801 was a tribe and Zappos is a tribe.      * Tony learned that chasing passion and finding happiness are much more important than money.      * It's important to think bigger than oneself or even the company.      * Zappos benefits from employee, customer and vendor (partner) crowdsourcing and has done so for years.      * Zappos is incredibly open, as you will read through the emails that are shared in the book.      * First customer service, then culture and today, Zappos is about spreading happiness - that's quite a mission.

B003NFM3KE|4.0|This item was $25.49.  So what does Amazon do?  Lowers it to $24.99, most likely to put it under the $25.01 threshhold (by two cents!) for saving shipping charges by choosing 'super saver shipping'.  Another wonderful disservice to customers from a company which makes huge profits.
B003F5WOEC|4.0|Brothers is mostly a pretty, laid-back affair. Nothing on it grabs me by the throat like The Big Come Up or Rubber Factory did, but I can appreciate that the band didn't want to keep putting out the same record and have taken their sound to new places. My favorite tracks on it have an early 70's AM rock radio atmosphere; they sound like unearthed classics that I'm finally hearing 40 years later. As a bonus, they throw in a CD version of the album. And a big poster with the lyrics on the flip side. I'm a little old to be hanging up a big poster, but I recognize the effort.
B000068CNX|5.0|I don't watch friends or like it, but my wife does.  She likes this set of DVD very much. So 5 star.
B003AIEOCY|1.0|Do Not Buy This Reissue. This reissue comes with none of the bonus material. I can understand not including a 3rd record with the bonus tracks on it, but they don't even bother with a CD insert or an MP3 download of the bonus tracks. All you get is the original tracks in an insultingly cheap version of the original jacket. Get $12 together, go to your local used record store, and buy a decent used copy of this fantastic album. You won't get this big middle finger being offered up by Universal Music Group, and you might even find a copy with the zany postcards intact.
0446563048|5.0|Reading Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh's \\"Delivering Happiness\\" book was like reading a novel and a business book at the same time. It was so engaging that I read the entire 250+ page paperback in one sitting. Take it to the beach this summer and do the same!<br /><br />Here are my favorite snippets from the book:<br /><br />  1. Build a brand from the inside out.<br />  2. Without conscious and deliberate effort, inertia always wins.<br />  3. Envision, create, and believe in your own universe, and the universe will form around you.<br />  4. Never outsource your core competency.<br />  5. Great companies have a greater purpose and bigger vision beyond just making money or being number one in a market.<br />  6. Celebrate your past and current successes while carefully navigating for the future.<br />  7. Be as transparent as possible.<br />  8. A word is a word, a picture is worth a thousand... but a brand is worth a million.<br />  9. Lifetime value of a client/customer can increase via positive emotional association with your brand.<br />  10. Build trust and engagement, not buzz.<br />  11. Problems are just mile markers. Each one passed means you've gotten better.<br />  12. The best leaders are servant-leaders.<br />  13. Make a plan, work it through to completion.<br /><br />This is definitely a book you want to have as part of your business-building library!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This was great the gazillionth viewing as it was the first viewing, back in '92 on HBO! I've had the pleasure of seeing Michael in concert (Victory and Bad Tours) and this DVD captures the excitement, fun, and awe of that wonderful experience. For those that (sadly) never got the chance to go to a Michael Jackson concert, this is the next best thing!<br /><br />Michael was, is and always will be the KING OF POP... :)
0439023491|5.0|This is one of the best series I've read in a long time.  Full of suspense with well crafted characters you can't help but care about.  The story is fantastic & I can't wait for the next book to be released.
B00008OLIO|5.0|An almost perfect combination of punk, glam and metal; `Too Fast for Love's reputation has grown over the past several years as the definitive Motley Crue record. Crudely (Cruedly?) recorded in 1981 and originally released independently under the band's own label Leathur Records, `Too Fast for Love' saw the beginnings of quite possibly the filthiest rock band in history. The brainchild of twenty two year old Franklin Ferrana who a short time after he began his career as a full time rocker and part-time delinquent changed his name legally to Nikki Sixx and the rest, as they say is history! Sixx found other like-minded misfits in Tommy Lee Bass, Vince Neil Wharton and an absolute wretched looking Bob Deal who called himself Mick Mars and played the rudest sounding guitar in his own advertisement when Nikki found him.  Four of the luckiest (and sleaziest) individuals to walk the planet were now and forever a band, no matter what clashes they have had (or drug overdoses, or firings) and no other foursome who called themselves Motley Crue were REALLY the Crue! It has always been Nikki, Tommy, Vince and Mick even if they don't really like each other after almost 30 years.  `Too Fast for Love's genius is its ultra raw recording and unabashed borrowing from Sex Pistols, Sweet, Aerosmith, Kiss and the Stones. \\"Live Wire\\" is the band's call to arms and is followed in quick succession by such monuments to depravity as \\"Public Enemy No. 1\\", \\"Piece of Your Action\\", \\"Come On and Dance\\" and the autobiographical (of sorts) \\"On With the Show\\". Some of the lyrics are so absurdly ridiculous that they make KISS seem like Shakespeare but it all works (especially the title track....\\"puts her legs up well you call it good luck, do you know what I mean\\"). But I friggin' love it! Motley never surpassed their debut in its raw intensity and comic pornography and that's what makes it a true classic of the hair metal era.
0446563048|5.0|Tony Hsieh delivers a new book and Happiness    Posted on June 7, 2010 Add Comment    June 7th 2010 on [...]    mcreads was very fortunate to get an advance reading copy of Tony Hsieh's new book \\" Delivering Happiness\\". If you hear someone saying he/she wants to change the world atleast I become very suspicious. Still when Tony finishes this book by writing \\" Together, we can change the world\\"  you want to join forces with him.    To me this is a book about corporate culture more than anything else. Excellent story telling on the ups and downs of the Zappos in pursuit of Happiness. Even a marriage with Amazon seems appropriate in the end. A path to profits, passion, and purpose as Tony Hsieh promises in the title.    This is a book to be read and re-read for personal and professional growth.
0143038419|1.0|The reviews and controversy of the book are more interesting.  BY FAR.  The book itself is so mediocre the author should be labeled the luckiest lottery winner of the century (and she's right she might not be THAT lucky again in her future endeavors).<br /><br />I couldn't finish the book and for the life of me I don't get why it's such a mega best seller (o yeah thanks to Oprah of course (snark)).  I was still stuck in page 40 something in Italy then skimmed through a few pages in India and Bali.  I really just don't care about her story or writing style.  She's trying too hard to be witty and she is NOT.  Instead I found her really irritating.<br /><br />She was a woman with a full-blown inner drama queen, yet she didn't reveal much why she behaved the way she did -drooling and bawling on the bathroom floor night after night- other than ... mental imbalance, perhaps?  This book would have been more interesting to read if she gave some indication why she lived such a sad, messy life having everything that she had.  That's one of the reasons why I think this book is so damn shallow and shouldn't have deserved the attention it does (well it's too late now, I'm already writing this damn review :( ).  Whatever.<br /><br />Mind you, I met Wayan, the medicine woman, twice when my husband and I visited Bali (I had thought it was her and I was surprised my suspicion was confirmed later on).  That was before the book became famous.  She even gave my husband a treatment each visit, not to mention having her healthy lunch.  Even so, I wasn't at all that intrigued to read the Bali part.<br /><br />I guess I can't add to this review anymore than what has been said zillions of times by other readers: self-absorebed, annoying, narcissist, spoiled, privileged.  And I second those, but again it's not why I don't think much of this book.  The part of finding God and meditation is so....Johnny-come-lately it's just ludicrous that anyone will still take this New Age rant seriously.  Yawn...  Well, at least for me it is.<br /><br />Her explanation of experiencing \\"enlightenment\\" through meditation sounds so forced (well, what else could she write?  She had to write something about this part of her \\"journey\\" or she would have to return that 200k) and, worse, like having been plucked from a dusty eastern spirituality 101 (I won't be the least surprised if, as someone mentioned, that she just copied and pasted it from the ashram's course brochure LOL).  It didn't even scratch the surface.  Puhleaasee...<br /><br />It's just a lame chick lit period.  If this is \\"one of the most important books of the century,\\" God help save our humanity!<br /><br />And the \\"odyssey of constant traveling to find oneself\\", I have done so too (yeah and writing it too, only I didn't think I was that interesting for people to read).  Probably that's why I'm somewhat prejudiced by, again, such clich&eacute;.  But that actually can be forgiven had she written it more convincingly.  She, based on this book alone and the little I read and skimmed through, isn't a very good writer.<br /><br />And above all I question further her authenticity in writing this \\"true story\\" because like everyone else has mentioned, it's so obvious she has the big screen version of this book with ...er...Julia Roberts playing her in her mind while writing this (and mind you, Julia Roberts will be playing the same ol Julia Roberts like in every single movie she was in...again just in the spirit of the cliche of the entire endeavor).  Uh...uh, very convincing.  It's very neat and...Hollywoody indeed (and I could't even read the part she had sex for the first time after a long time with her Brasillian hunk without being nauseaus.  Ugh...so cheesy).  It's more of reality TV than a memoir.<br /><br />It's easily the most overrated book and author of all time.  This memoir by Gabriel Cohen: [[ASIN:1600940501 Storms Can't Hurt the Sky: A Buddhist Path Through Divorce]] is far more down-to-earth, REAL, profound and relatable to many with such plight.  I couldn't put it down.  If you want something deep and entertaining, pick that book.<br /><br />I'm more looking forward to the \\"counter-argument\\" by his ex husband this fall.  It'll be interesting to delve into Gilbert's psyche from the vantage point of someone who was once closest to her to make sense of the absurd behavior she told in the book but never explained why.  Let the war begin -and both of them fight all the way to the bank...aren't we all suckers? LOL.you want something deep and entertaining, pick that book.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|The main reason I bought the G13 was because I kept reading how much faster you could move your avatar with the thumb joystick. I also liked that it had a lot of buttons and appeared to have a good ergonomic design. Also I would be able to use my computer keyboard less, and not wear out a few keys like I've done with previous ones.     After using it for a year, I am very happy with the purchase. The thumb joystick is not that hard to learn to use, and it soon becomes quite natural. By moving with your thumb, you actually free up the equivalent of 4 buttons (WASD) that you can bind abilities to. Also, you CAN move faster, rather you can circle faster. In thinking about it, it's because you can move on the diagonal very easily. You COULD do this with keys, by pushing AW or WD for example, but that's awkward, and makes it hard to use abilities. As for the ergonomics, it is very comfortable for my hand, and I have no complaints there. It also has some weight to it, which is nice, as it doesn't slide around.     Here are some things that you will have to deal with if you buy the G13. None of these are major issues, but you just need to be prepared for them. The biggest one is that you will no longer have a correspondence between the label of the key that you press and the label of the key that is bound in the game. For example, in a typical MMO, you would bind, say, button 1 of action bar 1 to letter B of the keyboard, then drag an ability to this button; with the G13 you will then bind a G key to letter B. This will be no problem when you create a character with the G13 installed, the macroing of the G keys will be done a few at a time as you level, and you will be able to keep track of what is what. But it will be quite a chore to start using the G13 with a fully leveled character. It will be like coming back to the game and having to re-learn all your keybindings. It has helped me to sketch out a diagram of the G13 layout on a piece of paper and note which key is bound to which for each game I play.    In some games, if you double tap a movement key, you might jump or dodge in that direction. Age of Conan for example. The thumstick is not so good at doing this. (By the way, you don't have to use the thumbstick to move. You can still bind WASD to the G keys and use it that way.)    Remember you can bind the SHIFT key (or ALT or CTRL) to one of the G keys too, like G15, and use this key just like you use the SHIFT key on the keyboard. I didn't realize this at first.    The middle key does not have a little bump on it, I forget what that bump is called, but it lets you know your fingers are on the right keys without having to look down. I solved this by using a hot knife to make a little notch in the button. I first tried putting a piece of tape on it, which worked well for a while, until it began to slide off.     That's all.
0684857219|5.0|Arnolds' encyclopedia, his first one from 1985 was my first really good bodybuilding/weight training book I bought this year and it changed my life for the good by teaching me some weightlifting basics I had been overlooking through the years of basic weight lifting a few times a week casually, and motivated me to do more serious lifting, and liked it enough that I decided to buy this new updated version, and it is a good addition to my weight training/bodybuilding library. A weight lifter or someone looking for personal fitness needs the good information in this book, but I advise purchasing several major weight lifting encyclopedias for your personal library, even if you have to buy some used and cheaply priced, my recommendations are defitinely get the Bill Pearl \\"Keys to the Inner Universe\\" and \\"Getting Stronger\\", Weider \\"Ultimate Bodybuilding\\", and one other bodybuilding encyclopedia I bought for reference is the Robert Kennedy \\"Bodybuilding, the complete A-Z book on musclebuilding\\", and a couple of other minor smaller books for variety of information given, though for Arnold, I am limiting my purchases to the encyclopedia for right now.  My favorite sections are the double split systems mentioned, not that alot of my other books don't have those listed as well, and the good pictures from the good old days of bodybuilding and its sheer size really.  Funny, the old book had bold lettering stating it was an encyclopedia, with Arnold's name in smaller print, now the newer version has his name in rather large bold print, and in smaller print the encyclopedia words, wow, what a difference almost a quarter century made, you will find in the new updated version more pics of Arnold in his various movie roles.  And of course, there is no reason lifters need any dangerous banned substances like anabolics to cheat their way up the success ladder, most of these encyclopedias warn and talk of the dangers associated with this sport and activity associated with \\"juicers\\" and\\"getting juiced\\", and Arnolds encyclopedia has an ample section pertaining to the dangers of, etc.    AND, I want to make it clear this book was updated with alot of newer information circa 1999, the latest medical knowledge, latest nutrition advice, along with changing out pictures of bodybuilders as examples that were current for the late 90's(though the color photo section of the 1985 book was changed to black and white photos this time), and I really do not believe there have been any real extra breakthroughs since 1999 in the last eleven years, so I believe this book is pretty much \\"current\\" in my opinion, and I can't imagine getting into serious weight training without having this book with others as reference.  It's also fifty more pages than the older version.

While I work on my laptop, while driving in my car, everywhere I go the Platinum Collection goes with me. I think we lost one of the best singers we have ever known when we lost Freddie Mercury. I would recommend this collection to any one who loves rock, definately one of the best rock collections out there!
0393072231|4.0|I have been a fan of Michael Lewis ever since I first read Trail Fever, a humorous and insightful look into a republican primary race.    This book provides an insightful (and occasionally humorous) look into the events that led up to the recent economic meltdown.  Try as I might on my own, I could not really sort through all the different terms and finger-pointing that surrounded the economic crisis.      Michael Lewis' book was extremely helpful in this.  While I am still not completely confident in my grasp of the situation and how we got here, I at least feel that I have the beginning of an understanding.  The bottom line seems to be a warning not to trust your money to Wall Street... at best, they are stupid; at worst, they are crooks.  The casinos seem to have more government oversight than the financial sector.  Hopefully, Michael Lewis' book will help change that.
1416905014|5.0|The Pop-Up Fairy Tale book is a great mixture of childhood fantasy and beautiful construction. This book will capture the heart of a young girl in an instant. Its incredible three-dimensional forms and creative surprise pop-ups are exciting time and time again.     I purchased the pop-up book for myself, as I am experimenting with writing a pop-up book. Of all the pop-up books I have been studying, this book is far more exciting when examining its construction and playfulness.     As each page is turned the reader will be surprised and excited with the display they see before their eyes. The pretty pastel colors, sweet classic story line, and three - dimensional forms are made to capture the attention and the heart of any reader. Every spread is unique but still maintains the overall story.    A particular spread that stands out in the book is with Cinderella and her horse drawn carriage.  The horses rise slowly from the pages and the carriage springs into a beautiful sphere. The whole spread is unique and beautiful.     Cinderella is a classic childhood story that has been told in many different formats. The pop-up book is another exciting way to tell the beloved story.  It will become a timeless part of any collection or a lasting memory for any young reader.

(You can read about that over at Wikipedia.)<br />Book 1, was mediocre until the end, at which point he flips a protagonist into an antagonist.<br />This book was mostly from the point of view of Lyra, the main character.<br />Book 2 and Book 3... he spends whole sections going off talking about the world (as though he were Tolkien, WHICH HE IS NOT), and occasionally he gets around to telling more of Lyra's adventure.<br /><br />This is also the only story I've read where God was turned into a pathetic antagonist, and I mean pathetic.<br />Yeah, you read that right, he TRIED turning the creator of the universe into the \\"bad guy\\".<br />(Some people might view it as anti-Christian... but really it doesn't even merit the effort to argue it at that level...)<br /><br />...its just ANTI-good-STORY-TELLING.<br />Like I said it was a literary exercise, and he FAILS MISERABLY at the exercise.<br /><br />SKIP IT.<br />SAVE YOUR MONEY!<br />IT SUCKS!<br />IT IS THAT BAD.<br /><br />Oh, and this is one case where the story of the MOVIE of Book 1, is MUCH better than the book!<br />The writers of the movie script actually knew how to tell a story.
B000001GXE|5.0|During the early seventies, three batons seemed to illuminate the great international stages with resplendent talent. The young promise Michael Tilson Thomas, the unforgettable Istvan Kertesz and Carlos Kleiber.<br /><br />Kleiber was visibly the most introverted of these glories. He always kept a low profile. And very selective. His negative to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic (when Karajan passed away) became him a cult personality, acclaimed by the great audiences. The Vienna and the Bavarian Orchestras were the most favored by his charisma and coup of grace. He emblematized the music by itself and his achievements were hovered by powerful attacks and sublime expressiveness with out ostentation or selfish behavior.<br /><br />This Unfinished withstood the test of time and still is regarded as one of the supreme milestones of the recorded versions ever.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Third is very good. But there's an insurmountable version. Kertesz- Vienna.<br /><br />Don't miss it.
B0002DB52M|5.0|Dogville works on many levels, but I suggest that it is primarily an allegory of almost Biblical proportions.    This is mainly confirmed near the end, when the true power dynamic is revealed and the apocalyptic ending unfolds in dramatic fashion.     There are many sub-themes on the journey to the Apocalypse, including slavery, witch hunts, racism and the suppression/exploitation of women, but for me, the greatest commentary is the way it plays out an almost Christian hybrid of Old/New Testament values.    When we discover Grace's relationship to the unknown man in the limo, there is almost a suggestion that she was 'sent' into Dogville, the way Jesus Christ was sent to Earth in order to teach by example and transform people's lives and thinking, only to be ultimately persecuted and betrayed.    The stark, Old Testament 'payback' ending will shock some viewers and be uplifting to others, depending on whom you identify with during the story unfoldment.    It is a long and at times slow movie, but if you can work with the deliberately minimalist theater-like sets, it is well worth your time.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|Just wanted to add another five star vote for this movie.  It was a positive experience!<br /><br />When I think of the positive aspects of the film, any minor inaccuracies, oversentimentality, questions about why the protagonists didn't build a house for the dog, etc. etc., take a back-row seat. After all, the film industry seldom gives such a perspective on the benefits and the costs of loyalty and patience.  Good job and thanks.
0446563048|5.0|Delivering Happiness is further proof that the workplace doesnft have to be hostile and ruthless in order for companies to succeed.  In his exciting and insightful book, Tony Hsieh explains how his career evolved from starting an unsuccessful worm farm business as a child to investing in and managing Zappos, the online shoe retailer, as its revenues grew from nothing in 1999 to over $1 billion in gross sales in less than ten years.    Zappos was able to build such a successful brand because it created and developed a culture that was focused on treating onefs customers and coworkers well.  Hsieh realized that unparalleled service is critical in order to thrive in competitive markets such as shoe retailing, and that happy employees are best equipped to provide great service to customers.    Zapposfs culture is based on ten core values, which include:    ¡Create Fun and A Little Weirdness  ¡Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication  ¡Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit  ¡Be Humble    While many companies claim to support values such as building a family spirit, Zappos has truly weaved these values into its DNA.  For example, Hsieh describes how Zappos has developed a recruiting process that helps filter out potential bad bosses.  Hsieh writes, gBe Humble is probably the core value that ends up affecting our hiring decisions the most.  There are a lot of experienced, smart, and talented people we interview that we know can make an immediate impact on our top or bottom line.  But a lot of them are also really egotistical, so we end up not hiring them.  At most companies, the hiring manager would probably argue that we should hire such a candidate because he or she will add a lot of value to the company, which is probably why most large corporations donft have great cultures.  Our philosophy at Zappos is that wefre willing to make short-term sacrifices (including lost revenue or profits) if we believe that the long-term benefits are worty it.  Protecting the company culture and sticking to core values is a long-term benefit.h    With regards to building a positive team and family spirit, the goal at Zappos is gto create an environment that is friendly, warm, and exciting.h  The key to developing a healthy work environment is to have bosses gthat lead by example and are both team followers as well as team leaders.h  Whereas most companies are organized and managed according to a top-down hierarchical structure, Hsieh and other Zappos executives gbelieve that in general, the best ideas and decisions are made from the bottom up, meaning by those on the front lines that are closest to the issues and/or the customers.  The role of a manager is to remove obstacles and enable his/her direct reports to succeed.  This means the best leaders are servant-leaders.  They serve those they lead.  The best team members have a positive influence on one another and everyone they encounter.  They strive to eliminate any kind of cynicism and negative interations.  Instead, the best team members are those that strive to create harmony with each other and whoever else they interact with.h    If more companies developed a culture like Zappos, then workplace bullying probably wouldnft be such a widespread problem and people wouldnft need to rely on services like eBossWatch to evaluate the work environment at potential employers.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|Indie features are a mixed bag, sometimes delightful, fresh and surprising; just as often pretentious, boring, self-conscious film school projects masquerading as \\"Important Cinema\\".  I am happy to report that `(500) Days of Summer' is the former, powered by two marvelous, naturalistic performances from the leads and just enough stylized whimsy to be charming rather than grating.    Tom (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) isn't completely miserable in his go-nowhere job as a copywriter at a third-rate greeting card company, but he is starting to wonder if this stop-gap job that he took when he gave up on his dream of being an architect might be where he stays stuck forever.  Then Summer (Zooey Deschanel) starts working as the boss's new assistant, making the office suddenly a whole lot more interesting as Tom and his disaffected cubicle mates speculate about the new girl.  Too shy to make a move, Tom has just decided that a girl that beautiful must be way too stuck up to ever speak to the likes of him when Summer strikes up a conversation in the elevator about the music on Tom's Ipod.  This tissue-paper thin opening leads, over the course of several months into a burgeoning office romance, at least on Tom's part.  Summer is, as she admits freely up front, a non-believer in true love due to her parents' awful divorce and is just looking for casual, uncomplicated companionship.  For a while, Tom is so thrilled just to be in her company, that seems like enough.  But it's not, really--Tom is a deep and profound romantic, (aka `the girl' in this relationship) and in Summer he is convinced he has found his \\"One\\".  He figures that with enough time, Summer will come around to his way of thinking: that they are a great match and belong together.  In the meantime, they give a pretty good impression of being a couple in Tom's mind, doing `coupley' things like pretend-shopping for furniture at IKEA and having sex.  For Tom the latter is a pretty profound thing that seems to seal the deal,but the free-spirited, bohemian Summer regards their encounters as just another of the `benefits' of keeping things casual.  When the inevitable day comes (somewhere in the 200s) that Summer tires of their arrangement and ends it, a devastated Tom shuffles through his pack of memories, trying to determine how he could have misread things so completely, not able to accept that he was in love all alone.    Joseph Gordon-Leavitt is that rarest of commodities: a child star that has transitioned successfully into adult roles.  On \\"Third Rock from the Sun\\" he played an old soul trapped in the body of a young boy, and finally the rest of him has caught up with those world-weary eyes.  Joe has grown up very well, and here gets to play a character whose age mirrors his own, imbuing Tom with all the alternating moods--angst, exuberance, confidence and insecurity--that come along with first love.  As the elusive Summer, Deschanel has a trickier role; it would be very easy to hate Summer for failing to love Tom back, but we don't.  We feel the regret of something that would have been great had it worked out, but in the end, their failure to gel as a couple is nobody's fault.   Not many movies actually deserve the label `dramedy', but I'd say this is one, equal parts levity and pain, just like life itself.  Ultimately love is out there to be found, it says . . we just have to go through the `Not-the-Ones' first.  As painful as that can be, the reward at the end makes the necessary pain worthwhile.
B00018D44U|1.0|It's hard to tell where to begin. Norah has a beautiful voice and can sing country music. The music I heard was not country it was just bad. The song's lyrics were beyond bad. The arrangements were more than jazz inspired(they were jazz). If you are going to sing country, sing country songs with country arrangements. It's all rather simple.
B00337KM2S|3.0|On the face of it, I get why George Clooney is a Huge Movie Star.  It goes without saying just exactly why Gorgeous George is, well, gorgeous.  Clooney exudes that kind of Old Hollywood glamour and masculine charisma of manly-men actors of eras past.  There is even something very reminiscent of Cary Grant in that famous Batman jaw line and the insouciant way that George wears his clothes.  The man is a bona fide Movie Star, creating massive red carpet excitement wherever he goes.   And yet, despite all of George's considerable charms, his film work leaves me absolutely cold and reluctant to put him in the top drawer of American actors.  Somehow I can't shake the inescapable feeling that what we see of Clooney is exactly all there is to get, and that for all of his box-office charisma, George is a very limited actor, with a stock-in-trade of essentially one persona.  It seems like when I go to a Clooney picture, I am getting the same variation on a theme over and over again.  Clooney can't stop playing Doug Ross, the maverick pediatric surgeon that made Clooney a star on \\"ER\\"--except that on the small screen, it worked.  Doug Ross was a great creation, a character for the ages, and it could be argued that the show suffered a fatal blow that it never quite recovered from when Clooney hung up his scrubs.  Was Doug Ross simply an extension of Clooney, the man, and that's why the two blended effortlessly into one another?  Maybe.  But George plays all of his big-screen characters more or less like extensions of himself, too, which gives each of his roles an odd feeling of déjà vu.  Clooney is a Big Name in Hollywood, and it's a marquee name, with the chops to open a picture and open it big.  But Big Name is not synonymous with Big Talent, alas.  George is kind of like a male Sandra Bullock, who, recent Oscar win notwithstanding, is a Movie Star for the same reason that Clooney is: she looks good and can be relied upon to deliver the same likeable performance again andagain playing essentially a variation on her own likeable down-home self.    I could be confusing the man with a carefully-constructed façade, I suppose.  If so, what an elegant façade it is!  Even Cary Grant once said, famously: \\"Even I wish I were Cary Grant.\\"  Does George ever wake up wishing that he, too, could be George Clooney?  There was one time I can recall that George bucked the `Clooney' persona and gave a surprising and hilarious screen performance, in \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?'  That is, sadly, the only Clooney performance I ever wholeheartedly enjoyed, because it was the only performance I know of where George stopped being a brand long enough to actually, well, ACT.      Which brings us the long way `round to the most recent addition to the Clooney canon, \\"Up in the Air\\".  I finally screened this in the full knowledge that no way could it be as fantastic as all the praise heaped on it at awards time.  It wasn't.  But it is a case of art imitating life to such a degree that it is spooky.  This role of the high-flying corporate `facilitator of redundancies' is such a perfect meshing of the Clooney persona with a role that it HAD to be created just for George by director/screenwriter Jason Reitman.  I wonder if Mr. Clooney ever, in a few moments of solitude, reflected just how much this character is like himself, and whether that gave him any sort of pause.  After all, Mr. Clooney, like his character, is a dedicated bachelor in his late 40s who, until very recently, never finished out a calendar year with the same girlfriend on his arm.  Like his character, Mr. Clooney must enjoy exhaustive air travel, owning as he does a villa in Lake Cuomo, Italy.  George is living a life that is the envy of every ticket-buying man in the world right now, but one wonders if, in those quiet moments George ever asks himself if an enviable lifestyle passes for a meaningful life.  I wonder.  The realization that it isn't is one that his character, Ryan Bingham, comes to, tardily, but he's been so glib during the proceeding hour-plus, it's hard to sympathize.  Clooney seems destined to have slights and arrows just roll off his back, even when he tries to emote the angst of a less successful man.  The suave Clooney facade doesn't extend to projecting emotional gravitas.    They say that great acting is that in which the heavy lifting never shows.  George makes it look so very easy, that by that definition, he should be one of our greatest actors of all time.  But I think he's not so much skillfully hiding the seams of his craft as there's no `there' there to show.  I could be very wrong.  He could actually belong in the `minimalist' school of acting exemplified by the likes of Cary Grant, Robert Redford or another current practitioner, Clive Owen.  But I doubt it.  I think we have allowed ourselves to become so distracted by Gorgeous George's window-dressing that we have lost sight of he fact that for all his pleasing physical proportions, he is not an actor of heft.  Even Brad Pitt, for whom things have often seemed to come too easily onscreen as well has given us some interesting efforts that buck his Hollywood hunk stereotype.   Gorgeous George seems quite content to exist at the Hollywood hunk level.  And why not, when the payday is so great and he has been endowed by his Creator with the genes for hunkdom?  Why work harder than you have to?  When you look like George, that seems like a no-brainer.  Too bad they couldn't somehow bottle \\"Eau de Clooney\\" so we could all at least smell a little bit like George.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|I first started watching the LOST series because it began as a modern day Robinson Crusoe or Swiss Family Robinson tropical island adventure. The show delivered intigue as we discovered all the \\"baggage\\" that each survivor brought to the island. I bought in to the Dharma story line and began to appreciate each character for his/her strengths and flaws.   The flash forwards and flash backwards were confusing, but forced the viewer to pay attention. The flash \\"sideways\\" brouht a ray of hope to the viewers who became attched to the characters. Then the final episode was a cruel slap in the face. Maybe I'm too much of a romantic or optimist to accept the final conclusion that everybody struggled for three years only to just die. So much for happy endings!!!  No, I'm not going to order the final season DVD set. Veiwing it once was disappointing enough.
0446563048|5.0|I highly recommend this book to any entrepreneur as well as corporate executives who are serious about their commitment to create enduring success for their business. The formula, that is both simple, but still so hard to executie is: Purpose, Passion and Profits. Although in the book the order is the other way around, it is really this order that generates sustained business success. Tony writes in a very direct and refreshing style about his personal development journey and how it has influenced his entrepreneurial endeavors. He clearly is an entrepreneur at heart, but what he has learned by experience really does apply to any successful business undertaking. It all culminates in the rise of [...], which is a great branding story and at the very core of it all is a commitment to creating happiness for customers, employees, vendors and shareholders. As an experienced Brand Builder, who passionately believes in the value of brand purpose as I have experienced the power of it, I highly applaud Tony for taking it one step further from \\"serving consumers\\" to \\"creating happiness\\".  Do yourself a personal favor and pick up the book. It is a pleasant read and if you truly \\"listen\\" to the message, it will change your life for ever.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|I love Michael Moore. There I've said it! This guy makes movies that are never mainstream for a reason - most people in this country are much more interested in the latest 'wardrobe malfunction' that in the truth. If we could only get people like Mr. Moore elected to serve in Washington then maybe, just maybe, we (and the nation) would stand a chance of surviving the current turmoil intact. Everyone alive in the U.S.A. today should watch this (agree with the politics or not) and see just how the corporate powers-that-be are really running our country. I may be the fool but I don't believe thats what the founding fathers had in mind. Watch this mans movies and actually learn something.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes with your food before it reaches your plate? While most of us might not realize exactly what goes into our food, or at times not even think about it. But director Robert Kenner and his production team seek to bring out the truth about what goes on behind the scenes of the food industry and make it transparent so we all know the truth about what goes into our food so we can make more decisions about what we put into our body.    There's a lot of mystery in what goes on with our food. Whether it's ingredients we have no idea what they are, or whether it's the general process through which our food goes through, there's a lot that we don't know. The food industry hasn't really helped us in finding out either. Shrouding the farms that work for major industry markets in secrecy, and restaurant chains fighting tooth in nail to avoid giving us nutritional values for the meals we eat it seems as though the food industry as something to hide.    As depicted in Food, Inc. the food industry does have a lot to hide. Not only do the ingredients that go into our food seem less than savory, but their deplorable treatment of stock animals, farmers, and workers are enough to make anyone sick to their stomach. The filmmakers don't just attack their query though, they try to present both sides of the story from the consumer to the market leaders, unfortunately in the case of the market leaders they more often than not decline to be interviewed. And while this documentary might not answer all of our questions about the food industry, it definitely does a great job at helping us realize that things must change.    In the end Food Inc. doesn't just tell us about our food, but how the industry has changed things in America altogether. From appointed government officials who formerly worked for big name corporations and have influenced legislation on their behalf, to the food industry's influence on illegal immigration this film approaches all aspects of the trade. I highly recommend this film, not only to open your eyes to what your eating, but to help you understand how and why things need to change.    5/5

1591841666|4.0|They say that quitters never win.  Well, that's true, a lot of the time.  But often there is profound wisdom in knowing WHEN to abandon an endeavor and move on to something else, versus staying the course.  This book gives you the tools you need to evaluate situations and circumstances where quitting may be the best thing to do.  Move through the \\"dip\\" or quit?  The choice is up to you!
0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's, Outliers;  The Story of Success, is an interesting and easy read about the factors contributing to success.  Gladwell theorizes that those ultra-successful individuals in society, otherwise known as \\"outliers\\", owe their success to numerous factors other than outstanding personal characteristics and effort.  While these individuals are truly talented, Gladwell compares them to similarly talented individuals with little or no relative success to illustrate his point that the outliers benefitted from a series of opportunities upon which each one capitalized to become ultra successful.  Gladwell's work is meaningful because it illustrates that success is made and not necessarily inherent at birth.  The significance of this work is that it offers hope and strategy for those looking to grow success in themselves or others.  Talent plus effort plus opportunity holds the potential for success.  As an educator, the implications of this work speak to the importance of individualization, equal access and the provision of critical opportunities to maximize the talents of the children in our schools.

030726839X|4.0|I recently read William Manchester's two volume Churchill bio and this book just happens to pick-up right where Manchecter left off, with Churchill becoming prime minister. I like Hasting's writing and I found his treatment of contemporary public opinion, especially in Britain, to be enlightening. This book seems well balanced without diminishing Churchill's well-deserved stature among 20th century leaders.

044654146X|4.0|If you are looking for the key to success for Israel's tech businesses, this book is a good source to outline the conditions that have been necessary to achieve success. Israel has only recently been something of a model in huge success stories (maybe 20 years). All of this despite a basically socialist system of government.    Where there real success began, socialism retreated, however they still have government supplied infrastructure and medical systems. Where I think they differ from the European and American models, is that the citizens do not necessarily look for more and more handouts. The government was originally 100% socialist, but has recently allowed more privitazation, eg. in starting venture capitalist funds, in banking, in biotech.    This book would be useful for someone who is looking for the keys in encouraging economic success.
0446563048|5.0|If you had lived in the neighborhood where Tony Hsieh grew up, you might have met an earnest little door to door salesman just discovering his entrepreneurial spirit. Now at the ripe old age of 36, Hseih shows us the path that took him from selling earthworms and photo buttons to running the success story known as Zappos.<br /><br />As highly publicized as Hsieh and his company have been, his new book Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose  tells a far more complex story. In the first part of the book, we get to know Hsieh; in the second part we get to see the evolution of the unique culture that is Zappos.<br /><br />Hsieh's story is so captivating (and I assume that his youth contributes to his recall of details) that you may find yourself identifying with his ups and downs--and cheering for him even though you know how the story  turns out.<br /><br />To my delight, I discovered Tony Hsieh and I have a number of things in common.<br /><br />1. We both became fascinated with mail order when we were kids.<br /><br />2. We both adopted Las Vegas as our hometown.<br /><br />3. We both believe that business is about much more than just making money.<br /><br />4. We both look for lessons from diverse places (i.e. poker) and apply them to running a successful business.<br /><br />Many people start a business because they fall in love with a product or an idea for a service. Then there are people like Hsieh who are fascinated and challenged by  the entrepreneurial journey.<br /><br />By his own admission, Hsieh isn't all that crazy about shoes, but bringing them to the marketplace in an innovative way seems downright thrilling.<br /><br />Happily, for the reader, you don't have to dream of building an online empire in order to find the useful ideas in Delivering Happiness. There's a stunning lack of corporate hubris and plenty of examples of how Zappos walks the talk every single day in each and every part of the business.<br /><br />Numerous Zappos folks share their stories giving us even clearer insight into how the much-quoted core values influence their daily lives. Even the story of how those values evolved shows us that this is not a business as usual operation.<br /><br />While each of Zappos' core values is described in great detail, it seems obvious to me that they provide a foundation for building a standout operation, even if you're a one-person enterprise--or a school or nonprofit organization.<br /><br />You're going to be seeing Tony Hsieh and hearing a lot about Delivering Happiness in the coming weeks. I urge you to pay attention. This isn't just a smart book--it's a wise one as well.core values influence their daily lives.

B001LF347E|4.0|I am really enjoying this series so far.  I was a little heartbroken when the BBC cancelled Robin Hood, which was great (five stars in my opinion) but am glad they have another period show on again.  Maybe at some point the USA will catch on and start making some tv shows that revolve around friendship, history/legend, and moral chivalry instead of sex and skinny, cranky girls...just saying.  Anyhow, it is about Merlin, a young magician and Prince Arthur, heir to Camelot.  You also get to meet Gwen, a \\"serving girl\\" of sorts, and Morgana, ward of King Uther, and Gaius, physician to the throne.  There is also a dragon that becomes Merlin's advisor sort of.  The relationships between characters in this show is what makes it endearing.  Gaius is looking after Merlin for his mother because magic and socery has been outlawed.  Merlin can't seem to not use it, but keeps it quiet.  However it seems Morgana also has the \\"sight\\" unbeknown to Merlin.  And the adventure begins!  For example: they save a young druid boy, fight a wraith, and find out what is magically poisoning the water supply of Camelot.  This show is light hearted and family oriented!  Nicely done BBC!
B00099BPP6|3.0|The obvious rap against this Rigoletto from 1965 is that Fischer-Dieskau is devoid of Italian style. Yet on the whole he's one of the strengths of this set, which has far worse problems elsewhere. The timbre of F-D's voice doesn't sound any more wrong (or right) than Thomas Hampson's when he sings Verdi. On the other hand, it's refreshing to do without the conventional claptrap that too often colors portrayals of Rigoletto, and if you compare F-D's inventive account, which is full of ideas, to the bellowing Sherrill Milnes on the famous set with Pavarotti and Sutherland, the former wins hands down. He's also in great voice, making many passages quite thrilling as pure singing. Now that we live in an era when even a respectable Rigoletto is hard to find, F-D sounds better and better.<br /><br />I referred to serious problems elsewhere, and for me they begin with Kubelik, whose conducting is too often slack and insipid. He coasts through \\"La donna e moblie\\" without the slightest punch or vitality. That is a harbinger of many dull stretches to come. One must also blame the conductor for the scrappy playing of the La Scala orchestra; one knows that they must have been bored to tears, but ensemble is poor throughout. finally, Carlo Bergonzi, doesn't bother t make the Duke anything but a mild-mannered exercise in vocalizing. Didn't anyone clue him in that the duke is a cynical cad? Two minutes' comparison with Pavarotti, Bjorling, or Domingo laughs Bergonzi out of court.<br /><br />Which leave Renata Scotto, then thirty, and a potentially great Gilda. Thee's a heart-stopping account under Giulini, also from La Scala, that proves her dramatic abilities, but it comes in truly dreadful sound on Opera d'Oro. Here the voice is in very good shape and not remotely as shrill as it would soon become. Callas began a tradition of turning this demure, suffering girl into something stronger dramatically. Scotto takes her lead, offering a poignant portrayal that is miles away from Sutherland the superhuman canary. Even Kubelik's tepid conducting can't ruin \\"Caro nome,\\" which is magnificently shaped both vocally and psychologically.<br /><br />In the end this is the most mixed of mixed bags, with Scotto and F-D being the whole show. They sound more like brother and sister than father and daughter, yet if you listen with open ears, two great singers create something special.human canary.

B00001R3GI|5.0|Exile on Main St. is a GREAT album. I also like most of the bonus tracks too, though at times Jagger's vocals sound too forced, especially on Plundered My Soul and Following the River. Keith does a nice job on the alternate take of Soul Survivor, sounding elegantly wasted. Also, Good Time Women, the forerunner of Tumbling Dice is a real highlight' as well as, I'm Not Signifying. If there has ever been an album from a British band that captures the underbelly of America, particulary the South, it is Exile, both lyrically and musically. You feel and smell the sweltering heat of Black churches at one hundred plus degrees(Just Wanna See His Face, Let it Loose). Boogying at dance halls (Rip This Joint, Shake Your Hips). Roadhouse Country/Blues on a hot, Southern night (Sweet Virginia, Torn and Frayed). Smokey, booze drenched saloons with loose women  Ventilator Blues, Stop Breaking Down).  The entire album is an experience. Is it the Stones best? I guess it depends on the mood I'm in at the time. Sometime I think Beggars Banquet is their best. Other times, Sticky Fingers. But Exile ranks near the top. Mick Taylor really shines. A great lead and slide player. Though I am a bit befuddled when some people say he is a superior player than Keith. On lead, yes he is. Mick T. is a classic, fluid, virtuoso. But Keith has never tried to go that route . His great rhythm and riffs have driven the Stones for years. His intro's on Rocks Off and All Down the Line are pure Keith. Could Mick T. have handled those chords? Sure. Would he have thought of them in the first place? Probably not. Keith is great at being Keith, and that is all that matters. And what would the Stones be without Charlie Watts on drums? Charlie has always said that he plays the song. And that is true more than ever on Exile. The sound quality, by the way, is fine. I've read some negative reviews about the remastering, but I can't really find fault. I guess it's just a matter of taste. Now, I'd like to comment on amore trivial matters, but ones that bug me nonethless. And that is the packaging of the deluxe CD, especially the credits on disc one. On the original album released in 1972, several musicians other than Bill Wyman were given bass credits on more than half the album. In interviews over the years, Bill W. has stated that mistakes were made on at least two tracks, All Down the Line and Shine a Light, in which Bill Plummer and Mick T. were given credit, respectfully, when it was actually Bill, and he is superb on both of them. Still, there were several other tracks that had Keith and the others, including Happy, Tumbling Dice, Rip this Joint, etc. Nothing against Bill W. I've always liked him, felt he was underrated, and at times, underappreciated, and felt it was a shame that his bass playing was at times hijacked by Keith R., Mick T., Ron W.,and others. But on disc one of the reissue, every track has a bass credit for Bill W. Some tracks have as many as three bass credits. (Just Wanna See His Face) Also, some tracks have horn credits, when no horns were played, such as Shine a Light, and Black Angel, to name two. I also never understood why there were so many photos of Mick J. on the front and inside of the album, and so few of the others. I realize Mick has always been the front man, but come on! There were four other members at the time. Just had to get those few things off my chest. Exile on Main St. is and always will be about the music. How does it make you feel? I just listened to it for the umpteenth time as I'm writing this, and I feel great.

B000H1RFKA|5.0|Shane Black's directorial debut is the sort of film that one can enjoy immensely as long as one is willing to go along for the ride.  That ride has to take place somewhere; in this case it takes place in Los Angeles.  The first frames to show Downey's character Harry Lockhart come from the shallow end of a swimming pool, so we the audience see Harry the same way everyone else at that Christmas party sees him. Considering just how shallow the image-driven culture of Los Angeles appears to the rest of the civilized world, I can understand and appreciate that skewed angle underwater.  In his youth, Harry was a magician, but now he's just a petty thief.  Both vocations require someone who's good with his hands, and Harry is.  What Harry's not so good at is figuring out this whole L.A. thing.  I mean, life must have been so much simpler back in the Big Apple where he was discovered by a big time movie producer, albeit quite by accident.  What Harry needs more than anything is someone who can steer him straight on L.A.'s curvy roads.<br /><br />That's where Val Kilmer as Gay Perry comes in; Harry is being considered for a part as a private detective and who better to train him than a licensed private detective?  Oh, and Gay Perry is gay, but his homosexuality is quite incidental to his character.  As a matter of fact, Perry is clearly the more manly of the two.<br /><br />Harmony captures Harry's locked heart.  Actually, she captured it all the way back in high school without ever quite realizing it.  She came out to L.A. from southern Indiana in order to save her sister from her father.  Her sister came all the way out to L.A. to find who she mistakenly thinks is her real father.  If it all becomes confusing, just take heart in the fact that NONE of these characters understand what is going on any better than we do.<br /><br />What [[ASIN:B000H1RFKA Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]] does best is that it allows the protagonist to befriend the audience, and it is for that admittedly subjective reason that I love this film.  The plot elements are clear if you're willing to look hard enough, but what is more important is what the characters learn about themselves from experiencing that which they do not completely understand.  The acting, scene pacing, and cinematography are all top notch, but a little more clarity in the storytelling itself wouldn't have hurt, but that is the ONLY complaint I have.  All in all, this stands up to repeated viewings better than most!<br /><br />If this sounds like your cup of tea, then I would whole-heartedly recommend getting the blu-ray disc.  Not only is the cinematography top notch, but the color treatment of the 35mm film is absolutely one of the most beautiful treatments I've ever seen!  The brightness of the reds against the softness of the blue hues in the bar scene where Harry is trying to win Harmony over are some of the most best images I've seen on a Blu-ray disc.love this film.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|This is a good movie, much better than the previous version with Harry Hamlin. It is was filmed and edited very well and the special effects were very great. The story was mostly focused on action and did not pay attention to the story underlying this movie. It was all chop, chop, chop, then some talk and maybe a little more talk, but then back to chop, chop, chop. All in all, it was not a bad movie. It was just good and entertaining.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|I have no doubt that this album has been deeply, thoughtfully analyzed to the last breath.  I'm just going to speak from the perspective of a long-time Dylan non-fan.  For years, I felt that Dylan's best song was Al Yankovic's palindromic \\"Bob\\".  I never could make sense out of Dylan's 'Tiger Lovin' Blues' (or whatever the real title was), and never felt it was worth the effort for any of his works.  This album is different.  Dylan's shattered, wrecked voice has never sounded so good; for the first time, I really see him as a master - listening to this album is like listening to, say, Ralph Stanley nowadays - the voice is shot, but what he does with it is fantastic.  This album is sort of the distilled essence of blues; the words are often bleak (and sometimes completely indecipherable), but the songs make you feel good.  This album is simply pure pleasure from start to end.  Buy it - you owe it to Mr. Dylan and every one of his magnificent band.
B001R10BEG|5.0|That stood out to me the most - having never seen all of these scenes that were edited from the theater and DVD editions.  Some are good...some are very good and some were thankfully cut.  I don't want to give away any.  The blu-ray quality is terrific too.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have seen 'The Godfather' films so many times I've lost count. I also own the 6 VHS director's cut which puts the three films together in chronological order and adds well over an hour of great footage(the best version by far!). I was contemplating buying the new restored Blu Ray edition and I'm very glad I decided to go ahead and buy it.<br /><br />Like a lot of other reviewers have stated the films look better than they ever did, but naturally they do not look like state of the art films made in 2010. The Blu Ray version is a noticeable improvement and the films look bright and as clear as they will ever look. Coppola wanted a certain grainy look and to remove it completely would be like scrubbing the grit out of The Rolling Stones classic album 'Exile On Main Street'! Of course I'm talking mainly about the first film as part II looks better although many scenes are still dark, they are as bright as they will ever be. Part III looks exceptional and helps the overall experience of the film since it is by far the least of the three. The extras disc is full of hours of good stuff for hard core fans to navagate through including the extras from the 2001 DVD release which was a nice addition.<br /><br />The first film is the greatest mob film ever made with the second film rating a very close tie with 'Goodfellas' for second place. Part II has a much more ambitious story and probably deserves top seed, but the character's of Don Vito(Marlon Brando), Tessio(Abe Virgoda), Clemenza(Bruno Kirby) and Sonny(James Caan)are sorely missed in part 2. That's not to say that the second film doesn't have great characters, I just prefer the original characters to part II.<br /><br />What is incredible is the casting of Don Vito(Robert DeNiro), Clemenza(Bruno Kirby) and Tessio(John Aprea) in part II, it's very believable that these young guys are those older guys in the first film. I also think that the very underrated John Cazale gives a fantastic performance in part II as Fredo. As good as Pacino is in these films, he is not very likable and I find the other characters more appealing and interesting. I could have watched an entire film just following the young Don, Clemenza and Tessio for part II.<br /><br />I know the third film has been bashed to bits, but how could part III have not been a disappointment? With what it had to live up to, it's surprising it was ever made. I have grown to like it more over the years. If only Duvall and Coppola could have come to a money agreement, I think the film would have been much better. For one it would have added another brilliant actor in the film and maybe that would have forced Coppola to edit out some of the religious overload.<br /><br />If you have a Blu Ray player this is a must have as these films will probably never look better.My only gripe is they should have made this a deluxe box set with the director's cut of all three films included too, it has never seen a DVD release. I guess, I won't be retiring my VCR just yet. It's an amazing piece of work with a lot of stuff that was cut out of the original films.

0670021652|5.0|I loved Eat, Pray, Love and this book is written in the same style and voice.  Gilbert is both knowledgeable and personal.  I loved her descriptions about what she loves about her man and her 'list' of what he'd have to put up with if he married her.  And I loved his response.  Although this book is full of facts and research, it's a wonderful love story, too.
0307454541|1.0|The actual English translation of the Swedish title is...\\"Men Who Hate Women.\\"  Sure wouldn't have purchased it with that title and must be some brainy marketing stooge figured I wouldn't either.  But the author should be given credit, at least, for not intending to dupe the reader.  It is a book about men who hate women.<br /><br />Having suffered through this poorly constructed novel with bland writing, shallow characters, dull narrative interspersed with grizzly episodes, I grieve for anyone who enjoyed it.  Hard to imagine that mutilating, burning, sexually humiliating and stoning women and torturing animals to death can be a good read. And like the Twilight series, it gives one pause to consider a society that embraces such a work with the degree of celebrity that this mediocre piece enjoys.<br /><br />BTW the dragon tattoo is a complete red herring.
B00005ASOI|3.0|I just saw this for the first time. I always knew of the rave reviews and it has been mentioned in almost every horror film documentary I've ever seen and figured that for a horror fan like myself, it was imperative to see it.<br /><br />I see why it got it's classic status, but I think it's a tad overrated and I had my expectations just a little too high. Argento has a certain style I appreciate, but I feel ambivalent about it. Almost like I'm supposed to like it as opposed to it just being my guttural reaction.<br /><br />This movie was hard to follow first off. The sound quality is very poor making it difficult to follow. I later learned it was because the sound was dubbed in much later and was evidently shot without sound. But nonetheless it's distracting when the sound gets out of sync with actors mouths. That explains it, but doesn't make it any easier to follow the movie. At times it's far too loud, others so quiet I couldn't turn up the tv loud enough to understand the mumblings of the actors. Then the sound effects and background scoring is suddenly jarring at high volume and not in a good way.<br /><br />I get the dream-like state of Argento's personal style and this movie definitely has it. But it's a little disconnected at times making it hard to understand and at times I felt like \\"What did I miss?\\" \\"When did that happen?\\". It doesn't flow very well in my humble opinion. It reminds me of being very drugged with painkillers to the point of being half awake, half asleep and some things just being unreal and later on when one comes to, is wondering what was reality and what wasn't. It's just unsettling, not frightening.<br /><br />The film making in general for this is good. I loved seeing the spectacular European contemporary sets and it has surreal moments that completely feel like a nightmare. The \\"special effects\\" are without doubt a very dating quality to the movie, but I sort of enjoy the \\"red paint\\" blood horror movie era.<br /><br />The acting is good and I wouldn't complain about it most of the time. It certainly has an old-fashioned 70's era horror film feel to it which personally I enjoy. I'll probably watch it again at some point just to be thorough, but I'm not sure I'd add this one to my personal collection.<br /><br />In short, I can completely appreciate it in it's own time and culture as a good piece of film making, but I wouldn't describe it as \\"scary\\". More unsettling and disturbing and bit suspenseful but lacks a big climax. The plot is a lot like Rosemary's Baby, which is one of my personal favorites.most of the time.

B0034U4QLM|5.0|First of all,there are 2 versions: CD only & deluxe with CD & DVD.  I purchased the deluxe version.  I received my purchase approx 10 days after ordering.  Upon receiving it I noted that the cd/dvd was encased in cardboard type casing (no jewel box plastic) it slides in the black outer case.  There is a small but gorgeous foldout poster/artwork of our Lady of Guadeloupe holding a fallen soldier,along with other artwork motifs from the different songs. On the flipside it contains all the information for each song : featured artist and musicians/instruments played.  No lyrics. A lot of the song titles are in Spanish with a few in English giving me a heads up that this was going to be a pretty unique album from the Chieftains. The Chieftains like to explore music from different cultures that usually have some sort of cultural connection in which they weave their music and songs into. I understand very little Spanish, however I love the many varied Hispanic cultures; this one focuses on the different styles of traditional Mexican music plus some little know intertwining history of Mexico and Ireland during the Spanish American war. Okay with that out of the way, I popped the CD in and I found this cd a joy to listen to.  In true Irish spirit it has the dancing/foot stomping music, to the gut wrenching songs/airs.  I watched the DVD and it is a running commentary by Paddy Maloney & Ry Cooder of the history of the San Patricios, interspersed with behind the scenes recording music for the CD with some of their guest artists.  The only song fully videotape is Luz de Luna which is awesome. This was certainly Paddy's project, it looked like he had a great time making this CD & DVD, even if you don't view the DVD the joy comes through on the CD.  I really liked this CD and gave it 5 stars; as with most music, taste is subjective. If you enjoy pure trad Irish, this is not for you.  If you like exploring other cultural music tweaked a bit with some Irish, then you will most likely enjoy it..whether you speak Spanish or not.ly enjoy it..whether you speak Spanish or not.
1844560783|3.0|First of all, I want to state that this audio book IS AN ABRIDGEMENT.  No where in the Amazon listing does it state this, and I didn't discover it myself until after I received the CDs in the mail; and even then, only after reading the fine print.  Although an abridged version was not at all what I wanted, that seems to be all that's avaiable in audio for this book at this time.<br /><br />Jamaica Inn is an intriguing story well-told; it is a Daphne Du Maurier, after all, so fine writing goes without saying.  My only complaint is that it seemed to be too short, and limited to just the action of the plot; there were no descriptive passages to tell about the scenery or set the mood.  I am guessing that all of those passages were cut out in the process of abridgement, although since I have never read an unabridged version of this book I am guessing.<br /><br />This is an overall good story, and the narration by Samantha Bond was excellent.  For me, it has served to whet my appetite to read the full and unabridged version.  I want to savor the descriptive, moody scene-setting that Du Maurier is so good at, and that I suspect was cut out in order to fit this onto 3 CDs.

0439023483|5.0|In the future the world is a hot mess.  Nature went berserk and wars broke out, leaving a haven of civilization in North America called Panem.  In the center is the Capitol, which is surrounded by 13 less-fortunate districts.  While the districts provide the Capitol with everything they need, they are also starving to death so they rebel.  The Capitol, having less man-power but more power, squashes the rebellion, completely obliterating District 13, and forcing the other 12 districts to participate in the Hunger Games.    Each year a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen from each district to battle it out in a gynormous state-of-the-art arena which is designed differently each year and equipped with cameras for viewing pleasure.  They fight to the death, the victor being wealthy for the rest of their life, and the winning district getting a variety of prizes and food.    The story centers around Katniss, a 16 year old who is the head of her family, acting as the provider since her father died in the coal mines.  She's a survivor, and illegally hunts outside the borders of District 12 with her guy-friend Gale, both of them keeping their families from starvation.      During the drawing for the 74th Annual Hunger Games, the name of Katniss's 12 year old sister is drawn.  Knowing her sister wouldn't stand a chance, Katniss volunteers to go in her place.  The boy chosen is Peeta, a classmate who once helped her out by giving her food when her family was starving.  Together they go to the Capitol, are given makeovers and paraded around before being set in the area to kill or be killed.  The only problem is, they kindof like each other.    This book is wonderfully crafted, the world is well written, the characters are so real, and the situations are woven just so that it leaves you panting for more when the book ends.      This may be considered YA but I'm 30 and devoured it.  I'm recommending it to everyone teenager and up.

B0007INZLQ|5.0|The Verdi Requiem is only one of the most incredible accomplishments of brillance that has come from the mind of a sentient being on this planet since the beginning of time.  Yea, so I like it!  If you want to hear it in a manner that the composer surely intended, this DVD will fit the bill.  The orchestra, soloists, and conductor had the pulse of this work seared into their DNA and deliver a performance that can only be described as perfect! There are moments of bliss so sublime that a stone would surely weep!  If I had to be lost forever on a desert island (so long as there is electricity on that island) let me have this disc.
0446563048|5.0|Zappos is clearly a great organisation - firstly, because of its mojo / values which describes a sort of place that many people would like to work in, and secondly, because of how well it has created a culture / organisational capability aligned to this mojo / its organisational values.<br /><br />As Hsieh notes:<br /><br />\\"It doesn't actually matter what your company's core values are.  What matters is that you have them and that you commit to them.  What's important is the alignment that you get from them when they become the default way of thinking for the entire organization.\\"<br /><br />So I've been looking forward to reading this book.<br /><br />It serves, I think, as a good overview of Zappos' culture and development, particularly for those who haven't come across it previously.  The other main thing I liked about it is that it is a very compelling and readable autobiography - not normally a format that appeals to me.  And I think Tony Hsieh's entrepreneurial mindset comes over very clearly.<br /><br />Where, personally, I'd have liked to have seen a bit more focus is on the theme of this book, and Zappos brand promise - delivering happiness.<br /><br />Tony Hsieh is clearly a very happy guy, and not just for the obvious reasons.  And the company he has created is one which enables people to be happy at work.  But I wouldn't buy this book if your own objective is to maximise your own or your organisation's happiness - I think there are other books that provide better advice on this (and it's a subject I'd love to return to and post on again myself).<br /><br />I'm also not convinced everybody's end goal is happiness as Tony Hsieh suggests.  So, for example, I think his highest level of happiness, having a higher purpose meaning, can be a goal in its own right, not just one that will deliver happiness.  In fact, I'd suggest that that higher purpose is likely to be served best by focusing on this for itself, rather than as a source of happiness - and that doing this may actually result in more happiness too.<br /><br />I was hoping to read more on Hsieh's views on this area but perhaps good ideas will now emerge from the movement he's set up.<br /><br />I've written a longer review (and included some videos) at [...]I was hoping to read more on Hsieh's views on this area but perhaps good ideas will now emerge from the movement he's set up.

0792846443|5.0|One of my all time greatest movies
B0038BZ9JU|4.0|i agree with all reviewers that loved this movie. It is great and complex, with various levels of meanings and addressing several (not entirely comfortable) issues. Her director is a talent to watch. Wasp, her previous short included in the DVD is as good as the movie itself, and in widescreen, unlike the movie. Which brings me to the issue that really made me drop a star. I don't know how it was released theatrically, because I didn't see it, but I don't think it could have been in the old Academy aspect ratio (4:3) as it's been transferred to the DVD, despite the wrong listing on Amazon UK (widescreen anamorphic). It says on the DVD, 4:3 is the ratio aproved by the director, but to my mind it doesn't serve the movie well. The picture is in many occasions just too constrained and limited, with essential visual information at times lef out. I don't understand this choice. I loved watching this film, but I felt I was missing part of the picture.
0446563048|4.0|The entire first section of the book which details the author's life and how he got to where he is today, is just too long and drawn-out. I agree that it's important to know something about Tony Hsieh (pronounced \\"shay\\") in case you wonder how he got to be the CEO and was a major builder of Zappo's, an extremely successful company. But it needs to be seriously condensed. If you want to really understand him and possibly try to emulate him, though, you should not skip this first section. Also, even this first section has good lists of advice that we can all apply, such as thoughts on evaluating market opportunities and strategy, to name just a couple.    Most of the rest of the book has the meat of the story of how Zappo's really became the success that it is, today, including many specific lists of items directly from the company. For example, Tony has shared the company's \\"Top 10 Ways to Instill Customer Service Into Your Company\\" and the book specifically addresses their hiring methodology that ensures they get people that will fit in with their customer-service-oriented culture.    The final section talks specifically about \\"happiness\\" and asks us all to consider what that is and what makes us happy. It's a mini-tutorial and workshop on the topic.    Finally:
B001FB5634|5.0|WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. YOU MAY NOT WANT TO READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT.<br /><br />2009's The Road is based on the 2006 post-apocalyptic novel of the same name, written by Cormac McCarthy. Fans of the book needn't fear that the film version has ruined the story, as it follows it fairly faithfully.<br /> The world of The Road takes place in a near future where some mysterious, disastrous occurrence has rendered the earth all but uninhabitable. Within the first few minutes of the movie, we learn that there was a night of bright light and loud concussions. After that, nothing was the same - much of the world's population was dead, along with crops, animals, and life in general. It is never explained exactly what happened, as the actual crisis is not as important as the story of survival in the aftermath.<br /> Viggo Mortensen plays the lead character of The Father, while 11-year-old Kodi Smit-McPhee plays the role of The Son. Charlize Theron is in the film briefly, and only in a series of flashbacks as The Mother. Robert Duvall also makes an appearance as the Old Man. It is strange and unusual that the characters do not have actual names; however, this is how it was portrayed in the book as well.<br /> In a time where corporations no longer exist and transportation is defunct, it is very hard for the remaining people to find food. No new cans are being rolled off the production lines, there are no mega farms subsidized by the federal government to feed the nation. Horrifyingly, many have resorted to cannibalism, and roving gangs patrol regions looking for food, whether this is fellow humans or leftover nonperishable goods.<br /> The film uses voice-over narration and flashbacks to get inside The Father's head. It offers glimpses of what life was like before the disaster happened. The Son does not know a time when life was peaceful and food was plentiful - he was born into a time of horror, strife, and starvation. The Son also has had little interaction with other children - not only are there no schools functioning, but there are few children who survived or have been born since. The Son is innocent and naïve, due to having been sheltered by his parents in his early years. Later in the film, he matures beyond his years due to what he is exposed to and the gritty realities of life in these times.<br /> The trailers for this film incorrectly portrayed it as an action movie. It most certainly is not. It is a drama, a road film, and an exploration of human character. It explores fatherhood in a nurturing, loving way (as opposed to the usual movie depiction of mothers being the involved parent). The real subject matter of The Road is not what happened, but what happened after, and how this new and horrible world affects The Man and his son.<br />The Father is focused on surviving and protecting his son, while The Son wishes to actually enjoy more of his life. The interactions between the two main characters are visceral and very realistic. Smit-McPee does well at playing a character a few years younger than his actual age. The acting chemistry between the two is palpable.<br />It is already known that times of desperation can make humans do things they wouldn't otherwise consider. Would it get as bad (cannibalism) as things are portrayed in this movie? This movie spurs thoughts of moral and ethical quandaries - what would the average person do in these times? Obviously it is wrong to kill another for meat, but would it be wrong to eat a human found by the wayside if you were starving to death? What does it mean to remain civilized in a country where civilization no longer exists? How can one insist upon holding onto their morals when they may die by doing so?<br />Throughout human history, civilization has only been able to progress once the basic needs of its citizens have been met; it is not implausible to think that if these needs were no longer easy to come by, humanity would revert to a primal, more brutal nature.<br />Our society takes so much for granted: ample supplies of food, clean water, green signs of life all around us, and that we are relatively safe while at home or travelling. This movie shows what it could mean when access to these things (luxuries in the reformed, bleak world of The Road) are all stripped away. The film is bleak and harrowing, yet at the end there is a glimpse of hope which makes it worthwhile to watch.: ample supplies of food, clean water, green signs of life all around us, and that we are relatively safe while at home or travelling.

030745455X|2.0|I had read a lot of the reviews here and couldn't wait to read the book. I was unprepared for the pornographic material. Larsson writes well and I was immediately intrigued with the story. But he also indulges in every perverted sexual fantasy a person can think of and I only read 1/3 of the book before I gave up in disgust. I kept thinking that surely this scene was the last for awhile only to read on and find myself in another explicitly detailed sex scene. The characters have the morals of alley cats. Lisbeth Salander was engaged in pedophilia, lesbianism, multiple sex partners with no \\"strings attached\\", and domination. The married Berger indulges in three ways, orgies with and without her husband and multiple affairs (all with her husband's approval). Blomkvist sleeps with every woman he encounters and particularly likes older women. Oh, and this is even before they get involved in the sex trade business. Why would people like this care about exposing the sex trade? I mean, as far as they go in their own personal lives, how do they come to a line that you aren't suppose to cross? For people like this, where is the line in the sand? What they consider harmless and fun, I consider seriously perverted. And why not go further next time? and the next time? They seem to think it's awful for the sex mafia to kidnap girls and sell them out for money. But Salander seduces a black boy in Grenada by helping him with his Algebra homework. Isn't that pedophilia? Why is it OK for her, as an adult, to take advantage of a boy? Blomkvist and Salander sleep around but then get hurt feelings because they catch each other sleeping with others?  Salander sets herself up to be raped by her guardian while she videotapes it. Then she kidnaps him, ties him up, rapes him, tattoos him with \\"...pervert\\" and then threatens to release the video if he doesn't do what she says. Meanwhile she hacks into people's computers and steals money so she can live free and easy and, oh, by the way, she kills people on an as needed basis.<br /><br />Did I mention that these characters are the \\"good guys\\"?

0446563048|5.0|I was lucky enough to receive advanced copies of Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose. The book was personally written by Tony Hsieh (CEO of Zappos) without the use of a ghostwriter.    Tony Hsieh is your everyday entrepreneur; start out small and work your way up. From worm farming as an adolescent, selling burgers and pizza for spending money in college, to the $1 billion dollar sale of Zappos to Amazon in 2009, all of those long hard days of work finally paid off for Tony.    In Delivering Happiness - A Path to Profits, Passion and Purpose, Hsieh talks about his failed attempts at worm farming as a child and selling burgers and pizza in college. He chronicles the key moments while advising and investing in Zappos and how those decisions helped him become CEO of the $1 billion a year company.    This book is not intended to help improve your bottom line. The book outlines the successes a company can enjoy when they provide a great atmosphere for their employees and customers. It's common sense.    The company culture has to be one of the biggest keys to success for Zappos. Provide a great atmosphere to work in and those positive attitudes will trickle all the way down to those repeat customers.  Employee and Customer loyalty will abound.    This is an easy read for anyone. You don't have to be an entrepreneur to appreciate the nuggets this book has to offer. This book provides great business and life lessons from a down to earth perspective.    It's about the people involved in the company, not the profits that makes Zappos successful.

B003FMTZOM|2.0|'Bionic', Christina Aguilera's follow-up to 2006's 'Back to Basics' is aptly titled; like any machine, there's a lot going on, a lot of pieces and work that goes into making things function normally, and there's always something in need of fine-tuning. 'Bionic' presents a different Christina Aguilera than we're accustomed to: one that is on the defensive, desperate to reaffirm her place amongst other music and pop stars. Unfortunately, `Bionic' is just the little album that couldn't. It's not firing on all cylinders, if it is indeed \\"bionic\\" then it is due for some heavy maintenance and servicing because this is (in my opinion) Christina Aguilera's worst album to date.<br /><br />The Good: Sound wise, 'Bionic''s strength lies with Aguilera willing to delve into so many different new sounds. If you were bored or overwhelmed by [[ASIN:B000G759LW Back to Basics]], or miss the edgy material of [[ASIN:B00006CXXU Stripped]], 'Bionic' attempts to find a middle ground to please old and new fans alike. The opening track, \\"Bionic\\", serves as a fair warning that what you're about to hear isn't typical Aguilera stuff. She raps, she lets her voice be processed, tweaked, twirked and made mechanical sounding and sets the tone that this is an album meant to make you move. Like the cover and art work suggests, the album could be said to be split into two distinct sections: there's the first half which is very electronic, dance and mechanical sounding with Aguilera's usual vocal stylings toned down if not completely eliminated in favor of raps, hyper beats and club-orientated sounds. The second half is far more organic and human sounding, favoring songs about motherhood and emotion. There are some very upbeat, pop, catchy songs such as \\"Not Myself Tonight\\", \\"Woohoo\\", \\"Prima Donna\\" and more tame, ballad-type tracks like \\"You Lost Me\\" and \\"Lift Me Up\\" that feel as if they were included to reassure fans that the old Christina Aguilera is still present underneath the layers of machines and processed vocals on other tracks. The attention given to the album art, from the cover to the inner notes and photos, is great. Christina channels a new persona, 'Madame X', with some very risque, provocative imagery. The artist responsible for the art this era, D*Face, found fun ways to play with the 'bionic' theme by manipulating some of the images to make Aguilera appear somewhat robotic.<br /><br />The Bad: While it's easy to see and accept that 'Bionic' was meant to be different and less serious than 'Back to Basics', it feels like a complete step-down from all the work Aguilera has done over the years to set herself apart as being a unique artist. Up until this release, she's never felt too concerned and worried about standing out or not being taken seriously. This album feels like a desperate attempt to convince the listeners that she's still relevant and worthy of her fame after such a long departure from the scene. Her attempt to re-invent herself into the edgy, fun, provocative singer who's more provocative and attractive than mother-like seems entirely unnecessary. What made Christina Aguilera stand out in her previous work is in fact that she didn't rely on autotune or computers to manipulate her voice to make her music interesting. Yet, 'Bionic' relies heavily on beats, voice and pitch tuning and mimicking the producers of her tracks (Sia, M.I.A., Ladytron, Peaches) and in the end, the artist is really lost within layers of sounds and beats. The first half of the album feels poorly pieced together. While \\"Elastic Love\\", \\"Glam\\", \\"Desnudate\\" are average music tracks that anyone, and I mean anyone, could have pulled off. Lyrically, Aguilera spends much of her time describing how great she is, why she is famous, why she's glamorous, why she's better than anyone on the scene and in the appropriately final track \\"Vanity\\" she even goes so far to review all of these questions and asks the listener \\"Who owns the thrown?\\" to which her child answers \\"You do, Mommy.\\" I found myself unintentionally amused by her vanity and preoccupation with herself (her vanity, her fantasies, pleasures are all addressed on 'Bionic'). Missing from this album is the Christina Aguilera we've come to know and like: where is the real singing? Where is the confidence and desire to make music that no one else is making? 'Bionic' is an average album that any singer could have put out with the same sound and success; a true Christina Aguilera production it is not.<br /><br />In most of the press and interviews for this album, Aguilera and her label has described 'Bionic' as having a futuristic sound. They failed to mention that the tracks that really experimented with sound and felt a bit on the side of futuristic were saved for the deluxe edition's bonus tracks. If you want variety, definitely purchase [[ASIN:B003G4DFRC BIONIC - DELUXE (Explicit)]].<br /><br />In all, 'Bionic' is a disappointment in that it feels like Christina Aguilera and her label tried to dumb down her music and sound to make her fit with other pop star acts, which ultimately failed. 'Bionic' has a very clunky feel - unlike past albums where the music seamlessly fit together to tell an overall story, this album felt loose and all over the place as if Aguilera is unsure where she wants to go or where she fits in after taking so much time off in between releases. Too many of the tracks felt wasted by either being totally unnecessary (all of the intros) or sounding like Christina Aguilera putting aside her vocal skills and talents in favor of imitating other artists and their styles and sounds. The music and release sounds rushed and I have a hard time believing it took two years to piece this together but it sounds as if it were slapped together in two months or worse, two weeks. A lot of these tracks, after a listen or two, are skip-worthy, unfortunately. Hopefully, 'Bionic' gives Christina Aguilera her opportunity to vocally rest and try out club/dance music and she won't keep her fans waiting another four or five years for music and material that better fits her voice and talents.<br /><br />Listen to These: \\"Lift Me Up\\", \\"I Hate Boys\\", \\"Bionic\\", \\"Woohoo\\", \\"Vanity\\", \\"Prima Donna\\"self unintentionally amused by her vanity and preoccupation with herself (her vanity, her fantasies, pleasures are all addressed on 'Bionic').

It outshines and pales anything else on TV, with the exception of Dexter.<br /><br />Breaking Bad is built on a plausability-factor that works in the real world, if at its most extreme.<br /><br />It laces the most perfect syncronicity into every plot and each and every plot realates to each and every previous as well, no doubt, as all plots to come.<br /><br />I end every episode recovering my breath and uttering \\"My God, that was good!\\"<br /><br />If they were to produce 26, or even 52 episodes per season, it wouldn't be enough.  Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston and their wonderful cast tear my heart out, make me furious, and leave me feeling compassion for the most flawed group of characters imaginable with every episode...Though fewer, as the series intensifies, there are also incredible laughs to be found.<br /><br />Breaking Bad is life lived on levels none of us can imagine for ourselves, but know, could happen to any of us with one wrong turn or one cruel twist of fate.<br /><br />Bravo to a true masterpiece of entertainment!  I am in awe of a perfect work in the making.<br /><br />If you have not watched Breaking Bad from the beginning, it is the only place to start.  Buy season one, and just keep going!  You will have no regrets, and you will experience the very best any media has to offer in truly imaginative entertainment.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|The latest \\"Twilight\\" soundtrack features a plethora of stars, just like the previous two, and this just might be the best of the lot. It opens with the sweet Pop/Rock \\"Eclipse (All yours)\\" by Metric, followed by Muse (who have appeared on all three soundtracks now) with\\"Neutron star collision (Love is forever)\\", a theatrical piece starting off like a Queen ballad before galloping Disco-ish beats sweep in, while \\"Ours\\" is stomping synth Rock by The Bravery.<br /><br />Everything stands out, the dark and dense \\"Heavy in your arms\\" by Florence and the Machine, the piano ballad \\"My love\\" by Sia, the Folky clap-filled \\"Atlas\\" by Fanfario, the Blues/Rock \\"Chop and change\\" by The Black Keys\\", The Dead Weather's \\"Rolling in on a burning tire\\" (with sporadic squeals of guitar, more accessible than much of their new CD), and the atmospheric \\"Let's get lost\\" by Beck and Bat For Lashes.<br /><br />Continuing are the chugging melodic Rocker \\"Jonathan low\\" by Vampire Weekend, the droning \\"With you in my head\\" by UNKLE (featuring neo-psychedelic Texas band The Black Angels), the crunchy atmospheric \\"A million miles an hour\\" by Eastern Conference Champions (with ghostly harmonies), the acoustic Fleet Foxey \\"Life on Earth\\" by Band Of Horses (with humming and \\"Life on Earth is changing/ending, life on Earth is changing/ending\\" sung repeatedly), the whistle-laden bouncy echoing guitar Pop \\"What part of forever\\" by a soulful Cee-Lo, and the creepy but beautiful piano instrumental \\"Jacob's theme\\" by Howard Shore\\".<br /><br />An eclectic and fantastic soundtrack which \\"eclipses\\" the other two, and a finer compilation you'll be hard pressed to find.
B002RAREAK|5.0|I have been following Usher throughtout his career.  This is probably one of his best albums.  Certain artist seem to repeat past hits in another way, but Usher has out done himself on this one.  He's professionally maturing with his music as his career takes off to the next level.
B003FMTZOM|2.0|Christina Aguilera's \\"Back to basics\\" had her mining Soul/Jazz sounds from the fifties and sixties. For her latest \\"Bionic\\", the future is the concept; robotic synth-driven animals. The result is rather schizophrenic as she seems to want to be everyone, Madonna, Pink, Beyonc&eacute;, rarely finding time to be herself.<br /><br />Title track \\"Bionic\\" is electro Dub, while the spare \\"Not myself tonight\\" is squelchy Techno. \\"Glam\\" features booming synths and can be best described as Madonna's \\"Vogue\\" for the noughties. \\"Prima Donna\\" has a horn riff that sounds cribbed from the Jackson's \\"Can you feel it\\".<br /><br />The robotic \\"Elastic love\\" has rather puerile lyrics as does The bouncy Rock/Pop \\"I hate boys\\" (with angry screamed lyrics and sounding like a Pink/Gwen Stefani cast-off). The stomping \\"My girls\\" features Peaches, while \\"Vanity\\" her asking \\"Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fliest b**ch of them all\\" and other rather narcissistic lyrics but is club friendly and all done in fun, especially the bit at the end where her son Max goes \\"You do mommy\\" when she asks \\"who owns the throne?\\".<br /><br />There are a few songs where attitude wins over melody or even any discernible tune, songs like \\"Woohoo\\" (featuring Nicki Minaj who seems to appear on the most awful tracks on just about everyone's album these days, and no I don't wanna taste your \\"woohoo\\" no matter how licky licky yum yum you think it is), and yhe sexless \\"Desdunate\\". These should excite people who felt Beyonc&eacute;'s \\"Diva\\" or \\"Videophone\\" were symphonic masterpieces, but you'll skip these if you appreciate even a hint of melody.<br /><br />Thankfully, a slew of ballads come to the rescue, the steamy Janet Jackson-esque \\"Sex for breakfast\\" (co-written by Bernard Edwards of Chic's son), the Linda Perry-penned \\"Lift me up\\" (an acoustic version appeared on the \\"Hope for Haiti\\" album), the stunning tender \\"All I need\\" (a song for Max and my favourite), the piano/violin-drenched \\"I am\\", and the tender \\"You lost me\\" (a sad song of love lost and betrayal which fittingly preludes \\"I hate boys\\"). Her vocals on these are more sensitive and emotive, rarely overdoing the histronics like she did in times past. Now, THIS is the real Christina.<br /><br />If you get the regular edition, you'll miss great bonus tracks like  \\"Monday morning\\", a Chic-inspired groovy dancer, the sublime \\"Birds of prey\\" (an electro Pop gem, think Gwen Stefani's \\"Wonderful life\\") with Middle Eastern vocal effects,  the fiery guitar-driven \\"Stronger than ever\\", and a stripped version of \\"I am\\". The other bonus track \\"Bobblehead\\" is simply horrendous. The latter clunker aside, without these extra tracks, the regular CD is just average.and betrayal which fittingly preludes \\"I hate boys\\").

0307346617|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Like \\"28 Days Later\\" (NOT \\"28 Weeks Later\\"), this book is less about the zombies and more about what happens to humans and to humanity when encountered with a global crisis that cannot be stopped.  Some of the scariest moments in this book deal more with what humans are capable of doing to each other rather than the damage done by the zombies.  This book is interesting, sometimes sad, sometimes touching, sometimes scary and sometimes infuriating.  Although the book seems choppy at times--this serves the story well in the sense that the flow of information in a time of a pandemic crisis of this sort would be minimal at best.  Very effectively written.

B00393R1ZC|5.0|Although I was a little disappointed when I first received my new Daria DVD collection and read inside that the original music used in the tv series from popular songs at the time (this was MTV after all) was not in the DVD episodes because it would have cost the publishers a lot of dough, I have enjoyed watching these episodes I haven't seen in more than 10 years so much that I have forgotten those popular songs were there when it aired on MTV in the 1990's. Daria stands on her own as hilarious and poignant as ever. And now I can watch her whenever I want to!
B001C4CI8U|5.0|When \\"Fringe\\" first aired on Fox, I was informed by a friend that \\"if I like the X-Files, I will love Fringe.\\" With this being said, my friend was absolutly correct.     \\"Fringe\\" is about Agent Olivia Dunham and her work for the fringe division in the F.B.I. The fringe division takes on the cases of the paranormal, similar to the \\"X-Files\\" Oliva's supervisor \\"Agent Broyles\\" allows her to work with Dr. Walter Bishop and his son Peter Bishop. Walter, who was institutionalized, is a very smart man, but needs his sons help, in order to complety function.  Fringe does start out a little slow, but it ends with a bang !      Writer/Producer/Creator of \\"Fringe\\" JJ Abrams does a wonderful job of makeing the plot very interesting, and confusing. But like other projects of JJ Abrams, \\"Lost\\" he always has a plan for the show.    If you quit watching \\"Fringe\\" because of the way it started out, give it a second chance. The ending will having rushing to the stores to get season 2.
0446563048|4.0|The book is, clearly, about Zappos, but the first half is really an auto-biography where Tony Hseih introduces himself and summarizes his entrepreneurial efforts starting with mail order businesses in childhood through his first job as a college graduate which lasted all of five months before he quit and founded LinkExchange. I didn't know he was behind LinkExchange, a banner ad trading network for websites in the early 90s in which I myself was a member. Of course Microsoft bought the company in 1996 and effectively killed it, but Tony took his money and started investing in other companies.    Ultimately he's convinced to invest in an idea which ultimately becomes Zappos, and Tony gets involved in the company as CEO when it's on the brink of bankruptcy and he cashes out his real estate and personal wealth and pours it into the company. The second half of the book is focused primarily on this process and bringing Zappos through its dark days into a profitable and well respected company.    Unfortunately there's a section in the middle of the book which goes over Zappos' ten core values with 2-3 page essays written by Zappos employees. While Zappos has somewhat non-standard core values, and the essays attempt to give varied personal perspectives on each value, the end result is a not-quite-cohesive hodgepodge of brief stories.    The book itself isn't a very dense read and goes quickly. It can be pretty enjoyable, but go into it with expectations of fluffiness rather than a serious discussion of business practices. There's a disclaimer in the very beginning from Tony where he makes it clear he's not a professional writer and he's not using a ghost writer, and while I appreciate the honesty, you can see why.
B00000I3JO|5.0|The Blue Nile is a magnificent yet underrated band. Hats is unquestionably their masterpiece. The sound of the album has dated a little (okay, a lot) since it's release 20 years ago, but ultimately Hats--and the Blue Nile in general--is less about the sound and instrumentation, but about the gorgeous ATMOSPHERE. And if there is one thing that makes Hats one of the most beautiful pop albums in recent memory, it's the atmosphere and emotion created by Paul Buchanan's lovelorn brogue. He pours every bit of himself into every word; the expansive arrangements are just a canvas for Mr. Buchanan to bear his soul to the world. I'd say that Hats, in tandem with Talk Talk's [[ASIN:B000005RS5 Spirit of Eden]], is a lost masterpiece of 1980s music.
0060853972|5.0|This was really a fun book. It was just fun to read and really entertaining.<br /><br />Some of the aspects I really liked about the book were contained in it's humor. The book is overall fairly and likes to poke fun at lots of subjects, such as Americans, the British, and many more. Many of the characters in the book at first feel like they should be cliche, but turn out to find a way of getting out of that trap and become interesting and engaging. I like the use of footnotes throughout the book to add some humor into parts where it does not fit directly. Some of my favorite parts of the novel are the conversations between Crowley and Aziraphale. They feel light-hearted and fun for the most part, but there is another layer to a lot of what they are talking about. Their conversations, as well as the book as a whole talks a lot about Heaven and Hell, and the good-naturedness versus evil intentions of humans without becoming overbearing or heavy handed in giving their opinion.<br /><br />My favorite character in the novel, Newton Pulsifer, also is just one example of the many great characters in the novel. He is just a kinda normalish guy that answers an add for Witch Hunters and gets thrown into this epic battle of Heaven versus Hell and has to find a way to come out of it alive and unharmed. Dog is another great example of the kind of humor that really makes this novel great. From the story of his naming to some of his interactions with some of the other animals in the neighborhood, is fun.<br /><br />The only thing I think I did not like about the novel was that the end sequence kind of came very late and did not last as long as I thought it did. Granted, I never felt that the build-up to it was too long or dragging, but I just wish that it was a bit longer then it was. Thought I would like to be clear, this is a minor complaint about a novel that besides this one minor point, was one of the most fun and enjoyable books I have come across in a long time.

0393072231|5.0|No one will ever know entirely what went so badly wrong with the nation's financial system that we taxpayers and Americans not yet born will have to pay. Even the handful of offbeat characters who predicted the crisis (and made money off it) only had glimpses of what was going on in the Wall Street black box. However, if you need a guide to take you entertainingly through the swamp, hire Michael Lewis by reading his book \\"The Big Short.\\" This reviewer had to slog through some passages, due to an inability to comprehend some of the maneuvers. For that, I fault my intellect. I do not fault my intellect, however, for an inability to understand some of the financial products dreamed up by Wall Street biggies. That's because they made no economic sense. The case could be made that they were fraudulent. My thanks to Michael Lewis for helping me to see I'm not stupid. If you are wondering why the worldwide economic markets were almost pulverized by the subprime lending crisis, Lewis hints that the malady started when Wall Street firms went from being partnerships to being public corporations. The shareholders came in as the suckers (aka \\"dumb money\\"). Before, the partners in a financial institution had some skin in the game.

0446563048|5.0|Steve Jobs is often cited as the best business leaders in the world, but I place Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos.com, right up there with him.<br /><br />A business leader who creates just one noteworthy innovation stands out in the crowd. But Tony has developed multiple cutting edge innovations which, in my opinion, separate him from most CEOs.<br /><br />These innovations include:<br /><br />  * Paying trainees $2,000 to quit (if they take the money, then they weren't the right fit)<br />  * Requiring all of his employees to use Twitter<br />  * Surprise upgraded shipping for customers<br />  * Empowering customer service representatives to solve the customer's problem (even if unrelated to their Zappos order)<br />  * Hiring and promoting not just based on performance but also fit within the Zappos culture<br />  * Allowing employees, vendors and customers to contribute to an annual, un-censorsed culture book<br />  * Requiring customer service representatives to recommend to customers other internet websites that carry a product when Zappos.com is out of stock.<br /><br />It is therefore with great excitement for me to receive two advanced copies of Tony's debut book Delivering Happiness, and give my honest and objective opinion of the book.<br /><br />The book is written in a colloquial style which makes it easy to read and genuine. For a man who prides himself on being transparent, it works perfectly. Another unique feature of Delivering Happiness is Tony's sprinkling of third party emails and accounts to realistically convey portions of his story. For instance, Tony shares his October 19, 2000 state-of-the-company email (and not a pretty state, by the way) which he sent to all of his Zapponians, and two actual response emails to his emails following drastic lay-offs at the company. The use of these supporting, back-up documents adds to the credibility of the story and makes it more compelling.<br /><br />Tony shares stories of his childhood (including his first failed entrepreneurial venture of worm farming), college years at Harvard, first job a Oracle, and ultimately the stories behind LinkExchange (his first true success), and of course his roller coast ride taking Zappos.com from near extinction to a billion dollar success.<br /><br />Tony ended up selling LinkExchange to Microsoft for $265 million showing tremendous courage along the way by rejecting earlier offers from other suitors of $1 million and $20 million. Even after he sold the company, he intentionally forfeited $8 million of his $40 million share of the sales price because of his unwillingness to remain with LinkExchange for the agreed time period due to his incompatibility with the company's then-culture.<br /><br />The early years and rise of Zappos.com is just as fascinating, which Tony sold to Amazon.com for $1.2 billion. Highlights include Tony's use of most of his savings to keep it afloat, the story behind his decision to change from a drop-shipping business to a warehouse, in-house shipping business model, and (most importantly) his decision to make spreading happiness his company's raison d'être.<br /><br />In the age of self-aggrandizing autobiographies, it is refreshing to read a down-to-earth (and at times self-deprecating) memoir. The Business Learning Junkie says this book definitely delivers happiness.<br /><br />By the way, when I shared the stage with Tony at an Entrepreneurs' Organization event last year, he couldn't have been more gracious.

Adding Weird Al to the mix? Gold. This song is pure summer.<br />Give A Little - This song with get everyone moving on their feet. I can't NOT listen to it in my car without boppin' around.<br />And I Waited - The drum intro alone pulls you in. The lyrics are fun to sing along to.<br />Me Myself and I - Beautiful piano and a great album exit song.<br /><br />Could Live Without: All tho I absolutely LOVE the story/theme/verses behind Voice In The Chorus, the 'chorus' itself is a bit redundant.<br /><br />Missing: Ike Solo??? Where are you??? First album ever without an Isaac solo... my poor heart can't take it.<br /><br />I'm giving it five stars because even Hanson's 'worst song' is still better than 98.76% of the crap that's played on the radio.<br /><br />-aj-

I found the book disjointed and incomprehensible, filled with gibberish.

Certainly a comedown for Pulitzer after the stellar \\"The Road\\" last year.
0446563048|5.0|El equipo de Tony Hsieh (CEO de Zappos) me envió en avanzada dos copias de su libro \\"Delivering Happiness\\" hace casi dos meses a México.   En resumen, es una pieza de arte.    La buena noticia es que el día de hoy salió su venta al público, y si me preguntas a mí, es un libro que no debes ignorar.    En ocasiones anteriores he bloggeado acerca del éxito de Zappos y la obsesión de Tony por dar el mejor servicio a sus clientes, pero después de leer el libro, creo que me quedé corto con la filosofía detrás de su empresa.    Zappos, por mucho, es el mejor ejemplo de cultura organizacional y servicio a cliente que puedes seguir para diferenciarte.

B002JCMZA0|3.0|I have eagerly followed Dianna Krall since before the release of her \\"Look of Love\\" album.  I was able to see her in concert in a small theater setting of 150 and even though she had a cold, she delivered both vocally and on the piano, but especially on the piano. She had kept up displaying her piano chops until she married Elvis Costello and then became more and more a Julie London with piano chops, but with more emphasis on the Julie London mode. Her jazz playing is becoming so secondary that I begin to wonder when its time to stop collecting her albums. \\"Quiet Nights\\" has songs, for the the most part, that she has performed better on other other albums and I may download the HDtracks version, but not purchase the CD.  Had she released \\"Quiet Nights\\" in SACD, I may have still have purchased the hard copy just to support he medium. And, as she moves into listening modes best described as \\"easy\\" she is sure to appear on the smooth jazz stations, where are where jazz goes to die.

0446563048|5.0|A few years back at a TED conference,  I met Tony Hsieh (pronounced \\"shay\\") the CEO of Zappos.  I was familiar with Zappos as on online shoe retailer, for their Kentucky warehouse presence, and embracing of twitter but I was not by any means a customer.  I was also vaguely aware that they were into customer service something that I felt passionate about since we had designed a highly systematic patient loyalty and service excellence program in our physical therapy clinics.  From that brief encounter, I received overnighted Zappos culture books, a variety of online tools that highlighted their program, and eventually took our entire EIM Executive Management Program on a Zappos tour as part of their class experience at graduation.  I also became an unabashed customer and delight in getting an anniversary card celebrating the boots I ordered 12 months earlier.  What I now know after reading Hseih's book, is part of receiving such value before I had ever placed an order was his view that my lifetime value as a customer is due to more and more positive emotional associations with their Zappos brand.        As a blogger, I received advanced copies of Delivering Happiness A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose by Tony Hsieh in return for doing a book review post.  Since I write quarterly business book reviews for a CEO organization, I was particularly glad that an evidence based physical therapy blog and myself qualified!  You can obtain a copy here as it gets officially launched this week.        Zappos sells itself as a service company that just happens to be selling shoes. This book should likewise can be described as a great business book that just happens to be about Tony and Zappos.        The book is comprised of 3 sections. The first entitled \\"Profits\\" is essentially a partial autobiography of Tony and his journey into Zappos.  It includes many stories including the culture that he grew up in and his on-going quest to make a lot of money which included attempts atworm farming, customized buttons, newspapers, food, and designing websites.  It is hilarious at times and he might be one of the best practical jokers to every become a CEO.  More compelling is that his journey to become wealth finally leads to a much better consequence-what he really wants out of life.  In that vein, it supports Daniel Pink's contention in Drive that research shows such quests become addictive and although often leading to financial success but do not lead into happiness-a point that I think Tony would wholeheartedly agree.  In fact, after selling his first company, he literally walked away from tons of money to pursue his passion which ultimately includes in part building something, connecting with others, and purpose with a few red bulls in between, a climb of Kilimanjaro, and of course completing a marathon.  This section was a pure joy to read and provided the occasional outburst of laughter while also giving you great background for creating the \\"soul\\" of the Zappos culture as well as key lessons resulting from an intense interest in playing poker can provide for foundations of playing the great game of business.        The second section \\"Profits and Passion\\" really details the Zappos story as Tony goes from being an investor then adviser to running the show and having to make \\"bet the company moves\\" including selling key personal real estate assets off at losses to keep Zappos afloat as well as tough personnel layoffs.   It provides a lessons in the \\"hard\\" business parts-financing, cost of growth, painful lessons in outsourcing your core competencies but more importantly it provides the backdrop to the entire Zappos value proposition-culture, branding thru service, and core values.  A wise business sage told me once that great companies \\"will\\" themselves to success without ever relenting to unsurmountable obstacles.  While Zappos is the epitome of value creation with over 1 Billion in sales and a closing acquisition price of roughly 1.2 Billion, Tony's details of the struggles, challenges, and eventual path are a history that needed to be told.  As a business book \\"junkie\\", you will not find anywhere in my opinion better  example and instruction in how to enumerate your core values with key \\"take home\\" messages and real employee examples.        The final book section-Profits, Passion, and Purpose transitions to deploying the Zappos philosophy into delivering on happiness.  After detailing the exemplary way to handle selling of a company to your employees, it includes a great summary or melding of his personal takes from a variety of books on happiness including The Happiness Hypothesis, Good To Great, Tribal Leadership, and Peak.  It really is a culmination of his personal journey that took him from his growing years in Asian culture to financial success to the significance and transportability of the Zappos message.        This is a fantastic book-a wonderful combination of biography, business, and building significance. For the readership of this blog, I trust you will be able to apply quite a bit of it to your work, your clinic, your patients,and most importantly, to yourself.
0307463745|4.0|The book is a quick read, with lots of white space and pictures. One might say the advice presented is an over-simplification of what makes a company successful. But this advice certainly worked for Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson.<br /><br />I am in the minority among the reviewers in that I was not familiar with their company, 37signals, or their blog.

The advice is right to the point.<br /><br />Some of my favorite advice from the book:<br /><br />*it's not that you have an idea, but it's how well you execute that idea.<br />*embrace constraints and foster creativity.<br />*focus on those things that won't change, not the peripherals.<br />*get real, stop dealing in abstractions<br />*provide content and out-teach your competitors, instead of trying to outspend them.<br />*hire great writers because clear writing = clear thinking.<br /><br />Is this the most helpful book ever published about starting a business?  No, but it's still worth reading.  You never know when a piece of advice will really stick with you.

0061537969|5.0|I have read another book that was written from the dog's point of view and it was great but this was so much more than I expected.  Enzo, the dog, was full of heart and soul and as I read what he was thinking and how he wanted to do things but couldn't because he was a \\"stupid dog\\", it gave me a greater appreciation for my own dogs.  I laughed and I cried but I mostly marveled at how human-like Enzo was.  He was an amazing dog and I had to remind myself as I read that he was a dog and not a human.  I won't give away the plot but the ending was so cool.  It was all-around good book and worth the time I spent in reading it which really wasn't all that long.<br /><br />This book is a great story about human/canine relationships and if you've never owned a dog, you may want one after reading this.
0525423842|2.0|I have worked in a middle school library for 19 years and I think this book would be a hard sell. There is not enough action and at times it felt like a lecture on law. The ending was flat. Grisham should read the competition for this age group. The late Robert Parker (Chasing The Bear, The Boxer and the Spy and The Edenville Owls)did a great job on his three titles for YA readers - great for reluctant male readers. Andy McNab - Traitor, Robert Muchamore - The Recruit, Anthony Horowitz - Gatekeepers Series, Jack Higgins - Surefire and David Gilman - Devil's Breath, know how to take the kids to an intensity in a storyline that rivals video games. Do some summer reading Mr. Grisham.
B003CFBQBW|3.0|I enjoyed both of the previous Twilight soundtracks and was anticipating for this album a lot. When I found out the list of the artists on the 'Eclipse' I was happily surprised.<br /><br />Having all those well-known artists such as Muse, Beck or Vampire Weekend, makes this accessible for any of the fans of any band on the soundtrack. What I mean is that if you like Metric - you will not be disappointed, if you like the latest album from Band Of Horses - you will not be disappointed by their song. On the other hand, my recommendation would be to be familiar with at least some of the artists on the album, 'cause you might get surprised in a bad way. This is a compilation of Alternative(!!) music which needs time to be approached.<br />However, in my opinion, this is the weakest soundtrack yet of 'Twilight saga'. Why? It is very unbalanced and it is more alternative than other records. You might say, how is more alternative bad? And it is not. In general. Just some of the songs are way too experimental ('With You In My Head' or 'The Line') and lack simple catchy melody which has been haunting us in the two previous soundtracks. For example, I am a die hard fan of Jack White, I love his work in the White Stripes, i like the Dead Weather, but their track 'Rolling In On A Burning Tire' simply needs appropriate taste to like it. Like I said before, If you liked the latest the Dead Weather album 'Sea Of Cowards' you will definitely love the song. By unbalanced I mean the outstanding tracks being close to songs which are a disappointment (to me at least). A simple example would be Bravery song 'Our' and the following song Florence + the Machine 'Heavy In Your Arms'. When you listen to the Florence song you will most likely forget how Bravery song even sounded like.<br /><br />Even if I am saying that you need to like alternative music already and this might not be a 'I fell in love with this at the first sound', everyone is different, and, who knows, you might like this whether you are a fan of indie or alternative or you are not. A simple advice would be to get familiar with some of the artists on the album before purchasing this.<br /><br />The good sides. Not so popular artists like Florence + the Machine, Fanfarlo or Eastern Conference Champions make a great appearance and I instantly purchased Eastern Conference Champions studio album after listening to their wonderful song. If you are an alternative fan, you might get yourself surprised and found something new to admire! Beck & Bat For Lashes make astonishing collaboration, producing a fantastic 80' sounding like hit 'Let's Get Lost'. Sia just proves how beautifully Love might sound like with her song 'My Love' (one of the best here).<br /><br />This is a soundtrack of whole different new seas and if you are not afraid of adventure, go ahead with this album! Hope this helps.<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />- Heavy In Your Arms (Florence + The Machine)<br />- My Love (Sia)<br />- Let's Get Lost (Beck & Bat For Lashes)<br />- Jonathan Low (Vampire Weekend)<br />- A Million Miles An Hour (Eastern Conference Champions)f indie or alternative or you are not.

B003E48AYC|5.0|It is not possible for me to read the reviews of others regarding movies like this without wondering how jaded they are on the marvels of visual art as displayed by masterpieces as this. These movies are lovingly and painstaking put together piece by brilliantly crafted piece with results...particularly like \\"Alice...\\" that are mind boggling. And yet all the nit picking!<br />I was overwhelmed by \\"Avatar\\" and then along comes this Johnny Depp starring plunge into the surreal.<br />What a joy to behold.<br />What a pleasure just to relish in the sheer ingenuity and the aesthetic rush.<br />This would be the movie to take to that \\"desert island\\" ... at least for now!

0596804822|5.0|This is the first book I bought on iPhone/iPad 3D graphics programming.  The author did excellent job on presenting modern OpenGL ES programming in a clear way.  The book contains lots of examples using both OpenGL ES 1.1 and 2.0 APIs.  The first six chapters are very detailed in explaining the code.  The last three chapters are faster paced but still contain good explanation on important portions of the code.  I like the presentation of code that lists application side, shader side and how they are tied together.  The author also explains very well how you would want to organize your code through interfaces.  I run most of the examples on the iPhone emulator and they all worked!  The reader should have a good understanding of C++ programming language in order to get most out of this book.  Also, this is not a general iPhone programming book but rather a 3D programming book on iPhone/iPad.     The book could have broken some of the later chapters into multiple chapters, so a reader will not feel too overwhelmed by sheer amount of material.    \\"A good graphics programmer thinks like a politician and uses lies to her advantage.\\" - A quote from the book.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|Just as we are expecting from David Slade this soundtrack should be perfect.  There are songs for all 3 of the main characters on here, so they don't just sound a like.    Everything is beautifully musical and perfect, I can't wait to try and figure out where they are in the movie.    If you want to buy this I would definitely suggest the 17 song version and not just the 15 song.  It's a couple $ more but well worth it!
B0039UTDA6|2.0|When Life was broadcast on Discovery channel in America, I of course watched every episode knowing that it was not narrated by David Attenborough. Even then, with already lower expectations, I was slightly disappointed. I thought that the music was poor and repetitive, with the same distinctly \\"poignant\\" piece played in every episode, and the episode wrap ups were not very well done. Also, scenes were unnecessarily repeated, like the not-particularly-interesting ibex scene. Enough has been said about the Oprah-Attenborough issue. However, I was still excited to buy the BBC release when it came out.    What I got was an entirely different product. The score was completely different and of the quality found of Planet Earth and Nature's Most Amazing Events. Also, there are some scenes which were not included on the American broadcast, most notably a scene in the first episode of leopard seals hunting penguin chicks. I think this scene was removed from the American version because it was too graphic (and it is up there), and thus was replaced by the repeated ibex scene. There were others that I hadn't seen before, though I haven't seen the Oprah version in a while so I don't remember all of them. The scenes were shown in different sequences as well.    All in all, I feel that the original David Attenborough version is a far superior product, for reasons including but not limited to the change in narration.
B001MS7IBS|1.0|Terrible remake of the X-Files - without the writing or acting quality of the original.  Don't waste your money on this turkey.  Unbelieveable premise, lousy acting, extremely slow and suspense-less writing style - if you're stuck with it like I was play a game trying to guess what the next line will be.  There's enough time between lines to think up some cliches - and you'll probably be right 75% of the time.    A really hopeless series - with all the great shows that got cancelled, I cant believe this made it to a second season!
1594481717|5.0|Daniel Pink's work in \\"A Whole New Mind\\" has the potential to be helpful with a critical issue facing 21st century policing.  Increasingly, officer's operating environment is transparent and open to worldwide scrutiny in real time.  For good or bad, the individual officer can instantly become the epicenter of organizational influence on a worldwide scale.  Besides being transparent, our communities are much more diverse and complex.  The influence of universal pop culture and media constantly bear upon even the most rural areas of our country.  While much work is yet to come, \\"A Whole New Mind\\" potentially opens the conversation to allow law enforcement to begin adapting to the challenges of the 21st century.  If law enforcement courageously considers the implications of Pink's work and humbly sets out to build on it, I am convinced the following benefits await us:<br />A Whole New Mind approach has the potential to begin to fortify law enforcement with new levels of tactical acumen and social competence.<br />Tactical acumen:  1) More comprehensive pre-contact threat assessment by lowering the natural proclivity to be blinded by personal bias, prejudice, fear and loyalties thus allowing for a more objective assessment of total context and individual behavior.  2) Increased awareness of subtle precursors to violent or aggressive behaviors through a continuous gestalt (big picture) assessment of people and situations thus keeping the whole mind engaged to listen and observe.  3) Through these, increase the member's ability to use appropriate force at the appropriate time thus averting dangerous escalation. 4) Provide the foundation for strategies designed to devastate an adversary's willingness to resist, without devastating the adversary.  Thus, build community trust and partnership with every encounter, even the most challenging ones.<br />Social competence allows members to: 1) Appreciate as relevant, culturally and socio-economically diverse information from others perspective.  Then, convert information into useful energy or processes needed to improve safety and quality of life.  2) Develop appropriate compassion: empathy for others with a strong desire to relieve suffering, through diverse life situations.  Otherwise, when emotionally charged personal judgments of others swamp officers (with, for example, a feeling of disdain or \\"contempt of cop\\"); situational awareness and social competence evaporates.  2) Improve the effectiveness of assessment (precise attention and appropriate response to what is really going on with people and our communities).  3) Develop the capacity for attention and reflection (consideration untainted by mind-blinding judgmentalness and blame).  This will produce the ability to match need with provision between various community members and professional colleagues.<br />In a time of budget and staff cuts, law enforcement has but a few options before it:<br />1) Shrink back and become irrelevant observers to increasing chaos and suffering while engaging in what the military calls `force protection.\\"<br />2) Increasingly resort to heavy-handed applications of force and enforcement; masked, rifle-toting SWAT teams hovering around, swooping down to decimate any perceived resistance, all the while destroying trust.<br />3) Take Pink's work and the work of many other progressive thinkers and learn to be responsive, reflective and relevant to what is really going on in our communities.  In short, use our whole mind to continue learning new ways to unleash the power of unconditional respect.<br /><br />Jack L.

It also contains detailed analysis of Steve Jobs presentations (and we know he is great in front of audience) so author unearths the secrets what makes him so special.  Presentation tips are supported by latest researches and professional advice, there is also good references to external sources so you can actually follow the book on the web.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|This is by far Jack's best album to date.  Although the lyrics aren't as personal and strong as his last album was, the music is top notch.  I like how Jack is starting to add uptempo songs.  Some people may prefer the slower songs, but I prefer a little of both.  I hope Jack continues in this direction.  Highly recommended.
0446567337|1.0|To begin, I will say that there will most likely be spoilers ahead, so don't read if you don't want to know what the book is about. I read The Notebook after seeing the movie when it first came out, and all I remember about it was that I didn't care for Sparks' writing, but since I couldn't remember anything else about it, I decided to give this one a shot. A friend had borrowed it from someone else and I borrowed it from her. The best part about it is that it's short...less than 300 pages. The worst part is just about everything else.    If I said this was the worst book I had ever read, I'd be exaggerating. It was not good, but it wasn't the worst thing in the history of the world. I just can't understand how anyone can like Nicholas Sparks and his writing. He's a decent enough storyteller, but he is a simply terrible writer. I don't need to know about when John walked around, bought some water, walked around some more, bought some pizza, and walked around. It's tedious to hear every detail about someone's life (yet at the same time, he has no problem skipping months at a time...it throws you off, to say the least).     The characters were OK, but I never cared about any of them. I didn't believe for one second that John and Savannah were in love. They declared their love for each other mere days after meeting. Call me a cynic or whatever other name you want, but I don't buy it. True love is built over time, not over a couple of days. Perhaps it was partly because the book was so short that I didn't care about the characters or believe in their supposed love. It just felt so contrived to me, and I didn't enjoy it at all.     I can't understand the appeal of Nicholas Sparks. He has decent enough story ideas, but is a terrible writer. Very few authors can pull off writing in the first person, and Sparks definitely isn't one of them. From what I can tell, almost all of his stories have identical plot devices (usually the two lovers are from different worlds, there'ssome kind of tragedy, they overcome the odds, someone dies or has a terrible disease, etc). Beyond the writing quality (or lack thereof), Sparks seems like the most arrogant author in the world. He thinks so highly of himself and thinks he is utterly unique, despite writing fairly generic love stories. To Nicholas Sparks, I say: Get over yourself. Spend less time talking about how wonderful you are and take a class on how to WRITE. Use what you learn when you have your next idea. And might I suggest writing a non-white character for once?
1423113381|5.0|I have been waiting for this book since I saw Rick Riordan was doing another series. Sadie and Carter are a brother and sister who barely know each but must come together when their father blows up the British museum. The story is narrated in a way like you are listening to a recording from Carter and Sadie. Even though, at each chapter it tells you who is narrating, as I got into the reading I began to get confused of who was actually narrating Sadie or Carter. That is the only thing that bother me in the book.<br /><br />The book in general was a great adventure. Sadie and Carter trying to find their father and beat the evil Set. They come in contact with a bunch of Egyptian gods: Anubis, Horus, Isis, Serket, Thoth, Sekhmet, Bast and many more. Not only was it a great adventure novel but I got to learn about Egyptian mythology that I didn't know about to begin with. It was fun to learn along with Sadie and Carter as they learned about there heritage.<br /><br />There were a couple loose ends at the end of the novel which makes me wanting more. Not to give anything away but Sadie and Carter are still missing someone that they must find and they still have alot to accomplish. So I can't wait for the next one!
0449002128|4.0|\\"The Kill Artist\\" tells the story of Gabriel Alon, a former Israeli agent who has retired to a life of an art restorer, his former cover which became his occupation. Alon is called back for duty one last time to stop an old enemy who is on a murderous spree before he leaves this world. The story takes place in Europe, US, Canada and Israel and has many twists and turns where no character is left unharmed.<br /><br />The book if an easy read, fast and a page turner even though somewhat predictable, yet it does have its surprises. The author does try to present several sides of the mid-East issues but doesn't delve into any issues of take sides (almost a bullet point presentation summed up in a few paragraphs). There are no \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" guys in this book, which is one reason I liked it, the Israelis fight with the same immoral conviction as their Palestinian counterparts - and both believe they are right an stand on a higher moral ground than their opponent.<br /><br />The characters in the book are somewhat clich&eacute;, a supermodel spy who is used to entice enemies, a tortured reluctant hero, an enemy who feels justified, SOB directors and more.<br /><br />It is a well written spy novel, filled with details in all the right places as well as several characters from Silva's previous novels and wonderful political popcorn for those of us that care. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
0307387151|4.0|Let me admit that this is my first Ian McEwan novel and that I read it primarily for two reasons: first, it was on the required reading list for school, and second, I'd heard good things about the movie adaptation and I have a personal rule about reading the books before watching the movies. That being said, I was also aware of McEwan's reputation as England's best author today and was curious to see if it was true. While not the absolute best novel I have ever read, ATONEMENT is very skillfully written and I can now see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />McEwan's style has the feel of a classic (I certainly prefer it to Steinbeck's, at the least) and an eye for detail that I feel some other modern writers are beginning to do away with. Though recently books have been becoming increasingly more plot-centric--with the events happening so fast there's little room for description, which suits our ADD culture very well--Atonement stops to take note of the nuances in thought, in vision, to describe the sounds and smells of war, and to give each character a distinct, recognizable personality through development of inner dialogue. The plot itself starts out strongly. The beauty of the first few chapters cannot be matched, unfortunately, in the later ones. As the characters grow up and away from the fateful, disastrous summer night (which I will not summarize because countless other reviewers have already done a fine job) the plot grows a little more shaky and uncertain. It's certainly a great story, but McEwan really put in his best work at the outset, and this is so wonderful that it casts a shadow over the rest. The only part I had real problem with was the last chapter, in which the narration suddenly switches to first person. I personally have no taste for first person point of view, so it was a jarring conclusion to an otherwise wonderful novel, I thought.<br /><br />I will continue to read McEwan's work. His prose is top quality and more beautiful than anything I've read in a good while. I recommend the novel heartily, with the warning that it's not a feel-good summer read. While the plot will break your heart, the literature will hopefully lift it. I've also watched the movie and must say that visually, it too, is a work of art. 4.5 stars.good while.

B00003CXCD|5.0|Just finished watching \\"Roman Holiday\\" AGAIN for the upteenth time!  Even after what seems like 50 times, this flick NEVER gets tiring.  What holds up this film so well are the two SPARKLING performances from the leads -- Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck.  Eddie Albert (yes, this is \\"PRE-Green Acres\\") also deserves a lot of credit for defining the \\"Side Kick Role\\" so well, playing along with Hepburn/Peck without skipping a beat and providing plenty of chuckles along the way.  The chemistry among these three is simply UNFORGETTABLE!  You can tell they really  enjoyed each other's company whether the cameras were rolling or not.    First few times I saw this film I couldn't understand why Audrey Hepburn won a \\"Best Actress Oscar\\" for her very first film starting  out of the gates, beating out veteran Hollywood actresses such as Deborah Kerr (who sadly never won) and Susan Hayward.  But the more times you view this film, the more you enjoy Hepburn's performance.  She makes it look EASY, but there's so much going on inside to make the portrayal of a princess coming of age as effortless and beguiling as possible.  After the first 20 minutes, she completely wins the viewer over and you truly BELIEVE she IS a princess!  Before you know it, you are pulling for her every step of the way.    Gregory Peck plays the somewhat second-fiddle role superbly.  Perhaps another actor would have overplayed the role of American newspaperman to gain equilibrium with Hepburn's performance, but Peck never stoops to that.  He knows he has to underplay his part in order to showcase Hepburn's role.  His is another seemingly effortless performance but Peck's character, just like Hepburn's, evolves as the film progresses.  By the memorable finale in the Royal Reception scene, you sense how deeply these two characters care for each other, but have accepted their fated roles.  The lines must not be crossed.  They've enjoyed the precious times together, memories that will never be erased, and perhaps enough to carry them through the rest of their lives.    Even though this is billed as a \\"Romantic Comedy\\" it's difficult not to get misty eyed during the final minutes of the film.  Every person that I've watched the film with has admitted the same thing:  they were hoping the two of them would elope at the very end, but that wouldn't have made a realistic or satisfying conclusion for a film that is beautiful from beginning to end.  Perhaps one of the very BEST films Hollywood has churned out in the last 100 years, this film defines what a CLASSIC is in the truest sense of the word.  How I miss great performances, writing, and directing such as \\"Roman Holiday\\" in our present age.  It's too bad times have changed, but at least we have these cherished films to transport us back to the Golden Age of Hollywood.
B00003CXIP|5.0|When the author (Stephen King) says this is the best depiction of one of his stories done in movie form, you can bank on it.  It is based largely on King's childhood and some of his childhood friends at age 12.  It has a unique universal appeal to many of us who experienced many of the same things and had similar friends at that age.  This has got to be the best movie ever done about \\"coming of age\\", the journey, and the people and things we encountered at that innocent age.  Its a movie you can watch over and over without ever tiring of it.  Five stars, and richly deserved, for this Rob Reiner production.
B000002LND|5.0|Anyone who survived the 1980's knows every one of these songs by heart, whether you're an admitted Madonna Fan or not.  The genius behind Madonna's artistry is for each of these songs, you can still picture the video that accompanied it, playing endlessly on MTV.  Of course the ones that stick out are her Marilyn Monroe impersonation in \\"Material Girl\\" where she dons a long pink satin gown almost an exact replica of the one Marilyn wore in \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\\".  The choreography is perfection !    The more notorious ones are \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Justify My Love\\".  How can you listen to \\"Vogue\\" without remembering her \\"Marie Antoinette\\" stage performance at the MTV Music Awards with her male backup dancers sticking their heads INSIDE her dress !  It seems like yesterday the public outcry and controversy that greeted Madonna's \\"Justify My Love\\" video only added more fuel to the fire -- EXACTLY what the \\"Material Girl\\" was looking for !  By today's standards, the video seems tame, but in 1991 it was unexplored territory and the public hadn't seen anything like it.  Even being banned on MTV couldn't keep the song from shooting straight to # 1.  Madonna was ALWAYS one or two steps ahead of the game, that's what makes her not only a great artist, but a marketer/promoter second to NONE.    The \\"Immaculate\\" CD is remastered to perfection, using the Q-Sound that is no longer in use by the recording industry, but at the time was all the rage.  Some people don't like it's \\"Ultra Treble\\" sound where the high's are pronounced, but I feel it adds more definition and clarity to the overall sound.  This CD will still be indispensable and timeless even in another 20 years.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Like a lot of people, I was skeptical when I first heard about the story for Up. An old guy taking his house to South America, via balloons, because his wife wanted to go there before she died? It didn't sound dumb by any means, just kinda weird. Then I realized how weird the stories for WALL-E, Monsters Inc., Ratatouille and a few others sounded, and I knew I'd be seeing it no matter what. I may not like everything Pixar's done, but they have a good track record, and just like with WALL-E, they knocked another one outta the park with Up. If you ask me, I think this movie has the most heart of all Pixar's films, and that's pretty hard to do given the amount of heart that most of them have.    Up is the story of Carl Fredricksen, a balloon salesman who lives alone in an old fashioned house now in the middle of a construction site. He runs into a little trouble one day when he's encouraged to sell his house, and takes off with thousands of balloons tied to it. He wants to go to Paradise Falls, a beautiful location in South America that he and his now deceased wife were going to go, but things keep preventing them from taking the trip when they were younger. Everything seems to be going to plan at first, but Carl soon discovers that he's not alone. Russell, a boyscout, was on the porch when the house took off, and is now along for the ride. The two make it to South America, and try to make it to Paradise Falls, but discover a rare bird, 'talking' dogs, and someone that Carl used to admire when he was younger. What's in store for these guys is the definition of adventure.    Personally, eventhough kids obviously loved this film, I think Up is a little more for adults than children, kind of like how The Incredibles was. The theme of an old man trying to fulfill a promise made to his dead wife is pretty emotional, and seeing the couple grow old in a montage is sure to tug at anyone's heart strings. The cast of characters here is great, and since the cast is fairly small,everyone gets their share of time. Russell and Dug steal every scene they're in, and the humor is typical Pixar, with a lot of little jokes that anyone can enjoy. Having a boyscout out in the middle of a South American jungle is pretty hilarious on its own when you think about it. I can honestly say that this is one of the few movies in the last couple of years that I enjoyed every minute of. I was never bored, and didn't want the movie to end. The final scene did bring a tear to my eye, not because I found it sad, but because of how beautiful it was. Up deserved every bit of that Best Picture award nomination it got, and it's a shame that it didn't win it.    Simply put, the picture and audio quality for the blu-ray are perfect. There's NOTHING bad I can say about either, though it might've been even better if there were a 7.1 track in addition to the 5.1 DTS-HD Master. Either way, if you're looking for an animated movie, or any movie at all, to show off your home theater system, Up is sure to impress.    And just like the audio/visual quality, the extras are great too. First you get the dvd and digital copy, and both are good to have since you can have one in the car and the other on your computer or portable media player, then keep the blu-ray for home. Disc one, the blu-ray disc, has a good number of extras. Partly Cloudy is the short that played before the movie in theaters, and Dug's Special Mission is a brand new short where we get to see what Dug was doing before Carl and Russell meet him. There are also two featurettes about the animators going to South America for ideas for the scenery, and one involving the movie's antagonist and a kind of alternate ending with them. There's also an extensive commentary track that'll cover everything not given its own feature on either disc. Very informative, and I liked that they'd point out extra jokes that you might've missed. Disc 2 has even more, with featurettes for the four main characters (Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin), an extended montage scene of Carl and Ellie when they were younger and growing up (get ready to cry during this one), and more extras covering music, promos, trailers and much more. Basically, the only possible thing missing from this set is the 3D version of the movie, which I'm sure will come out on its own when 3D tvs start to sell better.    If you like Pixar, you'll get Up regardless of the reviews. It's definitely a worthy follow-up to WALL-E, which is to me, Pixar's best movie to date. This is definitely one for the whole family, or anyone who just wants to watch a great movie with an excellent story and memorable characters. For the movie itself, or the blu-ray, there's nothing bad I can say at all. This is one of those rare perfect sets.

B000FQ4M58|5.0|I always considered myself to be a MEATLOAF fan until I discovered that there were albums and cd's that I knew nothing about. Then I saw a link to Meat on FACEBOOK and got in on that and heard exerpts from the latest cd Hang Cool Teddy Bear which I pre-ordered on i-tunes and later ordered on Amazon. I like that one but I really like Bat Out of Hell III better, it is more like the old stuff from Meatloaf. I have since discovered through Amazon that there are more cd's that I never heard of and have ordered them now and am anxiously awaiting their arrival, even the one shipping from the UK.
030745455X|5.0|Oh kids, if you enjoyed the Stieg Larsson's first book in this series, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, you are going to DEVOUR the second installment.  The Girl Who Played With Fire has wings!  Larsson takes off where The Dragon Tattoo leaves off focusing on the Salander character and reviving the roles of Berger and Blomkvist.  We learn much more about Salander and like her even more (as if that were possible.)  As Salander adjusts to be being a millionaire loner, she's drawn into another mystery.  This time it's personal and she must take action. At the same time, Blomkvist is working on a new story, one involving a young girl prostitution ring.  Just as Blomkvist and his magazine and publishing company, Millennium, are about to go public with their ground-breaking story, Blomkvist and Salander's lives collide again.  This time, they are in contact through the computer, but their communications are just as salacious.  The end result is a fast-paced thriller that you simply CANNOT put down.  The book ends on the kind of hook that forces you to purchase the next installment immediately - thank God for the Sony reader.
0446563048|5.0|I read Tony Hsieh's 'Delivering Happiness' yesterday, a great read if you're interested in business, shoes or happiness. It's the story of the rise of online shoe store Zappos, which is now turning over a billion dollars a year. They're a remarkable company. You can find out more about them in my blog post from SXSW    Zappos is proof that your company's brand and your company's culture are two sides of the same coin. Get the culture right and everything else should follow.     I must admit, I've been interested in Zappos as a company for some time so I was hoping to learn more about Tony's personal quest for happiness. The cynical amongst us would say that it's easy being happy when you've sold the 3 year old company you started after leaving college (LinkExchange) for $265. But it's been proven that once you earn enough money to bring you the necessities in life (food, shelter, clothes etc) your level of happiness will not go up with rises in income. Lottery winners have this peak of happiness after winning which then drops off soon after.    Taking inspiration from books such as Happiness Hypothesis and Happier Hsieh built his happiness framework around 'perceived control', 'perceived progress', 'connectedness' and 'being part of something bigger than yourself'. So naturally, with a history steeped in acid house, I was delighted to see the impact clubland had on the culture of Zappos.    Hsieh reluctantly crossed paths with acid house one night when he was dragged to a club that played 'repetitive music he hadn't heard on the radio'. From the moment he walked in his life was changed. The connectedness and tribal nature of the rave scene shaped a large part of his happiness framework. He bought a loft space, threw mad parties and had random conversations with strangers. That feeling of connection, coupled with being part of something greater became a large part of the culture of his company.    Whilst there's something Nathan Barley-esqu about their operation, youcan't but help like the guy and his company. When it comes to customer service he's nailed it. When it come to creating a culture of happiness in the work place he goes above and beyond the call of duty. Viva Acid House!!!
B00393R1ZC|4.0|This television series is one of the all time best. The DVD includes episode introductions for at least some of the episodes by Daria herself. The only remotely negative comment I have is what prevented this series from coming out on DVD, all of the scene transition music. I haven't watched all of the episodes yet, but for at least the first season, all of the recognizable music has been taken out and some \\"transition\\" music has been inserted in its place. You hardly even notice. In fact, forget I said anything. If you loved Daria before, you'll love her again.     It's worth every penny!
0756655730|5.0|Years ago my course of study was a B.S. in anthropology and in my opinion this book is not only a fine, detailed one of both words and photos for both paleontology and prehistory, but will remain so for the near future. A time will come no doubt when another volume will update the information, however, for now this is a book most readers will enjoy.    My wife said upon seeing the book something as \\"Wow, what a coffee table book\\". I answered yes but if read much more indeed. She of course referred to the overall size of this book, which is mammoth compared to most scholarly books.  The book will far surpass the tag \\"coffee table book\\" once the reader begins to mine its depths. I read Scientific American magazine each month and for any reader who does likewise cannot see that this book and subject will not be a veritable feast for their eyes and brain.    I can easily offer this book up to readers who have interest in the subject of prehistoric life up to present time.  The book may not be the best that has ever been, nor it may not be the best of all time and all time to come, but it is one fine book indeed for the present time.    Semper Fi.

030726999X|4.0|If, like me, you read and enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy, you will - and should - unquestionably read \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" just to see how the story resolves.  That said, however, I can't say I was as engrossed in this one as I was in the first two.  There are a few problems I can identify.  First, unlike \\"Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" which continued some of the plot threads from the first book while adding an intriguing new mystery, \\"Hornet's Nest\\" simply continues the storyline of \\"Fire\\" without adding any significant new plots (with the exception of a rather tedious story involving harassment of Erika Berger).  Because the mystery of \\"Fire\\" reached its climax (at least in terms of action)) at the end of that book, \\"Hornet's Nest\\" sometimes feels like a nearly 600-page denouement.  Second, the bulk of \\"Hornet's Nest\\" focuses on a number of different groups of people - at one point I counted at least six - who are independently (and sometimes together) investigating the true facts of Lisbeth Salander's history and trying to uncover the conspiracy that was hinted at in the earlier books.  The result is that sometimes we read a chapter in which one of these groups makes a certain discovery, only to follow it up a few chapters later with another group discovering the same fact by different means... hardly the stuff of a page-turner.  Third, Larsson appears to be more focused in this book than in its predecessors on Swedish political history and railing against some of its institutions, which can often come off as preachy (and less than captivating to non-Swedish readers).  As I said, though, you should still definitely read this to conclude the trilogy (DON'T under any circumstances read it before the other two, you'll be hopelessly lost), and the last 100 pages are pretty terrific.
0446563048|5.0|About a month ago I was sent an advanced copy of Tony Hsieh's Delivering Happiness. I was planning on just lightly skimming it, but I ended up really falling in love with the story.    Most of the business principles you'll find in the book have been around forever, but Tony does a great job of describing how he's actually practiced them in his life and his company ([...])    The opportunities / crises he faced in growing the company are riveting. What gets under my skin about the book is that as a person deeply connected to communities of faith, Tony's passion puts many of us to shame.    In his story you'll find huge leaps of faith, creativity spawned out of desperation, and sacrifice to the point of liquidating everything he owned... and all this to sell shoes!    Our world needs more people committed to Delivering Happiness.    [...]
B002QGSW8I|3.0|I just got back from a vacation that required two days of driving both ways. After the first day on the road I realized I needed a book to pass the time, so I stopped at a Walgreens and this was one of the few options they had. It grabbed my attention so I picked it up.<br /><br />Also, just to give you an idea of my mindset while reading - I'm a math/science minded guy so literary elements like symbolism are completely wasted on me. I don't like to think when I'm reading and oftentimes I'll finish reading a book not being completely sure how the characters are even intertwined...especially in a novel like this where it jumps around among three different locations and about 10-12 main characters.<br /><br />I don't consider this review a spoiler, but some people might (just a warning!). I found this novel to be INCREDIBLY anticlimactic. The entire book they dodge death multiple times in search of a particular item. About half way through the book I figured out what the item would most likely be so that ruined part of the surprise in the end. When they finally find it I'm thinking to myself, \\"Really? That's it?\\" I felt like the book could have ended just as well without them ever finding it. In addition to that, the item they sought didn't appear to have any particular use. The real pressing issue was resolved about 2/3 of the way through the book.<br /><br />I was unaware that this book was one in a series. Perhaps if I had read the other books this one would have been a little better. The book was the only thing that preserved my sanity considering I was trapped in a minivan for a 20 hour one-way journey with my in-laws. Had it not been for that I probably would have put the book down about half-way through never to be picked up again.

B000AJIF4E|3.0|I read some of the other favorable reviews of Sony's MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphones, and I thought that they were the headphones for me. Alas, beauty is in the ear of the hearer. These headphones, to me, have a tinny sound. That is, they are weak in the bass and too strong in the higher frequencies.<br /><br />It's not all bad though. I adjust the bass and treble controls on my receiver to compensate for the weak bass and too-bright high frequencies. These phones are also reasonably comfortable to wear. I can go 45 minutes or so and not experience the \\"vice on my head\\" feel that a lot of other headphones can inflict.<br /><br />So I'd recommend that you listen to the Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphones if you can prior to purchase. That way you can decide if they have the sound for you. Depending on your own ears and preference in music, you may love these headphones. For me, they're only fair.

B003EYVXYG|4.0|George A. Romero is the undisputed godfather of zombies. His (and John A. Russo's) Night of the Living Dead really started the genre, but was not the first \\"zombie\\" movie by far, but it was the first person dies or is dead and rises back to life and eats people move ever, the previous \\"zombies\\" were hypnotized slaves(see White zombie1932,King of the zombies1941). George went on to create the greatest zombie movie ever, dawn of the dead. he followed up with day of the dead and land of the dead, all being big budget, theatrical movies. he then made diary of the dead a cheap, low budget, independent, P.O.V., movie that was not bad. He then made this. This movie was not too bad but for Romero, i have to say IN COMPARISON it was pretty bad. I got this on comcast on demand and also got the dvd. I own all Romeros movies and spent a lot of money on an autographed print signed by him,savini,russo and others, i also have hundreds of zombie films from big budget to indy flicks and i can say this was sub par FOR ROMERO but as far as an indy movie on its own it was alright.  If you dont go in expecting dawn of the dead 2, you will laugh at the jokes, enjoy the zombies,and wince at a couple really cool kills! overall worth checking out, i would say spend your money on the previously mentioned movies first then watch this. 4/5.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This two-disc DVD set is a must for anybody who is a fan of George Harrison. As a gift for the GH fan in your life, it cannot be surpassed. The accomplished musicians,family and myriad friends of GH's come together with a loving, laughing tribute to him that will lift you up. When I am out of sorts or feeling down at all, I play Disc 2 of the set (Disc 1 has more of George's Indian music that I'm not as fond of) and I am filled with awe and hope. Even Tom Hanks takes part in Monty Python's Lumberjack Song--it will bring tears to your eyes from laughing. It is my favorite DVD.

I agree with the other reviews that it is a little difficult to get used to the Swedish references but after a few chapters you don't even notice it.  I am so amazed at this man's vocabulary.

B003E48AYC|4.0|I got this movie mostly because it was on sale and I had a coupon. I do love the way it looks, kind of the way I love Sleeping Beauty. For a lot of people, however, the eye candy wasn't enough to overlook a story they found lacking. It also helps if you love all things Alice, or all things Tim Burton. I think it will entertain kids easily enough, but the movie itself isn't for everyone.<br /><br />If you DO like the movie, or if you're getting it for kids, it's hard to go wrong with this edition. This package includes the movie in 3 formats-- blu ray, DVD, and a digital copy. Putting the digital copy into your media library on your PC is pretty straightforward, and I can't help thinking having multiple formats would save a lot of spats over who gets to watch what among the kids (and adults sometimes).<br /><br />The extras are pretty typical \\"making of\\" featurettes that can be played all together or separately. I was surprised at how much of it was computer-generated or enhanced in some way. I don't usually watch these and only did so because I knew they were very short. Some people may be left wanting more, especially if you like director's commentary or extensive documentaries. You're paying for multiple formats here, and the extras are an afterthought.<br /><br />The one downright irritating thing about this edition, as is the case with so many movies these days, is the multiple trailers and commercials that auto-play when you put the disc in. (The digital copy doesn't include this annoyance and I'm glad I wasn't forced to devote hard drive space to it.) You can skip the promo tracks-- a lot of discs don't let you do that, but it's still irritating, especially if you are going to be watching the movie a lot either by your own free will or with the kids.<br /><br />Other than the previews, if you know you'll use the multiple formats and already love this version of Alice, this is a perfect choice. It's also a great gift for an Alice devotee if you don't know what format they will use, or when you don't know what kind of player they have, because this covers most of them.<br /><br />Four stars because I love the visuals, and I want the multiple formats. Casual fans will want to see the movie before they buy it, and should consider whether they need all three versions before buying this package.you don't know what kind of player they have, because this covers most of them.

006621131X|4.0|I have always loved Patti Smith's art. The albums that I still have on vinyl and play regularly, proud and priveleged to have been there to see her emergence, the first kid in my tiny rural town to be enraptured by HORSES. (I have always loved turning others on to great music, and i spread this album far and wide in my quest to be a hillbilly guru to the masses.) The poetry, in the albums themselves as I pored over every liner note, and in the couple of books I purchased, EARLY WORK and my prized signed copy (alas, not in person) of AUGERIES OF INNOCENCE. And now the art comes together as a whole as she shares the story of not just her life, but the story of her best friend and soul-twin, the artist/photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, whose work I have also always admired, and their love of each other and art as it intertwines and makes them stronger. I can think of no two artists more suited for this twinship, both honoring influences while pushing boundaries to become influences for countless others.<br /><br />  Smith takes us from her childhood in New Jersey through her arrival in New York, staying alive despite lack of food or money through the kindness of strangers and a relentless drive to not just survive but succeed and transcend. Mapplethorpe becomes her first and best contact in this brave new world, and we get to see them mature and thrive both as artists and as the sharers of optimism, dedication, and devotion to both their craft and each other. As what could have been a lifelong lovematch in the classic sense progresses and winds its way to a true deeper meeting of hearts and minds, you are drawn to every detail. Smith's writing style is factual without being rote, learned without being pompous. When she speaks of poets and artists like Rimbaud, Picasso, and Janis Joplin, you get the feeling that she's not so much name-dropping to build her own image up as she is selflessly sharing the joy she found in them with others. (This brought a smile to me as I realized my tiny kinship in this philosophy.)<br /><br />  The book has all the things that affection prods the heart to show: joy, triumph, more humor that I expected, and, alas, sorrow. Most art/music aficionados know how this story ends, but to see it from the beginning makes it so much more powerful, and there were so many amazing stops on the way that are revealed here. My favorite unexpected moment is when someone helps Patti out in a small but caring way; she subsequently finds out she was helped because the artist thought she was a goodlooking boy and was hoping to forge a connection with said boy.<br /><br />  I was minutely disappointed to find that Smith's and Mapplethorpe's road to success was on occasion paved by more luck, timing, sponsorship, and even larceny than I would have expected from those now known for principle. But then again, except for the larceny part, what rise isn't in some way or another? The honesty concerning these jump-starts balances the moral ambiguity, and despite such perks the subjects are never coasting, working hard from day one to reach the summit that is rightfully theirs. Also in Smith's favor, there is no braggadocio as these facts are revealed, just the knowledge that sometimes one must use what is given, that wasting the opportunity would be much worse. All opportunities are used very well by both Smith and Mapplethorpe.<br /><br />  As noted before, the writing draws you in. Except for a brief section detailing some of Smith's recording sessions, the story never gets so technical that you can't feel the emotions behind it or the pure intentions behind the telling. Smith says the book is a promise she made to Mapplethorpe, but with such a captivating subject, one feels that the story would have been told regardless of that vow. Some things are just too good not to share, and another recurring theme of the book is that sharing. The artists are never lax in helping others when they can, in encouraging each other toward their best work on their own terms. Influences are respected but not copied as so many do today. The originality here clearly stands on its own.<br /><br />  Despite the rags-to-semi-riches aspect of Patti and Robert's stories together and apart as told here, the things that radiate from every page of this book are respect and love - for each other, for friends and influences, for art itself. It is comforting in this day of spoiled so-called \\"stars\\" that artists such as these can find their way without the cruelty or egomania that is commonplace today. Smith has pulled this love, and this book, straight from her heart as an homage to the friend who loved and nurtured her art, her joy, her soul. In doing so, she more than returns the favor to the late, great Robert Mapplethorpe. Fortunately for us, the happy side-effect of this is that she opens their world to us to show just how stong love and respect can be. You come away feeling that maybe there's hope for humanity yet.

The Heath brothers, in \\"Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard,\\" bring a refreshing, engaging and insightful perspective to an age-old problem. For centuries, scholars have argued about whether change is a matter of thinking or acting: do new ways of thinking create new behaviors or is it new ways of acting that change our thinking? The authors make a convincing case that the answer is not \\"either/or\\" but rather \\"both/and.\\" Their ingenious framework, built upon the images of riders and elephants navigating a path, provides clear guidance on how to successfully manage the important \\"switches\\" in our lives by showing us how to change both our thinking and our actions at the same time. If you're looking for practical insight into the secrets for managing complex change, this timely book provides the glue for the new.
B00275EHIM|3.0|Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is a Walt Disney/Jerry Buckheimer Picture set in ancient Persia (now known as Iran).  The movie, although somewhat \\"cheesy\\" at times, is overall entertaining and a fun interlude for family oriented entertainment.  I was pleasantly surprised that Jake Gyllenhaal could pull off a swashbuckler role as naturally as he did.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays a smart, fast-witted adopted prince named Dastan.  His father, the King of Persia,  found him as an orphaned poor boy in a marketplace and saw something special in his demeanor and reaction to threats.  Dastan grew up with the King's two biological sons and they accepted him as their own.  When the three princes traveled together, they were doing their father's work checking on the desert cities of the Persian Kingdom.  There is also an evil Uncle i(Ben Kingsley) to make the story interesting.  The movie shows the princes and soldiers coming upon a city they debate whether to raid.  At this point, the movie gets interesting.  Paths seem to diverge as Dastan and a mysterious princess Tamina (Gemmea Arterton) band together to protect an ancient dagger that can release the Sands of Time.  This is a gift from the gods that can reverse time and only the possessor knows what has happened.<br /><br />The special effects keep you interested, as well as the time rewinding sequences.  The film gives plenty of action scenes, including a crazy ostrich race, and characters that keep an interesting story overall.  The kids will love it.  (The movie's plot is based on a Video Game)

0446563048|5.0|There are lots of books by entrepreneurs but this one does a better job than most of really letting you peer into the innards of a very successful one. I admire Tony not so much for the mega $$$$ he earned by selling tow companies for huge sums but for the philosophy that he has brought and is bringing into the workplace. With any luck he will change the terms of debate on what makes for a great company and I am rooting for this.<br /><br />Are entrepreneurs born or made? Not sure about this but his early account of how Tony tried to make money in worm farms and other ventures is fascinating. Form a VERY young age he was bucking the system and thinking big. He did succeed with a button making venture that was immensely profitable for a kid his age and actually launched a mini business that he was able to bequeath to his brother.<br /><br />Tony then founded a company - LinkExchange - with college buddies that he was able to sell to Microsoft for a few hundred million dollars. The impetus for sale was the money but also the realization that he did not like coming to work anymore. And he thought that if he didn't like it and he owned the company what must it be like for the others? And that precipitated the sale.<br /><br />He then leads into the [...] story and how he determined that he would build a company that people would WANT to work in. This is the part of the book that is pure gold. He details the early struggles, the mishaps with technology and how he and his partners struggled to get it right. Success is sweet but it did not happen overnight or easily. Early on he decided that what would set Zappos apart would be phenomenal customer service - what he calls delivering WOW! - and how he went about doing this is a big chunk of the book.<br /><br />Employee cohesion is important so he details steps he took to encourage workers to spend time together outside of the office. This is still a big part of the way Zappos culture is built. People like to feel that they are in control of their destiny so Zappos has a series of certifications - eg phone center, warehouse work, customer service etc - and any employee can decide which he/she will achieve and when. Achievement of each certification qualifies an employee to work in that area and also to get a bump in pay. To achieve more bonding Zappos puts out a \\"culture\\" book where each employee states what the company means to them and also sounds off on any work related matter. These are published unedited - except for typos etc - and many of the statements are heartfelt paeans of praise. This reinforces the views of others that Zappos is indeed a great place to be.<br /><br />There is relentless emphasis on WOWing th customer. If the company does not have the shoes the customer wants, the Zappos rep will check at least three competitor websites to find it for her. They may lose a sale right then but figure that they more than make it up in future customer loyalty. It works. The vast majority of sales are to long time customers. Like a pair of shoes but not sure which size will fit you? No problem. Buy the size you think is right and one larger and one smaller. Shipping is free both ways and you simply keep the one you like. And you have an year to return that one if you finally find out that you never really liked it.<br /><br />If you are thinking of becoming an entrepreneur, this is a roadmap of the philosophy that will enable you to create a world-class enterprise.<br /><br />In short, buy this book and read it.

B0033AGPG2|5.0|Though I have heard some great digital remastering ( Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane at Carnagie Hall from the Smithsonian vaults) but to compare this to the Eddie Kramer digital copies that came out earlier is a no brainer. The music is just not nearly as authentic and satisfying on the original. This rocks! Hendrix will always be the one of a kind genius that will never be touched for overall greatness.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|OK, it's a little premature to judge something that hasn't been released yet.  And I'm sure I'll make a few additions to this review when the set is released.  In the meantime, this review is meant to enlighten you about Series 5 of Doctor Who.<br /><br />I'm sure I wasn't the only fan who was skeptical that this lanky upstart Matt \\"Who?\\" Smith (Ha! Did you see what I did there?) could replace the wonderful 10th Doctor, played by David Tennant.  But we long-time fans have come to accept that the role of the Doctor is going to change every few years.  And in the case of Matt Smith, the role couldn't be in better hands.<br /><br />But Doctor Who doesn't just have a new face in front of the camera; Steven Moffat, writer of such modern-day DW classics like \\"Blink\\" and \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" took over the showrunner position from Russell T. Davies.  And again, the show couldn't be in better hands.  Moffat has been very vocal about his reimagining of the series as a sort of dark fairy tale.  And this is evident right from the start, as the TARDIS crash-lands in the back year of 8 year old Amy Pond.  The figurative monster under Amy's bed is actually a crack in her wall, one that will have cosmic consequences throughout the season.<br /><br />New companion Karen Gillan (playing the adult version of Amy) brings a spunky kick to the new Doctor's adventures.  Yet one can still see hints of that lost little girl from time to time.  Gillan and Smith perfectly compliment each other, as both appear wise and experienced far beyond their years.  She almost immediately endures herself to the Doctor (and the audience, hopefully) in the 2nd episode, \\"The Beast Below,\\" by preventing the Doctor from making a terrible mistake.<br /><br />The series touches on more familiar territory--the Daleks, the Weeping Angels, the mysterious River Song--yet stays firmly entrenched in the fantasy world Moffat has helped to create.  As the bowtie-wearing Time Lord, Smith channels Doctors of the past from Patrick Troughton to David Tennant.  He is, as Amy Pond notes in the first episode \\"a mad man with a blue box.\\"  And despite his seemingly unhinged nature, Smith gives the Doctor great dramatic weight when needed. . .whether it's righteous indignation at alien (or human) stupidity, or trying to protect his new companion from the inevitable fate that befalls all his fellow travelers.<br /><br />Doctor Who carries on in fantastic style, and I for one hope that Smith and Gillan stay with their roles for years to come.  I congratulate Steven Moffat and his team for honoring the legacy of Doctor Who, but making it all their own at the same time.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />UPDATE: As expected, the set doesn't disappoint.  Doctor Who began filming in HD in 2009, and the Blu-ray format is perfect for capturing the gorgeous cinematography and excellent effects work.  There are behind-the-scenes features for every episodes, some amusing outtakes, and a few commentary tracks.  And this may be a minor point for many people, but the packaging is really impressive.  The cover features a 3-D lenticular hologram, and there are 3 bonus art prints featuring the Doctor, TARDIS, and a Dalek.  THIS is how you do t.v. on Blu-ray :-)vid Tennant.

0446563048|5.0|\\"Delivering Happiness\\" is the rare book that gives you an inside look at one individual's journey to find happiness and as a leader in business.  Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos, has written a thoughtful account of what he has learned from experiences in life, in business and from his studies of the fast growing field of positive psychology.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to leaders and others who want to see what an engaging work environment -- or \\"Connection Culture\\" as I've described it in my writings -- looks like.  Not only will you learn about Hsieh's thinking, you'll see how he puts ideas into action.<br /><br />Hsieh and his colleagues at Zappos have made culture their top priority.  In hiring, Zappos has developed a process to identify individuals who have both competence and character that fits a healthy work culture.  I could go on and on listing all the great things Zappos does to meet human needs to thrive, but half the fun (and the best way to learn) comes from reading through the book and jotting them down.<br /><br />\\"Delivering Happiness\\" is also a glimpse at what I believe the workplace of the future will look like. With recent Conference Board research concluding that employee satisfaction is at its lowest point since it began surveying more than 20 years ago, we have a very long way to go.<br /><br />Finally, Hsieh ultimately draws upon the findings from positive psychology as a basis to guide our individual and collective (including Zappo's) journeys to find happiness.  I came to the same conclusion in my own research.  Ultimately, positive psychology promotes the character strengths and virtues celebrated by religious thinkers and moral philosophers throughout the ages.  I find this encouraging.  As my wise spiritual mentor once told me when I began my research, it all comes back to character.  Indeed.<br /><br />Michael Lee Stallard,<br />Primary author of [[ASIN:B001FOR576 Fired Up or Burned Out: How to Reignite Your Team's Passion, Creativity, and Productivity]].<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Note: FTC rules require I disclose that I received a free review copy of this book from Zappos.-----------    Note: FTC rules require I disclose that I received a free review copy of this book from Zappos.
0061122416|1.0|I had high hopes for this book after it was recommended to me by a friend.  I was told it could be \\"life-changing\\" and \\"inspirational\\".  I was seriously disappointed.  I read it in about a day and a half, but not because I was so enthralled that I could not put it down. I just wanted to get it over with.  I am the type of person who just has to finish what they start thus torturing myself by finishing this book.      It is terribly written and the \\"inspirational message\\" is suspect.  The boy risks everything to go after his \\"Personal Legend\\".  Why does everyone he meets call his journey a \\"Personal Legend\\"???  It gets very annoying.  The end is disappointing.  What is inspirational about being greedy and materialistic and leaving behind the ones you love to find treasure.  I held out hope until the end that the treasure would be something symbolic and spiritual...but no it was just plain old treasure.  So the moral of the story is that you can talk to the wind and to the sun and find gold.  Come on people!  I find it hard to believe that any self respecting adult liked this book.  This book is new age hooey!  It reminds me of The Secret only disguised as fiction.  It tells us that everything has a soul and that the Earth has a soul and that it wants you to find treasure.  The Universe will send you omens to guide you to treasure if you really want it bad enough.  Need I say more?  This book was painful to read.  Don't torture yourself as I have, skip this one.
159562015X|4.0|The book is essentially an index of the 34 strengths that you can work to develop over the course of your life. Not only are the strengths well-described, but the book also provides action steps that you can take to develop them. In order to determine which of the 34 strengths are your top five strengths, you take an online test that requires a special access code that comes with every book.<br /><br />Being the personality test addict that I am, I paid my $13.47 plus shipping and handling for the book, tore open the envelope with my super-secret access code and went online to take the test. My top 5 strengths were as follows:<br /><br />  * Intellection - Having a need for mental activity, whether it be solving a problem, developing ideas, or philosophical reflection.<br />  * Ideation - Being fascinated by ideas and new perspectives. Viewing phenomena from new and different angles.<br />  * Futuristic - The ability to have a clear, detailed vision of what the future might hold.<br />  * Connectedness - Understanding that we, all of us, are a part of something bigger. Being aware of the subtle forces and patterns which govern all things.<br />  * Learner - Having a love of learning.<br /><br />I wasn't particularly surprised by my results, other very good personality tests I had taken had basically informed me of my strengths (and weaknesses) in a similar way. What was different was how the StrengthsFinder book encouraged me to develop my strengths.  The book stressed that although these were my natural talents, I had to work to develop them or they would deteriorate.<br /><br />Thinking back to my career as a recruiter, I realized how true that was. In the effort to eliminate my weaknesses, I had neglected many of my natural strengths, almost to the point of making them weaknesses. Because I was too busy making calls and answering emails, I gave myself little time to think things through, thus neglecting my abilities of intellection. Because I was so busy gobbling up other people's ideas about how things should be done, I had spent little time developing my own ideas, thus neglecting my abilities of ideation. Because I didn't allow myself see past my sales figures for the next fiscal quarter, I failed to think about the future-the long term consequences of my actions and inactions. I was so preoccupied by narrow concerns that I failed to tap into my ability to see the connections between things. Finally, because I let myself work 50 to 60 hour weeks and partied all night on the weekends to blow off steam, I spent very little time learning anything new.<br /><br />I realize now that I could have worked to develop my strengths even as a recruiter, but because the job was such a mismatch for me, it made me more aware of the weaknesses I had to improve upon than the strengths I could capitalize upon. Now, because I've decided to work for myself I find myself gravitating toward business opportunities that take advantage of my strengths rather than making me aware of my weaknesses. It's amazing what change in perspective can do.up other people's ideas about how things should be done, I had spent little time developing my own ideas, thus neglecting my abilities of ideation.

B003NJPOAQ|2.0|To begin I do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever, however, this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty.  The sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90's would have have submitted to companies as a demo.  I understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies, but with this album I fail to see that expansion, and if anything, the feel appears to be reflecting the mood, not neccessairly the words, of the so-called economic recovery of the United States.  Overall, if this were his first album, it would receive a higher rating, but it is not.  I truly find it amazing that Jack Johnson insists on using renewable sources of energy to power his recording sessions; I just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry, hollow, and virtually flat sound was the best he and his engineers could come up with.  If this is supposed to sell people on the Green movement and its approach to recording, I suggest finding someone else.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|It is NOT the Blair Witch Project. It is not even a very poor man's Cloverfield.    I cannot believe I didn't camp outside the theatere to warn people that, if they weren't brain dead with superstition or some other mental ailment, they would want their money back.    As a Jr. college film project, it's cute, as anything else it's insulting.
0756405890|5.0|I can only compare Name of the Wind to books like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Twilight, Chronicles of Narnia, The Hunger Games, Percy Jackson, etc (and I recommend all of these series on a sliding scale for different types of readers); and Name of the Wind is an exceptional book.  I couldn't put it down from the first moment I started reading it and I think that it has a very well crafted plot with creative and imaginative detail and development.  My only complaint is that it is a little wordy, but it is a fabulous read and I am looking forward to whenever Wise Man's Fear is released.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|Having bought, and enjoyed, the previous two soundtracks I was very excited for this one to come out.  I was NOT disappointed!  The songs on this soundtrack are unique and I can't say that there is a dud in the bunch.  Well, I guess Jacob's Theme isn't my favorite.....but all the rest are amazing!  I can't wait to look up more info on all the artists.  In my opinion, this is the BEST Twilight Saga soundtrack yet!
1416550550|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" and I still feel pretty emotional about it. To call it just a page-turner is not to do it justice. Just about the time I would think I had an idea as to where the story was going, there would be a surprise and a new twist to the mystery. One thing, tho. This is not a book that is easy to follow, as to the time line of the story. If you like to start a book, leave it for awhile, then go back to it a week later, you might get confused (or, at least I would), about what period in which the events were taking place. It would have been helpful if there had been a genealogy chart, but then again, that might have taken away some of the fun of reading it.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|This is an excellent book.  I've already lost 7 pounds and my constant hunger and cravings are gone.  The medical community can debate the science but I'm convinced by the numbers on the scale.  If you are having problems reading the charts with this book for the Kindle version, and you are using the Kindle app with an ipod Touch, just turn the ipod sideways and the charts will read correctly.  Mine also says \\"table of contents not available\\" but it is there.  Just go to the first chapter and page back and you will see it.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|James Cameron spent 12 YEARS thinking about this .12 YEARS!  Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel in less time.  Leonardo did the Mona Lisa in less time.  The Golden Gate Bridge took less time.  Building the Haldon Collider took less time.  WW2 took less time.  etc.  12 years ,an enormous amount of hype to justify exorbitant ticket prices,and all we have to show is a remake of \\"Dances with the Wolves\\" done with smurfs!    Honestly, this is no better than a very poor episode of Star Trek(the TV version).
B001GCUO16|5.0|I always liked the X-Men series.  Hugh Jackman is great.  The digital copy is a nice added bonus.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Along with the Complete Studio Recordings boxed set (CDs) that I bought a few months back, I decided to chuck in a couple of DVDs for the day that I might catch-up with the 21st century and actually get myself a DVD player!!    I was going to save the DVDs for that 'pie in the sky' wide screen that I may or never may get. Anyway, just the other day, finding myself with some time on my hands; I decided to give the Led Zeppelin DVD a spin. (Bad move... Well, not really a bad move - just bad timing. I decided to have a quick look at it on my desktop computer... Just before going to bed. To cut a long story short:)    1) I was completely blown away. (I should have known better after my experience with the \\"How the West Was Won\\" CD...)    2) I was up the whole night and I didn't even think about going to bed until way past the time when the sun started beating down on my tin roof!    3) I felt the need to burst into print with this because I have just been watching Jimmy Page's guitar solo in \\"White Summer,\\" (Live at the Royal Albert Hall, London - 1970) - for about the 10th time already. At the end of the performance, I couldn't restrain myself from bursting into applause - (even though I live alone and only my dogs could have even heard it!) There were tears in my eyes - and I noticed that all the hairs on my ugly legs were standing-up on their ends!    There's also a lump in my throat, as I write this.    I can't say any more...
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I loved this movie like all Pixar movies.<br /><br />The blueray edition was stunning.  I only wish it had a digital copy.
B000P0J09C|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is an outstanding portait of soldiers before and during the VietNam War. The first half of the film is so great that it seems to overshadow the rest of the film. But I feel the second half is just as compelling. Kubrick's direction reflects early films such as Paths of Glory and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Like all of Kubrick's films, there are images that you will see that seem to linger in your mind long after the film is over.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It is a great movie for kids.  What a wonderful story. It's about a young boy who lose's his mother and he is in a wheel chair.  The kids take him to the Secret Garden and that's where the fun begins.  It was nice to see this little boy walk after being told that he never could go outside or ever walk again.  His Dad comes home and they take him to the garden and then the son shows his father how he has learned how to walk again thanks to the garden.
B0037W68F4|4.0|If you liked Kids, Electric Feel, and Time to Pretend, but not tracks off the latter half of their first album, Congratulations probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Granted, the huge success of the three aforementioned singles put MGMT on the map, and perhaps made them a bit too popular for their own liking.  Congratulations seemingly brings MGMT back to their \\"roots\\", with meandering synthpop beats that are not appropriate for radio, club scenes, or other Lady Gaga-esque mediums.  In fact, Lady Dada's Nightmare (track 8) is a thrilling diversion to music that's everything un-pop.  Siberian Breaks (track 6) is a 12-minute journey through what the band describes as \\"surfing through the Arctic Circle\\", and definitely worth a listen.<br /><br />To be fair, I got into MGMT due to early exposure to the genius that was Kids, but Congratulations is a nice break from that through a \\"Moons, Birds & Monsters\\" feel across the album.  I feel like MGMT will make a splash again someday with more radio-pleasing tracks, but this album is a defying rally against their earlier formula for success... and it works.
031606792X|5.0|Had to buy this because I wore my best friends copy out! Had to replace hers and get one for myself! these books are just awesome!
0307476154|5.0|I bought the first of the trilogy as a book to read on travel.  I had no idea there were more to the series.  I had to buy the second book to continue the story, I wanted to know more.  Very suspenseful and keeps you wanting to read on.  This book was just as good of a read as the first one.
0345409671|5.0|FIVE STARS PLUS 100!!!!  This book was so amazing I finished it in a day! if you don't read any other books from this series, you HAVE to read this one.  I couldn't put it down and found myself crying several times.  This book is a true masterpiece! Go Anne!
B003P8BB5W|5.0|I'm a huge Twilight fan, so I think I would love anything associated with it.  Putting the Twilight connection aside, this album is great!  When the free sneak peek was available a few days ago, I listened to it all day and never got sick of it.  Now that I own it, I plan to listen to it non-stop for weeks, and won't get sick of it!  As I listen to the songs, I try to imagine where they will fit with the story in the movie.  This album is highly recommended to everyone, not just the Twilight-obsessed.  (I'm one of the Twi-Moms, by the way, so it's not just for the teens).  Buy the album and enjoy!!
0525423842|1.0|i\\"m with you. i did the same thing, hoping to see a big comeback. when i \\"finished\\" the book, I kept looking to see if the final pages were torn out as it did not 'end'. at first i thought he was just dumbing down the language to attract less educated people, then realized its a kid book. not genX! not genY! maybe Gen Z. we'll find out when my grandkids are old enough to read.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|I attended the U2 360 Tour concert at Fed Ex field last September. Trying to describe the experience to someone who wasn't there is almost impossible. The HUGE \\"Claw\\" stage setup was an amazing sight - like something out of a Godzilla movie! But if you couldn't be there, this DVD is the next best thing. Although the Rose Bowl set list is slightly different than the one I saw, watching this DVD still brought back some great memories. 95 percent of this concert is the same as what I saw in DC. It was like going back to the concert again, but this time from different ever changing seat locations. The sound quality is excellent and the presentation of the concert is top notch!  So for those that missed the 360 tour, heres your chance to finally see it. And for those of you that did go, this is the ultimate 360 concert souvenir. Enjoy!
0307341550|4.0|If you ask me which words come into my mind first whenever I think of this book, my answer will be: nasty, dark, twisted, disturbing.<br /><br />In this rather traumatizing psychological thriller Camille Preaker, a troubled newspaper reporter, is sent to her home town to get the inside scoop on the murders of two preteen girls - both were strangled and had their teeth removed. As we follow Camille on her quest to obtain as much information as possible about the crimes, we learn much more than we bargained for. The small town of Wind Gap, in the fashion of Twin Peaks, is filled to the brim with dark secrets, and not the least of them is the twisted dynamics in Camille's own family...<br /><br />For me the most remarkable aspect of this book is that Gillian Flynn succeeds in creating a novel main characters of which are nasty women. I am so used to books where women are victims and all evil is committed by bad, bad men. Not so in Sharp Objects. Women of Wind Gap are both victims and perpetrators, they are promiscuous and abusive, self-destructive and violent. Men are only fixtures in their lives and pawns in their sick games. If anything, this is a refreshing twist on the old tired genre of murder mystery.<br /><br />I liked the psychological aspect of this novel as well. Flynn skillfully portrays how differently people react to the abuse in their lives - some direct the pain onto themselves, some inflict it on others - and both are equally damaging to one's psyche.<br /><br />I definitely wouldn't recommend Sharp Objects to squeamish. There is a lot of disturbing stuff in this book - promiscuous young girls, self-mutilation, sexual abuse, drugs. This is not a comfort read by any means. However I found it fascinating (in a I-can't-stop-watching-this-train-wreck way) and hard to put down. I will certainly read Flynn's other novel - Dark Places. Well, as soon as I psychologically recover from Sharp Objects.
B002N5N4M6|4.0|Love the show.  The DVD is great.  I didn't understand some of the synopses which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of five.  I like having the whole season to watch my favorite episodes.  Can't wait for this season to be available.

B0020MKTOS|5.0|hahaha this movie is great, eastwood plays a washed up recently widowed grumpy old man who in the past was fighting in korea and is haunted by the horrble things he did and the people he killed there. because of his experiences, he despises koreans, or as he calls them \\"gooks\\" but when the new neighborhs are a a family of the kind he hates, he finds that there is less truth and gorrible fiction to his foul mouthed and sometimes funny racism, as he grows close to the family and the young teenage boy and girl who live there.   the whole movieis mostly slap style jokes that make you feel bad that you are laughing at them,and the old tough guy looks the part and seems prefect for clint eastwod. he is awsome,   but underneath his crude humor there is a powerful and often moving story that will have you close to tears at the end.   i would recommend you buy it.   its just awsome.
B001TMCIPS|5.0|Eat That Frog! is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  Procrastination can be broken down to fear - fear of failure, fear of success, fear that project is too big or too time consuming, fear of lack of money or knowledge.  I encourage my clients to face their fear, and commit to doing whatever it is they are procrastinationg doing.  They write their biggest procrastination on a froggy notepad, post it where they see it first thing in the morning, and eat their frog everyday.  They've had great success.  Thanks, Brian Tracy, for coining this awesome phrase!
B001OQCV6A|1.0|ok, the accents were way over done, and what eas with the dumb guy returning form the dead???   cheesy lines, and story line, the special effects sucked, the acting fro downey was dumb and horrible, and the movie was just a down right frollicking mess.   the humor was lame, and everything about it started off way too fast and didnt tie toegether at the end, it was not worth it.
B003HE2B6C|3.0|I have been a Hanson fan since I was a teenager, and I make it a point to always buy the newest album as well as see them on tour every single time they are in my state. I was eagerly anticipating Hanson's 5th studio album (of new music, I'm ignoring the live albums and Christmas album) and found it an infectious cd filled with sugary pop songs.    \\"Shout it Out\\" returns to what the band does best...write catchy, fun, pop songs with fantastic hooks. It is filled with wonderful harmonies of the three brothers and delicious guitar riffs from oldest brother, Isaac.       \\"Thinking `Bout Somethin'\\" the first single from the album, is easily the best song on the entire album.  A song and video that pays an amazing homage to the classic Blues Brother movie of the 80's that is so catchy it is impossible not to dance along.     However, while the album does feature some wonderful catchy pop songs it also highlights the bad, bland lyrics.  As a band that has been in this for over 13 years should have more ability to write something with a little more meat lyrically than very basic rhyming lyrics. It feels very juvenile, catchy, but very, very cheesy. Having been a fan for as long as I have been, I know they are capable of much better lyrics than what I see displayed on this album.    The CD starts off pretty well with a catchy \\"Waiting for this\\" followed immediately by the fantastic \\"Thinking `Bout Somethin'\\" but nothing after \\"Thinkin' Bout Somethin'\\" ever equals the greatness.  On \\"Thinking `Bout Somethin'\\" we see the first display of the brass section used a few more times on the album, and only on this song does it feel appropriate. The brass section makes a reappearance on \\"Give a Little\\", \\"Make it Out Alive\\", \\"And I waited\\" and lastly \\"Voice in the Chorus\\", each time not adding anything extra to the song, especially \\"Make it out alive\\" which I liked better acoustically.     I do not feel this album has a cohesiveness to it.  I understand that it is supposed to be a fun, light, and loud album, but I find many songs oddly misplaced on the album.  \\"Carry You there\\" which highlights the bands beautiful vocals and harmonies feels oddly out of place, as does the ballad \\"Use Me Up\\" which displays the vocals of Zac Hanson. These songs feel as if they needed to be on \\"The Walk\\" album instead of this one.  \\"Use Me up\\" and \\"Carry You there\\" are both nice songs, but slightly feel heavy on a record that is supposed to be fun, light, and loud.  The last song \\"Me Myself and I\\" wants to be another \\"Song to Sing\\" but lacks it in charm, lyrics, vocals and goes on about  2 minutes too long.  \\"Me Myself and I\\" seems to plod along without anything significant happening to grab my attention, and also feels slightly misplaced upon this album.    The record, for me, derails pretty quickly after \\"Make It Out Alive\\" going from catchy songs with pretty good hooks to forgettable songs that I can't remember the words to. I lose a lot of interest after track six.  \\"And I waited\\" which again features Zac on lead vocals has the potential to be great, but lacks the infectiousness that the previous songs had for me and starts the process with more forgettable songs such as \\"Musical Ride\\", \\"Use Me Up\\", \\"Voice in the Chorus\\". and \\"Me Myself and I\\"  The only exception in the second half being \\"These Walls\\" which is infectious and charming with a great chorus.     The worst song on the album, by far, is \\"Voice in The Chorus\\" where after a few listens I've decided the song has too much going on in it.  Nothing about this song grabs my attention and I've tried to listen to it a few times, but I can't seem to sense the vision of this song.    Overall, I understand the vision that Hanson wanted to have with this album and I applaud the effort. I enjoy about half of the CD very much, which is why I'm giving it only a 3/5 because I don't enjoy all or most.   I do think they've gotten back to what they are good at...writing pop songs with great hooks, but it's still not asevolved as I think they are capable of.  I sometimes feel that this album is a step in the right direction just as it is a step backwards.  I feel it finally comes back to things they are excellent at, but the lyrics are an absolute step backwards.   I'd like to see them continue in the vein of \\"Thinking `Bout Somethin'\\" and really make more great music with lyrics that don't feel so juvenile.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|Overall, this is her darkest and most expressive album.  After the somewhat pedestrian Bare, something must have happened, because this lady is sad and angry.  I would not expect that to translate well for her, but the results are stunning.  The song \\"Through the Glass Darkly\\" features some of the most powerful and disturbingly beautiful vocals I have ever heard.  \\"Sing\\" does get watered down with too many guest vocalists and loses focus, for me, but it's still very good. Keep them coming, Annie.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This is hot. Like burning hot. Like hot as the fugging sun hot. With artists putting out cheap beats and shiet lyrics; this ultra refreshing. Refreshing like as if I hadn't drank water for 1 month while running on treadmill on the sun's surface. Then I drank ice water straight from the arctic, but that's impossible, because this album is hot. Jay-z just put out a hot album, now Nas/Damian Marley, next is Dre. Time for the old hip hop kings to return, slap the shiet out of, and show how the young bloods how's it done (Lil Wayne and his less gangster copy, Drake the Fake)
B002VKE1K2|1.0|After viewing this snorefest, I would suggest you put in a classic, one with some real character development, and a psychological use of your imagination, and watch 'The Haunting (1963)'. I'm surprised that Amazon, and others, would give such a favorable review to this very ordinary, predictable pseudo-scare film, in the horror faux cinema verite style.     And yes, the BIGGEST disappointment was the complete absence of multiple, extended, and langourous scenes of Micah fully unclothed, which, as potential victim would have been fully justified by the genre, generally, and thoroughly enjoyed by me and many other very attentive and appreciative men and women.
0525423842|4.0|Being a huge John Grisham fan, I read Kid Lawyer just because Grisham wrote it.  His books grab you right from the start and don't let you go until the last page.  Kid Lawyer reminded me of the Client, but without teeth.  Again it's the story of a young man, Theo a thirteen-year old aspiring lawyer with lawyer parents, but this time, instead of the main character witnessing the murder, Grisham has him being told of the murder by someone else.  In The Client, the eleven year old is in mortal danger, in Kid Lawyer, the thirteen year-old's client is in mortal danger, removing much of the tension of the story.<br /><br />In The Client, Ricky, the eleven year old, has dysfunctional parents and smokes cigarettes and goes to places he shouldn't, in Kid Lawyer, Theo skips school.  From my observation, kids like to be scared.  Take a look at the best seller rack in any bookstore and you'll see what I mean as you peruse the kids section.  Kid Lawyer, though written as superbly as any Grisham novel, isn't scary and Grisham makes the major mistake of making his main character nearly perfect.  How can any kid relate to that?  Theo solves his friends legal problems, tutors the homeless and has nearly perfect parents who love and adore him.  Not much reality to relate to there for most kids.<br /><br />If Grisham had written the book from the view point of the homeless kid, I think this novel would have related more to kids and he would have broken some new ground.  Plus, he would have ratcheted up the suspense by about 100%.<br /><br />Again, I loved the book because I think that Grisham is one of the finest writers of our generation.  He will be remembered long after he's dead, but maybe not for this book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1608605809 When I Dream]]

B0007MWZEK|5.0|I don't order things off the TV very often.  If you are looking here, I strongly recommend ordering it here or from the SS website, the phone ordering process made me very uncomfortable as it was all automated.  But we got ours together last night, and first used the hand tool.  It was great, it picked up crumbs, cat litter, cat food.  Then we used the sweeper itself.  It is so much quieter than a vacuum and did a very satisfactory job.  When this one gives out, hopefully a long time from now, I would definitely buy another one.  I am even thinking of buying one for the office.  We have janitorial, but we work in a small, high security area, and it's a big hassle to let them in to clean.  Overall, very glad I bought this.

0061251305|5.0|In a nutshell, as Peter Drucker says, \\"culture eats strategy for breakfast.\\"     The authors show us how the developmental stages of culture in the business world, how to recognize them, and how to move the culture up a stage. If you are familiar with philosopher Ken Wilber or Don Beck and Spiral Dynamics, you will see a familiar philosophy applied in the business world. Based on an eight year study of 24,000 people, the book is grounded in research but written in stories that make it easy to understand and comprehend.    As an executive coach that works with dozens of CEOs in NYC, I highly recommend this book for every business leader!
B002ZG4Q5W|2.0|Ran's a great movie that deserves a better transfer.  I saw the film in the theater a week before getting this blu-ray.  It was a scratchy print but it didn't have the noise that is prevalent in this disc.
B002TZS5GU|4.0|\\"Carriers\\" is not really a good title for this movie, because even though one look at the DVD cover makes it clear this is not about [[ASIN:B001LP33Y8 World War II flattops]], you still do not get a real sense what this 2009 film is about.  Once again most everybody in the world is dead and the focus is not on latter-day Thyphoid Marys but rather a quartet of survivors who are trying to make it from New Mexico to Texas to get to the beach.  In that regard it is similar to \\"[[ASIN:B001FB5634 The Road]],\\" which I just happened to watch last week, but without the landscape being totally decimated and scavengers having already picked everything clean.  Packed into car are Brian Green (Chris Pine) and his brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci), along with Brian's girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo) and a classmate of Danny's, Kate (Emily VanCamp).  Thoughts of being the next Adam and Eve have not popped up yet, and at this point the goal is survive and reach their destination, although it is just the beachhouse were the boys were happy as kids and not a true place of possible salvation.  But when Brian ennunciates the five rules by which he insists they live, everybody who has ever seen \\"[[ASIN:B000P0J0A6 Gremlins]]\\" or any of the hundreds of other films that takes as its dramatic impeteus the dictum that rules exist to be broken, knows what is going to happen between now and the end of the movie.<br /><br />Written and directed by the Pastor brothers Alex and David, this movie is the series of encounters that the four have with other people.  Danny is the sort who things that human beings should look out for each other, but whereas he was to believe the glass is half full, brother Brian knows that proverbial glass is not just empty but broken beyond possible repair.  But Brian is such a disagreeable person that it is hard to take his pragmatic perspective, even though you know he is right (plus, there is the sense that it is the times that have tried Brian's soul and that he was not always this way).  Then again, kind-hearted Danny is not going to survive if he does not get a serious attitude adjustment.  To further complicate things, each brother is paired up with the wrong woman, because Bobby is the compassionate one and Kate the one who is deadly serious about the rules.  Something has to give between here and the Texas coast.  The most ironic line in the film is also the grimmest, when Bobby tells Brian, \\"I think we need to start seeing other people.\\"  Tell me about it.<br /><br />\\"Carriers\\" belongs in the viral pandemic sub-genre of post-apocalyptic films, which puts it in the tradition of Stephen King's \\"[[ASIN:B00006AUIN The Stand]],\\" and which also makes it a relatively rare exception these days to the zombie movies from \\"[[ASIN:B00005Y6Y2 Night of the Living Dead]]\\" to \\"[[ASIN:B002WY65VU Zombieland]]\\" currently dominating end-of-the-world films.  With these latter films switching to postmodern zombies that are now quick and dead (e.g., \\"[[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]]),\\" it is actually nice to get back to something relatively \\"normal\\" for the end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it.  Ultiamtely, that is the main attraction for me in this film, because I like to be able to rumminate about what the hell would I do in such a situation, and I would rather deal with the problems presented by simple survival and debating the attempt to rekindle the spark of human kindness in others than having to contend with a geometrically progressing horde of speed racing evil dead.  The performances are decent enough, especially Perabo, and the majority of characters the quartet encounter on their journey come across as real human beings and not the psychopaths that usually populate such films.  The result is not great, but these days a solid movie comes across as being pretty good given the competition.ays this way).

This particular edition, however, is flawed. My copy had forty pages missing and replaced with a portion that was already printed in the prior chapters.

B003CIG7AE|3.0|Infinite Arms is the third CD from Band of Horses, but it is the first one of theirs that I have owned or listened to.  So this review is geared for the casual rather than the die hard fan.  I thought that this CD had potential after listening to the samples available online, and it does have a handful of decent songs.  However it is one of the more inconsistent CDs that I have.  I found \\"Compliments\\" and \\"Laredo\\" to be catchy and upbeat by way of comparison to the rest of the CD.  The vocal harmonies are pretty good, and the instrumentation is pure rock candy (pun intended).  The other song that I really liked has more of a country/folk leaning - \\"Older\\".  I don't think it is their intent, but this song seems like Band of Horses sweet spot to me.<br /><br />However, I found a couple of low points on Infinite Arms.  The vocal delivery on \\"Blue Beard\\" and \\"Evening Kitchen\\" seemed more high pitched, and I found it annoying.  Ben Bridwell seems to hit somewhere between Barry Gibb and Peter Cetera, but it just doesn't work.  I much prefer his lower register like what is found on \\"Older\\".<br /><br />The rest of the songs and the instrumentation are OK but nothing stellar.  The music overall is unoffensive, but there wasn't much that I latched on to either.  If you are like me - the casual fan - I would suggest seeing if you can listen to some full length samples before committing to this one.  I need something to connect with in my music, but I just didn't find it here.<br /><br />Download this:  Laredo

1591841666|4.0|People love or hate Seth Godin. People who like him find him inspirational and/or great at giving you a different perspective on things. People who dislike him find him short on specifics. Seth Godin is not a \\"how-to\\" author, he's not trying to 12 step you to your goals. He's trying to give you a different perspective, something new to think about.     I found The Dip to be very helpful when I was at a crossroads on some career and financial decisions. The Dip did not show me what to do. It just gave me the very helpful bigger picture perspective that if you feel you are at a cul-de-sac well, you probably are, but it's hard to see when you're there. Several people have pointed out that Godin's advice is obvious, and yes it is, but the way he distills the information was helpful and timely for me.    In summary, if you are at a crossroads and are looking for a different perspective, or maybe just the equivalent of conversational relief, pick up The Dip. It's a gem of a little book. It won't change your world but it will help you rethink it, and that will lead to the change you need.
0743454537|1.0|The only thing that makes this book even appear to be worthwhile is it's \\"controversial topic\\" (which is advertised right on the cover). I was so irritated with how awful this book was it took me over an hour to chill my brain enough to start a new one. So often controversy is mistaken for depth. This book had none. I thought it was going to be great but the more I read the more I was proved wrong. The characters are absurdly one-dimensional while constantly try to claim otherwise through out the book but ultimately don't. This book is not even worth the paper it is printed on. Normally if I don't like a book I donate to the thrift store or give it BCID on bookcrossing. This one I tossed directly into the recycling.

B002VKE1K2|4.0|A couple begins filming the unexplained activities that have been haunting them in their Southern Californian home. As the entity begins to show more and more signs of its presence, Micah and Katie quickly realize that they shouldn't have tempted forces that they do not fully understand. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY stands as one of the strongest \\"found-footage\\" films in the genre. The film maintains its integrity by implementing a slow and subtle terror that is built on suspense rather than the typical Hollywood jump scares. By including lengthy segments that are relatively uneventful, director Oren Peli creates a believable scenario that could conceivably happen to anyone. When the events do occur, they are so jarring and incredibly frightening that they are sure to shock even the hardened Horror fan without ever having to show anything on screen. Micah Sloat creates a rounded character that is able to sneak in a few laughs to break up the tension, however Katie's performance often becomes too scripted and unnatural to be taken seriously. The insignificant touches that are added to the house (such as the patches of dead grass in the yard or bead table that Katie works from) add an authenticity to the characters and setting. Peli's adaptation of the documentary-style format in to the ghost film proves to be a winning combination that offers some of the greatest scares in recent decades. The phenomenal box office response served to solidify this fact, making PARANORMAL ACTIVITY one of the most successful Independent films of all time.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
1591940672|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

B000TTRGUE|5.0|First off.  I screwed up on the seller feedback and would like to thank Ace Photo Digital for the excellent service in providing this microphone and the rest of my order.  Now, as to the mic.  I added the foam ball wind screen immediately and my observations are with that in place.  The mic is quite heavy and shows a very good build quality.  It is no more heavy than my old Shure that I've been using for eons.  I wasn't even in the market for a mic until I read the reviews of this unit.  For less than $30 I had to try it.  It has a very natural tone..not to warm, not to bright.  I use it in my home studio while mixing music for friends.. I add voice overs much like DJ'ing.  I have to tell you.  This new Baringer stuff rocks.  Much higher quality than their price would suggest.  If I needed a mic for vocals I wouldn't even shrug at the purchase of this one.  Irregardless of the low price, the build and sound quality would compare with many mid and top end mic's.

B003P8BB5W|4.0|At the end of last year, I declared the \\"New Moon\\" soundtrack the best album of the year, and I still standby that claim. It was just a great collection showing the pure talents of some of the best in Alternative & Indie music today. Moreover, it was totally against the tastes of its teenage fans, so that's always a plus. And while they weren't quite as well implemented into the movie as I would have liked, most/all of the songs still stood on their own. So the question is, can the Eclipse soundtrack possibly follow-up to the best album of 2009?<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />Eclipse (All Yours)<br />Ours<br />Let's Get Lost<br />Jonathan Low<br /><br />The thing about the \\"New Moon\\" soundtrack that was so great is that the songs felt like their sound. It was just material they were working on, and decided to put on the soundtrack. It seems that this was the same case for this album, but the sound doesn't really fit with most of their artists.<br /><br />In fact, the album almost comes off as slightly experimental. Vampire Weekend sounds like a more mainstream version of Vampire Weekend. Florence + the Machine are a lot heavier sounding than normal. Muse inches ever close to sounding like the second-coming/rip-off of Queen. Some of it works. Some of it doesn't. It's really hit or miss.<br />For me, the best work on the album is that, which is in line for the artist that created them. The Bravery sounds like The Bravery. Metric sounds like Metric. Band of Horses sounds exactly like Band of Horses. Whatever the reason, there's a huge gap in tone and quality for several songs on the album. Even the Howard Shore piano tune isn't as memorable as the Alexandre Desplat track from last year.<br /><br />Overall, due to its uneven nature throughout, I don't recommend downloading the full album, but instead downloading the better tracks, or the tracks by the bands you like. It isn't a great overall product like the \\"New Moon\\" soundtrack was, but there's still enough great work here to be listened to in some capacity or another.<br /><br />Real Score: 3.5/5 Stars<br /><br />If you got the bonus tracks, these will consist of songs by artists apparently too obscure to be released on the regular version (Sia & Fanfarlo should have be relegated to this). The results are interesting, but ultimately forgettable. You'll also get two interesting, but again, useless remixes. Not really worth the price to get the special edition,  but if it sounds appealing to you, by all means try it.<br /><br />Real Score for Bonus Disc: 2/5 Starsother.

B003JSU2NU|4.0|The best thing you can say about any movie's soundtrack is that it can stand on its own, and that no matter what you think of the movie, the soundtrack is chock full of amazing music.<br /><br />And the soundtrack to \\"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse\\" is one of those. Whether you love or hate the teen-vampire-infatuation series, it's undeniable that the soundtrack has some excellent (if less indie than the last one) bands -- expansive rock'n'roll and lush echoing pop, some of it well-known (Muse, Vampire Weekend) and some relative obscure (Florence and the Machine).<br /><br />\\"Tear me down, they can't/take you out of my thoughts/under every star/there's a battle I've lost...\\" It opens with Metric's \\"Eclipse (All Yours),\\" a beautifully layered pop melody filled with shimmering rough riffs; after that it segues into the painfully passionate \\"Neutron Star Collision (Love Is Forever)\\" by Muse -- a lament that explodes into a supernova of dark racing riffs and wailing vocals.<br /><br />There's a pretty good rock'n'roll showing after that, with the Bravery's fast-moving angsty \\"Ours,\\" the Black Keys' raw bluesy \\"Chop and Change,\\" the Dead Weather's slow-burning bleak \\"Rolling on a Burning Tire,\\" and the mildly funky folk of Cee Lo Green's \\"What Part of Forever.\\" The best: UNKLE's collaboration with the Black Angels is a brilliantly eerie, murky rocker, while Vampire Weekend slips effortlessly into the expansive, glittering \\"Jonathan Low.\\"<br /><br />Then there's the pop songs, which are even more remarkable -- Florence and the Machine's exquisitely spooky \\"Heavy in my Arms,\\" Fanfario's sprightly \\"Atlas,\\" Sia's haunting strings-and-piano ballad \\"My Love,\\" Band of Horses' starlight-filled \\"Life on Earth,\\" and Howard Shore's bittersweet piano melody \\"Jacob's Theme.\\" But the best of the bunch is Beck's collaboration with Bat For Lashes -- a sensuous, elusive duet of piano and blips.<br /><br />Finally, there are a pair of bonus tracks -- the ominously perky \\"The Line\\" by the Battles, and the vaguely hallucinatory Bombay Bicycle Club's \\"How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep?\\".<br /><br />This soundtrack is pretty different from the two that precede it. It's not as deliciously indie as the \\"New Moon\\" one, but it's not crammed with emo popmetal either. In fact, there are only a few songs on this album that don't thrill me to the core, and only one I dislike -- namely, Eastern Conference Champions' blandly monotonous \\"A Million Miles an Hour.\\"<br /><br />And the bands included set a wonderful double mood -- some of the songs reflect bittersweet romanticism (Metric, Sia), but there's also a feeling of dark raw menace in others (The Dead Weather). There's a lot of slow sad piano, veils of electronica, bouncy acoustics and some deeply brilliant guitar riffs -- they can shimmer like starlight on the water, or erupt into a fast-moving, expansive band of sound.<br /><br />And both the singers and lyrics stretch across a wide range. They can be dark and distorted, quirky, sweet, filled with pain and sorrow (\\"Love is forever... we'll die together\\"), and sometimes understatedly powerful (\\"Who is the betrayer?/Who is the killer in the crowd?/The one who creeps in corridors/and doesn't make a sound!\\").<br /><br />You don't have to be a fan of the Twilight franchise to appreciate the music in \\"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse\\" soundtrack -- some is creepy, some is lovely, and most of it is brilliant.Bombay Bicycle Club's \\"How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep?\\".

B0037Z95Z6|1.0|Return to Cranford will not play on my blu-ray player or on my neighbor's player.  It was clearly pressed for British Commonwealth blu-ray players, not for North American players.  This is the second time Amazon has been sloppy in its marketing and burned me, the first time was Miss Potter which also would not play on a U.S.-based blu-ray player.  I was very disappointed as I was so looking forward to playing this disc.  Cranford works just fine but not Return to Cranford.  Amazon needs to be more careful in the discs it provides to its viewers.

It recaps most of the underlying theories and discoveries in physical science in a way that a high school graduate should be able to understand.  I'm not going to go into great detail about the book its self but I highly recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about physics.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|As a Community College student myself not so long ago, I was interested what NBC Comedy could possibly do with such a wacky institution. The Results? I wish I went to this Community College...<br /><br />First off, the show does take great liberties with the setting. My experience may have differed from the norm, but mostly what I saw was a bunch of apathetic people who couldn't wait till the moment they could get back home. They would never go to a candlelight vigil at night for example. The people of Greendale are the opposite of that. They care about EVERYTHING. They will create a candlelight vigil for wacky causes, and bake cookies for everybody there. Of course, the setting also gives a great sense of openness and freedom for the show. In this world, the possibilities are endless and anything can happen.<br /><br />Next up, the stories. At the beginning, the show struggled hard to find itself, being more hit or miss more than anything, but after the first 5-10 episodes, the show really entered its own. A relationship doesn't work? Drop it! A pairing doesn't work? Separate them! Two actors had more chemistry then you originally realized? Put them together! A personality is too negative? Change it, then make jokes about it! Nothing holds this show down, and each time it comes down with more flair than the last time. May I also note that almost every episode takes advantage of each classroom setting really well? Plus, especially towards the end of the season, the episodes turn into complete brilliant parodies. An episode that takes on \\"Goodfellas\\" and other mafia movies? Do it! It's hilarious!<br /><br />Plus, the cast is great for everything that is thrown at them. Joel McHale is excellent of course, Chevy Chase does a serviceable job, and everybody else, who were basically unknowns before the show, really break out here. This includes Donald Glover, Allison Brie, etc. Plus, Ken Jeong is great as always, and that's always a plus.<br /><br />If you're still not convinced of the brilliance of Community, watch \\"Modern Warfare.\\" Not overrated in the slightest, it's the best episode of TV period of the last 6 months, and the best episode of comedy in the past year. Everything that makes this show so great came together PERFECTLY for this episode to absolutely gut-wrenching comedy. Never before has ridiculousness, parody & inspired brilliance come together before like this since \\"Airplane!\\"<br /><br />Overall, in a year where The Office shows considerable signs of aging, new-comer Community upstages and BLOWS AWAY its older brethren. It's only a matter of when for the show to get a big cult following like The Office once did, so jump on now. It's just now starting to get really good, and you don't want to miss a minute of it.munity, watch \\"Modern Warfare.\\" Not overrated in the slightest, it's the best episode of TV period of the last 6 months, and the best episode of comedy in the past year.

0307386171|4.0|In just a few short pages McEwan has a lot to say about how men and women communicate, or miscommunicate.  He wants you to know it takes more than love and for anybody who has ever let one get away, he makes you ponder what might have been if only you had that something more.
0321647440|4.0|This is a great instructional product that goes way beyond the manual that comes with the program. If you are a serious photographer and/or editor, and you are willing to be diligent with your studies this is the trainer for you.  I did run into some trouble with what seems to be a malfunction of the disk. It is not obvious where to go for help. Once I worked through that I was treated cordially and was supplied a new disc or download (my choice) without any hassle.
B000002P2V|5.0|I had this on album, but had to have on CD with all the Bonus tracks available. If you are a Who fan, you must have this CD. Also, considering this was the last Who effort with Keith Moon (he passed after this was released) you can see the definite changes the band has gone through since \\"Tommy\\". I always wonder how the band would have been if Keith had lived on. But this is a wise choice to have (along with Who's Next and Live At Leeds), and do recommend it to all.

B00140PK6O|4.0|I am a fan of Elizabeth Gaskell whose books are of wider variety than an author like Jane Austen.  While North and South is my favorite of her books and her adaptations, this one is so different it is hard to compare with anything else and you have to love it as one of a kind.  It is a story about a little world all its own and I really enjoyed this adaptation of 3 stories into one because it was done very well.
1416583408|3.0|I'm a dog lover and I selected this book after reading some reviews and thumbing through it. However, I put it down without finishing it.  I just did not find it compelling enough to continue.  There were a few good nuggets but that was not enough to maintain my interest. For those who want a better understanding of their dog, \\"Cesar's Way,\\" and \\"Merle's Door\\" are recommended.
0385334206|5.0|Reading this book was somewhat terrifying because someone finally saw the surreal nature of American society the way I do.  I think this is one of the saddest, and somehow funniest, books ever.  I can't believe it was published in 1973: it is still so relevant.  The most incredible part of it is to hear things we've accepted about our society as part of life mirrored back at us so that we can feel their full absurdity.  One section that will always stay with me was when Vonnegut talks about African American history in a matter of fact way (I'm paraphrasing here): \\"They were slaves, but then they were emancipated.  They were not given land.  They were free to go exploring.\\"  The fact that that was what what really happened in our universe is so overwhelming that Vonnegut writes as if speaking to first time observers of earth: okay, this is the way earthlings decided to deal with a massive injustice?  Anyway read the book.  I don't think I've ever seen such great insight into our national pathologies.
1439190275|5.0|I'm 60, and have a lifetime of digestive woes behind me.  I got to a point where I thought virtually NO food out there would agree with me.  I was slim until my second child at 36, and carried an excess 20-30 lbs. after that.  I was unsuccessful with every diet I tried.  In 2003 I tried Atkins for the very first time.  It was effortless, the weight dropped off quite easily, and best of all, I felt physically better than I had ever felt in my entire life.  My digestive issues disappeared, headaches disappeared, I felt fantastic.  How could that be?<br /><br />A few years later I learned I have celiac disease, meaning my time on Atkins without gluten benefitted me enormously.  In the years since 2003 I've learned a lot about my body and what works to fuel it.  I am highly carb sensitive, and in addition to not being able to eat gluten, I also do not do well with any other grains, starches, and I have to limit even fruit since I just can't handle much sugar.  At my current age it is hard to lose weight, but I've been back on a basic Atkins diet since March 1 and have slowly but surely dropped about 15 pounds and a lot of fat in the middle.  I feel wonderful, my blood pressure is down, and I expect my cholesterol to also go down.  I am frankly tired of reading all the other competing nutritionists and diet gurus dissing Atkins and I'm fed up with people who don't understand the diet making erroneous assumptions about it and how it works.  If I ate the way these people prescribe, I'd be sick and I'd feel horrible all the time.  If Atkins is so bad, I'd like these naysayers to explain why I feel so wonderful eating that way!  The proof is in the pudding, as they say.  While Atkins may not work for everyone, it sure works for me on every single level.  I'm committed to eating along the lines of Atkins as a way of life, not as a quick fix diet.  Atkins is allowing my body to stabilize and return to its natural state, and Atkins has completely solved all my lifetime digestive issues.<br /><br />I've enjoyed all the Atkins books over the years.  My favorite is the friendly, chatty, very personal and anecdotal 1972 version, but they are all a bit different and offer different bits of information along the way.  I found this new version to be quite good and it incorporates much of the newest information to back up the claims.  It's valuable to understand the principles behind how this type of diet works and why it works so well, and this edition is informative and very readable.  If you have had a very carb heavy diet prior to going into Atkins, there is a period of adjustment where your body reacts to the withdrawal of carbs and switches over to a fat burning type of metabolism.  If you know this going into it, be ready to put up with possible headaches and feeling tired for a few days, but your reward will soon come.  After the first week, I have never again experienced any fatigue.  I have plenty of energy for sports (I ski 50+ times each winter, I mountain bike, I do strenuous weight and cardio workouts 4-5 times a week, and so on).  The only time I feel bad is if I eat something not recommended by Atkins.  I have learned how my body reacts to such foods, and I don't like it.  I much prefer how I feel on Atkins to how I feel eating a different way.<br /><br />My advice to anyone is this:  Buy the book, read it front to back, and give it an honest trial for 2 weeks.  The proof will be in how you feel.  The weight loss you'll observe is a bonus.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/19/11.  I'm still following Atkins, and at this point I have lost about 25 pounds from my start in 3/10.  I have lost 11% fat, going from 40% to 29%.  Physically I look entirely different.  I look slim and SMALL, and it still amazes me to see this in a mirror.  I'm still a few pounds and maybe 5% fat loss from my goal, and need to lose around 10 more pounds.  But the important thing is that over the last 16 months I have completely altered my relationship to food, and have adjusted to eating this way for life.  This is absolutely key to success:  you cannot go back to old eating habits.  But for me, I had to realize I could not lose weight as fast as I wanted, and I could not allow myself to be discouraged by that.  My loss has been in fits and starts:  If  I was pretty strict with the diet, I'd lose.  When I loosened up a bit I'd maintain, but that was useful because this incremental rate of loss allowed me to establish increasingly lower \\"set points\\" for weight.  I have had lifelong issues with high blood pressure and high-ish cholesterol.  My BP is quite normal now, and while my BP is still around 250 or so, a closer analysis reveals that my HDL is extremely high (part of the reason my total has not gone down), and my LDL particles are off the chart fluffy in nature, which is also good.  So I'm no longer worried about either of these measurements.  I take no meds, have zero digestive issues any more, zero heartburn, I have tons of energy to ski, bike, exercise.  Running on a relatively carb-less metabolism suits me perfectly and I'll never go back.  NEW BOOK REC:  Two of the authors of this book have just published a new one:  The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living:  An Expert Guide to Making the Life Saving Benefits of Carbohydrate Restriction Sustainable and Enjoyable.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|If you're going to buy this Blu-Ray, make sure you buy the one narrated by David Attenborough and NOT the one narrated by Oprah Winfrey.  I'm sorry, but anyone who's being honest will agree that Oprah Winfrey narrating a scientific program is distracting to the point of annoyance.  Choosing the right narrator is of utmost importance for an educational series about science, and I'm sorry but her voice does not have an authoritative quality for scientific programming.  Let's face it, Oprah is known for her daytime talk show so her voice naturally will make the listener think of that.  Just a horrendous choice to narrate this wonderful series.  What's next?  A series on Earth's geology narrated by Jerry Springer?  An anthology of cosmology and astrophysics narrated by Stone Cold Steve Austin?  Or perhaps a documentary on biological evolution narrated by Vince Shlomi the ShamWow guy?  Let's face it: David Attenborough IS educational nature programming.

It is in Spanish with English subtitles, but the subtitles are short and easily read, colored yellow, shows up better than white print.    Penelope Cruz is very good in this movie, she is beautiful and an actress to boot.  The plot is intriguing and different.  It is great to see a movie that has explored something new, plot-wise.  I don't want to reveal the plot, there are twists...!    I enjoyed it very much and am now buying it for my daughters.  (I think it will appeal more to women, but my husband said he enjoyed it too!)

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Considering the ample number of shows on television, it pains me to see such a great show get canceled after only one season when so many shows go on season after season with a sub-par storyline and awful acting.    Firefly was an amazing show with an original and well thought out storyline and a wonderful sci-fi universe. The acting was great and it was created so that we would eventually get to know each character bit by bit. I felt incredibly slighted whenever the show ended because there was so much room for character development and background to come out and they hardly scratched the surface of what they had planned.     All in all, I highly recommend you buy and watch this amazing TV show!

B001HN694K|4.0|This is a magical movie regardless of your age. Tim Burton is amazing, and yes, I agree, that this movie could have been \\"darker\\" in how it portrayed some of the characters (afterall, this is Tim Burton!) but I think it still works in it's own way. I like that it had a real storyline, there was a sense of start and end. I like that at the end we are not completely sure if she really experienced those adventures or if it was all really a dream. The conflicts she had in Wonderland were parallel to conflicts she was having \\"up above\\" (everyone telling her what to do, the personal battle of herself with those around her, should she get married or not?, the loss of her father....etc) which is often what occurs in dreams. There is definitely a feel of the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" in that it is about entering another world through some kind of strange portal, a child having to lead a battle between good and evil and hence saving the world and all creatures in it and the dreamlike quality of the whole adventure. But the visuals were great and overall it was worth watching. And who could resist a good Futterwack?!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|I loved the Daria series when it was on MTV in the 90s and like many I have waited a long time for this release. And I'm happy that they decided to create one box set with everything rather than waste our time and money by slowly releasing season box sets, with the risk, as has been the case with other series (ahem, Fox where are the rest of the King of the Hills???), of the production stopping half way if sales aren't up to par.     The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is not because they couldn't include the original music...which all of us die hard fans who have been begging for years for this release already knew. I'm not even upset at the letter that was included, which I personally think was somewhat of a nice gester because it lets us know that they are well aware of our concerns and desires and the factor that they gave it a Dariaesq tone I found kind of cute. What upset me is some of the music they put in to replace the original ones. Most of them still go with the flow of the episodes so you don't entirely notice the change (I actually found myself struggling to remember what the original songs were in some cases). But there are some that are so disruptive that it's downright annoying. Like the dream sequence in \\"Ill\\"...the beat of the original song was similar to the one they replaced it with except for one major difference...the original song was softer!! The song they used to replace it was so harsh and annoying that I found myself fast forwarding through the scene so i wouldn't have to hear it. And there is a scene in another episode where the music is so loud you can't hear the characters talking, clearly showing that the music was dubbed over. And, as another reviewer pointed out, I'm a little disappointed that they didn't include an episode list. Sure many people don't look at it but some of us do, especially in series where the titles are so unique as is the case in Daria. And finally, I'm disappointed that they still included the movies with the cut scenes (they're minor, but if you saw the original on TV you notice them, and it took away some funny jokes).     We can't expect perfection and all of us fans are very grateful for this release. All I'm saying is that this box set is good, but it still needs improvement.     And note to the reviewer who says the packaging comes apart every time they open it...send it back as defective and get a replacement because mine doesn't do that. I did it with a Gilmore Girls box set years ago about a year or two after I bought it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity was an amazing movie. I love the show Firefly, therefore the movie continuation filled my need for more. My one complaint is that I don't think the River storyline matched up with what they had said so far in the show. I'm sure it was simply to make the movie work, but it did take away a little.
B003BKF696|5.0|The National is a band that I know critics love but I hadn't really heard much of before I decided to buy their new album. It turned out to be worth the risk, as I enjoyed almost everything about it. Since I'm godawful at describing music, it's hard to say what makes them different from a lot of other current bands, but there's just something so mature and well-formed about their sound that it seems like they could make any idea listenable. There's no guitar solos or freakouts or anything distracting from the quality of the song writing, yet it still seems like they're reaching all of their potential every time.    I think the band's strongest asset is their singer. Sometimes the guy saying all the words is someone I merely appreciate or even just tolerate, but Matt Berninger's almost impossibly pleasing baritone seems key to their sound and keeps the whole thing together. Not much about the instrumentation really sticks out, but both pairs of brothers play more than competently and work well together. The album kicks off with \\"Terrible Love\\", a surprisingly affecting song that sets the tone for the whole album, and is followed by a bunch of great songs. Some standouts are \\"Anyone's Ghost\\", \\"Afraid of Everyone\\", the single \\"Bloodbuzz Ohio\\", and the curious but memorable \\"Conversation 16\\". Actually, those aren't necessarily the best songs, just the ones with the most easily remembered hooks because I am shallow. Really, every song is good. I haven't gotten very much new music this year, but what I have has been well chosen.
0307271862|4.0|As I read this Mankell mystery, I was reminded of his earlier WHITE LIONESS in his Kurt Wallander series, which also takes place on different continents.  I enjoyed being in Sweden, China, western United States, Africa, and London as I journeyed in my imagination with the characters.  The themes of globalization, human vengeance, and greed leaped off the pages.  At times connections between the plots and subplots and the motivations of the characters needed greater clarification.  Overall, however, this was a delightful book.  Deep down I cherish the dream that Mankell would revive his Kurt Wallander series which was/is so popular and dealt with many of the themes he now develops in independent mysteries/novels such as THE MAN FROM BEIJING.
B001HN694K|3.0|OK, I know I'm going to upset a lot of people, but here is MY review of this movie:    I've seen CGI that was so real, so lifelike - regardless of the subject matter, that you could NOT help but believe what you were seeing on screen.  My problem comes to this; with all of the money and talent that Disney commands, why is the CGI so obvious and UN-believable?  Please don't tell me that if I saw it in 3-D it would be better.  I didn't.  I also didn't see the other examples of BELIEVABLE CGI in 3-D.  So the playing ground is level.  The story is fabulous, even this 'generation' of the story is fabulous.  Lewis Carroll was a genius.  The overall movie is quite good, and you can even make yourself overlook the piss-poor CGI and enjoy the movie.  But I wonder just how phenomenal the movie would have been if the CGI had been top-rate instead of second-rate.  As it stands, this is a good, entertaining movie.  However, it could have been a breathtakingly outstanding movie.  I also wonder about the wardrobe for the movie.  Granted, 'Alice' looked nice in her gown - but the time period would not have allowed a \\"20 year old\\" to be in a YOUNG juvenile dress - showing her lower legs (over the age of 12, this did not happen at this point in history), and bare arms OUTSIDE in the daytime just was NOT done! Why were 'Alice' and her sister the only ones to flout tradition and style by baring their arms during the day - outside, where they just might get SUN on their skin?  You might as well have put her in a spandex dance outfit, for all the historical accuracy - and YES, this does contribute to the believability, the 'feeling' of actually being there - in a movie.    Sorry Disney - you really flubbed this one, and I can't recommend it to anyone other than children.  And, it wasn't made for children, now was it?

In the \\"Trying it Out\\" section in Chapter Four: Drawing (Beautiful) Women (p.74-77) the author gives an example design for some manga style pop idols which he claims he did research for.  What he comes up with is a trio of hideous, flat girl characters that look like they came from someone with very little artistic training, like out of one of those terrible \\"how to draw manga\\" books that the market was flooded with around ten to fifteen years ago.  When I first read this section, I was so shocked that I didn't believe Bancroft had drawn them until I reread the entire chapter just to be sure it wasn't someone else's work.  I'm not picking on him because the manga style isn't my thing, but because there are plenty of great examples out there that actually fit with his instruction.  In the \\"Style\\" section in Chapter Nine: Putting It All Together (p.154-157) his apparent distaste for practicing styles that aren't really his thing is even more apparent.  The anatomy of the Comic Book example is extremely poor, has very little depth overall and it is right next to the Feature Animation example that turns in space very well, so even if these two pages were all you saw of the book, we know he should be able to do better.  His text in the Video Game category shows how out of touch he must be with what he calls the \\"core market\\" for video games if we take his example to show what he thought would be a good fit.  Remember, this book was published in 2006.  Information on what styles work well and what falls flat in the video game industry have been readily available for some time.  And I've already touched on his lack of control control over the Manga style.    I am sure that some people who read this review might feel the need to defend Bancroft's few poor examples, which is fine.  But please take into account that this is a howto book, with very good and detailed instructions on how to best avoid crappy design.  I can't speak for everyone, but I don't feel right rating this book more than average because the author doesn't put his own advice to use through the entire book.  This is not an unrealistic expectation.    Another point that I can't say I am too happy with is his encouragement to stick to generic stereotypes when creating characters, but this is a minor and personal preference.  Sticking to what people are familiar with is a great way to capture the average person without having to work too hard at it, and is good advice to follow if time is short.  After all, there is no real need to \\"create\\" a character's personality if it's already built in to the mind of the audience long before you drew anything.    All that said, don't let my review put you off too much. This is still one of the better \\"how to cartoon\\" books out there.  If you are a beginner, or even if you have already gone through formal training in animation (or whatever) and need a refresher, it is quite useful.  It puts a lot of focus on motion, which many how to books lack.

B00000JGHL|3.0|This is a film that left-brained folks who can follow complicated plots will probably like better than right-brained people like me who are more interested in who falls in love with whom.    The main love connection  here is between Al Pacino as Pappas, the first Greek mayor of New York, and John Cusak as Calhoun, his young apprentice, transplanted from Louisiana.  The admiration that the young man has for the older one and his ultimate disillusionment is a good story.  Unfortunately there are too many characters doing too many undercover things and I lost track which diminished my interest in the film. They should have provided a roster of characters.    Bridget Fonda appears briefly as another idealistic young person and for a while there seems to be a possibility of something more than camaraderie between her and the Cusak character, but that story line was sort of dropped until the rather silly ending.     Overall the acting was first rate.  Pacino was magnificent.  Others have called his Harlem \\"sermon\\" over-the-top but I thought it was the best thing in the film.  (reminded me of Bill Clinton)   Cusak is quite good too, but when he's on the screen with Pacino, all eyes are with the old guy; he is amazingly entertaining.  All of the supporting characters are well played with the possible exception of Fonda whose presence was lack-luster.      If I could, I've give the film three and a half stars.  Great cast but you'll forget it ten minutes after the closing credits. Don't we already know that many politicians are corrupt?
1416550550|4.0|There were many elements of The Forgotten Garden that make me thrilled that I read it, despite the slow start. This book is a massive 500 plus pages,  and the first 100 were tough to get through. Yet, after the story really started to take shape, and became much more of a mystery, I loved it and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The first that really grabbed me was the writing itself. It is wonderful. Kate Morton threw me some serious revelations in the midst of one crazy adventure that forced me to slow down my usual reading pace, pause, and digest what I had just read. For example, she begins her 38th chapter by telling us that, \\"finally it seemed autumn had realized it was September.\\" Isn't that line beautiful? Every fall there is a day when the weather suddenly shifts. I notice this day, but I cannot describe. Kate Morton summed up a whole day for me in nine words. Fortunately, she includes these gems sporadically or I don't think I would have been able to take the beauty overload.<br /><br />Another reason why I liked The Forgotten Garden was the actual set-up of the book. Several different women  narrate the book, and the mystery that Cassandra has to solve is always just enough out of reach that I wanted to keep reading. As I said, the pace of the novel lost me in the beginning, but after 100 pages I was hooked.<br /><br />There was, however, one small area of the novel that troubled me. Early on  in the novel, we learn that Nell (Cassandra's grandmother) is adopted. When Nell discovers the truth about her past, her whole life is ruined (or she ruins it). She is haunted by her biological parents: wondering who they were and why they abandoned her, and I could easily see why this would be incredibly upsetting. What I could not understand was the reason why Nell allowed  her past to negate the wonderful adoptive family that she had.<br /><br />Now I should disclose that I am an adoptive parent, so I think this element of the novel touched me more than it would the average reader. But I found it really difficult to take that as soon as Nell decides to find her \\"parents\\" she stops doting on her younger sisters, ends her engagement, and loses touch with her adoring father. Luckily this point was reiterated by one of the characters late in the book when he says that Nell was lucky to \\"not know her past...It's a gift,\\" he continues, \\"to be able to look forward and not back\\".<br /><br />Now this is not how I view adoption-as a way to forget about your past-but I also do not view adoption as a negative sentence on your life. Adoption is about loss, on some level, but I hope my daughter has gained something too. Nell never saw the gifts that she gained from both of her families: the family in front of her and her biological family. And I must admit that I hope my daughter (who has always known she was adopted) will feel fulfilled by all the parents in her life who love her and not just the ones with the same DNA.<br /><br />My adoption tirade aside,  I really did enjoy The Forgotten Garden and all the characters I met there. This novel is now in paperback, and I highly recommend it.it really difficult to take that as soon as Nell decides to find her \\"parents\\" she stops doting on her younger sisters, ends her engagement, and loses touch with her adoring father.

030726999X|5.0|I was very irritated by the \\"ending\\" of the second book in this trilogy. Too many loose ends. I couldn't wait to read this one. It tied up all the ends. I enjoyed every minute of this story. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be entertained. It will keep you up all night if you aren't careful. You will be thinking about the plot constantly. It is a bit predictable but has some unexpected twists.
0446563048|5.0|All I could think about was getting home to lounge on my brand new hammock - which is by far the best purchase I have ever made - even better than my MacBook - I know I am sorry Steve Jobs, but my MacBook can't hold me like a hammock can.  When I suddenly loose this wonderful contentedness I was experiencing and start heading down the path of this would be better if...If I had a stereo system, someone to bring me mimosas, someone to refill my mimosas so that they never ran out, a nice looking man serving me mimosas, a book to read...a book to read.    So, all I could think about was that I needed a book - it was more realistic then my other daydreams...So I was a block from home, and there are no book stores on my beautiful street, because now they all seem to be in strip malls and shopping malls. And I blame that on Amazon, so I started cursing Amazon in my head, cause all I wanted was a book to read, but there are no independent bookstores near me, because too many people completely define value by a low price.  Really?  Do you all understand what these low prices cost us?  Hmm, but there is a liquor store...    So, I am thinking about how I hate Amazon, when I run into my UPS driver, who I had almost missed completely.  And he hands me a package - a free advance copy of Tony Hsieh's (CEO of Zappo's which was acquired by Amazon) new book - Delivering Happiness:  A Path to Profits, Passion and Purpose. Alright God, I get it Amazon is not evil - they just made by day and Tony you delivered happiness to me.    I read the entire book in one long period on the hammock, yes I read fast, thats why I had no books at home.  And it was one of those books that I swear Tony, you had written just for me, and I hope that you can forgive me for hating on Amazon.   Cause I see that you have done some amazing things with Zappos and I can only hope that Pure Habitat will be able to deliver happiness to millions of people, as well as have the most amazing work culture.  Which, hey its just me right now and I have a lot of fun.    But, Tony if you did write Delivering Happiness for me.  Thank you.  It is one of the books that I will say inspired me when people ask why Pure Habitat is so wildly successful.  And if you ever are looking to be involved in another internet company that will change the world, I wouldn't mind a little help.    HIghly recommend Delivering Happiness.  I also suggest a hammock and a mimosa.  or two.
B00138J2MA|5.0|Trite as it might sound, I simply can't fathom why anyone would rate Lovers Rock as only worthy of one or two stars. Simply put, its best cuts showcase Sade's best lyrics and tightest grooves.  Here are my favorites:<br /><br />By Your Side- The lead single from the album, it possesses a beguiling, introspective quality.  It isn't an easy-listening gem like Smooth Operator or Sweetest Taboo; nor does it command your attention like No Ordinary Love or Cherish the Day.  Rather, it's a heartfelt affirmation of unconditional love.<br /><br />Flow- This one blows me away.  A stone-cold groove with tribal elements, and deeply felt emotions.  Music critics noted the use of more acoustic, percussive elements on this album upon its release, and Flow is one of the best expressions of Sade's artistic growth.<br /><br />King Of Sorrow-  Bleak lyrics, wrapped in an agreeable melody.<br /><br />Somebody Already Broke My Heart- Gives me chills; absolutely incredible.  This one sweeps you up in a hypnotic, percolating vibe One of those songs that truly qualifies as a neglected masterpiece.<br /><br />Lovers Rock- The title track washes over you, like waves over a rocky beach.  Enthralling, brilliant statement.
B0002YJ29O|5.0|The description of the DVD/program is already said and the artists introduced, so I'll just say that this DVD rocks!<br />Each performance is top rate, as you have top rate artists, and their joy and excitement is simply infectious.  These artists make you really really really want to learn how to make music.  How wonderful music is!  The artists are from all over the world.  Leaving behind all the differences they might have, they put their souls and artistry together and become one huge inspiring fire ball.  It is absolutely enchanting.  The Happy B-day variations are a real treat. Sarah Chang's beautiful huge ear-to-ear smiles were contageous and music by itself; they will snap you out of depression.  If you're depressed, go get a copy of this DVD. It is much more effective than going to a doctor or taking anti-depressant.<br /><br />The 8 pianos are amazing as well.  Of course, there are moments that they aren't quite in perfect sync, but their sheer joy overrides those moments, and you become their captive.  It is simply fun to watch/listen.  Also, you will see how differently each pianist plays.  It is a very good study for young pianists, as these pianists are all top-rated artists.  I watched it over and over again, especially right before my students' recital.  In fact, I am planning on giving it to one of my students for her B-day that's coming up this summer.<br /><br />Behind all this fun and smiles, you never know what kind of hard life these artists had to endure when they were growing up learning and competing, to get to this level.  They deserve all the fun in the world!  And really, music is for us to enjoy and appreciate.<br /><br />My only complaint is the \\"behind the scene\\" section.  I think it was Lavine who was talking when the interview ends abruptly sort of, and the \\"behind the scene\\" ends without a solid conclusion.  You sort of feel an \\"unfinished\\" kind of dissatisfaction there. But I still appreciate their effort to have this section filmed.<br /><br />I recommend this DVD for anybody who loves music, especially for students who are under pressure and beginning to feel that they want to \\"quit\\".  Don't quit!!!  Just watch this DVD.  You will regain strength to keep going.or anybody who loves music, especially for students who are under pressure and beginning to feel that they want to \\"quit\\".  Don't quit!!!

0374531269|4.0|A Long Way Gone is by Ishmael Beah is a bit different than the normal books I review.  Generally, I review theology or pop-Christian books.  However, a friend asked me to read the book so I did.  I am moved by the plight of child soldiers, so I decided to review it.<br /><br />First, let me discuss the strong points of this book.  Beah tells his story of losing his family, fleeing from rebels, being converted into a brutal soldier for the army, and finally his return to a normal life.  He tells this story with clarity, which makes it easy to understand and, at times, cringe at the horrors of the war in Sierra Leone.  It is very impressive the way he shows the contrast between the humanitarian \\"civilian\\" workers and the boy soldiers.  This contrast highlights the demoralizing effect such brutality has on a child.  Further, the book has brought the plight of child soldiers into the limelight.  Certainly Sierra Leone is not the first nor last place where children have been placed on battlefields, but Beah has used his story to draw the world's attention to this urgent problem.<br /><br />Now, let me discuss the weakness of the book.  Beah does an excellent job portraying his thoughts and emotions throughout his fleeing the rebels and on to his brutal adventures with the army.  When the memoir reaches his living in the rehab center, it begins to gloss over details that are important.  I was left wondering many questions like how the children overcame the effects of the drugs they had been given.  How did Beah become the polished spokesperson that was sent to the UN?  How did UNICEF convince the army officers to give up their young soldiers? The absence of these details leads me to believe that the purpose of this book was simply to highlight the problem of child soldiers.  This is a noble goal and Beah accomplishes it well.<br /><br />Much has been made of suspicion raised by The Austrailian's investigation of Beah's account.  Beah has adamantly defended his memoirs, and to his credit, brings witnesses to bear.  It is important to remember a couple of things in dealing with this controversy:  1) War is never so cut and dry as to claim that rebels were not in a certain village.  Much of Beah's accounts describe roving death squads more than they do actual military campaigns.  2)  The horrors described and the problem highlighted are very, very real.  Believing Beah's account loses nothing.  Dismissing these memoirs may cost many children the help they need.  This book is important in resolving an urgent problem.<br /><br />Beah highlights a problem that exists all over the world.  Children unwilling made to fight in wars they do not even understand.  They are turned into brutal killers and often sent on missions that adult soldiers would not dare attempt.  This should haunt the reader of A Long Way Gone:  The problem is real, the solution is possible, but the need persists.witnesses to bear.

B00005JKN9|1.0|Historical accuracy is not the strong suit of this movie. I understand the need for dramatic license to drive a compelling story but what aggravated me about this film is that it dishonors the memory of the overwhelming majority of 19th century New Yorkers, both natives and immigrants, who worked their behinds off in legitimate trades and professions. In reality this city was built by extremely hard working people that lived decent lives grounded in faith. They don't exist in this film. Of course plenty of crime & corruption existed but the vast majority of people struggled honestly to improve their lot. Faith was a crucial component of the difficult lives of most and yet we get the obligatory Hollywood gratuitous slander. Throw the Bible in the river. Tell the the pastor when he mentions the church service to \\"go to hell\\".

1400052173|5.0|Science journalist Rebecca Skloot unravels the story behind the first immortal human cells, known by the code name HeLa. Skloot's fascination with these cells began as a teen in a biology class when her professor mentioned that what scientists know about cancer cells came from studying the cells of a woman named Henrietta Lacks. He went on to state that Henrietta died from an aggressive form of cervical cancer in 1951. Without Henrietta's knowledge or consent, samples of her tumor were cultured. Although scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in order to study them, they had had no luck --- but Henrietta's cancer cells not only lived, they reproduced rapidly. HeLa cells continued to reproduce, dividing constantly and indefinitely; hence, they are \\"immortal.\\"    Henrietta's cells are still reproducing. They are bought and sold to labs all over the world by the billions. It is said that if one were to weigh all of Henrietta's cells that have been grown since she died, the total would be a staggering 50 million metric tons. These immortal cells have been one of the most important innovations for modern science and medicine because scientists can study the effects of experiments they cannot perform on living people. HeLa cells were on board during the first space mission so scientists could study what happens to human cells in space. Because of HeLa cells, scientists know the effects an atom bomb has on human tissue. Henrietta's cells were also instrumental in developing the vaccine for polio. They have been the cells used in studies for in vitro fertilization, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, and much, much more.    Skloot's teacher off-handedly mentioned that Henrietta was African-American. But Skloot's questioning about her personal life met a dead end, and the consequent researching revealed nothing about her. She became obsessed with Henrietta, and her fascination turned into a passion that she pursued for 10 years in order to write this book.One of Skloot's driving questions was about Henrietta's family: Did she have children? Did they know about their mother's cells and their contribution to science? She not only learns the answers to these questions, she also forms a relationship with Henrietta's daughter, Deborah. Along the way, we learn about Henrietta's life. As part of a poor tobacco farm family, young Henrietta lived with her grandfather after her parents died. She and the rest of the family worked the same tobacco fields that their ancestors worked as slaves. After marrying her cousin, David, Henrietta's life continued to be difficult. She had her first child when she was barely 14. The second child she bore had developmental challenges and was reluctantly institutionalized. Despite her hard life, the people who knew Henrietta remembered her as beautiful, outgoing and hospitable.    As Skloot skillfully weaves together the stories of Henrietta, the evolution of her immortal cells and the reactions of her family members, readers will find themselves entranced. Exploring the topic of scientific exploitation --- in which her cells have been used and sold without family knowledge or consent --- leads to a description of the historical use of African-American research subjects and to a discussion of the policies and ethics governing the use of patients' tissues. During the course of the book, we travel with the writer to Henrietta's unmarked grave, to scientific laboratories, and to a church service. We are present during a touching scene in which two of Henrietta's children examine HeLa cells.    Interspersing these human elements with scientific explanations, Skloot has fashioned a compelling multi-layered tale that will keep readers unable to resist turning pages until they reach the end.

0553573411|2.0|I rarely say a book I am getting enjoyment out of should be shorter, but that is most certainly the case with this one.     The first thing that should have been left out is about 60 pages of self loathing and uncertainty. In this book, the main character is hardly an assassin, which makes the title misleading in the extreme. He is more of a professional whiner, which begins to grate on you.    But other people have mentioned that in their reviews, the one thing I haven't seen voiced is that the other 40 or so pages that could have been left out were the love story. Molly, the love interest of the main character, has no redeeming qualities at all. She is the least appealing love interest I have ever come across. She is paranoid, rude, surly, illogical and totally unreasonable. It's not a crime to write an unappealing love interest, but it seems evident that we are supposed to feel bad for Fitz when he loses the girl. I just felt relief.
0815411839|1.0|Don't believe everything that Spoto writes. Instead, most definitely read anything by Robert Slatzer, also \\"The Marilyn Conspiracy\\" by Milo Speriglio {I think it is out of print so do look in Amazon,Alibris or Ebay for used copies}. Also, \\"Crypt 33\\" is a very compelling book, one of the best aside from the authors I have just mentioned. Slatzer was an INSIDER. Unlike Spoto, who was NOT an insider.  There will forever be people who just want a cover-up. The Kennedy's did not have to be right there, leaning right over Marilyn when she died in order to have been involved in her death. Although Robert Kennedy was around, way too close to the time of her death and just read the books I have mentioned. Marilyn had been romantically and sexually invloved with both Kennedy's and when she got dumped by first JFK and then Robert, she was pretty angry. Marilyn was going to do a press conference and \\"spill the beans\\" about her involvement with the Kennedys and the day before the press conference she was dead. What does that tell you ?  Marilyn had also been keeping a diary about her talks with both Kennedy brothers. Imagine how dangerous that had to have been.<br />If you read Slatzer and Speriglio's books, you will find out that Marilyn's house was wired and bugged like nobody's business. Between what she knew about the Kennedy's, and the mafia's interest in what was going on,  only an idiot would say she killed herself.  What people with their head in the sand don't know is, murders like this happen a lot more than you'd be comfortable knowing about. Spoto is known for writing slanted books, and is probably quite close to the Kennedy family and partial to wanting to help them distance themselves from Msrilyn.<br />Read widely, do not grab a book like this and assume you know the final word.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|Okay....here I go.... Absolutly wonderful film when I saw it for the first time in the theatre! Incredibly amazed and stunned by the first DVD release!<br /><br />Now this Blu-Ray version - all I can say is FANTASTICALLY-MAGICAL-EYE-OPENING-STUNNING etc.! The clarity. The depth. The colors. Wow! And it just seems to be even more heart-warming, charming and even funnier too! How is that possible? The picture and sound quality I think are literally BETTER than it's original theatrical release - if that is possible! They have to be - simply because of the changing technologies!<br /><br />You all should know by now that Toy Story is a 'buddy picture'. And without giving any spoilers -- its one of the best - ever made! You forget that is is a computer animated movie.  Tom hanks and Tim Allen are amazing together. So let me focus on the bonuses.<br /><br />Beside the original stuff and the DVD that is included in this set - the extra extra extra bonuses on the Blu-Ray are really amazing. Retrospectives, more deleted scenes, art work, promotional stuff, marketing stuff, interviews, behind the scenes, the cast, the production, the memories, the fun! You get the idea?<br /><br />It's all worth the price youpay for it. Disney's concept of including the DVD with the Blu-Ray version is genius. Why? Well you can take the DVD anywhere. Your Portable players, your car, school, work.....and the Blu-Ray is the premiere version of a now classic story. I am sure you will watch it more than once - especially this version!<br /><br />If you haven't bought any version of Toy Story - this is the ONE to get! If you already have it - sell the old one here on Amazon and get this one to replace it! You won't regret it.<br /><br />This is one of Pixar's best films ever - it relies on story and characters as the most important thing. For the price - you actually do get a lot more bang for your buck! 6-8-10

The way a few of the reviews here sound though, it's almost as though a great many people have forgotten what \\"entertainment\\" actually is.  -If- your primary concern with buying a DVD is simply extra features and \\"fluff\\", then no...that's not in this release and you can clearly read about that in others reviews.  If your only entertainment concern is having the best, latest, greatest technology such as a 3D television...well...that's not here either.  However if you're simply looking for a truly -great- movie with captivating characters, wonderful visual effects and a really strong environmental message to boot, then please read on...    Ok...unlike a others here, again I had never seen this movie in the theaters.  In fact, I hadn't even heard of it until the McD's kid's meals started featuring the toys!  Even as I stood there inserting the DVD in to the player, I didn't even know that Sigourney Weaver was in it (which was a very pleasant surprise)...that's how little I knew about this flick before hand!  I honestly wasn't sure what to expect.  That said, last night made the -3rd time- I've watched this movie in just over 1 week.  This is simply a truly outstanding flick, hands down!  I'll try not to spoil too much of the actual plot for you but essentially this is a Sci-Fi flick that is a combination of live action and some excellent CGI. In a rather small nut shell, the time frame is \\"some time in the distant future\\" where humans have started to explore space and colonize other planets.  In this case, a base has been set up on a very distant planet (actually in the early sequences, it looks more like a moon in orbit around a large, Jupiter like gas giant) known as \\"Pandora\\" which was intended to apparently be some kind of mining operation.  It seems as though some large Earth corporation is interested in a rare metal which can be found in abundance on this planet called \\"Unobtainium\\" (and if you think that's cheesy, look it up on Wikipedia!).  The problem is the planet has an indigenous species known as the Na'vi...a 10 foot tall race of blue humanoids who at first appear to be quite primitive.  They live in the trees, they hunt with bows and knives, etc., etc..  What we come to learn is that these people, while they are a tribal like culture, have a strong connection to the planet and all the living things that grow there and they understand the inter-connectivity of all living things on Pandora.  Needless to say the Na'vi want to protect their home.  The Na'vi are not totally dis-similar to tribal people who have actually lived on this planet...people who have been virtually decimated by modernization and so-called progress and the ideology of Western culture.  Imagine the native Americans of this planet before the arrival of the white man...that's the Na'vi, only they're blue and -really- tall.  Pandora is...much as early America was I'm sure...not the most hospitable place at times.   Imagine how a person who had never heard of, let alone seen, lions or rhinos or cheetahs or hyenas would react on their first visit to the Africa Savanna.  The creatures of Pandora are certainly \\"alien\\" but the idea is the same...most of the wildlife on Pandora isn't exactly \\"friendly\\".        In an attempt to \\"make nice with the locals\\", the humans have bio-engineered these \\"Avatars\\"...living beings created from a combination of human and Na'vi DNA.  Humans are put in to these high tech chambers (not dis-similar to a CAT scan or MRI machine) and \\"go to sleep\\" and when they wake up, they are in their Avatar bodies.  The humans who do this of course are all scientists and such who are trying to understand the people of Pandora, although the ultimate goal of the program is supposedly to negotiate with them in order to get them to relocate so the humans can get the Unobtainium.  That is of course until our main character, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) shows up.  Jake's an x-marine who lost the use of his legs (apparently in combat).  Jake was selected for the program because his twin brother who was a scientist was murdered...since Jake was his identical twin with the same DNA, the powers that be decided to offer him the chance to be part of this program instead.  Of course, Jake has no training and very little understanding of Pandora beyond the legends he's heard on Earth, let alone the Na'vi...or little else really.  He's your basic \\"jar head\\", except that he's confined to a wheel chair.  Because he is a \\"warrior\\" however, the Na'vi people accept him...at least more easily than the scientists who have gone before him.  I won't go much more in to it than that as if you haven't seen the movie, there's plenty of spoiler info out there.  However...    This movie has a very strong environmental message.  While it's a great action flick with awesome special effects to be sure, the real meat of this flick is the message that it sends out.  In the time period of the movie, humans have basically \\"killed Mother Earth\\", much in the same way we are doing today...and now they are looking to do the same on Pandora, all for the sake of \\"profit\\" (sound disturbingly familiar?).  It addresses that almighty belief that many humans seem to have in that anything and everything is ours to take and destroy as we wish without any thought what so ever to the consequences or how it effects the environment of the creatures (including \\"people\\") who live there.  With the facts and evidence of global warming here on our own planet quickly becoming indisputable, this is a very timely movie with a very potent message...a message that people should listen to and take to heart.    Even without those DVD extras that some people seem to cherish more than quality entertainment, this is a very strong movie with a very strong statement.  The visual effects are simply breath-taking (even without any bloody 3D!), the characters are engaging and often downright captivating, the music/sound track is very lovely to say the least and the CGI is simply stunning...all and all an excellent flick for everyone in the family (ok...there -is- some mild use of bad language...get over it)!  Seriously, if you've already seen this flick in theaters and you're simply more interested in the extras than the flick itself, then as others have suggested, just wait for the special edition release.  If you're easily offended by someone telling you just how greedy, petty and stupid we humans can be, then don't watch the flick at all.  However if you enjoy -good- entertainment with great action, strong visuals and a tremendous message that all of us could learn from, this is a GREAT flick and the DVD is -well worth the cost- even without any extras...this one get's a solid 5 stars in my book!
B00003CXB4|1.0|DVD I received was unbalanced and doesn't work.  Makes a load noise when you put it in the DVD player.  Waste of $25.  Worthless!
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|I hope someone at the top knows to reconstruct the original, uncut, theatrical version of this great movie for the Blu-ray release. Many don't realize that every \\"Masterpiece\\", \\"Legends\\", etc. version of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho we've been getting on home video for the past umpteenth years has been an edited-for-television version of it.     That's when they cut several frames of the shot of Norman's POV of Marion (Janet Leigh) disrobing before her shower and cut what were slightly more and/or longer shots of Norman's bloody hands as he cleans up after Mother...    These are not insignificant edits. Hitchcock made sure those moments were edited to the exact frame he wanted in order to create a specific and devilish response in the audience.     Well, for some reason the 1970s edited-for-television version has been taken as the official version all these years and used for the home video/DVD releases. Truly an unforgivable oversight, unless the original, uncut, theatrical version simply no longer exists. Which would be a shame.    Anyway, I'll keep my fingers crossed.
B0030ZOYJ0|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed this.  I already had the platnium series and was curious about the difference between the two.  Animation improved and battle scenes extended.  This still retains its weird factor, just some of it is removed. This version has fewer eva's fought than in the series. Music in this and the extra's are good, soundtrack is a definate future purchase.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|It's already been said over and over again, don't buy this version of \\"Life\\". Get the BBC version instead. It's just that simple.

B003C1SPX8|5.0|Hi Folks,    this just arrived and while  Amazon.com claims its run  time is  60 minutes its actually 1:30 for the concert  another bit for a couple of  classic TV appearances and another hour for a very cool documentary which is archival quality not something produced recent...so I feel pretty darned happy for my 12 dollar investment indeed!!    Whether I would upgrade to blu-ray is debatable....the picture is  not poor but its  of its age and not  something perhaps benefited  by that format...    Jump  on this one folks!!!
B00009RDG9|3.0|The Hunted is a fine chase picture which delivers what audiences want and what anyone would expect in this particularly story which is straight forward; A former \\"Special Ops\\" Operator Aaron Hallum(Benicio del Toro) goes on a killing spree after suffering from PTSD. The FBI enlists the man who trained Hallum in order to track him down, LT. Bonham Tommy Lee Jones.    As I said, the film delivers in being a chase picture. Hallum is always one step ahead and Jones is none too far behind. What I appreciate about the film is the fine pacing, it dives right on in into the action with everything unfolding. William Friedken, director of some the finest action films in film history such as The French Connection and To Live and Die in LA, is naturally up to snuff when it comes to the car chases and major action sequences. However what keeps this film from perfection ? A lack of originality. There are just too many echoes from films such as Rambo and The Fugitive without the critical psychological aspects. Hallum is a Rambo clone but we don't know why he goes on his blood bath; The film tries to suggest, I think, that he is disgusted by senseless slaughter but that's exactly what he does during the entire film. Also the biggest annoyance of the film by far was why LT. Bonham ignored Hallums pleas for comfort. We even saw the numerous letters Hallum sent being burned by Bonham at the end of the film. Bonham stated he never killed anyone, does he just sever the ties to his students once he was done with them ? Is he even disgusted by what any of them do with the knowledge he teaches them ? We don't know and the film doesn't seem to care.    I would recommend this film simply for the well done chase sequences and terrific knife play but this film could have been a lot more than a plagiarism of better films.
B000002LKU|4.0|Just came across this classic folk/blues/country album on the trail of Mark Knopler's musical career and quickly became a big fan of this one-shot group.  Great musicians and credible voices.  Especially like the cuts \\"Feel Like Going Home\\", \\"That's Where I Belong\\", and \\"Blues Stay Away from Me\\".  The only piece that doesn't completely succeed (in my opinion) is the gospel song \\"Weapon of Prayer\\" that just didn't have a feel of authenticity--maybe the group's laid back approach kept it from being convincing.  Otherwise, this is a wonderful album to sit back and relax with.  A great discovery.
B001AR4K8K|5.0|First of all,you really can't get any better than the actors in this movie. Kiefer Sutherland who was just starting out in the acting world,did a fantastic job in The Lost Boys,and he was by far my favorite character. That could be,because he is just so Sexy and charming. Am I the only one who gets bummed when David dies in the end? No matter how many times I see this movie,I always discover new little things about it. I know it was made in the 80s,but I was born in 93' and this is by far one of my most favorite movies I've ever seen! Both my parents love it,but even they didn't show it to me,I found it all on my own. So glad I did! No one should live their life without seeing the Lost Boys! What a sad life that would be.<br /><br />I can't get enough of this movie and everything it has to offer,comedy,horror and some very sexy vampires. The Lost Boys puts movies like Twilight to absolute SHAME. This movie shows you what vampires are supposed to be,fierce creatures of the night,who have to hunt to survive,trying to take everyone and everything with them,not powder puffs who worry about girlfriends and proms..LAME! Thank you Lost Boys for making my life whole. :-)
B00383ZTXO|5.0|This sounds *slightly* better than the original CD (as far as I can tell). Why even bother to say it was remastered?
B001UV4XWY|3.0|The Box<br />Synopsis:<br />A box is dropped off on a front door step. It has a button. Cameron Diaz and James Marsden stare at it. Cameron Diaz has a weird foot and wears a lady ascot. People have questions about Mars. There is a guy with a bowler hat and a messed up face. He offers a deal, push the button on the box, an unknown person will die and Cameron will be given One Million Dollars! She has 24 hours to decide. So, they go to a weird play and discuss their thoughts. A child is kidnapped. There is a philosophical discussion on \\"knowing\\" people. Do they push the button?? I shouldn't tell you. They decide at 34 minutes in, so there are essentially 80 minutes I can't tell you about lest I ruin the plot. :(<br />Review<br />Don't like succinct random statements? Then you won't like The Box. The film has a dreamy, blurry, sepia feel to it. There are some really bad accents, but sweet mustaches and golf carts! Oh and lest I forget, so very dramatic music with some ominous tones. The sets are more vibrant than the actors are. The most entertaining part of this movie is discussing whether or not you would take the money. We debated a few times if there was anything better to watch on TV as the show is a bit, well, slow. It also slowly gets weirder.<br />My Recommendation<br />If you like pedantic movies with more ominous tones than dialog, this is for you. However, you could either watch the Twilight Zone episode or read the short story and save some time with the same results.
0446563048|4.0|Transparency. Alignment. Relationship building. Culture. Many companies struggle to incorporate today's new business memes. But some companies have embodied these ideas for years. Zappos, the online shoe store known for its tribal culture and customer service, is one of those companies.    Zappos' CEO, Tony Hsieh, tells his story in \\"Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose.\\" The book covers both Tony's personal entrepreneurial story and that of his company, Zappos. \\"Delivering Happiness\\" offers a feel-good look at the passion, culture, and, yes, happiness that could drive the next generation of companies.    Here's a summary of the content of the book:    \\"Delivering Happiness\\" starts with a look at Tony's childhood. Like many of today's successful businesspeople, Tony was an entrepreneur, innovator, and achiever from a young age. You follow Tony into high school, through his Harvard undergrad education, and then through the inception and buyout of his first major company, LinkXChange, which made him millions.    After selling LinkXChange, Tony dabbled in new projects, from poker to investing, before realizing that building companies was his passion. At this point, he jumped into a young, struggling Zappos, betting most of his fortune on the company's success. After several trials, Tony and his team get Zappos off the ground and growing.    The second part of the book leaves Tony's personal biography aside to focus more on Zappos' inner workings. Zappos has three priorities: customer service, culture, and employee training and development. Tony describes how Zappos uses each, and how each is a competitive advantage. Then, the same chapter goes through each of Zappos' ten core values in detail, with employee anecdotes along the way.    The third part of the book describes the public relations and speaking lessons Tony learned, as well as what alignment means to Zappos. It then covers the Amazon buyout. Tony finishes the book with a chapter on happiness, what it means for both humans and business, and the questions you should ask yourself in order to find it in your own life and career.    My thoughts:     If you're a regular business book reader, some of the concepts inside of \\"Delivering Happiness\\"--building on your core values, learning what to outsource, impressing customers through service--won't sound new. The character-building trials Tony describes are also a theme of any biographical business book.    Yet \\"Delivering Happiness\\" is timely. Buzzwords like alignment and culture are smoking hot in today's business language. Zappos is emblematic of many such \\"conscious\\" qualities. If you haven't yet immersed yourself in new corporate culture, Tony and Zappos' story is a fun place to start.    Tony's verve, passion, and openness also differentiate \\"Delivering Happiness\\" from your average business biography. He describes a wide array of experiences, including having an epiphany at a warehouse rave. Tony's engaging writing style makes the book feel conversational, even in some of the more technical, business-y sections.    Should You Read It?    If you're already familiar with today's new corporate qualities, and are scratching your head about whether to pick up this particular book, I'd say skip it. I found it good, but not mind-blowing. Nothing really stuck with me after I closed it, because I'd learned about the importance of spectacular customer service and company culture elsewhere.    Still, I do think that some people would benefit. \\"Delivering Happiness\\" would make a great starter business book for Gen Y-ers. Tony sounds like a Red Bull-chugging, whip-smart kid at heart. Today's 20-somethings can probably relate much more closely to him than to old-school titans like Jack Welch. I also recommend \\"Delivering Happiness\\" if you're curious about Zappos (or a fan), or you want a primer on today's new-school business qualities.    (book review by Drea Knufken)

0765348276|5.0|I love this book. I was looking for a new author to read and I discovered this in the bookstore. After reading the first three chapters I couldn't put it down. I read it over a weekend. It reminded me of \\"Ender's Game\\". There was non-stop action and characters that I really cared for. The other books in the trilogy are next on my reading list.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Lots of sports movies are produced every year, and almost all are either romance or drama movies; the latter being about some individual or team proving or redeeming themselves to their fans or opponents.  The list of \\"proving\\" movies, i.e. movies about teams or athletes that prove themselves includes Rudy, A League of Their Own, and The Mighty Ducks among others.  The list of \\"redeeming\\" movies would include He Got Game, Hoosiers, and The Natural.  Rarely, Hollywood produces a truly original sports movie, one that does not fit into either the \\"proving\\" or \\"redeeming\\" category of sports movie, and Invictus falls into that category.  Directed by Clint Eastwood, this movie is based on the real-life journey of South Africa's rugby team to the championship post-apartheid.      Morgan Freeman does a wonderful job playing Nelson Mandela; his portrayal of the Nobel-prize winner is probably the most accurate rendition I've seen of a world leader by a Hollywood actor.  Matt Damon does a great job playing the captain of the South African rugby team.  And the rest of the cast is great.  The pace of the movie is perfect, with a good mix of on-field action with off-field dialogue.  In my opinion, this was one of the best movies of 2009, and should have been nominated for a Best Picture by the Academy Awards over lesser nominees such as District 9 and Up In the Air.
0812973992|4.0|This is a very good book. Don't get me wrong. It was a very enjoyable reading experience and I would recommend this book to anyone. That being said, I started reading this book with sky high expectations and I have to say at the end I was kind of disappointed. The book did not succeed in blowing me away, and I think I know why.<br /><br />McCann is a superb writer and he really has a way with words. His imagery, diction, and the way he can so seamlessly slip into the heads of characters from different walks of life is pretty amazing. In this novel, he writes several spectacular short narratives and then falls short on cohesiveness when attempting to tie all the threads together at the end.<br /><br />We've got some great characters: the heart-wrenching Corrigan, the warm, generous Gloria, or the painfully stiff and slightly pathetic Claire, who all arouse sympathy and are flushed out with mastery in their introductions to the story. They really come alive under Mccann's pen, but as the narrative moves forward their stories are swallowed by the confusion of characters McCann has constructed in his ambition. There are too many characters, and McCann did not do all of them justice. I read five pages of superb , profound prose about a graffiti tag photographer, and then he is never mentioned again save under a photograph-- clever, but unsatisfying. Three tech kids working in California appear in one chapter and then disappear forever. What's confusing is McCann picks and chooses the characters he wants to give endings to like he's playing favorites, and never gives a reason as to why some characters get a huge hunk more exposure than others.<br /><br />Needless to say, this made the reading experience slightly disjointed, and I was disappointed that only some characters' stories were revisited. Note to author: If you're only interested in these characters, stick to them, or give everyone equal facetime at least. Of the stories that were flushed out, however, McCann does a great job at building intrigue, but he sometimes veers off into the realm of cliche and convenience. Many of the coincidences and connections between the characters in the novel seem improbable, and McCann's wish to make everything in the plot do double duty ends up making parts of the narrative seem forced and constrained.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me about this book was it's failure to draw up strong emotion. This may be cliche, but I usually know I've read a good novel when I've laughed, cried, and forgotten to eat too. I think i did chuckle while reading \\"Let The Great World Spin,\\" but for such an ambitious, atmospheric title, the novel fell short on emotional delivery. There could have been so many emotional high points, with the turmoil and insanity of these character's lives, but I never felt tears well up in my eyes in empathy for any of these characters, and I found that extremely odd. This may have had to do with the too-many-characters-too-little-time-for-everybody problem that I mentioned earlier, but usually by the end of a great novel my breath is caught in my throat and goosebumps are running down my spine. I was disappointed that with \\"Let The Great World Spin,\\" neither were the case.<br /><br />Additionally, sometimes wording is awkward and plot development uncomfortable, with the last paragraph being extremely awkward in this regard as McCann describes an unlikely encounter between a certain important young woman and an Italian man. The chapter made me feel sleazy and a bit skeptical, especially with McCann's awkward brushing over of the sex scene as if he's not quite sure what to do with himself. Many other instances like that in the novel had an unpleasant jarring effect on the reading experience.<br /><br />Of course, I'm being nitpicky here. I gave the book four stars and it deserves all four; McCann has written a very good novel that is much better than a lot of the other stuff out there. It deserves all the recognition it hasgotten, and I only focus on the negatives in these reviews to put some of the over-praising odes into proportion. In my opinion, this novel was good, but not great. If you want an extraordinary book on 9/11, one that will blow you away and make you fall in love head over heels, read Foer's \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.\\" This book tries, but in the end only partially succeeds.se reviews to put some of the over-praising odes into proportion.

B0030U1TLQ|5.0|I can definitely tell the difference, the remastered version has a lot more presence and clarity.  It's not apparent on every song, but try swapping back and forth between the opening of \\"Same\\" and listen the drums; nice, they no longer sound like they're deep under water with the song.  Is it a critical issue, must you run out and buy this because the drums are crisper?  No, obviously not, but you're a Cure fan so you have to buy everything, and any reason to punch up Disintegration again is a good reason.<br /><br />What I really would have liked is for Robert to go back and re-record the drums and the guitar.  I don't need to discuss the drums, you either hate that methodical thunking or you don't.  I can live with it, but I can also imagine improvements, if that's not some sort of cardinal Cure sin [oh yeah, it was].  As for the guitar, Bob just got a lot better as the years went on, and ten years later in \\"Bloodflowers\\" he was really a vastly different guitarist than here.  I would love to see him re-do the fills, it could be really magnificent.<br /><br />It's nice to have a full \\"Entreat\\" suite, that was a nice touch, I'll take it, there are some song versions here I like better than on \\"Trilogy\\".  And finally to the extras . . . we really need instrumental versions of everything, what for?  And everyone already has a better version of \\"Pirate Ships\\" I'm sure.  As usual the extras are something you listen to once (maybe) and never hit the playlist.<br /><br />Oh yeah, by the way, I listened to this with MP3's, I have no idea what the CD sounds like, I don't even have a CD player, unless the DVD player takes them, but it's not even hooked up to my music system.  Whattya going to do?  That's the age we live in, I bought the CD to support the band, but after I ripped it, it's in a box in the closet.  At least I was able to choose my own software and parameters, that's better than living with however it's mangled for sale.

0307454541|4.0|Personalities of the girl and the journalist in the story are well developed by the author. That creates tolerance to overlook super feats by the girl. The journalist manages to have affairs with every female he meets - don't know what this says about Swedish permissibility. Computer fans will love use of the internet to follow leads and gather information. Starting with our journalist loosing a court battle, the plot swings to a search for an industrialist's niece who has been missing for 36 years. Threads followed to solve things are very nebulous and only with determination and persistence can things progress. A good read but maybe slightly overrated.
0446563048|5.0|Before I say anything about Tony Hsieh's book, \\"Delivering Happiness,\\" I would first like to thank him and the Delivering Happiness team for selecting me to receive an advanced copy of the book. They actually provided me with two copies of the book - one to read, another to giveaway on my blog. Thanks for including me in your efforts and for allowing me to take part in the pre-release party. On to the review.<br /><br />Business writing is changing and I hope that it doesn't go unnoticed by corporations, authors and publishers. There is a valuable lesson to be learned here. I first noticed it when I read \\"rework\\" by Jason Fried And the 37signals team. Delivering Happiness is the second example. What are these authors doing that is so special? They are humanizing business writing and their efforts are redefining what it means to build a successful business.<br /><br />In Delivering Happiness, Tony Hsieh makes it clear that success should no longer defined by the size of your paycheck. It is about living a meaningful life filled with wonderful experiences. This is what truly makes Delivering Happiness a unique book. It is a book that focuses on creating a workplace that people love working in and that is focused on the long term development of all its team members.<br /><br />It is probably worth saying that I have been a fan of the company for some time now and I have bought a few shoes, books and other merchandise from them. I have experienced their amazing level of service as a customer first hand. Reading about all of their efforts behind the scene makes for a great read.<br /><br />The first two sections of the book focus on Tony's life - from his childhood and time spent in college to his time building LinkShare and then Zappos. I've heard bits and pieces of the Zappo's story, however, I was unaware of the major sacrifices that the company's entire team endured to make their dream a reality. In addition to the history lessons, the first two sections are jam packet with actionable ideas that could help any business prosper.<br /><br />Overall, Delivering Happiness is an outstanding book and it deserves to be read by entrepreneurs, c-suite staff, marketers, and anyone that is interested in living a life that is filled with meaning and happiness.<br /><br />This book is unlike any other business book I have ever read. I went into it thinking that it might focus on the company's history and best practices. Instead, it was a collective history of Tony and his experience in business. The book truly reflects the values that he and the Zappo's team live every day.<br /><br />About 200 pages into the book, Tony turns the tables on the reader and asks a couple simple questions: What makes you happy and how do you want to live the rest of your life? He then dives right into talking about the research he has done on happiness and how it can impact the reader's life.<br /><br />Think about what Tony is doing here. He leads a company that is in the process of changing our other companies do business, both with their team members and customer. In \\"Delivering Happiness\\" Tony makes matters a little more personal by reaching out to his readers and trying to impact their lives in a positive manner.<br /><br />I love this approach and I must say that Tony has had an impact on at least on of his readers - me. Thanks for sharing your life experiences, insights and values with all of us.uld help any business prosper.

030745455X|2.0|Not near as good as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (of which the author used about 200 pages recapping). This recapping necessary only if you have never read that book first. The author seemed lost for direction in this one. He uses a super (inhuman) bad-guy along with \\"chain saw massacre\\"type events to create interest. At the end our girl survives 3 bullets (one a head wound) and being buried in a shallow grave. For me, a vastly overrated book.
B0036B8MXC|1.0|This show was not a work of fiction or history , but of rather repugnant fantasy . True , gladiatorial schools and contests were vicious and brutal but this depiction was absurd in it's abuse of \\"300\\" style gore spattering . Let me note that I am not a prude , a christian or a weak kneed/stomach liberal ( and on occasion have been referred to as a bit of a potty mouth myself )but the nonstop revolting vulgarity was both silly and offensive. Most prisons probably don't sound this bad. As for history the writers threw out all but a few facts of the Spartacus story . The truth is that extremely little is known about Spartacus or the other 2 or 3 other verifiable historical characters shown thus far.If you like it, fine .But don't delude yourselves into thinking that this is remotely historically accurate .It's a sort of overly long snuff film with an unhealthy dose of pornography thrown in . The only positive thing about this abomination was the excellence of the performers . It's too bad they spent so much of their time spouting some of the most revolting filth I've ever heard and I grew up a street kid . Verecundia !

B001TOD92C|5.0|This was an absolutely fantastic film. Great on many levels.  Makes you miss the 80's on behalf of the protagonist. Disturbing in that it symbolically shows the destruction of the American male.  In particularly the white male. Divorced broke alimented from his kids.  Should have won an Oscar. Most Americas have died for there dream job and have more or less failed to reproduce health families. Viewers were probably excited to see how bad Micky looked and miss the unintended symbolic meaning of this brilliant but utterly depressing film.  Rourke is quite good in this film as was Tomei.

030745455X|5.0|This obviously is the second volume in the much praised trilogy by Stieg Larsson.  It is interesting because it just continues the story begun in the first volume. Believe me, it is absolutely necessary to have read the initial volume before tackling this 630-page thriller.  This book is both similar to but also different from its predecessor. Once again Larsson takes his time in setting the stage for what is to come; it is not until around page 220 that the story really begins to take off. That most fascinating creation of the author, Lisbeth Salander, once again is a key focus of the novel, and this time she is really the central character.  So we learn a great deal more about her than from the first volume.  Journalist Mikael Blomkvist also reappears, but he is definitely a secondary character to Salander, which is just the reverse of the first volume. I still have trouble keeping straight all these folks with similar Swedish names but that is my problem. The story line is once again very well developed, but this one is somewhat more complex than the first volume.<br /><br />Where the two books differ is that this one is much more the traditional murder mystery than its predecessor.  It also becomes a real \\"page-turner\\" of much more potency than the earlier book.  From about page 220 to the end at page 630, it is difficult to do anything else in your life but keep reading--it really moves and holds the reader. We have the more traditional story focusing upon a group of people trying to interpret various clues that pop up; there is a national dragnet in operation and its principal target proves too elusive for even crackerjack Swedish police experts to succeed in apprehension; and there is graphic and somewhat surprising violence, even more so than the earlier volume. Although I found the first 220 pages somewhat slower and less interesting than the beginning section of the first volume, the book as a whole is the better of the two in terms of suspense and emotion.<br /><br />I read with amazement many times that folks were so determined to find out what happened to the central characters in the third (and perhaps) final volume, that they were paying $200 to order copies from overseas before it was published here. Now I understand why; fortunately the third volume is now available in this country in hardcover and is not expensive.  The trilogy is a remarkable accomplishment by the late author. The story also translates very well to the screen, I note, having just seen \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" over the weekend. The film version of this volume is about to hit American screens as well.  In fact, the movie sort of let the cat out of the bag on several points that really only appear in this second volume, so don't be surprised if you see it. In the future, whenever I hear a book described as a \\"thriller,\\" I will know that I already have read an incomparable masterpiece of the genre.ead with amazement many times that folks were so determined to find out what happened to the central characters in the third (and perhaps) final volume, that they were paying $200 to order copies from overseas before it was published here.

030726999X|4.0|When we last saw Lisbeth Salander, she was shot in the head and rescued from sure death by Mikael Blomkvist.  As this book opens, Salander is saved through emergency surgery to convalesce under armed guard while the authorities decide what to do with her.  To top it off, her estranged father, Zalechanko, has somehow survived too and is in the very hospital Salander is in only a few doors away.<br /><br />The inner circle within the Swedish security police (Sapo) realize that Salander is a threat to their secret cadre as long as she is free.  They therefore work to have her recomitted.  They realize that Mikael Blomkvist has some information that could implicate them so they need to eliminate him as well.<br /><br />Blomkvist gets in a pickle and realizes that he needs Salander's help but she is allowed no visitors in the hospital and is to go to trial as soon as she recovers sufficiently.  Blomkvist has to work out a plan to get to Salander, but on top of everything, Salander wants nothing to do with Blomkvist.<br /><br />The book starts off a little rough to read with the reader bombarded with a lot of Swedish names and some of them are very much alike that is a little tough to follow and that is the reason I didn't give the book the full five stars.  Once the reader gets past that, the book is impossible to put down and like the last entry in the Jason Bourne movies, we learn how Salander came to be like she is, how the secret orgination got involved and who was behind everything.<br /><br />The book has some tense courtroom drama as the people that try to help Salandar have to deal with a corrupt psychologist as well as a misguided prosecutor who will stop at nothing to win.<br /><br />The book has a bunch of subplots such as Beger's plans to leave Milennium and someone who is stalking her.  As for the playboy Blomkvist, he may have finally met the woman who will change his ways.<br /><br />It is a shame that the author passed away but perhaps some other authors will take the reins to produce a follow-up.

B001C4AFOY|3.0|All the period detail certainly looks right in this 2009 historical drama, but it amazes me how bloodless and staid the story feels under the pedestrian direction of Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e. That's unfortunate given how lively Emily Blunt can be in any number of onscreen roles she has undertaken ([[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada]], [[ASIN:B001UV4XGU Sunshine Cleaning]]). The key problem is that Julian Fellowes' sensitive albeit dull screenplay focuses on what was obviously a happy marriage between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the consequence of which doesn't give rise to much dramatic fire unless wrapped conveniently in political intrigue, insanity or war. Attempts to add sharper edges to their love story wring hollow because at heart, Victoria is not presented as that compelling a historical figure.<br /><br />Because of her station in life, the teenaged Victoria is unable to rebel with any conviction. Her scheming, Machiavellian mother, the Duchess of Kent controls her every move, while her advisor John Conroy manipulates the duchess and her daughter with strong-arm tactics with the aim of forcing Victoria have him rule in her stead before she can mature into her role. However, Victoria steadfastly declines his directives in favor of ascending the throne herself upon the death of her beloved uncle, the cantankerous King William IV. Although young and naive, she rises to the challenge of becoming her country's soon-to-be longest-reigning monarch. In the midst of this transition, she falls for her cousin Albert even though he has been aggressively coached by her uncle, King Leopold of Belgium, to ensure a match occurs.<br /><br />Once Victoria confronts Albert about his ruse, their affection builds and turns into a marriage of mutual devotion with a common dedication to the expansion of arts and science in the empire. The only compelling barrier to Victoria and Albert's happiness is the cagey Lord Melbourne, her trusted, almost-Svengali-like advisor, whose motives remain murky and highly suspect throughout the five-year span of the story told in the movie. Blunt handles her stately role with aplomb, injecting the right level of vulnerability to a character whose ultimate calling came so early in her life. Unfortunately, compared to Cate Blanchett's meaty opportunities in the first [[ASIN:6305358613 Elizabeth]], she is not given any scenes that take advantage of her innate fieriness. By comparison, Rupert Friend comes across a bit too pallid to make any real impression as Albert.<br /><br />Other worthy actors are given too little to do to strike more than single notes in their performances, for example, Miranda Richardson's petulant turn as the duchess, Mark Strong's Conroy trivialized into a stock villain, and Paul Bettany almost too subtly ambiguous as Melbourne. Only Jim Broadbent stands out in just three scenes as King William. The production details are executed just right from Hagen Bogdanski's clear-eyed cinematography to Patrice Vermette's sumptuous production design to Sandy Powell's pageantry of costumes. The 2010 DVD includes 22 minutes of deleted and extended scenes, a standard making-of featurette, a short comparing the movie' title character with the real Queen Victoria, in-depth looks at the film's coronation and wedding scenes, and a final piece that focuses on the costumes and locations.

0446563048|5.0|VIDEO REVIEW HERE ( [...] )<br />(NOTE: I actually rate this book 4,5 stars instead of 5)<br /><br />What could you possibly learn about happiness from a guy who spent his college years at Harvard partying; claims to have a personal relationship with RedBull; learned all he had to know about business from playing poker; and now even released a book titled `Delivering Happiness'? Yes, it's OK to be suspicious.<br /><br />I was very fortunate to be approved for the blogger program of the upcoming book Delivering Happiness book, written by Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh. It is an honest tale of entrepreneurship and taking all the risks in order to follow your passion. After finding out that profit alone is not enough to make a company tick, Tony Hsieh (pronounced `Shay') decided to try two other P's: Passion and Purpose. Like Jonathan Haidt[[ASIN:0465028020 The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom]], Hsieh is a firm believer of vital engagement and the pursuit of a calling (as opposed to a career or a job).<br /><br />5 Reasons<br />In the video I have summarized my 5 reasons why you should read this book. In short:<br />1. Alignment: when you bring the day-to-day actions of your workforce into alignment with your core values, that is when culture starts to make sense.<br />2. Ups AND Downs: in an honest and open style Hsieh talks about all the good and bad moments and the reality of falling down seven times and standing up eight.<br />3. Love & Work: Happiness is not a buzzword at Zappos. It is a business model. Take for example the emotional labor that Seth Godin mentions in Linchpin. At Zappos, this hard work is called Personal Emotional Connection and it appears to be one of their competitive advantages.<br />4. The Culture Book: Instead of making posters with empty buzzwords or investing into long scientific surveys Zappos' employees made the culture book, in which they tell and show in their own words what the Zappos culture and values mean to them.<br />5. The Style: I just love the direct style of Tony Hsieh. No poetry or literary statements; just straight talk and even entire emails that describe landmarks in the Zappos history.<br /><br />BCP: It's the Culture, Stupid!<br />`Culture isn't just one aspect of the game, it is the game. In the end, an organization is nothing more than the collective capacity of its people to create value.''Lou Gerstner<br /><br />BCP seems to be the Zappos codeword for Brand-Culture-Pipeline, thereby summing up their competitive advantage. When we have closer look these are three areas where 99% of the companies cut costs when the going gets tough.<br /><br />B is for Brand. First, Zappos decided to invest big time into their customer service, because they knew that the customer owns their brand. So there is no better way to build a strong brand than by taking care of these customers really well.<br /><br />C is for Culture. The above mentioned culture book is not really about the book. It is about the culture being owned and lived by your employees, vendors and customers. According to Hsieh, all organizations that are serious about culture should ask themselves if they would be comfortable printing everything their employees and customers had to say about their culture? And if not - they should ask themselves what it would take to get there. Now that is a strong question.<br /><br />P is for Pipeline. Rather than focusing on people as assets, they take the perspective of a pipeline. This is the long term perspective of continuous learning and evolving.<br />Imagine investing in these three areas while all other companies are cutting precisely there. Quite revolutionary I would say...<br /><br />Che or Hsieh?<br />In the title of this post I am making a specific reference here to the Latin American revolutionary leader Ernesto Guevara de la Serna who died in 1967 and got nicknamed `Che' Guevara and whom I think is related to Tony Hsieh in more than one way.<br />First, he isoften described as a dual character who simply cannot be categorized: he played a league of his own. Second, at present Che is still a source of inspiration and contradiction. And third: he was on a mission.<br />These are three elements where `Shieh' resembles `Che': there is no way you can categorize him, he is a source of inspiration to the same extent as he is a source of contradiction, and: he is on a mission.ent Che is still a source of inspiration and contradiction.

Their live quality sound was terrible and I have heard much better live albums before, Some of their guitar works were faded, theres some distortion sometimes, the crowd screams randomly which you can't hear the music sometimes and bruce dickinson struggles in his singing alittle bit. But despite all these flaws I got to say this is a pretty incredible live performance they put out and they sound more talented than ever.<br /><br />This album was alright but I guess it wasn't the right choice for me or new IM fans either.<br /><br />\m/ \m/ stay metal!

B002XGWPWK|4.0|I just reviewed this album, but I also wanted to add my thoughts on the deluxe version, which I own.  So first I'll post my review of the album itself, and then I'll tag on my thoughts on the bonus songs included in this version.<br /><br />First, my review of `Waking Up':<br /><br />\\"I really like OneRepublic.  I remember when I first heard `Apologize' and I was instantly hooked.  I love their style and their sound and Ryan Tedder's voice is magic to my ears.  He has the perfect falsetto, yet he never comes off as anything less than masculine in his delivery.  Lyrically, they have a nice repertoire, and just when I think that they can't one-up themselves I hear the next track and I'm engaged all over again.<br /><br />All of this said, they have yet to produce an album as universally complete as I know they are capable of.<br /><br />In parts `Waking Up' is a great album.  Sadly, OneRepublic winds up tied down by the one thing that makes them so unique; their sound.  When you hear any of the songs on this album it is instantly obvious that it is a One Republic song.  Even before Ryan starts serenading us, we know that his voice is about to be broadcast.  OneRepublic has a signature sound that they drench each and every track on this album with to the point where their songs start to run into one another.<br /><br />It's a shame, I know.<br /><br />The eleven tracks on this album range from great to mediocre, with only really one song standing out as unappealing to me, but then again only three stand out as truly amazing to me.<br /><br />The album opens with a gigantic bang, the first three songs basically setting the bar SO high that the only way to go from there was down.  `Made For You' is a fantastic opening track, perfectly fusing the pop beats with the soft piano and that chorus is just hauntingly hushed yet loud with emotional merit.  `All the Right Moves' keeps the energy high with a chorus so energetically engrossing you can't help but become a part of the song.  Still, `Secrets' is even better.  The musical opening is stunning and instantly grabs the listener.  The lyrical content is pure and poignant.  When the songs snaps into attention less than 40 seconds in with that stunning chorus you know that you have found this bands opus.<br /><br />And then the album starts to spiral away from itself.<br /><br />`Everybody Loves Me' is rich with satirical content, but it just doesn't manage to be anything more than a Beck soundalike.  `Good Life' is `happy-inducing' but it is also a tad lazy.  It just sounds so familiar for them, with no real newness to it.  That said, I really like the song.  In fact, I really like the entire album, it just doesn't wow me like I expected after that one-two-THREE punch right off the bat.  `Marchin On' has grown on me, if not for the fact that it shows true ambition.  It can feel a tad long, but no where near as long as the title track, `Waking Up', comes off as.  In fact, that song is the one that I just DO NOT LIKE.  It is just really bland and it carries on for far too long.  `Missing Persons 1 & 2' is nice and subtle, yet it doesn't leave a major impact.  It is pretty to listen to, but Ryan's voice does seem to strain in parts.  I do like the haunting quality to the song, but it just doesn't live up to potential.  The shift in song structure is also odd.  Why didn't they separate this into two tracks?  `All This Time' sounds like something they've already done, with no real spark or anything to remember.  In fact, it actually sounds a tad dated.  `Fear' is simply forgettable.  It almost feels like an afterthought.<br /><br />The closing song `Lullaby' would have been less disappointing had the rest of the album been more impressive.  It isn't a bad song at all, and it would generally be a great way to end an album (soft, sweet, serene) but instead it just becomes another seemingly dull song.<br /><br />In the end, I still give this album a B and recommend it if you are a fan of the group.  Ryan Tedder is going to stick around (highly in demand as a song writer and producer as well) so I don't expect this band to go away anytime soon, which is a good thing.  I want them to release an album that lives up to what I know they can create.  They have the goods and they have a unique and signature sound that I really wish they would use to the full instead of allowing it to defeat them by rendering them seemingly `one-note'.\\"<br /><br />Now, for my thoughts on the bonus disc:<br /><br />Like my review title suggests, this deluxe version really doesn't add anything new to the picture.  Aside from the beautifully delicate `It's a Shame', this is just a mix of mediocre fare.  If you purchased the Exclusive provided by this site then you will also have their cover of Duffy's `Mercy'.  I actually love what they did with it.  The original is better (obviously) but their cover shows some versatility on their part and I want to see more of that.  `Passenger' is just horribly crafted.  It is not only boring but it is musically annoying (the guitar riff is ear-splitting).  `Trap Door' and `Sucker Punch' are not bad, but they really lack any true spark.  They definitely feel like B-Side tracks that were left off the album for a reason, not bonus tracks we should be grateful were released for us.  `Sucker Punch' has a Harvey Danger feel to it, which I kind of like, but it isn't developed enough.<br /><br />Here is my ranking for those interested:<br /><br />1) Secrets<br />2) Made for You<br />3) All the Right Moves<br />4) Mercy<br />5) Good Life<br />6) It's a Shame<br />7) Marchin On<br />8) Everybody Loves Me<br />9) Lullaby<br />10) Missing Persons 1 & 2<br />11) Sucker Punch<br />12) All This Time<br />13) Trap Door<br />14) Fear<br />15) Waking Up<br />16) Passengeroducer as well) so I don't expect this band to go away anytime soon, which is a good thing.

They definitely feel like B-Side tracks that were left off the album for a reason, not bonus tracks we should be grateful were released for us.  `Sucker Punch' has a Harvey Danger feel to it, which I kind of like, but it isn't developed enough.    Here is my ranking for those interested:    1) Secrets  2) Made for You  3) All the Right Moves  4) Mercy  5) Good Life  6) It's a Shame  7) Marchin On  8) Everybody Loves Me  9) Lullaby  10) Missing Persons 1 & 2  11) Sucker Punch  12) All This Time  13) Trap Door  14) Fear  15) Waking Up  16) Passenger
0446563048|5.0|Ahora s&iacute;, llego el d&iacute;a del lanzamiento de \\"Delivering Happiness\\" el primer libro del empresario y emprendedor Tony Hsieh. Y como bien acordamos, todos los bloggers con &eacute;l, he aqu&iacute; mi honesto review del libro.<br /><br />La historia de Zappos (la tienda de zapatos online m&aacute;s grande del mundo) puede pasar por otra historia de sangre, sudor y lagrimas. Aquella carrera contra mil obst&aacute;culos que supone levantar una empresa. Mas la gran diferencia aqu&iacute; es como la marca ha ido evolucionando en sus diez a&ntilde;os de trayectoria hasta transformarse en lo que es hoy: Una organizaci&oacute;n la cual tiene a la felicidad en el centro de su modelo de negocios.<br /><br />Cuando supe eso, de verdad quede curioso y muy intrigado, puesto que una cosa es decir algo y lo otro regir tu vida en base a esa promesa. En Zappos, la felicidad se dice y se practica, tanto as&iacute; que durante estos meses, he investigado minuciosamente a la empresa para saber si esto es o no cierto: He visto sus reuniones mensuales en vivo por Ustream, he le&iacute;do el libro de la cultura, he revisado los Twitter personales de varios empleados y he le&iacute;do blogs y varias iniciativas paralelas que han nacido al alero de la empresa. Y creanme cuando les digo que Tony Hsieh y familia lograron crear una empresa ondera, feliz, que hace dinero y motiva a su tribu. Todo un hallazgo.<br /><br />Hay cosas dentro del libro que me convencieron acerca de esta filosof&iacute;a de vida:'Cuando Tony Hsieh vendi&oacute; la empresa, env&iacute;o un extenso mail a todos los empleados explicando detalladamente la situaci&oacute;n, las implicancias y consecuencias de la venta. El mail esta escrito tal cual en el libro y ah&iacute; queda plasmada la transparencia y calidez con la que todo se comunica.<br /><br />Aparte de la historia de Zappos en s&iacute;, Tony cuenta su vida, sus logros, frustraciones, empresas anteriores y c&oacute;mo se transformo en uno de los hombres m&aacute;s exitosos del mundo. Su prosa es agil, sencilla, amigable y directa. No puedes dejar de leer su historia. Desde que armo LinkExchange en su pieza, hasta que escalo el Himalaya, o cuando compro un edificio entero para vivir con todos sus amigos.<br /><br />El desparpajo del libro es decir que puedes crear una empresa multimillonaria s&oacute;lo si persigues la felicidad. Y no s&oacute;lo la tuya, sino la de quienes te rodean y compran tus productos.<br />\\"Delivering Happiness\\" es el backstage de esa empresa, de como han creado un servicio al cliente llamado WOW (porque los sorprende), hasta el trato prioritario que dan a sus proveedores, como nadie antes lo hab&iacute;a hecho en la industria.<br /><br />Regalo dos copias del libro, porque me encanto y s&oacute;lo quiero compartir lo que aprend&iacute; (de hecho me gusto tanto que compre la edici&oacute;n tapa dura).<br />Espero que puedan leer \\"Delivering Happiness\\" es realmente imperdible.<br />PEACE OUTsu pieza, hasta que escalo el Himalaya, o cuando compro un edificio entero para vivir con todos sus amigos.

0812550706|3.0|A 6-year old child prodigy is viewed as Humanity's last, best hope against an alien menace... but can he be honed into an unbeatable military genius before it's too late?<br /><br />Yep, that's pretty much the story, with some sub-plots tossed in that feel like filler (though this is book 1 in a series, and they may well come into relevance later on.) Per the author's introduction, this started life as a short story and was subsequently fleshed out to novel length. It certainly feels that way.<br /><br />On the bright side, this is a quick read and doesn't require too much brain power on the part of the reader. The library I got this from shelved it in \\"Young Adult\\" which I feel is appropriate.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was one of OSC's first novels, and it certainly feels like an early work by a starting author. Bare-bones descriptions, stilted dialogue that seems unbelievable from the lips of someone still in single-digit age, and a painfully predictable plot. Science fiction is notorious for requiring \\"suspension of disbelief\\"--which I normally have no problem with. The suspension required here, though, wasn't anything technical (super-fast space travel, etc) but the aforementioned social aspects.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this won the awards it did. I recognize that there's something of a cult following to this book, and again I'm not sure why. I didn't hate it, but I didn't go \\"WOW!\\" either. I can only assume that the street-level buzz around it built it up too much for me. I probably would have liked it (more) if I'd read this 30 years ago, but now I only felt let-down. I have no interest in reading the rest of the series.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|It was a good movie but not really up their with the standards that they have set  from previous films.  Liked the EVE character best in this film.  The film was kinda slow especially at the beginning.  This is nota must have to add to your disney and pixar collection but it would nice to pick it up if it was on sale for raelly cheap, i would never pay the full price for this film like I would some of the others.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is a satisfying conclusion to the late Stieg Larsson's riveting trilogy - a long and sometimes meandering journey through decades and deception ripe with a smorgasbord of Swedish names and places.  Consider taking notes.<br /><br />\\"Hornet\\" picks right off where \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" left off, with Lisbeth Salander in intensive care, bullets in her brain, shoulder and hip.  Setting up the story takes some effort from the author and the reader, so plan on investing some time up front to get the plot lines drawn in the sand.  But once established, the pace picks up considerably as Larsson weaves a deliciously convoluted and multi-threaded plot lines of conspiracy, subversion, sex, and deceit as the wily Mikael Blomkvist, with help from the usual suspects as well as some new ones, works behind the scenes to help clear Salander from the various murder and assault charges she as accumulated along her bloody path of revenge in the previous novel.  The author colors the action with Cold War history and intrigue, painting a credible portrait of Swedish international affairs, politics, and governance against a backdrop of Scandinavian promiscuity and socialism.  While less mystery than \\"Dragon\\" and less action than \\"Fire,\\" this is arguably the most thoughtful of the trio - and certainly the most complex.  Bureaucratic intrigue, espionage, shadowy government agencies, neat courtroom drama, and the always fascinating computer hacking take center stage here, leading to a climax that while predictable in the final outcome is nonetheless exhilarating in the journey.<br /><br />Steig Larsson obviously likes his women dominant - physically and intellectually,  a theme that was set up in the preceding books - and is unleashed here in a quartet of decisive women making sure the estrogen keeps flowing while Salander recovers from her injuries.  From take-charge editor Erika Berger to private security guard Susanne Linder to body-builder spy-cop Monica Figuerola and attorney Annika Giannini, this is a book where the women are kicking butt and taking names, relegating most of the males to supporting roles.  But unlike the pandering and abominable \\"Women's Murder Club\\" series of James Patterson, or Lis Wiehl's stereotyped knockoff \\"Triple Threat,\\" pair of novels, Larsson's women are gritty and believable - a credible blend of power and vulnerability - the signature that makes Larsson and Lisbeth Salander the refreshing and unpredictable global hit that it has become.<br /><br />Clearly, this is not a stand alone novel - readers will definitely want to start at the beginning a work up to this beguiling conclusion.  And before you despair over Larsson's passing and the end of the line, take heart: a long line of intriguing Scandinavian crime fiction is out there waiting to be discovered: try Arnaldur Indridason, Jo Nesbo, James Thompson or, for softer but well written and unusual noir crime from the north, Karin Fossum.ica Figuerola and attorney Annika Giannini, this is a book where the women are kicking butt and taking names, relegating most of the males to supporting roles.

B0031RS64G|3.0|This book is wonderful, as are the others in the series. When purchasing for the Kindle, I would recommend getting the kindle edition published by Tor, rather than this one, as there are spelling mistakes in this version.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I really enjoyed \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,\\" as I did all three books in the trilogy.  I thought it was suspenseful, and I had trouble putting it down.  That being said, I did have a couple of criticisms:<br /><br />1.  There were many unresolved issues at the end.  I realize that it could be in part that Stieg Larsson had more books in mind, but he died before they could be written.  So maybe this isn't a criticism, but a regret.<br /><br />2.  I had a little trouble keeping all the characters straight.  The main characters, of course, I already know well from the first two books.  However, the peripheral characters (especially all the different levels of police, good and bad), started blending together, and I found myself looking back to remember who was who.  Some of that could be because of the unfamiliarity of many of the Swedish names.<br /><br />3.  The ending was a little trite and convenient.  I won't spoil anything, but the setup for the final conflict did seem contrived.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the book immensely.  It was fast paced, and kept me wondering what would happen next.  I really wish the series continued, because I love the characters.  Lisbeth Salander is one of the most interesting and complex female characters I've encountered in a long time.
B000S88JTS|5.0|On Any Sunday, like Endless Summer, is an iconic Bruce Brown movie.   And, like Endless Summer it is of it's time - and I mean that in the best way!  Having grown up in the 70's I built models of Malcolm Smith's motorcycles, and loved reading about motorcycles and the early days of motocross.  I am a big fan of Bruce's movies and can't believe I waited so long to buy this one!  If you love motorcycles, are a Bruce Brown fan, or want to see what motor sports were like before the big sponsors, this is the movie for you!
B001GCUO5W|1.0|As I wrote after seeing this mess in the theater, anyone who gives it four stars is afraid to admit that they wasted two hours of their life and Scorsese is responsible. Anytime a movie can be compared to 'Robot Men From the Moon\\" that pretty much says it all.
B002BWQ586|1.0|WWZ offended me to the point I almost felt I needed to showcase his lack of intelligence.  Insulting was his use of the book to peddle his world views on how the world works. When I see the title, \\"World War Z\\" I do expect to read about war. It felt more like he asked a college buddy to play a stereotype and wrote down the scenario of what they thought was cool while sitting in their arm chairs.    No wonder they are having a tough time turning it into a movie. I mean how are they going to have a blind Japanese man fight off zombies as if it was straight out of the show Kung Fu (zombie edition) with the Blind teacher / young student concept. Also in our digital age, he writes an oral history?     So no one kept records or stored them digitally for when electricity comes back? In a court of law, when years pass a persons memory isn't exactly perfect so it's \\"recorded\\" so it is not overflowing with opinion.     One thing that kept annoying me through out the book were the generic details and gaps in logic that made me feel embarrassed to be a U.S. Citizen. Honestly the book made me felt like he never talked to a someone from another country and see if any of the events in the book could play out in \\"real life\\" So that makes this book fantasy yet people quote it like the new Gospel.    Another thing I couldn't wrap my head around is the fact that in the U.S. the latino group is quite large and there is a serious lack of discussion of them in the book, heck even other minority groups were rarely represented. The view point seem to be from some kid from the suburb who is telling you about a country he has never been to and about people he never met.     A friend of mine told me the difference between racism and ignorance. In this case, I can't claim the author is racist, because it clearly shows he is just has a lack of knowledge about the places he talks about. I hope he didn't intentionally came up with the South African Plan to back hand \\"colored people\\" Because if you want to stereo type, Brooks sounds like a W.A.S.P. and if you don't know what it is look it up. That's right, I actually paid attention in history class.Cultural assumptions aside, he did have a good sections like the downed pilot. Which I believe is not on the audio version.     By the time I finished this book it seemed tailored to a western audience who like sound bites for news and simple concepts that is easily digestible. How people can seem to quote this book and actually believe some of his suggestions can work is beyond me. At least I know they will be one of the first ones to go in an actual zombie pandemic! ^_^    By the way, this book was too serious in tone to be taken as comedy or even a parody. So, I hope this isn't the best he can do. -_-      [[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]]
0679420266|5.0|The Stranger   The Stranger is a novel by Albert Camus; the novel is a perfect example of existentialism. The main character is a Frenchman Meursault, one of the first things the reader will notice is that Meursault is detached form the world, on hearing his mother's death he does not break down into tears as most people would. Rather he sees it as just another event in his life, as if he ordered some coffee. The behavior of Meursault is classified as existentialism, being non emotional and being a man of few words, Meursault is the perfect anti-hero. The novel is separated into 2 parts. The first part describes Meursault's interactions with his friends, having sex with Marie, drinking with Raymond, watching Salamano with his dog and eating food at Celeste's. Meursault shows no ambition and no emotion in his everyday life. When at his mother's funeral he just walks and proceeds with what is necessary, he does not even know her age. At the end of part one Meursault murders an Arab while taking a walk on the beach. Part two consist of officials attempting to convert Meursault to Christianity. They say if he shows some sign of remorse or converts then they will set him free, yet he refuses. And at the end he is finally executed with no remorse, he does not have any feelings for his actions.   The Stranger is a different type of read form most novels. The heavily laced existentialism causes the main character to react to his surrounds with no emotion. The beginning of the novel is seemingly dull, as he has zero emotions or concerns and talk in short sentences. The initial thought was extremely boring and not at all a good read. But after a few paragraphs, the reader realizes that the novel is not like any other, the main character is more of an anti-hero, he does nothing brave. He turns down any chance to advance in his career and just enjoys the physical things in life. The first couple of chapters are there to setup Meursault's behavior, his way of life and his embrace of the physical things in life. The murder of the Arab is the climax of the story, although he could be let off easily Meursault refuses to take the easy way and remains true to his ideals. There in that aspect Meursault turns form the anti-hero into a hero. Staying with his ideals, Meursault is like every other comic book hero, despite the danger he still remembers his ideology and sticks with it. The usage of the short sentences and the lack of emotion in the book enforce the existentialist idea. Although the novel is a different style of writing, it still is a very excellent read. Meursault depicts a man that has no cares in the world, I see Meursault as what would happen if humans retained no emotion. This book gets a thumbs up and I recommend it for a light read, it's short and simply phrased yet the meaning of the book is deep; the dark side of the human soul with no emotion or ambition.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I own this movie on the 4-disc Director's Cut DVD and loved it so much that I had to own the Blu-ray edition. Though it has no special features, the movie rocks! Inserted the disc into my PS3 connected on my Samsung 63\\" plasma and watched it on full HD 1080p running @ 60fps, meanwhile kicking the audio on my Bose Lifestyle 12, 5.1 Dolby Digital system. The clarity of the picture and sound is way beyond the experience of watching the same on a DVD format.     I know some people have taken off stars for stating that this movie is inaccurate. In my opinion, this movie does not portray all Crusades as savages. The storyline though centered at Balian, offers much more depth between the other characters of the movie. Saladin is portrayed as merciful and powerful king but then King Baldwin is also shown as a powerul yet peaceful ruler  who tried to hold peace and harmony within the Holy land, even if it means punishing christian radicals by death. The terms between the two kings after the battle at hattin is one of the best parts of the movie. The directors cut does offer much more than the theatrical release hence gives the viewer more understanding and depth of the whole movie.       If I was to have my top 5 epic movies, this is definitely on top of the list followed by:    2. Braveheart  3. Gladiator  4. Troy  5. King Arthur/300    Again, can't say more about this movie, give this one a chance if you were disappointed by the theatrical release. And if you have blu-ray, this one is definitely one to go on a collection at a great price.     Thanks Amazon!     \\"Rise a Knight!\\"
0446563048|4.0|I purchased this book primarily because I am fascinated with Zappos and how they have grown so quickly over the years, and also because their founder and leader, Tony, has a unique approach to business in the Customer Service Era.      Running a small business myself, I think the insights Tony shared we're great, although quite focused on Zappos versus advice for business in general.  That being said, Zappos is obviously very successful and what works for them will work for many.  What I found most interesting was that the idea of Zappos, as an online shoe store, really has very little to do with shoes, which is becoming apparent as the company branches out into new businesses.  Creating a system and a competitive advantage that transcends products and prices is extremely difficult to do and I think it serves only a certain market.  That is not a knock against Zappos, as there is obviously a market of individuals who are willing to pay a price premium for items essentially guaranteeing a no hassle experience.  And that is one of the big takeaways from this book - knowing your market and how to serve them.      The book is extremely light reading (I finished in 5 hours and am by no means a speed reader).  There are some great action items to take away from it, and if you can pick up a copy of this it makes for a perfect weekend read.
0307269981|3.0|I've had this book lying around for a while in an advance reader's copy and picked it up because of the buzz over the film made of its predecessor in the trilogy (which I have not read and now have no intention of reading).  I find I have to agree with many of the less-than-enthusiastic reviews here.<br /><br />There are two key problems with The Girl Who Played with Fire:  poor editing and terrible pacing.  Like other reviewers, I really wasn't much interested in what each character ate at every meal or the names of every bloody piece of Ikea furniture.  I was also troubled by the introduction of an interesting mystery early in the novel which is promptly forgotten once the heroine returns to Sweden.<br /><br />This leads to the pacing problem.  Readers are asked to slog through excruciatingly detailed descriptions of things like driving directions and computer specifications while the plot lurches along in often pointless directions.  How, for example, does Berger's big job offer contribute anything?  When we finally do get to the climax (after way too much coffee), things are wrapped up in a few paragraphs and the book just ends.  It's not that I really wanted more text, I just thought I had earned a more satisfying conclusion after investing so much time in the book.<br /><br />Despite all of this, I can't say I really hated the book.  The character of Salander is intriguing and the story does give one interesting insights into Swedish culture.  I just wish it had been better focused.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|My wife and I had a somewhat hard time following the story at first - whether it be from us at first trying to compare it to the epic BOB or having 4 kids under 12 constantly interrupting us 40 times an hour. Regardless, it certainly isn't the series with the issues. I thought some of the parts overdone as when some troops go over to Australia and one of the major characters has a relationship while on leave - this is where historian buffs will balk. Most of what happened in Australia never happened from my research and understanding. Also, the way the series portrays Basilone towards the end. Since many of you are reading this for an informed decision, I will go no further - I am just one of those historian purists that enjoys factual data versus Hollywood's warping of the past. Many are minor in their scope overall however.    The character development and acting from everyone is well done and would risk to say some of the best I have seen in nearly every series. While it was initially harder for me to be drawn into these characters at first viewing for whatever the reasons, this series demands that I BUY it and give it a second to even a fifth look to capture all the subtle nuances that a series like this can provide. The CGI was completely undetectable from my unusually picky eyes as well. Hands down, this is the best you can get if this is the type of series you enjoy and would make a fantastic Fathers Day gift - hope your reading this hon!;)

B000BB14YY|4.0|If there is one word I would use to describe \\"Ran\\", it would be 'UNFORGETTABLE'.  I shall do my best to describe what a powerful impact this film had on me, but as with some of the true classics in cinema, such efforts can be futile.<br /><br />\\"Ran\\", directed by Akira Kurosawa, is a faithful but reimagined telling of Shakespeare's 'King Lear', using feudal Japan as the backdrop.  Before I begin, I will give you a brief character list, since I personally have a tendency to confuse foreign-language names when I read reviews:<br /><br />Lord Hidetora Ichiimonji --- The warlord who intends to give up his power<br /><br />The Three Sons:<br />Taro --- oldest, married to Lady Kaede<br />Jiro --- the middle<br />Saburo --- the youngest, most loyal and loving of his father<br /><br />Lady Kaede --- married to Taro, her family & lands were conquered by Hidetora<br /><br />The opening shots of the beautiful mountains leave the viewer uneasy as the brooding music plays over the credits.  Our tension is justified, because we suddenly see Lord Hidetora aim his bow at a hunted boar.  His fierce gaze is as intimidating as his precise aim.<br /><br />The story begins with Lord Hidetora (played by Kurosawa regular Tatsuya Nakadai) announcing to his family & court that he will divide his kingdom among his three sons.  Saburo (the youngest) objects, because he believes that the division will lead to jealously and corruption, possibly war.  But Hidetora knows no compromise, and bans his youngest from his lands.<br /><br />It turns out that Saburo was right, as older sons Taro & Jiro begin to plot against each other for the lands.  Meanwhile, Hidetora begins to go mad.  He has turned away his most loving son.  The sons he chose to reward have abandoned him.  He is too proud to acknowledge his errors.  His jester fails to amuse him during his sorrows.  And when the ensuing battles leave Hidetora's castles in ruins, he descends into madness while wandering the lands he conquered.  The destruction only deepens his descent.<br /><br />Sadly, only through more bloodshed and chaos do the lessons and appreciation of life come to the men who survive the story.  Only when that which matters most is lost, does life seem precious.<br /><br />I can't really say if \\"Ran\\" is well-cast, because I don't speak Japanese, and I also understand that Kurosawa's dramatic style tends to overexaggerate the dialogue and emotions.  In other words, Kurosawa's dramas love to have the characters use grand gestures when a simple facial expression would suffice.  However, I think anyone will agree that Tatsuya Nakadai deserves high compliments for his lead role.  His body language does the story a great service as he aimlessly wanders his ruined country.  His face is weary from battle, and is in a constant trance for most of the picture.<br /><br />Mieko Harada gives a fascinating performance as Lady Kaede, the woman who has been wronged by the Ichiimonji clan, and yet is bound to them through marriage.  In Kurosawa's interpretation of 'King Lear', Kaede is closer to Lady Macbeth.  Her role is to be loyal to Taro, but yet she possesses the power, confidence, and manipulative presence he lacks.  Kurosawa's films don't often have strong female roles, but Lady Kaede is easily one of the best.<br /><br />As powerful as \\"Ran\\" was for me, I can't say it's perfect.  I've long admired Kurosawa's work, but \\"Ran\\" has scenes that go on for way too long.  There are many scenes where characters just sit and talk, with very little movement.  This wouldn't be a problem if the camera had more closeups or cuts, but instead some viewers may become restless during some conversations.  The opening banishment of Saburo is one of the toughest to sit through.<br /><br />In fairness, the unmoving distanced camera fits the story of \\"Ran\\".  As I learned from Stephen Prince's DVD commentary track, the distanced camera is to imply how the gods of the earth have abandoned the corrupt creatures who inhabitit.  I guess the best way to sum this complaint of mine is that Kurosawa's direction fits thematically, but occasionally falters theatrically.<br /><br />Sometimes Kurosawa demands that we go to his pictures, rather than have them come to us.  But when the dark, deceptive web of \\"Ran\\" gets spun, it tangles you up and rarely lets go.  As these characters plot to control the lands, it becomes a gripping story of despair.  There isn't a ton of violence in \\"Ran\\", but when it's there, it hits you hard.  There is an unforgettable sequence where Hidetora's Castle is raided and burned.  It concludes with a mournful music score and no sound effects, and I promise if for nothing else you won't forget it.<br /><br />My appreciation for \\"Ran\\" has been cemented by its unforgettable ending.  Simply put, in the hundreds of movies I've watched in lifetime, I don't think one has haunted me and impacted me as much as \\"Ran\\" has.  I refuse to give it away.  If you are patient and willing to descend into this desparate tale, then you will have earned the privilege to see the tragic ending under the blood-red skies.<br /><br />\\"Ran\\" is not a perfect film, but it is exactly the way Akira Kurosawa intended it to be.  Every single camera shot & scene --- for better or worse --- fits the dramatic flow of the story.  I warn you that this film requires YOU to enter IT, and not the other way around.  It will not be fed to you the way you expect.  But then again, great art requires our horizons to be challenged.  Once you break the boundaries that American movies have cemented in our minds, you experience a sensation that no other film can provide.<br /><br />\\"Ran\\" is a one-of-a-kind experience.  Go to it.  It will not come to you.<br /><br />DVD NOTES<br />---I've read countless reviews that this 2-disc set is the only way to experience \\"Ran\\".  I haven't seen the other releases, such as the Masterworks disc or the Blu-Ray set.  However, I can vouch for this Criterion set's superb quality.  Thevideo colorfully & richly maintains the cinematographers' work.  I'm no sound expert, but I could hear everything from the most intimate conversations to the most hushed sounds of nature.<br /><br />The great rewards are in the bonus features.  Stephen Prince's commentary was probably my favorite of his tracks for Kurosawa DVDs.  Sidney Lumet gives a great introduction on Disc 1, pretty much summarizing how Kurosawa impacted him, and what \\"Ran\\" is probably about at its core.  Finally, Disc 2 has a 75-minute documentary detailing how \\"Ran\\" came into production.  Like the other Kurosawa featurettes in the Criterion Collection, this one is a great watch.
B003EYVXYG|2.0|I am really a big Romero fan as well as a zombie genre fan, so I don't want to come across as a hater.  This movie isn't good.  I really wanted to like it, but it is just plain bad.  The script is full of Romero's usual social statements which is fine, but the hack dialog was excruciating.  The story was just bad as well.  It involved the renegade national guardsmen from Diary finding their way to an island off the coast of Delaware which has two Irish clans fighting each other over what to do with the dead.  Strangely, only a handful of people spoke with Irish accents, the rest didn't even bother.  What hurts the movie is the contradictions throughout.  One minute the guardsmen say money is worthless, then they are fighting over a million dollars.  One of the clans wants to keep the zombies(dead heads in the movie) alive, but later on are shooting them left and right.  Also parts of the movie act like the world is completely lawless after 6 days of the dead rising, while other parts have internet and television still being broadcast.  I can go on and on.  The zombie makeup is fair, but sometimes is looks too much like makeup.  The acting runs from fair to poor.  The CGI is terrible and really fake looking.  The trailers showing the flaming zombie or the fire extinguisher death are good examples of how bad the special effects are.  Zombie fans will certainly rent this because of Romero's name, but I would advise to watch it before you buy it.

1400032717|5.0|First off, I have to say that nowhere in the text of this book does it ever say what Christopher's diagnosis is. It never says Asperger's, and the only place the word \\"autism\\" appears is in the blurb on the jacket (and in the suggested subject headings). This book is fiction, and Christopher is a fictional character, not meant to be the totally realistic representative of every single person with a certain neurotype.    I was profoundly moved by this book. I thought it was a fascinating and touching portrayal of the inner workings of a mind so different from mine that I would never otherwise be able to see in. Yes, Christopher was kind of horrible and so were both of his parents, even though both of his parents really loved him, and I do believe he loved them, in his own way. But I thought, more than anything, that this was a book that could teach us a lot about having tolerance for people who are different. This sounds like a platitude unless you're different, in which case you get what I am saying.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This DVD will kick your butt! But its really annoying to listen to over and over again - the music is horrible. Ah well. You cant have it all.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|This album is so RIDICULOUS. It is simply not believable that this album was penned by a human being. Slayer must have cut blood at the cross roads. There is no other explanation. I have played this album at least a thousand times and am still in awe every time. I can't believe the authors of Hell Awaits jumped to this level lyrically and musically without the hand of Satan involved or some other lunatic deity. However, since I'm an atheist, I can only conclude that Slayer is indeed collectively at the genius level of thrash. The IQ required for this album must be around 180, 185; or as high as 400, which of course would explain a lot.<br /><br />For anyone who has listened to this and did not conclude the same, you simply did not listen. The utilization of \\"atonal chromaticism\\" ([...]) is so amazing. The sound of this album transforms it into something four dimensional. It is a busy album, preventing a complete appreciation the first six hundred sixty five times it is listened to. I can see why Slayer fans are rabid fanatics (see [...]).<br /><br />The opening, Angel of Death, starts with an aggressive guitar attack and before your brain can finish processing what just happened, Slayer launch into Piece by Piece with Dave Lombardo's double bass drum from Angel of Death still bouncing around your cortex. Piece by Piece is near its end when you realize this is really the second song already and your brain, which has been put into a coma by so much crap music from the radio station, begins to get stimulated for the first time. What you've just felt is a jump in your IQ. The launch into Necrophobic blows your brain away, forcing it to contract and retreat like your eyes thrust into bright sunshine when it's been midnight for so long. Altar of Sacrifice starts and you've barely enough time to figure out it's a new song and you start sensing evil resident within the music, awakening your own demon. Altar of Sacrifice concludes and you read that Jesus Saves is next so youtrick yourself into thinking the music is going to slow down and at first Hanneman gives the illusion that Slayer is mortal after all until King, Hanneman, and Araya start up the pummeling machine and you try your best to keep up with the guitar solos and Araya's commanding lecture about religion. Your granted another breather when Criminally Insane starts and Lombardo injects some interesting percussion into your frontal lobe as the time warp starts again and you've become the victim again of Araya's terrifying anecdotal evidence of the certain demise of mankind as the guitar duo's assault resonates across your synapses like a tectonic shuffle at lunatic speed.<br /><br />Reborn brings to reality your stunned mind's conviction that the horror and metal are relentless and black and only getting darker, and you really are beginning to feel ripped and torn. Epidemic then suddenly crashes in on your brain courtesy of Dave Lombardo and Araya's dark intonations are a preamble to the death of mankind. But this scene seems all to real and possible. The guitar solos are short be complementary to the rhythm.<br /><br />When Postmortem starts you feel the impending doom and know right away that an epic song has just started. The culmination of insanity has been captured in this song and queries you with raw honesty querying whether you want to die. The question might scare you given the context as you get delivered to you a blast of sheer lunacy in musicianship and lyrics. Raining blood follows the sinister segue where you are sure you heard recordings of souls in hell wailing their anguish. The devil begins speaking to you through King and Hanneman in Raining in Blood as he unveils to you a picture of hell and what awaits you. The conclusion of this song is a shock back to reality and you can't believe you just spent four hours in hell. Then you look at the clock and wonder how so much content could be compressed into less than thirty minutes. So you listen again, falling victim to Satan again.
B000001EJ8|4.0|Vangelis is an inovator in electronic music, maybe best known for his highly rated Chariots Of Fire film soundtrack from 1981.  The timeless Titles is in this collection.   Having said that I really enjoy the collaborations with Jon Anderson of Yes fame.  The best being So Long Ago, So Clear, I Hear You Now and to top them all, I'll Find My way Home.  The remainder I do not listern to as often, overall a good compilation lasting 75 minutes.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|I saw this first in the movies.  Lots of facts and typical Michael Moore style point of view.  I recommend this documentary because he fills us with information that we need to know.  I would like an update from Mr. Moore with regard to what's going on today as opposed to when this first came out.  I refer to the doc. all the time,  It gave me a different perspective on the success of Capitalism.

B003ELOQCK|4.0|The U2 extravaganza we know as 360 live at the Rose Bowl documents the bands latest and biggest production yet which will still be trotting around the world this year. I was fortunate to catch this show in LA and and the one 2 nights prior in Las Vegas at the Sam Boyd Stadium. Looking back now the Vegas show was just a dress rehearsal for LA. The setlist was identical which is unfortunate which tells me as the biggest Rock and Roll band in the world they like to \\"play it safe\\" and create the illusion that that night was special and unique. If you like your Rock shows presented to you with perfection then shows like U2, Rush and Kiss is your cup of tea. If you wanted to see a rock show where the music is center stage go see The White Stripes, Prince or The Black Crowes where setlists if there is one differs night after night. I personally take the big production shows for what they are at face value. U2 at a time did let the music dictate and be the center piece of their shows and if it worked it worked. Take example their live aid performance in 85' They were meant to play 3 songs that day \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" \\"Bad\\" and \\"Pride\\" but they only got to do 2 songs Sunday and Bad. They got lost in the music and Pride wasn't performed. They didn't need all the gadgets -they had passion and its hard to get that with a rehearsed show. There are shows like Rush where it works they are probably the only exception in my opinion, with U2 seeing both forms - they do work better when they play off the fly- they are more exciting to watch as performers. Now that being said, at the vegas show I was in the front pit and in LA I was in nosebleed seats. Having experiencing the same show in 2 different outlooks. The show makes more sense in the nosebleed seats as a whole - the lights, the visuals it was more enjoyable, so with that in mind the home dvd will be great viewing. Being in the front didn't matter - the band 80 percent of the time were roaming the ramps playing to the rest of the stadium except Adam and Larry who you couldn't see at all. The front pit was created so it could have a club vibe with the band -standing room only without the pushing shoving and being crushed. personally it didn't work for me for the band was hardly visible and you couldn't see the visuals. The sound was way better in the nosebleed seats. The show was designed more for the people in the nosebleed seats. I give credit to U2 for coming up with ways to make a stadium very intimate. As far as track listing one thing i can say about U2 is that they play almost all their new material. They don't have to depend on their hits to make their shows work. They also throw in other than hits deep cuts from their old albums \\"In a little while\\" \\"Ultraviolet\\" \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" fans like myself like to hear the new material and songs that aren't as popular. U2 is great in the balancing act of giving hard core fans and just regular radio listeners what they need.
0767802659|5.0|One of my best sci fi movies i've seen to date. Made 13 years ago still had some of the best CGI compared to a lot of movies now i.e Starship troopers 3. Why are people rating this one star, aw cause it wasn't made like the damn BOOK, so what, not all movies have to be made like from a damn novel, get ovr it!. Poor acting..etc?? you people are nuts, you clearly haven't seen starship troopers 3 then >.> ST2 and ST3 are basicly low budget flings from the first movie with cheesy acting, they never should have made them. Myself thought the acting/dialog ..etc was excellent, lots of action, gore, nudity, tone, music and the storyline keeped me wanting more, i can't beleive titanic beat this awsome sci fi movie, ST1 should have got the award!
B00000J2SS|4.0|Finyl Vinyl is a collection of live performances from the band Rainbow founded by former Deep Purple guitarists Ritchie Blackmore. There were 3 line-ups with 3 lead vocalists (Ronnie James Dio, Graham Bonnet & Joe Lynn Turner) all represented in this compilation. The album chronicles the songs that were FM staples along with previously unreleased b-sides. Rainbow managed to blend virtuoso musicianship with pop radio friendly polished production without losing its integrity thanks to guitarists Ritchie Blackmore. The highpoint of this album is a live version of \\"Difficult to Cure\\" the instrumental homage to Beethoven's 9th with orchestra accompaniment. Difficult to cure wasn't a radio song when released but it does showcase the bands musicianship as it breaks the mold from the track listing that mainly consists of live performances of all their hits \\"Stone Cold\\" \\"All night Long\\" Street of dreams\\"...etc. This piece itself is worthy of purchasing this album. Ritchie's technical and soulful mix of guitar bombast is underated although he has penned many hits. To hear more of the extended live improvised Rainbow, purchase \\"On Stage\\" with Ronnie Dio on vocals. The songs on Finyl vinyl the band merely plays the songs as they are presented from the studio versions.

1400052173|5.0|This was a required text for my Ethical, Legal, & Policy issues in Advanced Nursing Practice. I am so glad it was.   In undergrad nursing school you heard about HeLa cells in microbiology and in other courses, but you never knew more than just the name and uses.  The story behind the cells is not only fascinating but heart wrenching and infuriating.   As a woman, a southerner, and a medical professional, my heart goes out to the Lacks family.   This book was well researched, well written, and I hope they make this into a documentary.   Read this book if you are in the medical field. Read this book even if you aren't in the medical field.   Either way, just read this book.
B001FB5634|5.0|I just finished watching, a film that should be ranked as highly as the Pulitzer Prize winning book on which it was based. I read the Cormac Mccarthy book which touched me as deeply as any book ever has. I am raising my Grandson and a few months back had to deal some serious health problems that had the potential to dramatically shorten my time with him and my Wife. When I came back from the hospital I read the book. All Fathers should read this book. The love of a Father for his Son has never been written about with such emotional depth. In the film Viggo Mortenson gives a performance beyond anything I've seen on film (I watch a lot of movies) in many years. Kodi Smit-Mcphee (The Son) also does an excellent job. The movie, like the book, is a work of great art.        In a destroyed world, a small but brilliant light shines in the darkness. This light is the love of a Father for his Son and a son's love for his Dad. The darkness cannot conquer it.    James A Baker (Opelika, AL)

Don't be afraid to buy this one!

0545123275|4.0|I have heard such great reviews about this book so I couldn't wait to get the chance and time to read it.  It was very engaging and I could see where Twilight fans would enjoy reading this one.  It has the same obsessed-love feel. (which I have to say I usually, and in this case do, enjoy).    The only thing I had a problem with was that the obsession seemed to come so quickly.  I know that Sam and Grace had  been watching each other and \\"falling in love\\" while Sam was in werewolf form, but it just seemed to quick to me.  And it seemed that Grace went from not knowing werewolves existed to having Sam sleeping in her bed in human form in no time at all.  That part was a little too neat and tidy for me.    But other than that, I enjoyed it.  I could easily see it being played out as a movie and I could see it being a hit.  And I'm glad I have the next book, Linger, in my hands to read right away!

0545140315|5.0|The Beatles were the ones to say \\"love is all you need,\\" and when I read this book, love was all I had.  I was loving every minute and every page with a passion!  It was fantastic and has officially become one of my 2010 favorites.  Elizabeth Eulberg may be a debut author, but her writing style and The Lonely Hearts Club are magic, no question about it!    Penny Lane doesn't exactly have a normal or what one may consider a typical home and family, but one thing she seems to have in common with just about every girl around is boy trouble, and she's got it in spades.  With The Beatles as her inspiration, she just may have found a solution to all of her problems, and those of her friends.    I really can't find any negatives about this book, other than I wish it hadn't ended, ever!  But in all seriousness, if you ask me, there aren't any negatives about this book, it was wonderful.  It was funny, quirky, realistic and with The Beatles all over it, and all through it, what's not to love?  Even the cover is brilliant, don't you think?    Eulberg has a fresh voice and I don't think she'll be going anywhere anytime soon.  She spoke at the book festival I attended a while back and after meeting her, there's no question that her writing comes from the heart.  Her personality is all over this book.  While speaking to the crowd, she may have mentioned a sequel being in the works for The Lonely Hearts Club in the future, and I couldn't be more excited about that prospect...really I was jumping up and down!    After finishing The Lonely Hearts Club, I most definitely have not had nearly enough of Penny Lane and her club of close friends.  Whether it's Tracy, Diane, Morgan, Rita, Ryan or Penny's parents, I just adored them all and most definitely did not want to say goodbye.  If you've got a sense of humor and are looking to add a new favorite to your shelves, look no further, The Lonely Hearts Club is the perfect book for everyone!

B00005JM20|2.0|Let's hope Ms. Imbruglia was well paid for suffering the indignity of playing Agent 99  to Atkinson's Maxwell Smart in this literal cesspool of a movie. Wasting a starlet this photogenic on a prepubescent knockoff of Austin Powers should be considered a snickering form of inverse sexual harassment. In fact, I have to wonder whether it wasn't this stinker that set off the listless downward spiral of her once-promising career.     After the spectacular breakout of Imbruglia's \\"Torn\\" music video in 1997, her follow-up releases failed to measure up to her initial success. And as her big-screen debut in Johnny English inspired little more than catcalls from movie critics, Imbruglia took refuge in a five-year spokesmodel contract with L'Oreal. After a long absence from music, her 2009 come-back album subsequently vanished without comment. Currently, Imbruglia has found a comfortable gig in the Paula Abdul role in Australia's \\"The X Factor\\" knockoff of American Idol.    Perhaps the most humiliating turn of events, however, has been the fate of Imbruglia's \\"Torn\\" video on YouTube. While the original version has garnered over 2.2 million views, it was recently edged out in popularity by the bedroom karaoke performance of fresh-faced amateur vocalist, Marie Digby. Pity poor Ms. Imbruglia, a has-been at the awkward age of 35.
B00007AJF8|3.0|Certainly Being John Malkovich's concept is incomparable to most, if not, all films. It explores the themes of identity--and lack thereof--in every day people, and their inner desires. While the film's concept is highly unique and novel, it isn't enough to make up for the direction the film takes after its initial surprise. The film's second half, in particular, steers away from its own creativity and into mediocrity, with unmemorable characters and a simplistically cynical plot. In the end, this is a film that is watchable at times, but also unappealing and unlikable.     It wasn't the nonsensical aspect of this film that put me off; it was the direction it takes after about thirty minutes or so. Clearly, there is inventiveness at the beginning. John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a puppeteer, aimless in life with an unfulfilling marriage and an inability to find a puppeteering job (imagine that). Taking a job at an office, he apparently has found a dimension into the mind of John Malkovich, a portal where a person can go and literally experience John Malkovich's life for fifteen minutes. He and his female coworker concoct a scheme to charge to go into the portal. Craig tells his wife, Lotte, also of this portal, and she experiences a strange euphoric feeling after going through once. John Malkovich gets wind of the portal, and goes to experience it. At times this film has some fun moments: the scene where John Malkovich goes into his \\"own\\" portal to see what it is like is rather amusing. He sees a line up of eagerly waiting customers. Craig's first entrance into the portal as John Malkovich is comical. However, rather than continuing on with the eccentric concept of \\"being John Malkovich\\", the film's takes a different direction, as the plot's second half veers off into pettiness, with the main characters, in particular Craig's wife, going into the portal with the purpose of fulfilling their sexual desires. Some call this original; I call it selling out.    I know that likable characters don't completely make a movie, but the fact that every character is basically unlikable doesn't help much, either.  John Cusack's character is so weak, and seeing him falling all over himself for some office worker gets old. One watches him and wonders what motivations he possibly has. Cameron Diaz' character is also self-centered, caring only for herself and her desires to be with the other female. The female coworker is also cold and grates on your nerves as the film progresses. The only redeeming character is probably John Malkovich himself, who is at least able to be a good sport about making himself the center of the joke.     I guess it is quirky and different, in a cold, spiritless kind of way. I'd have to say that this film is vastly overrated, and not one I'd want to watch again.

B00005JL96|1.0|Having seen some of the sequels to Lilo and Stitch which were not too bad, I purchased the original assuming it would be even better. Not so. Far too much family stress present in this film, isn't it bad enough that Lilo's mother, as with so many other cartoon characters in young children's films, is dead? Lilo, a really cute character, seems to solve her problems through violence quite a lot in this film. It's not that we expect her to be perfect but seriously, do kids really need this? No they don't. What kind of people write this stuff? Do they have children themselves or any idea of the most basic of studies on child psychology? Something is really wrong with a society that cannot produce films appropriate for young children. Shame on Disney and Hollywood, and the pathetic bunch of hacks who write this garbage.
0446581348|2.0|The information in this book is very basic and doesn't go into much detail at all. It's really for extreme beginners only. For example.. there is a section on how to apply your lip gloss. Who doesn't know how to put on lip gloss? The book touches on several different topics, but does not go in depth with anything. Although I didn't like this book myself, I think it would be an okay book for preteens or early teens who do not anything about makeup or beauty. But honestly.. even if you have read a beauty magazine, you probably already know everything in this book.

0307388921|5.0|Most authors can provide ample evidence of their ability to write by describing for you a city at night, a lone tree on a prairie, or a dog sniffing on a trash can. They can provide ample evidence of their ability to research the topic of their novel with exhaustive narration. There's one particular book I read that just put me to sleep with its detail and its description and its narration. That book, and it's considered a classic of modern fiction, forgot to be entertaining. It forgot to be funny. It forgot to provide a reason to turn the page. There's only so much time some of us have to read, and Chuck Palahniuk more often than not makes the journey through his words worthwhile. For those uninitiated few who have yet to delve into the catalogue, I believe there are three essential reads from Palahniuk: 1) Fight Club. The classic. The movie follows the book closely, but it's still well worth the read. 2) Rant. This book is narrated in an unusual manner, but it's an excellent read. This is the book that I discuss with my friends ad nauseam. 3) Choke. It's a sad venture into the mind of a pathetic man. Another famous author informs wanna be writers that their main characters must have redeemable qualities for their readers. There must be a separation between the good guys and the bad guys, he says. Chuck has made a career out of debunking this advice, and he has done so with proficiency. His catalogue involves hit and misses, but once you read these three hits you will not be able to stop yourself from reading anything and everything that has come from this unusual, sadistic mind.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I bought this for my kindle after seeing it on a top 10 sci-fi list.  Originally I was a bit skeptical but as soon as I started getting into it, I was blown away.  I read this book in one day I was so wrapped up in it.  I highly recommend this to anyone who likes science fiction stories, it has the right mix of action and story to keep you turning the pages.  After getting half way through it I ordered the 2 follow up books that conclude the story of John Perry and Jane Sagan.  I can't recommend this enough.
0393075966|5.0|In this brilliant book, the noted American economist Joseph Stiglitz explores why the crisis happened. Across the world, the crisis destroyed 50 million jobs and thrust 200 million people down into extreme poverty. From December 2007 to October 2009 the US economy lost 8 million jobs and unemployment rose to 10.2 per cent. Only 58.5 per cent of the working age population was in work. 2.3 million Americans lost their homes in 2008 alone. Bank executives' contracts were sacred; workers' wage contracts were negotiable - down.<br /><br />Stiglitz has a chapter called The Great American Robbery. The top 50 hedge and private equity fund managers got an average $588 million each in 2007. Nine US banks, which made record losses of $100 billion, got $175 billion public money, and promptly paid out a record $33 billion in bonuses. As the Chair of one of the House of Representatives' Committees said, \\"the banks run the place ... they give three times more money than the next biggest group.\\" Stiglitz notes that the UK's partial privatisation of pensions shifted 40 per cent of their value out of the pensions and into financiers' fees.<br /><br />The US government, like the British, has lent money to the banks at very low interest rates. Stiglitz asks, \\"Why not use the government's ability to borrow at a low interest rate to provide less expensive credit to homeowners under stress?\\" Banks that are `too big to fail' gain from this access to cheaper capital because lenders know that taxpayers will pick up the losses. So these banks grow at the expense of their smaller rivals.<br /><br />Public money went to the big banks, which didn't lend to small and medium businesses, but kept the money for themselves, in bonuses and dividends. Early in 2009, Hank Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury, ex-Goldman Sachs, gave AIG $180 billion, which then gave Goldman Sachs $13 billion. By contrast, US aid to Africa in 2008 was $6.5 billion.<br /><br />In the USA, financial firms back the student loans programme, a Public-Private Partnership in which the taxpayer bears the risk and private firms get the gains. The US government issues the loans, so there is no risk of non-payment, but the lenders still charge interest rates as if there were such a risk. Thus the US government gave the private sector $80 billion of taxpayers' money over the last ten years, because using private firms cost that much more than if the government had lent the money itself.<br /><br />Stiglitz shows that markets are not efficient and self-correcting; they do not allocate resources efficiently, especially not to innovation; and they redistribute wealth (from the poor to the rich), they do not create it.

B001DHXT20|4.0|XXXXX<br /><br />Another Hulk movie you say?  You're probably wondering if this movie is similar to Ang Lee's 2003 movie \\"Hulk.\\"  Surprisingly, it's not.  It's better!  How can this be?  Oh, it be!<br /><br />This movie is not a sequel to 2003's \\"Hulk\\" but rather is a reinvention that establishes a new back-story where Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton, who rewrote some of the script) becomes the Hulk as a pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate a \\"super soldier\\" program through gamma radiation.  (Why and how Banner becomes the Hulk is established in the movie's opening credits.)<br /><br />On the run, Banner attempts to cure himself of the Hulk before he's captured by General Thaddeus \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross (William Hurt).  The General's worst fears are realized when power-hungry soldier (Tim Roth) becomes a similar but more Hulk-like creature (called the \\"Abomination\\").<br /><br />This movie has it all: action, drama, humour, (dare I say) incredible special effects, and good acting (with one exception).<br /><br />I missed Jennifer Connelly who played Dr. Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Ross in the 2003 movie.  Here she's replaced by Liv Tyler who's rather bland.<br /><br />The CGI creation of the Hulk was quite good.  This movie did not over rely on special effects but let the actors do their jobs.  It was only at the end where (as you can probably guess) there's a confrontation between the Hulk and the Abomination that the movie becomes cartoon-like.<br /><br />Be sure to look for a few cameo appearances.  Do not miss, especially, Lou Ferrigno (who played the Hulk in the late 1970's television series).  He voiced the words said by the CGI Hulk in this movie.  (Lou...what a guy!!)<br /><br />I also liked the \\"Days without Incident\\" meter.  I thought this was a nice touch.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2008) has good picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a surprisingly entertaining Hulk movie.  Be sure to watch it to discover why you shouldn't get Bruce Banner mad.  (You wouldn't like him when he's mad.)<br /><br />(2008;  1 hr, 50 min;  wide screen;  20 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXto discover why you shouldn't get Bruce Banner mad.

B002GU5V24|4.0|Let's get this out of the way- yes, the bonus materials (interviews, etc) are non-existent. Given the amount of stuff we got with the previous box sets and the price point we should have gotten more instead of being \\"forced\\" to get the video box set. It also would have been nice to have gotten something, anything, from the short-lived Calling All Stations tour.<br /><br />That said, What we do have is another excellent re-mixing and remastering job by Nick Davis, who's obviously taken a great deal of care over the past couple years to make the entire catalog shine. The bonus live show from the Selling England By The Pound era is especially good and almost makes up for the lack of other bonus material. The only thing taking away from the disc is it sounds like Peter Gabriel re-recorded some vocals like on the Archive Volume 1 set. There's a big difference in his voice between then and now and it's noticeable enough to take you out of the moment.<br /><br />Bottom line- not a must buy for everyone but essential for fans.
0446563048|5.0|Delivering Happiness - A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose, a book by Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos.com launched today.    Delivering Happiness - A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose is a book about how Tony Hsieh decided to get involved in Internet companies and how he discovered what his passion was.    Since Hsieh was a child, he knew that he wanted to be involved in the world of business, starting a worm business, which later failed, and then moving on to a button business, which he advertised in a magazine. Both of these businesses were started when he was only a child.    Once Hsieh got older, attended college and while he was at college, bought pizzas and sold them on campus in order to make money.    After college, Hsieh and a classmate were offered jobs as software engineers at Oracle and while working at Oracle, Hsieh co-founded LinkExchange, a company which enabled people to advertise their websites on other websites.    Eventually, LinkExchange was purchased by Microsoft and then Tony decided to become an investor, creating an investment firm called Venture Frogs, which is how he discovered a website who's creator wanted to call ShoeSite. This is the website that eventually became Zappos.    Eventually, Tony Hsieh became the CEO of Zappos.com in 2000.    Zappos has since grown into a website where people can buy shoes, accessories, as well as other items.    Zappos also has great customer service, as that is one of the principles that the company is based on.    I would recommend this book to entrepreneurs, people who are thinking of starting a business, or anyone that is interested in the Internet and technology, as well as those who simply want to read a good book.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I received the package as promised and enjoyed viewing the movie.  I originally saw it in 3D, but it is great in 2D too.
0142410314|5.0|My very favorite Roald Dahl book.  Wonderfully imaginative and fun to read.  For kids and adults alike!
B00080ZG10|5.0|Many times the \\"Special Features\\" disks are only slightly to moderately interesting. This is the first film feature version that I have found the \\"Features\\" disk to be worthwhile. It held me spellbound. Every aspect of the special features (found listed elsewhere) were extremely interesting, accurate as to aviation aspects and even the discussion of medical aspects (maybe more so to other physicians). Every aspect such as the set designs, costumes and special effects to enhance the visual impressions held my interest. Documentaries from other media added greatly to the completeness of the Howard Hughes bibliography. For example, the aerospace developments which derived from innovations pioneered by the largely non-formally schooled engineer, inventor and innovator, Howard Hughes. The scene listings do not do complete justice to describing the content of what you will find there. I found it a completely captivating feature film in its own right. A *Must See* presentation.
1416955070|2.0|I actually couldn't wait to finish this book. I had starting reading it quite some time ago, I am the type of person who has to finish something before i start something else. So I sat down and finished it rather quickly, but not quick enough.<br />The characters are completely unlikeable, all of them. I have no emotion about any of them one way or another. Jace was quite honestly, a jerk throughout the entire book, but then again they all were. Rarely did anyone speak to each other in a tone or way that would convey they are even friends. Clary was the same way Jace was, never a kind word spoken. Isabelle and Alec, they were just there as filler characters. The only character that I felt any emotion for or even liked was Luke/Lucian. He was the only remotely interesting character, and was barely in the book until the ending. I won't even mention the \\"shocking\\" part about the characters because it's just dumb and unnecessary.<br />The storyline actually wasn't that bad though. Interesting and intricate, however nothing was ever accomplished. Our \\"heroes\\" (and i use that term lightly as its difficult to see these characters are heroes) are after the mortal cup to prevent the villan from using it to start an army of his own. Well they never get their hands on the cup and decide in the end to leave it up to The Clave. My question......Why didn't they leave it up to the Clave to begin with?<br />This book has very little to do with Vampires, Werewolves etc. They were just a side story to give shadowhunters a purpose.<br />This of course, is all just my opinion. From the other reviews on here, many people really enjoyed this book. I don't think I will be picking up the other books in the series, just nothing for me here.
B0036BDPOI|1.0|Like many others have said, Cowboys From Hell has some skipping issues.  My copy skips horrendously during Medicine Man.  What a let down.  I definitely expected more for $24.

B001FES0IE|3.0|The three stars are for the bad pressing on I received, otherwise this great album deserves 5 stars through and through.  My copy skips during the end of \\"Sweet Lady\\" (the best song on the album) which is very annoying.  I'm not sure if all pressings are like this but beware when buying this gem on vinyl.
B003AO1SVS|1.0|What a let down; all the press these dudes receive and I buy the new CD only to hear...crap.  Yeah, my expectations were high, but apparently not as high as the 2 that made this album.<br /><br />Let's have a time period where no more \\"duos\\" are allowed to exist, keep it at a trio minimum, ok? I thought lo fi recordings went out w/the Misfits and the rest of those Caroline bands; how wrong I was.
B000002MG0|2.0|The poor review is for the bad pressing of this album, not the music itself.  My copy sounded warped during Man on the Moon and Nightswimming, two great songs on this album.  Returned it for a full refund.  Do I dare buy it again and try my luck?
B000NU2CY4|1.0|For the Gladiator Blu-Ray Sapphire Series  - got this unknowingly at the store, thinking it would be a vast improvement over my regular DVD and what a HUGE disappointment it was! I'm getting rid of it immediately - smudging was unbelieveably bad and quality overall was terrible. I can't believe anyone would release this as is and think it was a good idea. Thankfully I got on sale, wish I had checked though beforehand. Anyone who loves this movie definitely should stick with their regular DVD format until a better blu-ray comes along. Totally disgusted with this version!

0385491026|5.0|Cat's Eye is one of my favorite novels and it still resonates with me today as much as it did when I first read it. First and foremost, Margaret Atwood is an incredible writer. Her deft handling of and the richness found in her descriptions and narrative is exquisite. Cat's Eye is more than a novel about girl bullies - it transcends that simple description. It is about Elaine, an adult woman, taking an introspective look at her life and the impact her childhood played in her development as well as her feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. But Cat's Eye also covers these same feelings as experienced by Elaine as an adult. Cat's Eye is still one of my favorites. Very Highly Recommended
B002ECN4P0|4.0|Good CD, but wish it had \\"You Can't Always Get Wht You Want\\" on it
0316096199|5.0|Sebold's memoir, Lucky, is an incredible book. It is also a blunt, honest book, graphically detailing her brutally violent rape as an 18 yr old young woman and the subsequent trial. It is not for the faint of heart. Also, since this is a memoir, events, encounters, and the conclusion aren't all as neat and tidy as one would find in a novel, but real life can be complicated and messy. Sebold begins Lucky with a detailed account of  her rape when she was a freshman at Syracuse University, which is difficult to read, but essential to understanding the aftermath it caused in her personal relationships and her struggle for justice and recovery. Some reviewers have criticized Sebold for being self absorbed, but I didn't find Lucky to be any more self absorbed than any other memoir -after all, it is an account from her perspective. Sebold is an excellent writer and her story needed to be told. Young women need to know this: Rape is a reality; they need to be aware of their surroundings at all times. I am a few years older than Sebold, but I too, remember a girl who was raped on campus during my freshman year of college. I understood exactly what Sebold meant when the \\"news\\" spread and she became known as the girl who was raped. Even today there are alerts on campuses across the country about a rapist in the area. Knowledge can be power. Very Highly Recommended
B0007P0LPC|5.0|Having seen their video of Romeo and Juliet, we purchased the Swan Lake with Nureyev and Fonteyn. We were entranced by the performances. Fonteyn was amazingly sensitive to her roles and did the vulnerable tenderness of Odette and the contrasting cold, hardness of Odile with the perfection of her art as Prima Ballerina Assoluta of her time. Nureyev is passionate and powerful in his role and the energy between the two is captivating.    Nureyev's choreography is alive, refreshing and a joy to behold and brought to perfection in this ballet.   This is a must for the libraries of anyone who is truly appreciative of the art of the dance.
1400064627|5.0|In a heartwarming, endearing style, Flagg not only captures a feeling of warm, Southern hospitality through her characters, she also manages to touch on some hot issues, but does this with such grace and charm that few could take offense. The story is set in two time frames. The earlier story begins in the 1920's while the present day story starts in 1985. The story set in the past is slowly revealed and developed throughout the whole book, and partly through Mrs. Threadgoode's stories. Evelyn Couch's friendship with Mrs. Threadgoode and listening to her reminisce/tell stories about her past, helps present day Evelyn, as she struggles with her self worth. I didn't have any trouble following the various storylines and time frames. Dates are clearly given at the beginning of each new section. (I hesitate to say chapters because some sections are one page.) Stories in both time frames are equally engaging.  The characters are well developed and memorable; the dialogue is easy to follow. Very Highly Recommended
B002M9WW30|5.0|The Rocky series is my favorite series of movies hands down. I know they are cliche and campy but I just adore them. This transfer is one of the best I've seen IMO. Now don't expect to watch Rocky I-V and it look as good as the Avatar blu ray because it just won't. But they are great transfers and the sound that is picked up on them that I've never heard before watching the old DVD releases is just amazing. If you like Rocky and are a fan of HD then you owe it to yourself to get this. The packaging looks great as well.<br /><br />..And enough about the price drop. Seriously. If you want to complain, blog about it. Create a discussion on this product. Don't rate the product poorly because YOU paid too much.

B001AVCFK6|4.0|This is the new JJ Abrams film which serves as an introduction to the crew which featured on the long running TV series. This is a prequel to the Star Trek series but should also find favor with new fans or the types who are clueless about Star Trek.<br />JJ Abrams helms the directorial duties and we are introduced to the crew quickly, so we have James T Kirk (Chris Pine) a directionless youth who is goaded to enlist and in order to honor the memories of his brave father. He quickly gets in to problems namely with a certain commander who himself had a problematic childhood, named Spock. Their problems are relegated to the background when they have to answer an emergency call from Vulcan. So they fly there to prevent the genocide by a Romulan (Eric Bana). The crew comprises of faces that should be familiar to every trekkie, and they include McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin) in a great Russian accent, and Scottie (Simon Pegg).<br />Also included are appearances by Leonard Nimoy who played Spock on the original series. I wonder why they could not find a story arc for the appearance of William Shatner as the original James T Kirk. However fans will cherish the final two minutes and the computer voice of Rodenberry. I loved the movie even though I have not been a Trek devotee but loved the few episodes that I had watched. Watching this was a nostalgia trip...Three and a half stars. 6/8/10
B0021L8V1G|3.0|After proclaiming to the world that he indeed is the Iron Man, Tony Stark must find a cure to prevent his death which could be due to the heart that he has installed in him. The second problem that he is faced with  is in the form of  certain Russian science wacko, Ivan Vanko ( Mickey Rourke ) colluding with a ratty Sam Rockwell, then there are the usual chemical attractions with his assistant ( Pepper Potts) Gwyneth Paltrow. Scarlett Johansson, along with Don Cheadle and Samuel Jackson trying to get him to join Avengers ( new movie) keep things afloat.<br />The first hour was great and the action fast paced to keep things interesting, some have claimed that they found the first half was boring. I thought it could have been more engaging than the first one especially if the goal is to make the sequel better than the original and not just make pots of money trading on the past glories. I found it simply okay.....Three stars...6/8/10
0062009540|3.0|If you haven't been living under a rock and you have been living in the United States, then I'm sure you have heard that the wonderful (eep, or not) ABC Family is turning the Pretty Little Liars series into a teen drama television series. Teen drama: it's what they're good at. I knew I had to give this book a go before the series airs on June 8. I always hate watching a television show/movie before I have read the book. I feel like I'm not fully informed. I mean, what if they change something? Then I will have no idea what the true fans are griping about. I hate to be out of loop. I quickly hopped over to my library and put this little baby on hold, seeing as how all the copies were snagged. No surprise there.<br /><br />One fateful day Hanna, Aria, Spencer, and Emily met Alison at a volunteering event. Every since their lives have never been the same. They quickly became best friends and ruled the school with their envious inside jokes and slumber parties. But that all changes the summer Alison disappears. One minute they are laughing, and the next she has just vanished from the party. The girls who are left behind try to put Alison, and that night, out of their memory. And they almost succeed. Almost. Fast forward to their junior year of high school, and the girls have found that without Alison they have drifted apart. Alison, and their shared secret known only as The Jenna Thing, tied them together. Now that string has all but disintegrated. But the girls still have secrets of their own, secrets they are holding onto from the past that only Alison knew and new terrible secrets. Hanna is spinning out of control in her quest to stay skinny and popular. Aria has hidden a secret for her father for many years. Now that secret is repeating history in her life, with her teacher. Spencer has fallen for her sister's boyfriend. Emily has fallen for another girl, although she is scared to admit it to herself. When a mysterious person known only as A starts texting them, will these secrets they have tried so hard to conceal be revealed?<br /><br />The premise of Pretty Little Liars recalled to my mind such books like Gossip Girl, The Clique, and Private. It's the reason I picked it up. It's also the reason I couldn't score it much higher than a six. Say what you will ye who only read high quality books, but I love the Gossip Girls of the world. They are super fun to read. However, I feel like Pretty Little Liars did not bring anything new to this category. A group of best friends with a dominating leader is found in the Clique; unhealthy friend dynamics in every single one of those books; someone returning with a Big Secret in Gossip Girl; extremely dangerous secrets abound in Private, let me tell you. Even the premise of a person revealing secrets through technology is the whole basis of Gossip Girl. \\"And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell.\\" I did enjoy Pretty Little Liars, but it didn't give me the feelings like when I first read Private or The Clique. Maybe my reading tastes have matured since then.<br /><br />My favorite chapters to read were the ones about Aria and Emily. For some reason I felt they were quite different to read about. The dominating perfectionist that was Spencer has been done far too many times before. These girls go to a top notch school; of course one girl will be a overachiever who is on every committee and sports team. That's to be expected. Even the whole schtick of her falling for her sister's boyfriend, which I honestly didn't see as too bad, has been done before. So what, little sisters always have crushes on their older siblings' boyfriends or friends? It didn't feel as big as secret as the other secrets. The same could be said for Hanna. She used to be the chubbier and dorkier of the group when everyone was friends with Alison, but suddenly she became gorgeous and popular. She is bulimic. She steals. She is insecure. Most teenage girls have insecurities, and it seems like in these stories thatthe most beautiful and mean ones are the most insecure. I don't know if that is true, but it seems like the trend. Bulimia: good to create awareness for, but lately I find if it's not portrayed as gritty as Wintergirls I want to skip through the pages until I arrive somewhere else.<br /><br />But Aria and Emily. Sigh. Now they were fun and different. The book starts off with Aria just returning to States and her home in the Main Line. Her family had been in Iceland since Alison's disappearance. Aria finds that she misses Iceland, with it's more kooky and unique people who got who she was. After Alison's disappearance, Aria had little to no friends and didn't enjoy school. She felt awkward and weird. Now she has blossomed with confidence only to be dragged back to the horrible place she thought she left for good. Upon her return, Aria expects to be alone like before, but imagine her surprise when she finds not only a handsome man but one who has been to Iceland! And on her first day back too. Too bad that man is her new English teacher. Can I just say that I want to be Aria? In no way am I saying I want to date my teacher, but I want to live in Iceland and travel to see plays in France. Aria was by far the most interesting, and I had character envy of that part of her life. Now, when she returns it gets a little weird with her teacher, but even that I felt was interesting to read.<br /><br />Emily is a young girl unsure of her feelings on love. She proclaimed her love once to a girl when she was younger, only to have those feelings lorded over her. She is dating a boy on the swim team because everyone thought they should date. But then she gets a new neighbor, a girl from California, and her feelings roller coaster. My heart went out to Emily so many times during this story. I applaud Pretty Little Liars because I think it was original to involve a coming out story with the whole secret-telling business. With her conservative parents and more than likely conservative school, I felt Emily's anxiety of her secret getting out. More than anyone else, I felt her secret was the worst to get out before she was ready. Throughtout the book, the relationship between Maya and Emily is unsure and rocky. It never becames stable, but it ends on a hopeful note so I'll just have to pick up the next one to see what happens.<br /><br />Worth reading especially because of the television series coming out. But don't expect much more than a guilty pleasure. There were a few deeper elements in the story, but when I say few I mean few. I plan on picking up the next one: to read more about Aria and Emily, to find out who A is (I was tricked through the whole entire book thinking it was the wrong person! You got me Sara Shepard), and to learn more about The Jenna Thing.ean ones are the most insecure. I don't know if that is true, but it seems like the trend.

1423113381|2.0|I absolutely adore the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, also written by Rick Riordan, so I had very high hopes for this book.  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy it as much as I had hoped, and ended up sending it back to the library without finishing it.    The books premise is that a brother and sister, Carter and Sadie, are descended from a long line of Egyptian magicians.  Carter lives with his father, a magician and Egyptologist, and Sadie lives in London with her grandparents.  Sounds great, right?  Wrong.  I was very disappointed by the amount of witchcraft and sorcery in the book. Sadie and Carter learn spells and potions in their magicians training, things that are very reminiscent of Harry Potter, another series that I am not allowed to read, thanks to the amount of witchery.  I enjoyed the Percy Jackson series because Percy is NOT a magician; he is only a son of Posideon and is incapable of casting a spell to save his life.  Why do we need to have such things?  The Red Pyramid would have been just fine without all of the spellcasting, magic, and evil.    I did give the book two stars, mostly for the characters.  Being a homeschooled student myself, I was pleased that Carter Kane, the main character, is homeschooled.  Also, he is biracial, something that is rarely found in a childrens book.  I am also biracial, so I enjoyed this aspect of the book.    Kudos on those two aspects, Mr. Riordan, but please go back to the drawing board with the rest of the book.
B003FMTZOM|5.0|Towards the end of this album, there is an exceptional ballad entitled \\"You Lost Me.\\" When one hears that song, it is a reminder that, whether you love her or hate her, Xtina Aguilera is in a class all by herself.<br /><br />\\"Bionic\\" is truly a detailed work of art, as many of the tracks range from experimental (the stunning \\"Elastic Love\\") to seductive (\\"Desnudate\\"), but many of the tracks end up somewhere in between. The album's lukewarm initial sales can probably be attributed to the performance of the lead single \\"Not Myself Tonight,\\" which is really a departure from the rest of the album. That is the one moment in which Christina does not feel like herself. The rest of Bionic is far more than an amalgam of Lady Gaga, Madonna, and today's other pop stars, as many have suggested.<br /><br />But as good as the album is (there are really no bad tracks on here), there are only two songs with killer hooks that could be smash hits - the exceptional \\"You Lost Me\\" and the pulsating club anthem \\"Prima Donna,\\" the album's best track. Why that was not chosen as the first single, you'd have to ask her record label. \\"Prima Donna\\" sounds like the \\"Stripped\\" era Xtina was beamed light years into the future, a perfect combination of her vocal range, her backup singers, and a thumping beat that you cannot sit still while listening to.<br /><br />The deluxe version also contains the excellent track \\"Monday Morning\\" and the breathtaking stripped down version of \\"I Am.\\" This is an album that may not take hold instantly, but after two or three listens, you just cannot take it out of the CD player. This is by far her best and most cohesive work, but sadly it is probably too experimental for today's dumbed-down pop audience, and a little too \\"glam-tastic\\" for her fan base, which has aged some 11 years since \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" first hit the airwaves. A scaled-back, 12 or so track follow-up album should come sooner than this one did, and she should keep it simple: a few good ballads that showcase her voice and a plethora of soulful dance/club tracks. If she really wants to compete with the likes of Rihanna and Gaga, her tremendous voice is her best means of doing so.d a plethora of soulful dance/club tracks.

0446563048|5.0|\\"My path began on a worm farm.\\"<br /><br />When I read this in the book's introduction, I was hooked. And I continued to be captivated throughout the rest of \\"Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose\\" written by Tony Hsieh, Zappos CEO and successful entrepreneur.<br /><br />Business books aren't usually described as \\"page-turners,\\" but Tony's storytelling style easily engages as he shares his background and early passion for \\"building stuff and being creative and inventive.\\" This is the backdrop for how he got involved with Zappos and how the company built its incredible culture and brand. (I love Tony's description of a brand as a \\"lagging indicator of a company's culture\\" and his in-depth explanation of Zappos' core values.)<br /><br />What surprised me most is that the idea for Zappos - a highly successful online shoe retailer with a unique workplace culture of highly engaged employees who provide legendary customer service (the \\"WOW!\\" factor) - didn't spring fully-formed from the minds of Tony and other key players (Alfred, Nick, Fred, et. al.). Tony candidly shares how the company evolved and persevered despite several near-misses - including coming close to shutting down the business.<br /><br />In addition, Tony shares a number of internal emails and documents that explain the rationale behind Zappos' strategy and values, including last year's decision to \\"partner\\" with Amazon. (Note: Zappos is now a \\"wholly-owned subsidiary\\" of Amazon.) So Zappos' story will continue ... and I eagerly await its next chapter.
B000059GEI|4.0|THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS isn't a classic. It runs at almost two hours long. If you were to trim off all the Irving Berlin songs, the running time'll get cut down to maybe an hour and a half. This would still be too long for the very thin screenplay. But I guess this is one of those films that you may get into despite the skimpy storytelling, the shallow character development, and the corn. More on that in a bit.<br /><br />This musical tracks the ups and downs of a family of lifelong vaudevillians, the Donahues, from 1919 to just when the second world war was looming. The movie gives us a peek at what goes on backstage in the life of a Broadway entertainer, except that we've seen all this stuff before. If behind the scenes stuff is what you came to this movie for, I say, instead, go check out YANKEE DOODLE DANDY or even THE CHORUS LINE. THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS boasts an all-star ensemble cast, except that nowadays the only name folks will really recognize is Marilyn Monroe's. But then she's an all-time star.<br /><br />Me, I've always had a lukewarm reaction to Dan Dailey and Mitzi Gaynor. They're okay, they don't thrill me. And Ethel Merman's big brassy voice makes for an effective fire alarm. Dan Dailey and Ethel Merman play the patriarch and matriarch of the Donahue clan. The kids, when grown up, are played by Donald O'Connor, Mitzi Gaynor, and that forgotten crooner Johnnie Ray. I'm a fan of O'Connor, who was affable and talented and should've gotten more breaks in the biz. He's one of the reasons I don't mind tuning in to this film. Mitzi Gaynor isn't given much to do, and so doesn't do much. But she's a good sport about it. Johnnie Ray is painful to watch when he's singing because it always looks like he's going into life-threatening convulsions. Thankfully, his character is soon entering priesthood and he's exit stage left for most of the film. Actually, his decision to become a priest provides one of the few real dramatic moments, the other one popping up near the end of the film as the father and son characters played by Dailey and O'Connor become estranged. These two are really good in this one scene in which Papa Donahue slaps the hell out of his always fouling-up kid.<br /><br />There are three hundred and seven songs in this movie, or it feels like it. The name above the movie title says Irving Berlin, and he spoon feeds the audience with his lyrics and music, and some of the songs do qualify as classic standards. But some do not. I could've done without the sailor tattoo song, for instance. And I wish the \\"Alexander's Ragtime Band\\" number hadn't run for 8 and a half minutes. What makes it worse is that O'Connor, in the only goof he makes, sings his part in a friggin' Scottish accent. But he makes up for it later in his big Astaire/Kelly moment with \\"A Man Chases A Girl (Until She Catches Him).\\"<br /><br />What makes the movie worth watching? There are reasons. It's shot in CinemaScope, for one thing and this lends the story a grand theatrical feel, especially if you dig those old slices of musical Americana. Donald O'Connor is a light and entertaining performer. There are several wonderful musical numbers like the above-mentioned \\"A Man Chases A Girl.\\" But, for my money, the best reason is Marilyn Monroe. Word is that she didn't even want to do this movie. But she was then promised the lead role in THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH, and so she came in in her supporting role and right away pushed Ethel Merman off the spotlight.<br /><br />Marilyn Monroe's three musical numbers are the best musical numbers in the film, and \\"Heat Wave\\" blows everything off the water. In that song Marilyn Monroe, in a dressed-up bikini, delivers what is probably the most provocative weather report ever. She sizzles in \\"After You Get What You Want, You Don't Want It\\" and is sexily languid in \\"Lazy,\\" with O'Connor and Gaynor dancing a lighthearted counterpoint. It's interesting that Mitzi Gaynor, a lovely woman and a fine dancer, fades in the background whenever Marilyn shares the scene with her. That's how potent Marilyn's presence is. If you don't have time to sit thru two hours of sentimental hokum, I suggest you fast forward to Marilyn's three musical numbers. Definitely check out \\"Heat Wave.\\"<br /><br />The DVD's bonus features suck and include three theatrical trailers for the film (one of them Portuguese, with the movie title changed to \\"O Mundo da Fantasia\\"); a side-by-side restoration comparison - a 77 second piece featuring a scene as seen thru the Original Film Restoration versus the Original Film Restoration Plus Video Restoration and then the same scene as seen thru the Previous Video Master versus the Original Film Restoration plus Video Restoration; trailers for BUS STOP, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES, HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE and THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH, as well as a segment promoting Marilyn Monroe's DVD Diamond Collection as a whole; and an image of the movie poster.

B001P3SA94|4.0|While I enjoyed the movie as entertainment, I felt that the whole essence and soul of what was Chess Records was somewhat compromised. As cozy nostalgia for a time in history when black American music was something to get excited about, this movie is okay... but it wanders from the path of truth and righteousness and makes you want to reach for the original music. Beyonce Knowles (as Etta James) is clearly out of her depth... and the snippet of hip-hop at the end only serves to show how African American culture has devolved into forgettable mush. I mean, come on... who is going to care about Q-Tip or Coolio in 50 years time? Worth a look, but the truth is considerably stretched. The music is still good... but the performances, while slick, are not a patch on the originals.
B002TZS5GU|4.0|In CARRIERS, a viral infection has destroyed all of mankind, leaving only a few survivors to fend for themselves as they attempt to find a safe haven free from contagion. Fear and paranoia set in as a group of four find out that their precautions have failed and one of them has contracted the deadly disease, putting the others in immediate danger. CARRIERS does an amazing job at conveying a post-apocalyptic wasteland on a very modest budget. The ravished streets and empty buildings give a true sense of devastation on a grand scale. Each of the actors put forth strong performances as they balance the lighter moments in the script with the psychological struggles later on. What makes the film the most difficult to watch are the scenes involving the infected children, where the adults that are conscious of the terminal effects of the disease must make heartbreaking decisions in order to end their suffering. Unlike in 28 DAYS LATER, the infected only pose a risk of contamination rather than creating bloodthirsty monsters, which forces the plot to rely on the darker aspects of humanity to drive the tension and suspense. The biggest complaint would have to be the overall lack of direction or purpose that the film presents, along with its down ending. CARRIERS comes from the same line of paranoid cinema as its Independent brethren BUG and RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR, and makes for another solid entry in the Post-Apocalyptic sub-genre.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B000002HJD|5.0|\\"An American Prayer\\" is a birth to death journey of the soul, the poetic, as experienced through the life of Jim Morrison. More than anything in life Jim Morrison wanted to be taken seriously as a poet. He even started making plans and recording his poems (separate from The Doors) prior to his death. Morrison wasn't able to bring about his vision of a poetry album to fruition. In Morrison's death The Doors created a musical poetic album to try and fulfill Morrison's legacy as a poet.<br /><br />An American Prayer is a mixture of Morrison's poetry, the surviving Doors instrumental accompaniment, and fragments and excerpts from Doors albums and live recordings. An American Prayer is a more straightforward journey than The Doors' albums, this CD journeys through life from the first awkward awakening of childhood, to Morrison's experience of the \\"Indians bleeding on dawn's highway,\\" to coming of age impressions and into the experience of rock stardom. In the folds of Morrison's poems you can glimpse the evolution of spirit from \\"I'll always be a word man\\" to the later \\"words got me the wound.\\"<br /><br />The title track \\"An American Prayer\\" is the centerpiece of the CD, and it makes a good case for Morrison to enter the pantheon of poets. \\"An American Prayer\\" is on a level with Ginsberg's, \\"Howl,\\" or T.S. Eliot's, \\"The Wasteland.\\"<br /><br />When \\"An American Prayer\\" was released as an album in 1978, The Doors long time producer Paul Rothchild called it a \\"rape of Jim Morrison.\\" There is a school of thought that still reiterates that idea, and maybe it is correct, \\"An American Prayer\\" isn't what Jim Morrison had wanted for a poetry album, but Morrison died before he was able to create the poetry album he wanted. But Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, and Robby Krieger created a truthful and poetic homage to the existentially fallen Morrison.<br /><br />The CD is also heavy on bonus features including a couple extra poems, \\"Ghost Song\\" made ready for FM radio play. It also includes a booklet with all the poems on the CD and also includes photographs and some of Morrison's journal drawings. If you sit and listen to the CD and look through the booklet you can experience Morrison's poetry through all available sensory avenues, and makes the poems and poetry instantly accessible, meaning made visible.<br /><br />Throughout my years as a Doors fan people ask \\"what was Jim Morrison like?\\" The surviving members of The Doors have struggled with that question too and have tried through various mediums, releasing 60's era live shows, films, and books to try and answer that question. If you want to know what Jim Morrison was like I think \\"An American Prayer comes closest to answering that question.ems on the CD and also includes photographs and some of Morrison's journal drawings.

0446563048|5.0|I recently received the book in advance, prior to the launch, so first of all thanks to Tony and Zappos.    (Note: I'm spanish, so the grammar of the comment is probably not so good)      Personally I really liked the book. From the personal story of Tony we can take some lessons for our daily life, and what Tony has been doing is removing layers until the finding of happiness, or what happiness is for him. Lots of people thinks that money is happiness, or at least that it helps, when the truth is that is not always the case. Tony didn't find the happiness with money, only free time that he didn't know what to do with until he found more interesting things that motivated him. Other lesson is about determination to believe and create something. Tony achieved (sell linkExchange to microsoft for 265M $ and save Zappos and make sales about 1B $) because he had so in mind, because he didn't surrender and believed in it, despite of the hard times that almost made the company to close out, and Tony poor.    More things. The company culture that has been created in Zappos in something to envy and is not something you can create overnight. The company culture is something inherent to the company since the firs times and can determinate the success of a company. The culture has to take account of all the parts of the company and the values which want to encourage. Zappos culture is something new in the sense that first are the persons: customers, workers, providers... and the in the rest. This focus is a little shocking in the traditional business culture. In the book Tony explain how this values were created and how everybody participated in them and took the company as something personal, something that not many companies can do... unhappy workers and customers are very common. Companies that believes in the involved people and make sense of the work of the employees besides promoting a personal and professional framework for them are the companies everybody wants to work for. And, I think these companies are the ones that are going to succeed in the coming years, because in the end money is not the most important, motivation is.    Lots of lessons of the book may be logical, but not a lot of companies are willing to implement them, and that can't be like that anymore. I hope this book gets into entrepreneurial people and that they enjoy as much as I did it, because in the end is that, the book is for entrepreneurs who want to learn different point views and want to learn about motivation, determination, company culture and happiness.

B003C1QIO6|2.0|A rather disappointing new release from Jack. It seems that he might have run out of ideas and tunes and although previous offerings were great, this one makes no impression with all tunes seemingly similar. I normally go right out and buy Jacks music without prior listening and am a fan of all his past material, but this one is disappointing and bordering on boring. I suggest a good listen to this album before plunging into the purchase.
B001GCUO5W|1.0|This was a very bland movie, bland acting and had a bland plot.  The \\"twist\\" ending was very predictable.  The reason I had to suffer watching this movie was because I was on an international flight and was stuck watching this atrocity.
B00020HEL6|2.0|I'm surprised at the surprise of many about Ms. Olstead's age. Perhaps the musical memory of these folks is very short. Anyone interested in the history of female vocalists will know that many recorded and charted records at tender teenage ages (child stars like Shirley Temple are excluded from this discussion). A representative selection of 13 to 16 year olds, recent to older: Tiffany, Nikki Cleary, Joss Stone, Brandy, Aaliyah, Alanis Morissette, Celine Dion; in 60's girl groups, some were as young as 12 or 13 and sounded much older. Listen to Tammy St. John's \\"Dark Shadows and Empty Hallways\\" from 1965 (it's on youtube) and see if you believe that that is the voice of a 13 year old.     In any case, Ms. Olstead makes a valiant effort but her voice is in serious need of discipline. Eva Cassidy she ain't. Perhaps her greatest achievements are yet to come, but if listeners like the material they are counseled to look up the originals, or to revisit Julie London, Joanie Sommers and Ella Fitzgerald.
B0002XDODU|5.0|\\"Reise, Reise\\" is one of the most solid foreign metal albums of recent years. With a bludgeoning, industrial-metal sound, spacey and haunting keyboards and Till's ever-famous voice, a voice that is quite likely nothing short of a human Terminator, this album surely delivers! Not only is the music great, powerful, majestic, dark and melodic all at the same time, but it's also educational; all of the lyrics are sung in German, so if you're wanting to learn a new language and you love this band, German might just be the foreign language for you. Anyway, on to my favorite/ the standout tracks of this album.    \\"Reise, Reise\\" - A slow, powerful, epic and majestic song with a great sing-a-long chorus, or rather declare-a-long, as Till's strong, matter-of-fact vocals imply. Great way to open the album, with some beautiful accordian music thrown at the end. Awesome song!  \\"Mein Teil\\" - This one might spook you after the calm ending of \\"Reise, Reise\\"! A sledgehammer riff gets cranked out of the amps for this one, with verses that slowly build up to a monstrous chorus. Excellent songwriting here, with some very creepy lyrics for a creepy atmosphere. A classic, nothing sort of it.  \\"Dalai Lama\\" - At first I didn't remember this song too much, but then I grew to love it a lot. The sinister, intro riff is similar to Black Sabbath, then comes in the steady beat, rhythmic lyrics, and an all-around great song. Some nice piano work is featured along with some darkly mystical singing.  \\"Keine Lust\\" - An uptempo song, one that's fast especially for Rammstein, but with a great start-stop rhythm as Till belts out \\"Ich hab keine lust!\\"  \\"Los\\" - An unexpected treat, this song features acoustic guitars, still downtuned to C, but are very nice nonetheless. I like this track a lot because it's another song that shows Rammstein musically branching out, which is always a good thing to do.  \\"Amerika\\" - If any song deserves to be called the fist-pumping sing-a-long song that SHOULD become a bighit, this one does. A nice arpeggiated keyboard solo in the middle of the song, followed by an angry, guitar-driven short section. The song is also a commentary on American society; now I'm no fascist against my own country, but in today's times, people can most certainly criticize the general America all they want in my eyes. Anyway, onwards...  \\"Morgenstern\\" - Translates to \\"morning star\\", very poetic indeed! What I love about this song is the chorus, where Till uses an almost operatic voice. A very nice touch, adding even more variety to the album.  \\"Stein Um Stein\\" - A slower and powerful song that features some great yelling by Till, although it is unintentionally comical the way he does it at the very end of the song. Either way, a very good song.    Well, there's really nothing to complain about here; aside maybe a lack of guitar solos if you want that (and I tend to love indulgent guitar solos in songs, for that matter). But either way, this album most certainly deserves five stars and a place in every metal fan's library. For anybody interested in this style of music, Rammstein will definitely not disappoint. Get this and see why Rammstein is as loved as they are. Yet another reason for me to be proud of the German side of my heritage. Either way, very highly recommended. Thanks for the time, and peace.

It's now one of my favorite shows!
B003O26LLS|5.0|When I read the reviews I was a bit weary but I actually just went ahead and bought it and I absolutely loved this album!!!! I can honestly say that I like every song on the album which is soooooo rare for me.  \\"Woohoo\\" is probably one of my favorite songs on the album...for obvious reasons being that I am a woman =). The songs are good upbeat club rhythms with one featuring Peaches (I love her BTW), and the ballads are classic give that old school vibe that I've always loved about her.      If other's hated the album it would definitely be based on their personal taste in music.  I love hip hop, electronica, and old school ballads and christina seems to mix them all together tastefully.  I give this album five stars!!!!!!!!
0780628551|4.0|\\"The Astronaut's Wife\\" (1999) is directed by Rand Ravich. The beginning of the film is reminiscent of the 1955 sci-fi horror film \\"The Creeping Unknown\\" as the astronauts encounter an alien entity in space which possesses them. Like other alien possession films part of the drama is about how the host changes his identity and how those around them gradually realize that the person they thought they knew is no longer that person. In this film Johnny Depp is the astronaut (Spencer) who returns to earth and his wife (Jillian)is played by Charlize Theron. This well acted and directed psychological horror film draws us into the hell Jillian discovers as the world she knew is turned upside down. Some other films with related themes include \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\", \\"The Stepford Wifes\\", \\"I Married a Monster From Outer Space\\", and \\"Rosemary's Baby\\".<br /><br />There was an alternate \\"positive\\" ending filmed but it doesn't appear on this DVD. This DVD also doesn't have any extras except for film biographies. I was hoping to get this film on blu-ray, but since it isn't currently available in that format I purchased the DVD and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. This is a very clean print that it is exceptionally sharp for a DVD, even better looking than some blu-rays I have purchased.

B002QEXN2K|4.0|Ok, so here's the thing. John Mayer seemingly has 2 sides to him. The blues and the pop. He combines this fusion so well but there are clear distinctions in some of his work and it is here that he has created his uniqueness but also, alas, a divided fanbase.     The problem lies when fans who prefer the electric guitar solo/blues/rock side of Mayer are then disappointed with an album which leaves this behind and follows a more traditional melodic route, which I believe Battle Studies is. I do think that some reviewers who wrote their thoughts after only a couple of listens would now rate it higher. It is a grower as it doesn't have the 'obvious' guitar solo licks to take you in upon first listen.     I still believe Continuum will be the album that defines him (so far) and when I hear it I sit up and take note. I do weirdly understand the argument that Battle Studies is more 'background' music (and by that I mean the best background music you can have!) The first time I heard Assassin for example it didn't jump out at me. Fast forward to a few listens later and it got me hook, line and sinker. There is an understated complexity to some of the songs which make them more unique and you know what - sometimes I want a decent album to listen to over a cup of tea or relaxing at home. They don't all have to make you want to get up and dance or strap on a guitar to join in with the solos.     As a side note, I think that the word 'pop' has such a negative connotation these days (and there are some pap songs that justify this) but to write a classic pop album that won't go out of fashion in a few years takes some unbeliveable talent. Please don't let the word put you off in context with John Mayer reviews.     Battle Studies doesn't have as many gems as Continuum but that's ok, there are still more on here than most. Continuum was an almost impossible act to follow but at the end of the day I believe that in 20 years time I will still be listening to all of Mayer's albums, including Battle Studies and how many current artists can you say that about?     I would say give this album a good listen before making your mind up. If you still don't like it there is always the blues side of Mayer or Joe Bonamassa and Jonny Lang for you guitar lick lovers!     (Please note that this review refers to some comments from UK amazon reviews as I am British. Thanks)

She is always positive in her music and a she is a great storyteller, and I'm not saying this because I'm a fan of hers. You could always tell talent, she is very humble, sticks to her roots and keeps it real. she doesn't have to sell sex or shake her ass to sell records like Beyonce, Rhianna or other non-talented rappers out here. Ms. Keys keep doing your thing girl!  Congratulation on your engagement and your bundle of joy!     P.S. Mariah carey, you could sing girl!

B0035WTJFW|5.0|If you are a sci-fi nut like me, then you'll like Minority Report, specifically this Blu ray version.<br />Blu ray is made for watching sci-fi and fantasy movies, where the CGI effects really shine through, and for a movie that's already a handful of years old (which is a long time in Hollywood), it's still holding very well with more recent and better tech sci-fi movies out there.<br />Some of the CGI, like the green house scene, are pretty lame to the trained eye, but for the most part it's a very well made and exciting movie.<br />Especially if you're a Tom Cruise fan, you should definitely get this (my 2 other Cruise favorites being \\"Vanilla Sky\\" and \\"Mission Impossible 2\\" - \\"Tropic Thunder was probably his finest role lol but he wasn't a lead so it doesn't count).
6304935811|5.0|This is the VHS version of the original motion picture starring George C. Scott as General George Patton.  An excellent brand new tape still in the original wrapper.  The movie is a superb depiction of George Patton's involvement in the European theatre of WWII.  Many of Scott's lines are direct (or almost direct) quotes from Patton himself and most of the scenes are historically correct.  Patton's views toward the Soviets and his total disdain of them is authentic.  The coarse language, which Patton used fluently, was a bit shocking in 1970 when the movie was released.  By today's standards it is fairly commonplace. A \\"must see\\" for anyone who wants to know who General Patton was in a nutshell.

I am not old enough to enjoy the old timers, but for me and my generation, Charlize is the one (other timeless favorite beauties of mine are Nicole Kidman and Kate Beckinsale).<br />And her in a sci-fi movie would make any geek's head explode.<br />Overall, a very stylistic movie (you gotta love Pete Postlethwaite in that robe-thingamajiggy - whoever persuaded him to wear that costume deserves a \\"Moonman.\\") that deserves a place in your sci-fi collection.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|If any FF game is a true legend among legends its Final Fantasy VII ... and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children was a true epic movie sequel that surpassed everything related to FF overall, that includes that sorry excuse for a FF game that is FFXIII, i compare the original movie to FFXIII because XIII is more like a Movie overall then it is a game, poor gameplay, stupid characters and a lack of fun in general, however it does have pretty graphics and nice CGI effects worthy to be called \\"Movie-Like\\" and even still the original FFVII: AC movie blows FFXIII out of the water...<br /><br />But with Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete with the extra footage as many others have stated, with new voices for some characters that fit better (Marlene, Denzel, Etc...) New lines added for a fair amount of characters, new actions, Reno & Rude play bigger roles this time around, so do the kids. Oh and Blu-Ray does make a big change to the original. the HD 1080p and Sound Effects are noticeable VASTLY improved over the original, to people who say Blu-ray makes little change compared to DVD are downright stupid or in denial of being biased against it.<br /><br />Anyways overall Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete doesn't only blow the original DVD versions out of the water, it blows EVERYTHING else FF related out of the freakin ocean!<br /><br />It also contains a few tid-bits from the PSP exclusive game Crisis Core: FFVII! as an added bonus.<br /><br />So overall with all these improvements the best FF title ever made just got better. With this, maybe square enix is still worthy after all.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|Deep, Dark, and Edgy - you can use these words to describe Batman, and you can use these words to describe this movie as well. This was the way Batman was supposed to have been, so this \\"reimagining\\" of the Batman franchise was the way it was supposed to be to begin with.<br />With this role, Christian Bale got into a hot streak from 2005-2009 that have rarely ever been seen before in Hollywood history (just don't say in the world as Andy Lau of Hong Kong cinema has been in over 100 big-screen movies). Bale probably appeared in over 10 movies in lead roles in that span, and deservedly so after this performance.<br />The only ludicrous thing about this movie is his semi growl/whisper/stoned voice when he dons the cape - what's up with that?? LOL
B000Y9Q59W|1.0|No need to review the movie. Not my intention here. It's great. Cast, Douglas/father & son Sheen, director, Stone at his peak, but, what about the Blu-ray edition? No one seems to review movies mentioning the product's quality, ever. One thing is the movie and another thing is the product. First, the Blu-ray version is only about 10 to 15% better image than its normal DVD version. Second, on the back of the box it says 2.35:1 Widescreen presentation and when you play it, it is the same as the normal DVD, 1.85:1. Nice going Fox. Yes, there's a little bit more of Special Features, one more than the normal DVD version. So, if you are not a fanatic in quality and your pocket has been collecting moths for the past year or so, stick to your DVD version or get one used. I'm stuck with the Blu-ray version I bought and I can't return it. And thus, the movie is a 1985 preview of what, in a way, finally happened in America 24 years later. Do you still want to invest in Wall Street?
B0027BOL4G|1.0|After watching this documentary by accident.. I immediately bought several copies to hand out to my friends and family.  After viewing this film, YOU will think twice before eating at a fast food chain and the way you shop at a grocery store.  I have changed the way I now purchase food for me and my family- and I have to tell you- I'm feeling a whole lot better &lt;health wise> just from the little changes that I've made. So why the 1 star rating- this documentary is brought to you by the same people who brought you  \\"an  Inconvenient  Truth\\" (which were not so truthful).. so until all the accusations are vetted out on Food Inc.. I will reserve that 5th star until the truth is documented. Hope this review was Helpful!!
1440789894|5.0|I was a little hesitant to read this book, but peer pressure won over, and I am so happy I caved. This is one \\"audio book\\" that is just terrific. It is read by a full cast : Richard Poe, Gerard Doyle, Carol Monda, Johanna Parker, Ramon de OCampo, Chris Sorenson and Patricia Floyd. The story begins on a summer morning in 1974, in New York City as a man balances on high above on a tight rope between the Twin Towers in NYC. As people below stare up in disbelief, the lives of other every day people continue on as usual.<br /><br />The novel is almost like a series of short stories, but before long their stories begin to connect: a Jesuit priest, a judge, a prostitute, a wealthy, but grieving Park Avenue woman are a few of the characters that appealed to me.  My favorite story/character was Tillie, a prostitute, down on her luck, and now in jail reflecting on her life and that of her grandchildren.  (You MUST listen to the audio version to fully appreciate all that Tillie has experienced).<br /><br />Without going into the details about all of the stories, I'd just like to say that this was such a beautiful novel. It was about human beings -- their every day struggles, and the circumstances and vulnerabilities that make all of us who we are. Each unique character was captured perfectly, as the author skillfully weaves together the dysfunctional lives of some of the most memorable people I've met, through a book, in a long time.  For me, truly a sign of an exceptional literary work.  McCann shows NYC at its finest and at its worst: all classes, all races -- all truly memorable.  Toward the end of the book, although 9/11 is not mentioned, the story jumps to 2005 with a story about the war in Iraq and references to airport security etc,.  It was here that I was reminded of just how precious our days are, and just how connected each of us are no matter where we reside.<br /><br />Read this Book, better yet listen to the audio version. I doubt that you will be disappointed. Highly recommended!
B001TWT0AE|5.0|Upon its release, this film was panned by most critics and quickly moved to the bottom half of double features. Now, 48 years later, 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' is both critically-acclaimed and loved by viewers. This is a compelling Western, one with a depth of character and story that is often missing from the genre. This film is well written, beautifully filmed and powerfully acted. It deserves its place in the pantheon of Westerns.    Jimmy Stewart portrays Ransom Stoddard. Stoddard has just graduated from law school and moved to the American West. He hopes to make a name for himself among the outlaws, ranchers, settlers and dreamers that populate the West. Upon arriving he takes a job as kitchen help in the town's busiest restaurant. John Wayne plays Tom Doniphon. Doniphon is the \\"baddest\\" dude in town. He is liked by many and respected/feared by all. Both Doniphon and Stoddard have their eye on the lovely woman who also works in the restaurant. She is played by the terrific Vera Miles.     The antagonist to our two heroes is the title character Liberty Valance. He is perfectly portrayed by Lee Marvin. Valance is obnoxious, foul-mouthed and very tough. Everyone, with the exception of Doniphon (Wayne), fears Liberty Valance. Valance singles out Stoddard (Stewart) for his abuse. Stoddard, being from the East, has no skill for dealing with such a person. He can neither fight nor shoot. He believes that laws and sheriffs will protect him from the wilder elements of the frontier. But the Wild, Wild West is not fully tamed. How can a city-slicker like Ransom Stoddard stand up to an outlaw like Liberty Valance?    One story about this movie that I love. Both Stewart and Wayne were huge stars before this film was released. Who would get top-billing? Having your name appear first in the credits (top-billing) was a sign of status in Hollywood. Both actors agreed that Stewart would get top-billing in all the advertising. Things like the posters, lobby cards, etc. would all feature Jimmy Stewart above John Wayne. Wayne would get top-billing in the opening credits. This would create some balance between the two stars. At the time, most people thought that Stewart got the better of John Wayne. Many more people see the advertising for a film than see the actual film. But John Wayne got the last laugh. His name still appears above Stewart's in the opening credits on each and every DVD, video and tv screening of the film. We still see Wayne getting top-billing long after the advertising materials have all but disappeared. Never try to best John Wayne!    'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' is the last big western from director John Ford.  His films featuring Monument Valley in Arizona had amazed viewers who had never seen such magnificent scenery before.  But 'Liberty Valance' is different from most Ford Westerns. Instead of amazing scenery and epic vistas, this film was shot primarily on sound stages. It is a personal story that focuses upon the characters. The traditional Ford cinematography is nowhere to be found. This movie tells the story of the changing West and Director John Ford changed his style to help tell that story. He returned to using black and white film. This too helps force our attention to the detail of the characters. These subtle changes in film making for Ford help to put The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance on the list of wonderful films.
0340896981|3.0|We first meet Emma and Dexter on the evening of their graduation -- 15th July 1988 -- in Emma's little bedsit in Edinburgh. Emma would like to \\"make some sort of difference\\" to the world around her while Dexter just wants to travel round the world until he decides what he wants to do.<br /><br />The day after they go their separate ways and we next meet them on the same day the following year when Emma writes to Dex; she's with a travelling theatre company and he's teaching English in Rome.<br /><br />This sets the tone for the next twenty years of their lives as each chapter is a snapshot of their life on ONE DAY -- 15th July -- so we know exactly what they're doing on that day and, from their conversations with both each other and other peoples, we get a general idea of what's happened to them over the last year. They don't always meet on that day - sometimes they speak on the telephone, sometimes they've fallen out and don't speak at all but they're always on each other's minds, particularly on that day.<br /><br />This is such a different and unique book, only meeting them once a year but the author gave just enough information so that we know they've both have their ups and downs over the past year.<br /><br />While Dex's life was falling apart due to his drug and alcohol addiction living the high life as a late-night TV presenter. Emma's life is the opposite, she's eating well and looking after herself and starts a teacher training course, and I did wonder why she would want to keep in touch with such a selfish and self-centred man like Dex. But when they were together it was so touching, and Emma brought out the best in Dex, but they were always 'just good friends'.<br /><br />I thought Emma was so funny, I really warmed to her and her one-liners had me laughing out loud more than once, she did live for a little while with a would-be comedian and she was more funny than him!<br /><br />I enjoyed David Nicholls writing style, it was simple and straightforward and uncomplicated.
B000TGELLY|3.0|Perhaps the good deal about this Director's Cut are the prolonged action sequences and the more colorful image, but when it turns to the time given to expand the characters development, the film feels way too slow and long at times. I also didn't like the inclusion of borrowed themes from other movie scores (such as Planet of the Apes) to replace James Horner's at many times of this new version.  If any new music was to be included, they should have used the amazing trailer themes which were completely ignored in the theatrical score; this was a perfect opportunity to put them into the film.   It still feels like a movie that tries too hard to be epic and serious in so many levels, and somehow fails. In the end it's enjoyable, but its extended running time isn't justified by what is added,  yet if  what you're looking for is a gorier version of \\"Troy\\", then you'll be pleased.
0316017922|5.0|I am a fan of non fiction and this was right up my alley.  Being a mother of two young boys, I often think about their future and how their upbringing will play a role.  Althought this is not directly a book on parenting, it is relevant. I highly reccommend this book for all parents as both educational and entertaining. I couldn't put it down I read it in its entirety over three days. That may not sound impressive unless you have 2 children under the age of two, then you may realize its darn near impossible!
B003FMTZOM|5.0|...but christina is an artist, first and foremost.  she's not going to put out the same album every time.  this is a fun summer album, and she includes a ballads section (\\"You Lost Me\\" is worth the price of the album alone--stunning).  there is something for everyone on this album.  if you follow christina on her artistic journey, you're in for a fun, interesting ride.  the comparisons are silly--madonna and gaga didn't invent dance music.  there is still no one like christina.  the voice is still there.  let her stretch and grow.  she's here for the long run.  a great album.
0521673763|4.0|Well written indeed, thorough and the graphics are superb (in accessibility but almost to the degree of being childish). The first third of the book has a heavy focus on neuroscience, brain development and cellular chemistry. Beyond the previous comments, I'll add that the structure of organizing the topics by psychiatric disorder may be less conducive to learning than if the topics were separated by drug class. This causes some limitation and minor frustration when trying to find background information on specific symptoms or illnesses which do not fall under the chapters' primary themes.  Time will tell but it is worth saying if a prospective buyer seeks a specific format.
0446563048|5.0|Soon after Tony Hsieh sold Link Exchange to Microsoft for a mere $265m, with a personal fortune of $41m, he gave $8m back because he didn't have the patience to wear his golden handcuffs for another few months. After a pretty restless sort of existence as a student, an employee, and then entrepreneur, he had finally worked out that for him, following his passion was more rewarding that chasing the buck.    Having read the book I can see that Tony Hseih's passion had very little to do with selling shoes. Online or offline. No - his passion is for driving human (and therefore corporate) performance through amazing customer service. It could have been furniture, whoopee cushions, griddle pans or fishing tackle. It just happened to be shoes.     What drives this man is the pursuit of happiness and the recognition (or is it faith?) that there is a proper commercial virtuous circle, where happy staff equals happy customers, equals happy shareholders.    Most companies focus their efforts on creating shareholder value. Tony Hsieh knows that very few people get out of bed in the morning to create shareholder value. A few companies flip this convention on its head and work their butts off the make their staff feel valued, empowered, trusted, respected and dare I say loved. This rubs off on customers big time. And so it's pretty good for profits too. Zappos is one of those companies.    If any of this resonates, you should read this book. If you think it sounds like a load of old tosh, you also should read this book.

B001HN694K|3.0|More of a sequel to the old animated Disney classic than a remake, Tim Burton's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is just the type of movie you'd expect when clashing Burton with Walt: it's beautiful yet strange, struggling yet touching. I saw this movie at the local cheap cinema, and felt it was worth two dollars (literally, two bucks for a ticket). And as I left the theater, I thought about how I felt about the movie.    The basic plot-line is well known; an older Alice returns to Wonderland to discover it broken and controlled by the Red Queen, and with the help of several old friends, has to find a way to defeat the Jabberwocky and save the mysterious land. Pretty straight-forward, not too complex, and not incredibly thought-provoking. I felt the story seriously sagged at parts; it was slow, and boring, and sometimes even confusing.     So why give it four stars? A few reasons, really. First of all, though I felt every actor and actress did an amazing job in this movie, the true star is Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. In other film versions he is simply a flat, bizarre character we don't really care much about. But here Depp makes the character a real human, with ranging, fascinating emotions, and a mad, quirky personality I couldn't help but describe as charming. The other reason I enjoyed this movie was for its computer graphics; they made up well over 3/4 of the movie, and were done incredibly well. Though the amount of them might feel overwhelming at times, they still blew me away.    It's a movie with heart, but not much else. I believe Burton got a little carried away with the effects, and felt that he could lack a little plot and make it up with fancy effects. Sadly, he was wrong, but hey, nobody's perfect. The actress who portrayed Alice, Mia Wasikowska (what a last name!) did a good job, and acted well with Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter, whose head is swelled the whole movie, which makes it a bit odd to watch.     The other characters within the cast are all ranging; from talking bloodhounds to the familiar rabbit with a pocket-watch, and even the Jabberwocky (voiced fleetingly by Christopher Lee) makes a bold appearance. The costumes and make-up (especially on Depp) was all great, and though this movie is far from perfect, some qualities redeem it. Such as the final scene between Hatter and Alice; perhaps one of the most saddest scenes in a movie I've watched in awhile, I could really feel Depp's powerful acting through those large green eyes, and it makes me wonder if Hatter and Alice had more going on than what meets the eye.    Before I wrap this up, I have one huge thing to add about this movie: maybe you've heard of it, but there is a final dance scene by Depp's character. And it is absolutely atrocious. So bizarre and out-of-place, it truly kicked off a star when I wrote this. Not sure who's idea that was, but they need to get fired, seriously.    Alright, so that final dance scene aside: over-all, it's a good movie that had more potential than plot. I'll probably sucker and buy it for Depp's sake. Give it a try; I'll guarantee you'll get bored, but Depp, Carter, and even glimpses of a very well done Cheshire Cat saved this movie.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|Is this movie driven by telling characterization, witty dialogue and thoughtful observation? No. Were you expecting a James Cameron film to be driven by any of those things? I thought not.     What Avatar is, is a revolution in what movies can be. 3D movies have been giving you the feeling of being in the motion for a while. Cameron's use of 3D envelopes you in an entire world, beautiful, fascinating, and horrifying. You will not be bored for one second watching Avatar. That's a claim only a very few films can make.     I wouldn't want to buy this movie, but I'd go see it in Imax 3D twice.
B000002O5L|5.0|Another great Tom Petty album!  Ranks right up there with TOM PETTY & THE HEARTBREAKERS, DAMN THE TORPEDOS and YOU\\"RE GONNA GET IT.  Jeff Lynne's production is perfect and the songs all can stand next to Petty's best.
B002VECM4A|5.0|Movies that generate as much buzz as Precious often are not fulfilling because you go into it with such high expectations.  It was a wonderful experience to watch Precious, a movie that not only met my expectations but exceeded them.    The story is heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.  Precious has a horrendous home life, and she has obviously been overlooked in school.  An early scene in the movie demonstrates the state of the school she attends, and it's not good.  After she enrolls in an alternative school, we learn that she is borderline illiterate but got an A- in English at her last school.  Through all of this and the fact that Precious is pregnant with her second child (from her father), she continues to show her strength and will to become better at everything.    The performances throughout the film are nothing short of outstanding, and Mo'Nique's potrayal of Precious' abusive mother is nothing short of jaw-dropping.  Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz both perform wonderfully in their roles with Carey really surprising me.  I had no idea it was her until the end.    The movie is very disturbing, and I can only imagine how much more disturbing the novel is.  Through the disturbing scenes and images, though, hopes shines through.  I found myself really liking Precious' character and loathing that of her mother.  With the type of subject matter, this movie could have been nothing more than shocking, but the performances and the excellent direction made it one of the best movies of 2009.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I have all three CD's(Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse). I ordered each CD without even hearing any of the music. I was plesantly surprised that each CD was awesome!<br />I love Eclipse(all yours)...The song by Muse-Love is forever really fits this movie...You already know that it is all about Edwards's and Bella's love for each other..I do feel the soundtrack makes me feel part of the movie too, like one of the reviews that was given..June 30th can not come quick enough for me...<br /><br />You must get this CD from Amazon! By far the best price anywhere...
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This is one of my favourite Bob Dylan Albums. I have enjoyed this album over and over. The first two songs are obvious crackers, especially Thunder on The Mountain, but When the Deal Goes Down and Workingman's Blues #2 I really like as well. The real slow burner for me is Nettie Moore. That is a great song! Of the so called recent \\"Trilogy\\", I think I prefer Modern Times the best. Really, to be honest, I've always enjoyed any of Bob Dylan's records. The Christian albums are some of my favourites and very under-rated in my opinion. He was right back on track with most people with \\"Infidels\\". I started with \\"Blood on The Tracks\\" (lucky me!) and I think I've got my fair share of good times from Bob's efforts over the years.
B002JCSRKC|4.0|I am really picky about the shape of my shoes.  My feet are not very big, but these boots make them look bigger than they really are. They are wide in the front like the clogs are. Maybe thats just the way rainboots are...I dont know.  I think you def have to be a fan of the shape of the origianl Croc's shoe to be in love with these boots.  I like them, they are very well made, seem durable, but I am not in love with them.
B000031WD9|3.0|My wife picked up an \\"American Pie\\" DVD from the bargain rack of a discounter and we watched it last night. It depicts the lives and times of four young males in the last year of high school as they are actively searching for what young guys search for. The movie was well done. The acting was good and the scenes well managed. However, I didn't particularly care for the movie. I felt uncomfortable throughout the viewing.<br /><br />The movie was meant to be a comedy and I'm sure many, if not most, people may find it hilariously funny. I didn't. The growing up and coming of age period of life is a very difficult transition for most people and this movie accurately portrays it. The writers, director and actors all have a fine eye for awkward and embarrassing situations and they maximize the comedy potential of each incident. But why laugh at people who are having a difficult time? Is their struggle really that funny? Well, it is funny, to be sure, but I feel more uneasyness than mirth when I watch the story unfold. I don't end up with the feeling that I've watched a really good comedic movie. Oh well, maybe that's just me. I don't view the high school years as one of the highlights of my life.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
0307278255|5.0|Amazingly well written. Now I'll have to read The Namesake. Her insight into human nature is profound. I especially loved the 3 stories in part 2 that followed two children from two Bengali families as they grew into adulthood. Short story writing at its best.
0345479092|1.0|Skip this book, use the money for diapers. I gleaned so little useful information from this book I wish I could return it. She glosses over or leaves out important facts just to stress or reinforce her point of view. At first I viewed her \\"luv\\" and such voice in the book as charming, by the end it reminded me of a narcissistic, manipulative aunt who thinly veils her condescension regarding your parenting choices.She may have a few years of being a nanny to back her up, but all the mothers I have talked to found this book fool of tripe.

B0036EH3XE|3.0|I am a Lost fan and I have seen every single episode.    I am entitled to my opinion so please don't insult me.      I am not an idiot - as one reviewer says that people who just put 1 star on their reviews are  - I also didn't like the ending - and I also feel that it was a copout.  I have actually given it 3 because it was ok, but I wasn't blown away by the 6th season.      We all look for different things in shows and the reason Lost got me hooked in the first place was because of this mysterious island and Jacob, and if it was all about the characters, then surely the biggest character was the island.  Yes, I cared about the human characters and it was good that they got a happy ending - but I feel that there are too many gaps between season 5 and season 6.  I am sorry but the ending did not work for me - no matter what is said in these reviews and whether I am insulted for not agreeing with someone who thought it was brilliant.  If you thought it was brilliant, that's great - you found something I didn't.    I felt that season 6 was rushed and it was a token effort to include some sort of ending for the island - it gave me the feeling that they did not know how to end it because they had put so many mysteries into it - the writers are certainly not geniuses.     I am not one of those people that want to have their hand held when I watch a film or tv show - I do like to think about it - but I do like to have some questions answered when they say this is the end.    I thought it had a brilliant pilot, first season, went up and down in seasons 2-5 but it was still compelling & then you get season 6 - which seemed to belong to a different story - or another story is needed inbetween seasons 5 & 6.    I got up for the 5am start (I live in England) and wished I hadn't bothered, but I am learning to let go and appreciate it for those seasons that I did enjoy.      UPDATE ON FRIDAY 9 JULY 2010  I am writing this in here as apparently I can write a review but I can't add a comment on those comments made about my review nor can I write another review - because I haven't bought an Amazon.com product - I am English so I buy from Amazon.co.uk.    Why can't those who loved the ending understand that those of us who didn't like it also understood it - insulting our intelligence again.    If you are a sci-fi fan then I suggest that you treat Season 5 as the end otherwise you will be disappointed.  The 6th season dvd may or may not add extra footage - but I won't hold my breath.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|When I saw Das Boot, the Director's Cut, I knew it was the best submarine movie ever released, the best war movie, and one of the best dramas, and I've watched it maybe thirty times. I don't even need the English subtitles any more. But there was a nagging sense that certain character developments just came our of nowhere, like the crew's antipathy to Lt Werner, and I always thought the captain's persona was a little sketchy. No more. All the nagging questions are resolved, all the scenes that seems to have come out of nowhere, and a certain disjointedness in the way the story developed, all resolved. Das Boot, uncut, develops slowly enough for us to really get to know these men, their lives, their loves. We see the Captain interacting with his Junior officers; we see the teacher, and the friend, as well as the leader. We hear the raunchy talk among the seamen. Add to that the superb narrative overvoice by Lt. Werner, and we not only see, we smell the cramped interior of that boat, the sweat, the stench of diesel, the overwhelming constant dampness. The boredom becomes palpable. We learn that that the crew isn't as united as the Director's Cut leads us to believe. And there's more. The translation used in the English sub titles is much more accurate. The soundtrack has more detail, more of the industrial noises of submarine life. It's a revelation. If you're a Das Boot fan, you must see it uncut.

B000E5N6LG|5.0|Lawrence Kasdan's &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34; got a raw deal in 1994 when it was released; the movie &#34;Tombstone&#34; -- essentially the same story -- came out six months earlier and stole its thunder. The difference in these two films can be observed in their names: &#34;Tombstone&#34; focuses on Earp's conflict with the 'Cowboys' gang in the Arizona town, whereas &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34; is an epic Western detailing Earp's life from youth to old age, although the Tombstone events are certainly the center piece. &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34; runs 3 hours 11 minutes and &#34;Tombstone&#34; is an hour shorter. Both are top-of-the-line modern Westerns and whether you'll like one or the other depends on what you're in the mood for. If you want kinetic mythmaking &#34;Tombstone fills the bill, but if you want realistic storytelling with the details and mundaneness thereof then &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34; is the way to go. Regardless, both are vastly superior to the dull 1957 version with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, &#34;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.&#34;<br /><br />I originally saw &#34;Tombstone&#34; sometime in the 90s, but by the time I got around to seeing &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34; I had forgotten the former film; as such, &#34;Tombstone&#34; wasn't able to 'steal the thunder' from my viewing of Costner's version. I was engrossed throughout. It may not be as great as his &#34;Dances with Wolves&#34; (1990), but it's not far off and, besides, few Westerns stand equal with that one.<br /><br />I recently saw both films back-to-back and it is fun comparing the two. Val Kilmer from &#34;Tombstone&#34; wins out over Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, but not by much and not because Quaid is bad but rather because Holiday's role is more prominent in &#34;Tombstone&#34; with better lines. Actually Kilmer is nothing less than fascinating in the role, although Quaid is more believable. Kurt Russell and Costner are about even as Earp, but &#34;Tombstone&#34; wins out overall in cast with Sam Elliott, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Billy Zane and the shining Dana Delany as Josie, although Joanna Going in the same role in &#34;Wyatt&#34; shines just as much. But there are several exceptions; for instance, Isabella Rossellini in &#34;Wyatt&#34; edges out Joanna Pacula as Big Nose Kate, Doc's babe.<br /><br />As for the dramatic walk to the O.K. Corral and the gunfight itself I favor &#34;Wyatt Earp,&#34; but &#34;Tombstone&#34; has a better dramatic build-up to the confrontation. However, &#34;Tombstone&#34; loses too much steam after the gunfight with redundant shootouts between Wyatt & his men and the Cowboys; &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34; maintains better momentum in the final act where the train sequence is much more impressive than the quick rendition shown in &#34;Tombstone.&#34;<br /><br />Unlike &#34;Tombstone,&#34; which was shot in Arizona, &#34;Wyatt&#34; was shot in New Mexico, with additional scenes shot in South Dakota, Port Angeles, WA, and Burbank Studios, CA.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Don't listen to the moron critics who undeservedly bashed &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34; upon release in '94. They're wrong, pure and simple. &#34;Tombstone&#34; was evidently too fresh in their minds and ruined the story for them. &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34; easily stands with the all-time best Westerns. Just make sure you're in the mood for a 3-hour-plus epic before viewing. And, by all means, catch &#34;Tombstone&#34; too -- they're both great.<br /><br />GRADE: A-iehn, Billy Zane and the shining Dana Delany as Josie, although Joanna Going in the same role in &#34;Wyatt&#34; shines just as much.

B003E7EXT0|5.0|Believe it or not, I had never actually read Pride and Prejudice, though I have been an English and Drama teacher for over a decade.  This book not only gave me the full text, but the little \\"insights\\" in the margin were interesting and often inspired my interest even more into the works of Austen.  I think this would be a great book for everyone - those who have never read it and those who are on their hundredth reading.  Kudos to the author.

1440469563|4.0|'Sense and Sensibility' is a wonderful book with characters that you become completely engrossed with. Yes, the book has similar themes to some of Jane Austens other works and the storyline is somewhat predictable but it has such wonderful imagery and sentiment that you cannot put it down. The satire and wit of Austen is amazing and the situations and lessons still ring true today. Highly recommend it.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I LOVE Johnny Depp and this movie is hot! For anyone who enjoys movies including Depp, I guarantee a winner with this one.
1401223176|5.0|If you like Batman, and more importantly, you LOVE Batman's long list of villians, then dont hesitate to buy this. The plot and story develop in a way that involves tons of the enemies who are trying to destroy Batman in a highly elaborate way that comes together beautiflly in the end. Catwoman looks great, as does Poison Ivy, and an appearance by Superman is always a bonus. Bottom line, its a really fun read that keeps you guessing right till the end.<br /><br />Also...Best Part...When it appears that the once slain Robin Jason Todd comes back to life for revenge on Batman. A great \\"No Way\\" moment. Check it out
B001P9EQH8|5.0|When I left my beat-up, loyal, and long-suffering Boostaroos on a plane, I seized the opportunity to see if I could match the force-multiplying role they played so well for this long-suffering long-haul traveler and his beloved Sennheiser PXC 450s at a small size and weight.<br /><br />Mission accomplished.<br /><br />The tiny, Chinese-made FiiO E5 headphone amplifier measurably improves the quality of sound I hear when I play tunes on my iPod or iPhone through the Sennheisers. That's news enough. What truly astonishes is the minute size and weight of the E5, even when you factor in the handy little clip that sturdies the whole deal by latching it onto a shirt pocket while the airplane meals come and go. Spaghetti sauce never did the old Boostaroos much good whenever they did their slow role into the soup du jour.<br /><br />Next up in the Pleasant Surprise Category is another little thing: the price. Twenty clams get this gizmo from Amazon to your door.<br /><br />I note the opinion voiced my some reviewers that you can do better elsewhere. I  suspect they're right. But for $20 it's hard to imagine going wrong with the E5.
0307454541|2.0|I was seriously disappointed with \\"The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo\\". The book is laid as a script for a soap opera. Maybe the essence was lost in translation but it didn't do much for me. The references and sentences were distracting. I kept going back and reading it again, to make sense and googling to realize what they were talking about (i.e gaol was the prison, what in the world is gaol?!?!).<br />There are different plots going on at the same time, some completely uninteresting. The sadism content is unbelievable and just plain cruel.<br />But the worst is that is full of filling and the writing is extremely boring. It goes on and on about the same thing, that doesn't add anything to the story.  The email exchange between Mikael and Erika is ridiculous and pointless.<br />Salander character was the only thing worth in this book, and I was hoping to have more of her.<br />I am giving two starts because it did have its grip on me middle way through. I wanted to know where Harriet was and what Salander was going to do. But as soon as Harriet was found and Salander stole the money, the book was over. Yet, there was still plenty of pages left with filling.<br />I don't regret reading it and I have heard the other books are better. Just don't expect it to be the best book you will ever read.
030726839X|4.0|The book gives what I think is a balanced view of what Winston Churchill could and could not do as Prime Minister during the war.  It gives a good image of Churchill's insistance on action, not just defense, while realizing the UK could not afford to sustain the casualties it took during the First World War.  It describes well how he had to manage as a diminishing power against two rising powers, the US and the USSR.    The book describes well the interplay between Churchill and his leading aides and competitors for political power and the concern shown that he would try very risky epedients to get back on the continent and have Britain show it could hold up it end of the alliance.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|This is one of the greatest series of all time.  I'd favorable compare it to Deadwood, The Shield, and Justified - only more exciting. Walt and Skyler have a totally disfunctional relationship and Jesse is one of the craziest characters ever.  In fact, everyone of the characters on this show are toitl nuts.
0307454541|2.0|I feel like I was completely duped. All I heard about this book for years was that it was SOOOO GREAT. Well, I beg to differ. There were a few passages that held my interest but they were very few and far between. I love to read and love books but this one was just way too dull, plodding and dreary for me. I kept forgetting which Vanger was which, and stopped caring very early on. The mention of sandwiches OVER AND OVER AND OVER again got really tiresome, too. What was that about?? It seemed like every other page had a mention of someone making sandwiches again. Weird. The whole free-love/open-marriage theme kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, too. I am no prude but that was just so gratuitous. I was NOT impressed with this book whatsoever and really don't understand why it is so wildly popular.
0061537969|4.0|I read this book last winter over vacation, at first I was not sold on the idea of the book. I am a stock car wrench by night, have been for 26 years. So for the most part any book I ever read that used auto racing as a hook was usually way off base in the \\"technological\\" part of the writing.<br /><br />This story told by dog gets better as it goes and for the most part is spot on about racing, bonus! The book is well written and flows very well. The story is one for our times for more than one reason. I think many people can or will identify with different parts for many reasons. Something most books cant accomplish.<br /><br />Pick it up and sit back and enjoy.
B00000DCHD|5.0|Every song on this album is really great at matching the mood of the music to the song. It's got big hits and songs that would have been hits just the same if they'd been released as singles. The first album ever to be released on CD in 1982.... maybe because they knew people would buy it again even if they already owned the record. It's just THAT GOOD.  This is the kind of stuff I play for my kids to listen to so they can understand music beyond the rehashed pop dribble they call music today. Billy deserves all the fame and notoriety because he has proven himself a unique talent for the last 35+ years.

0307454541|3.0|This book has gotten such great reviews, but maybe that was for the original. I find the translation somewhat stilted like it had been written before modern authors like Hemmingway.<br />Maybe an American writer will decide to do a translation that is more hip and moves along smoothly so a reader doesn't get tired by the boring style as by this translation.

Since I cannot attend a Donna Kato class in person, I am always eager to add another Donna Kato book to my collection. I also purchased Kato's Millefiori Techniques at the same time. Both books are terrific, as well as Amazon's price and delivery time.
B00337KM2S|4.0|This movie is different and interesting enough to be fairly engaging, so I had no problem staying focused from start to finish, and I often couldn't predict what would happen next (which is good).  And most broadly, the movie portrays the important lesson that, in our quest for meaningful lives, human relationships may be the best we can do.<br /><br />But I was bothered by a few things, so I have to drop my rating to 4 stars.  Most prominently, the main character Ryan strikes me as implausible: he's handsome, charismatic, can empathize with the people he lays off, and generally seems mature in many ways, yet he inexplicably goes to extremes to avoid close relationships; also, he likes to be pampered while traveling, yet he tolerates spending his relatively few days at home in a somewhat dumpy little place.  Similarly, I found it implausible to see how Alex, his female counterpart, was clearly sending him signs of romantic interest, yet in the end turned out to supposedly not be interested at all.  Likewise, I found the character of Natalie to be somewhat of a stereotyped cliche.  Last but certainly not least, I didn't find that the portrayal of the people being laid off effectively connected me with the distinct pain they must have felt at that moment.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, this is still a good movie overall, and many people will find it worth watching.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|This soundtrack really helped draw the fans into the feeling of the movie. Even though the release date is not until June 30th, the soundtrack makes you feel part of the movie. I cannot wait to watch the movie to determine if my visualizations of the soundtrack go along with the actual scenes. This soundtrack has some very interesting lead-ins to the music. \\"Ours\\" is my favorite on this CD so far. I actually bought the soundtrack at the local coffee house because the song titles looked so interesting. After listening to this CD, I am inspired to buy the two previous soundtracks.

031606792X|2.0|As the Twilight series continued, what started out as a mediocre book blossomed into a subpar series.  While none of the books could ever be considered great literature, the quality steadily declined from the first to the last novel.  This one features more disturbing elements (Edward's controlling behavior, the imprinting of Jacob on a baby still covered in placenta practically) but never seems to bring about the emotional high that was the saving grace of the others.  While in Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse Meyers taps into the well of human reactions and psyche (however shallowly), Breaking Dawn doesn't quite make it.  The action rises and rises but the denoument is so unsatisfactory it leaves even the most hardcore fans salivating for some kind of legitimate conclusion.  Akin to George Lucas's sing-song happy ending of The Return of the Jedi (which at least had the appeal of being substantive in the rest of the series if we don't count the newest three films), all the vampires and werewolves resolve their differences and live happily ever after forever and ever and ever (since none of them seem to ever die) in a perfect paradise where they also never eat humans.  The big threat that will destroy them all is neutralized by one piece of information from Alice and the big showdown just sort of dissolves in one big anticlimactic heap.  Isn't that peachy.  The end is just one big cliche-fest, which might be alright if she hadn't already worn out every aphorism, cliche, and tired metaphor in literature in the first three books.  As it is, the ending is almost unbearably sticky-sweet.  There is no real loss or hardship to remind the characters of how phenomenally lucky they are or how truly beautiful life is.  There is no real risk or danger, even though there is a potentially serious threat to their existence, and so it almost feels as if they cheated.  The best resolution involves real struggle which takes from the characters and makes them question the meaning of life and their place in it.  When everything is basically handed to them, that appreciation of and meaning to their lives falls flat and stagnant.  The rest of the plot is uneventful.  Whenever there seems to be a bump in the road, Meyers carefully removes it before anything too dire happens.  Jacob finally gets it through his head that he can't have Bella -- so he imprints on her child instead, bringing in the vague concept of pedophilia.  Seen through a certain lens, this book almost encourages it by saying that it's okay for Jacob to be totally and completely in love with a baby who hasn't even mastered basic motor skills or language because it's meant to be.  No, that excuse will not get you out of jail when you molest a thirteen-year-old.  Bella is perennially clumsy and uncoordinated as a human -- forever a hindrance to her abilities -- but as a vampire she's the most naturally talented of them all, and has more self-discipline and control than any newborn they've ever seen!  Golly gee!  To top it all off, she gets everything she wants in one fell swoop: a baby, a new life as a vampire, and basically an entire makeover.  The message here: the most fulfilling life is one where you're a happily married gorgeous mother.  Like all the other books, it's a clear case of teenage wish fulfillment.  Everything she ever wants comes true and all the roadblocks get magically cleared away so she can live this dream for the rest of eternity.  Aside from the banal plot, the characters continue to be basically one-dimensional.  Bella manages to balance her attention (which is where all her personality is directed) between Edward and Renesmee (a name even worse than Albus Severus Potter).  She literally has no life without the two of them.  Additionally, all her time is spent either catering to the every whim of one of the two of them (what a brat that kid's going to be) or having wild jungle sex with Edward for eight to ten hours straight every night because vampires don't gettired.  Ultimately, this book and this series preys on the insecurities and desires of a wide variety of people, but mostly girls and mostly younger girls (although let's not exclude guys, here, either).  By creating a shell of a character anybody can easily fit themselves into, everyone can experience, however briefly, the same fulfillment of all their unrealistic hopes and dreams -- a perfect man, a perfect life forever, and unblighted happiness.  To an even greater extent than Disney ever imagined or Barbie ever hoped, the Twilight saga has latched onto the minds of young girls like the proverbial blood-sucking leech and will forever warp their ideas of love, relationships, and happiness.  At least therapists will have plenty of work in the next few decades when these kids grow up and realize that Edward is an unrealistic idealization and that happiness is intertwined with hardship and sorrow.tired.

B0031ZWZR2|1.0|The review below is almost word-for-word what I wrote for the series \\"Invasion: The Complete Series,\\" but with \\"Flash Forward\\" replacing the word \\"Invasion.\\"  Once again, ABC cheats the viewers by not offering a finale to a huge cliff-hanger.  If you have more money and time than you know what to do with, buy this DVD.  I, on the other hand, will not watch any more continuing series on ABC.  --------   This was one of my favorite sci-fi series of all time. Well-written, well-paced, and suspenseful throughout. However, in a continual show of their arrogance and disdain for their viewers, ABC produced and presented a highly suspenseful cliffhanger season-finale, and then canceled the series. At the very least, they should have filmed one more episode and given us somewhat of a resolution. Instead, they left us wondering ... what happened?  I spent a lot of time watching this series and got no payoff. A complete series (attention ABC) has a beginning and an end. \\"Flash Forward\\" has a beginning and a middle.  Warning to buyers! I wasted a year watching this show. If you buy this series, you will be wasting both your time and hard-earned $$$.  First, ask yourself this. If ABC offered to sell you Star Wars: Revenge of the Jedi, but edited out the climactic battle at the end of the movie, would you buy it? I don't think so. That's what you get with Flash Forward-The INComplete Series.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I didn't read the reviews before I ordered the dvd - those critical of Pierce Brosnan's singing might have discouraged me and I would have missed the most delightful of shows. Maybe if you just watched it once you would not have picked up on the brilliant direction of this film. I've seen it probably twelve times in the month I've had it and am still catching the little subtleties that are seemingly everywhere (lady director) and have to admit I like Pierce's singing - but then I liked Eastwood and Marvin's singing in Paint Your Wagon. This is wonderfully cast, and the performances are unforgettable, but be warned the music keeps playing on that jukebox in your mind.
B003D83DPA|4.0|There had been numerous appreciation and criticism around this video. Especially given that Dire Straits don't play any more as a band together, this is still probably the best bet of having a blu-ray compilation of this good old band.<br /><br />Video encoding is 4:3 structured into a 16:9 format. So this keeps the auto stretching of this video to 16:9 by respective players. May be that's how the encoder's preferred it to be potentially in keeping down the grains. Audio in DTS-HD is fine for a 1983 recording.<br /><br />Amazon had been delaying the release of this blu-ray for numerous times over past few months. Finally gave up and ordered from Switzerland at much cheaper price.
0786868724|5.0|It doesn't matter if you believe or don't beleive in God or religion, the author tries to prove a point that we can have a little faith in our fellow human beings.

0805091742|3.0|Gawande made his point brilliantly in the first half of this slender book.    Perhaps the publisher needed much more in order to get $24.50 for it.  The latter half produced little additional understanding of the need for checklists.  You can sense an editor miming the taffy pull, a broadcasting hand signal to stretch things out.    Nor was there a practical \\"how\\" dimension to the book.  I know reviewers here say that wasn't Gawande's intent.  But the publisher's subtitle - How to Get Things Right - implied that it was.

6305090564|3.0|The Pluses:    The acting by the leads is good.  I love horror films in which a small group of people are brought together and required to overcome their differences for the sake of mutual survival in a scary and hostile environment, usually one that they are trapped in for awhile.  Also, nice if they are heavily armed so we can see alot of gunfire during their battle for survival.    The Negatives:    This film is a bit too long.  I think trimming a half hour off of it would have helped.    Also, this is one of those early films that relied too heavily on obvious CGI monsters (obvious because the lighting on them does not quite match their environment) that briefly pop up at unexpected moments.  Basically there is just a jumble of CGI tentacles coming through pipes and walls and doors through most of the film.  Finally, at the end of this overlong film one gets to see THE monster which is some sort of giant man eating octopus...I think.  If they had just used a few actors in rubber octopus suits that attached and ate expendable cast members who had occasionally wondered off by themselves, then that would probably have been MORE effective!    Overall:    Yeah, I would still recommend this film to the sci-fi / horror film fan just for the excellent acting by the leads and the claustrophobic environment of the ship they are all stuck on.  The explosions look good, too.  But, be prepared, because I think you will find the giant sea monster a bit of a disappointment.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|After some gift cards, a discount coupon, and twelve bucks out of my own pocket, I finally purchased the remastered Get Your Ya-Ya's Out concert package.<br />First up, the dvd. While only twenty-seven minutes in length, it is precisely what the movie Gimmie Shelter is not and for that, I am eminently grateful. If only we could have the entire show put out coupled with the priceless off stage footage of the band instead of lawyers and promoters, you'd have a documentary of the tour that would be the fitting tribute it started out to be. There are five full songs (Prodigal Son, You Gotta Move, Under My Thumb, I'm Free, and Satisfaction), some backstage celeb moments, and other little tidbits from both the pre-NYC shows as well as a few candid moments with Ian Stewart, Mick Jagger, and the Grateful Dead before Altamont. Lastly, there is a brief blues piano interlude from Keith that sounds exactly like those legendary Toronto tapes that were recorded many years later as he faced heroin charges and imprisonment. What price would you put on this rare footage?<br />There are three cds, one being the original release. The secondary cd of the unreleased tracks from the MSG show fairly completes what has long been missing and available on other boots of the tour and features a particularly endearing flub during Prodigal Son. A common whine is that they should've released the entire show, chronologically without editing. For those ocd among you, search out the numerous bootleg sites on line and buy it yourself or mix these songs together and form your own one disc set, but quit crying already. Is it just me or are Stones fans the biggest complainers in the world?  The third cd is the long overdue release of the opening acts. B.B. King is in fine form, easily as sharp and well-oiled as on Live at the Regal or at Cook County Jail. Although a short set, it's definitely something I'll be listening to often. Similarly, the brief Ike and Tina Turner portion is equally entertaining and the sizzling and sultry performance of I've Been Loving You Too Long loses nothing in the absence of her microphone stroking visual.<br />Lastly, the other items include a postcard replica of the tour poster, a freebie download of a song for Guitar Hero 5 (don't own), and a hardcover mini-book with photos, an essay, and some fan notes. Nothing major, but goodies nonetheless.<br />In summary, unlike so many packaged re-releases with supposed goodies and extras, the extra material herein is truly worthwhile and stands alone. There was not the option to simply get the bonus stuff without the additional copy of the original recording, so crying over what won't be is pointless. For me, this box is measured by the value herein and not so much by the price tag. Is it worth what it?

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I can honestly say The Millennium Trilogy was not what I expected! If I had to point out what I liked best I would say that it's the feeling that it's \\"crafted\\" rather than just \\"written\\". The plot is so thick and so many events and details are taking place that one can't help but be impressed.<br /><br />It's such a shame the author is dead because I definitely wanted to continue reading about these fascinating characters! I did like how it ended though, it felt right to me, very appropriate. The story was gripping and while some parts were definitely harsh to read, particularly in the first two books, I would definitely recommend this book to others.
0345495004|4.0|Great read for a book club.  While no one \\"liked\\" Frank and Mamah, they did generate a lot of discussion.

B00000DGUY|4.0|Dire Straits have released three Greatest Hits style compilations, and all of them contain some notable flaws. You'd think after three goes at it, they'd get it right, but apparently not so. 'Money For Nothing' contains some glaring omissions, while the 2CD 'Private Investigations' sounds more promising until you realise it also contains Knopfler's solo stuff. 'Sultans Of Swing' is probably the best of the bunch, since every album is represented to some degree, and it does contain most (if not all) of what fans want to hear.    As expected, the collection is dominated by 'Brothers In Arms' ('Walk Of Life', 'So Far Away', 'Your Latest Trick', 'Money For Nothing', and the title track) and 'On Every Street' ('Calling Elvis', 'Heavy Fuel', and the title track). That's fair enough I suppose, although it's a pity that a few more songs from the band's early days couldn't be included. There's certainly no arguing with 'Sultans of Swing', 'Lady Writer', 'Romeo And Juliet', 'Tunnel of Love', or 'Twisting By The Pool', but it would have been nice to include 'Down To The Waterline', and once again they leave out 'Industrial Disease'. There are a couple of other issues, in that several songs are presented in abbreviated radio edits instead of the album mixes, and the inclusion of Mark Knopfler's solo track from 'Local Hero' doesn't make much sense.     It's a pity that there's no one Dire Straits collection that provides a really comprehensive summary of their career, but we have to make the best of what we've got. Although it contains a couple of flaws, 'Sultans Of Swing' is the best bet for casual fans looking for the big hits, and newcomers to introduce themselves to the band.
B001FB55H6|5.0|What word comes to mind when thinking of this film? Wow! Plain and simple. This film, never mind a graphic novel adaptation, is a masterpiece. The visuals are truly breathtaking. If you are on the fence about purchasing this film, don't be. You won't regret your decision!

B002WCLG48|4.0|I was going to make this a decent review but Amazon unfortunately screwed up the original and I don't feel like retyping it all.    Overall this is an excellent DVD set graphically, visually, acousticly, and story wise but has a tendency to be a bit of a downer. Not surprising considering the nature of the Halo universe and how humans get the short end of the stick. That said some stories are also incredibly up lifting while at the same time being somewhat depressing.    And while Halo Legends is not exactly a thought provoking master piece I found myself contemplating the themes of each story, except one, quite deeply even several days after viewing them.    A word of warning \\"Odd One Out\\" attempts to be funny and crackish but in my opinion it is exceedingly stupid.

B001G7SS96|2.0|Will Smith is now, regrettably, experiencing the \\"Scorsese curse\\" -- which is to say that when the auteur is granted an unlimited budget, he lavishes his attention on expansive production rather than focusing on a project's essence.  The result is bloated spectacle.  There's an audience for this stuff; and this epic will be remembered no longer than an episode of bucket-of-popcorn indigestion.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I've used Xbox controllers, Nintendo controllers, and all kinds of other controllers, but Sony's DualShock remains my favorite.  There's nothing against the other brands (unless they're profoundly horrid), but as the PlaySation was my first gaming system, I suppose I'm slightly biased.<br /><br />What makes this DualShock better than its predecessors is that it adds SIXAXIS technology--which allows for slight in-game motion by tilting the controller.  Other than that, there's really no other bonus featu--oh, wait.  The fact that it's wireless is awesome.  That may not seem like a big deal, but for someone who's been using this controller since it first iteration, playing it without a wire is fantastic.  And it's lightweight, too.<br /><br />There are, however, two gripes I have with Sony's newest version.  First, I HATE the new L2 and R2 buttons.  I prefer the tactile \\"punch\\" that the rest of the buttons have, so having these two buttons similar to GameCube's L and R buttons really drives me nuts (that's the only feature I hate in GameCube's controller, too).  There are, however, some Dual Triggers available for $5USD on Amazon.com (and brick-and-mortar stores), so those help out.<br />My other gripe is the charging system.  The USB charging cable is much too short; I have to sit at the edge of my bed when I do this, and when I turn it off, I have to remember to keep the PS3 on during charge.  It's a stinker that Sony requires the system to stay on whilst charging a device.  That wastes much more electricity than need be.<br /><br />But other than those gripes, it's a great controller.  To me, it's the \\"perfect\\" controller because it rests comfortably in my hands, and all the buttons are easily within reach.<br />On to get a second!
B001974DG0|5.0|I just finished reading Watchers and I think it was one of the best boks I have read in a very long time.  I don't know about the movies, but most directors destroy good books with all there special effects, etc.  I loved Mr. Koontz's write-up at the end of the book and I know one day when he is a very old man, still autographing novels Big Foot will be in line waiting to get Mr Koontz's autograph.  As for a sequel to this book, I would not recommend one, because it could never compare with the original book.  I would not read a sequel to the Watchers.  I recommend that everybody read this book. - E. Stein
0375413405|4.0|I purchased this classic cookbook after watching the film Julia & Julia.

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Although I loved the relationship between the Doctor and Rose, Donna is by far my favorite companion of the new Dr. Who series.  Donna is truly a friend to the Doctor.  Their characters bring out the best in each other and the actors have a definite chemistry.  The end of their association was even more heart-wrenching than Rose being cast into the parallel world. David Tennant is absolutely fantastic as the Doctor.  The actors and the writers have done an awesome job reviving the Doctor Who series.
B003BKF696|4.0|Well, since I have all of The National's full-length releases, have written Amazon reviews for two of them, and have seen them live I guess I should weigh in on High Violet. I have never listened to ColdPlay or Interpol, so I am not qualified to determine whether The Nats are ripping them off.    I discovered the Nats by accident when I downloaded \\"All The Wine\\" from a free music site, knowing nothing about the band. I loved that song and the 1980s post-punk, WirePsycheldicFursNewOrderJoyDivision vibe that permeated the Alligator and Boxer. That vibe continues on High Violet to some extent although a few of the songs veer toward dense aimless noddling, than to music by the latest critics darling. Also, I can't tell if these guys are great musicians cuz they seem intent on creating a mood rather than displaying musical chops. I remember not being wowed by their musicianship when I saw them live a few years ago.    All of their releases have something to recommend them. I find High Violet to be a good listen, a little dense and murky at times. I don't attempt to analyze the poetry/lyrics of Matt B. but occasionally a lyrical couplet or a line stands out and sticks with me. If anything, his lyrics seem more concise here and less like amateur Poetry Night at the coffeehouse. High Violet is certainly performed with intensity, which is not always a good thing as this approaches arena rock levels throughout. Hopefully they will re-visit the low-key vibe that existed on their debut, the one with the dude in the swimming pool on the cover. I'd like to hear what they sound like now with the intensity reined in a little.    Yes, there is something about the Nats that I like. The less-stellar songs on High Violet aren't that bad and a few of them are outright moving. My favorite is \\"England\\". I love that song. It works for me the same way that lovely \\"Ada\\", from Boxer worked for me. The best National songs are mesmerizing, the average National songs don't send me running out ofthe room. The bad ones..well none of their songs are bad, actually.    Here is my unsolicited rank of the National releases.  1. Boxer  2. High Violet  3. Alligator  4. The one with the cover of the guy in the pool.  5. Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers.
B0004Z33EQ|2.0|When we last saw our G. I. John, he was just trying to get something to eat in a town when he was picked on by a mean sherriff who treated him badly. In his PTSD moment, he breaks up the town and ends up on a rock pile for his, uh, criminal mischief. Enter Rambo : First Blood Part 2.<br /><br />His old commanding officer who just glories in his fighting ability, Colonel Sam Troutman, comes to rescue him from the rocks, and offer him a job back home (Vietnam). He is to spy on a camp where Americans are suspected of being held. and report back to base so they can liberate the camp in a daring raid. But we the viewers ask, why do that when we have Rambo?<br /><br />Everything goes wrong from the beginning. He doesn't trust the guy in charge of the operation. He leaves his hair nice and long so every cootie in the jungle has a place to nest. Over the drop zone, he cuts away his equipment and weapon because it is creating a drag on the plane when he is trying to parachute out of it. He is left with his compass and a big bad knife--of course! Ignoring the need for several canteens of water and a machete, our lean, green, fighting machine runs through five miles of jungle to meet up with the sweetest looking Asian flower that side of the international date line. She's even sexier when she slings an AK-47. (I bet she even used real pearl cream).<br /><br />Rambo almost makes it as the rescue helicopter closes, however the mission is aborted by a slimy bureaucrat named Murdoch, and Rambo is stranded. His marketing manager, Colonel Troutman is just as surprised and angry. Even though he is a Green Beret too, he does nothing when a gun is pulled on him. When he returns to base, he gives the unrepentent Murdoch, hell. \\"Just wait till Rambo gets his mitts on you,\\" is what he might as well have said. I kept hoping Troutman would have kicked the guy's a-- at this point, but he is better at looking vexed. (Some friend)!<br /><br />In their attempt to free the prisoners, Rambo gets captured, and sadistic Russian paratroopers, wearing sweaty berets in the jungle, fly in to torture him. Now, poor Rambo has run through the jungle, without water, no food, no sleep and now he's being tortured, to boot. It's only been, what, 24 hours? Rambo is forced to entrap the rest of the operation by radio, in front of his captors. Rambo finds the right freq, and sends the chilling message, \\"Murdoch, I'm coming to get you.\\" It's at that moment that our hero swings back into action. Airborne!<br /><br />Hooking up with the girl again, the dialogue gets heavy. She talks and Rambo says yes five times. Then, he says no. What emotional depth! What economy of energy and dialogue! Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. (I told you the dialogue would get heavy). She dies and Rambo goes on a tactical rampage killing those sadistic Russian paratroopers and VC in the jungle--the place he calls home. Without stopping so much for a sip of potable water from a Lister bag, Rambo frees the prisoners, and commandeers a helicopter, which he just so happens to know how to fly. Only his Russian torturer is in full pursuit using a massive Soviet Hind-24 helicopter, but Rambo has a ruse. He pretends to be dead as the helo hovers, and just as the Russian lines him up in his sights, our hero pulls out a LAW, or light anti-tank weapon, and fires through his windshield, blowing up the Hind. He used the LAW so skillfully that no one in the chopper gets killed from the backblast. Actually, there isn't even a backblast. Hoooo-waahhhhh!<br /><br />Rambo returns, and just when you expect him to kick the livin' snot out of Murdoch, he instead shoots up the place, misses stabbing his head by milimeters and tells him that there are more prisoners out there. \\"Find them, or I'll find you,\\" he whispers, as we imagine Murdoch relieving himself with his pants zipped up. (Mama Mia! That's a spicyia meataball)!<br /><br />At the end, I really expect Rambo, the Ultimate Assault Weapon, to ask the colonel \\"Wherethe hell where you when I needed help?!\\" Johnny Rambo is all kinds of forgiving as the colonel tells him he could get a second Medal of Honor for his action. (Actually, no you can't). But the Johnny Rambo that comes rotaring home, goes walking off into the sunset after 48 hours of having run five miles through a jungle, having gotten no food or even a sip of water, having blown up a gun boat, having been tortured, having the girl die in his arms, having killed others bare-handed, and still not having gotten any sleep.<br /><br />Our hero is tough! He won't even ask for a snow cone, a cot, or a bath.<br /><br />There's plenty of action and automatic weapons' fire here for those who wish to leave reality at the Line of Departure, and indulge their wildest macho, military fantasy, free America of its Vietnam agony, and destroy the bad guys knowing that they can go into the next room at any time, and take a bath or get a drink. It's one thing to watch it; it's quite another to live it.<br /><br />First Blood 2 should have been the last. This was a complete hemorrhage.all kinds of forgiving as the colonel tells him he could get a second Medal of Honor for his action. (Actually, no you can't).

0143145754|5.0|I realllllly liked this 2nd book from Elizabeth Gilbert. She takes a deep look at marriage customs from around the world and from different times. I learned a lot of information about marriage that I never knew! I learned about religion (s) and customs. It's more surprising then i though! I recommend this book for any person scared of marriage.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the author repeats herself sometimes a bit too much in sentences. Most of the time it helps and clarifies, but very often it is a little irritating.  Ultimately we learn that marriage survives because the institution of marriage adapts to US, not the other way around. It all finally makes sense!
B003JJA59K|1.0|While the actors in the film were very engaging, my first thought after watching the film was, \\"I want the two hours back I just wasted watching this\\".  I kept waiting for the story to get started. I generally like apocalyptic fiction, and do not require a happy ending, but this was just too bleak for my tastes.  The surviving populace seemed to be divided into three one dimensional categories - hopeless, helpless, and predatory.  While many stories in this genre tend to gloss over the decline of human beings into cannibalism by inserting a mind altering disease of some type (kudos for not using that cliche), this film expects us to accept that a significant portion of the population would devolve to cannibalism within a few years of (admittedly) drastic hunger. I just don't see it. While there are isolated cases of people preying on people as food in desperate conditions, the thought that it would be as widespread and as cold blooded as depicted in this film is hard to accept. I believe a more realistic portrait of humanity in these circumstances is packs of traveling protagonists assailed by loan wolf cannibals, rather than the reverse portrayed here. I guess I like my apocalyptic fiction to highlight the positives of humanity, rather than suggesting that those positives are freakish aberrations in a child.
B003954I9C|5.0|Aww... AJ is all grown up!  Thoroughly enjoy this album, from the tough topics to the fun raunchy songs.  This is the first solo album from the group that takes some of the sound, mixes it up, and throws it back at the listener as something completely new to digest.  I loved all the true instrumentation, as opposed to the synthesized music we've all become so accustomed to.  He talked about it for years, and it was worth the wait.  You can tell AJ poured his heart and soul into this album.

B0030U1TLQ|5.0|Disintegration is a landmark achievement in popular music. Frequently heralded as one of the best records of the 1980's and of the new wave/alternative movement, this newly remastered and expanded edition features the original album in new remastered form, mixed louder and with more punch, but at the cost of some dynamic range. As expected from a modern remaster, the overall levels have been increased, but not in an offensive way and the record doesn't suffer from the heinous clipping that some remaster jobs get. Guitars sparkle anew, vocals echo and soar, bass slinks, and drums boom and pop on the twelve original tracks, all of which are classics in their own right. I'll forgo discussing the album in and of itself, because anyone considering buying this already knows that Disintegration is must-own. If all you're looking for is a more modern sound, then you've come to the right place, but never one to skimp, Robert has put together a very solid 3 disc set for the 20th anniversary of the album. The additional discs feature a fleshed out version of the 1990 Entreat live album, including a live take of each of the tracks from Disintegration, in the album's sequential order. These live cuts show the Cure in very solid, if not stellar, form, and is a definite treat for fans. The other disc is a collection of rarities, demos, and unreleased tracks recorded during the Disintegration sessions. Truly one for the fans, this collection of cuts will not likely appeal to casual fans, but for someone interested in hearing the evolution of these songs and of the album as a whole, the rarities collection is an interesting historical piece. I just wouldn't expect it to spend a whole lot of time in your car's CD player in lieu of the album proper. Another excellent addition to the Cure remaster series, I just wish it hadn't taken so long for the album to get arrive. Here's hoping the rest of the planned remasters are a little more expedient in their release.
0385512058|5.0|I consider this book a must-read. It is written cleanly, and organized around a number of relevant, diverse, and inspiring examples, that demonstrate a deep level of understanding and research on behalf of Ferrazzi. More importantly, the concepts in the book, and the light approaches to these concepts, are worth exploration and discussion, especially in our increasingly inter-connected world. Some reviewers have complained that this book is not specific enough in many respects, and they're right. This book is not a hard-nosed encyclopedia with all the information for navigating social events and closing business deals. And that's the beauty of the book. It's a light, efficient, and useful read for all because of this nature. Of course the story-line is a bit gimmicky, since Ferrazzi reminds us of his humble origins every 5 pages, but the treasures of this book are not lost as a direct result of it.    Each section of the book, I believe, provides an important, introductory overview of the power of human relations, harnessed for the mutual benefit of you and the person with whom you decide to forge a personal relationship. The specifics especially come in with regard to small talk and leading conferences. Both can be applied immediately in your personal business world. Ferrazzi also provides insight as to how to appear interesting, which to you skeptics out there, can also be applied to the current world of twitter and facebook. What differentiates you among the millions who are all broadcasting the banal, minutia of their everyday lives? This book gives you the starting blocks to being ahead of the pack. Yes, it doesn't have all the answers. But it gets you started, and in ways other books of its kind cannot. In short, I believe this book is a must-read and and an easy-read. I do not, however, endorse the sequel to this book, Who's Got Your Back. It is nothing like this book.

B0036EBARO|2.0|There's a fine line between homage -- carefully and tastfully reusing and readapting influences -- and tacky parody (imitating for the sake of imitating), and for the first time Goldfrapp have crossed it.    In the previous albums you could hear anything from John Barry to George Delarue and any other number of baroque pop touchstones carefully reworked into a new voice.  And -- unlike Bird and The Bee (for example) -- Goldfrapp lyrics usually have enough resonance to sustain multiple listenings.    Not this one.    I've listened to this album many times, and made an effort to like it.  But with the exception of the last track (Voicething) there's nothing here that matches any of their previous work.  Nothing that sounds inspired by anything greater than an ABBA album.    Sorry, but I expected more.
B002YIHO7I|1.0|I was a bit disappointed with Lovers Rock when it first came out but I grew to like it as a unique jazzy inspired albums with a great variety of instrumentation's.  But Soldier Of Love is a true snooze-fest!  These songs are dark, dreary, flat, boring, uninspired, dull, and forgettable!  I only like The single which was a true misrepresentation of the album.  I was surprised so many users who came on here praising this album.  But time has told the real story.  After Lovers Rock sold 3.9 million and stayed in the top 20 for 6 months, this album is already out of the top 50 and barely went platinum.  Yes, that's right only 25% of the sales of her last CD!  Something is surely wrong with Sade, waits 10 years to make a CD, only starts working on it a year before, and than cancels tour plans.  There will be no tour to even support this album.  She doesn't care about music anymore, and it shows in her music.  Creatively and inspiration wise, she has nothing left to give.

0465043577|4.0|(Note: first, I recommend that readers read Gaetan Lion's excellent review of this book.  My review addresses narrower, somewhat technical aspects of the book.  I apologize in advance for its great length.)<br /><br />Second, some backstory to this book.  Institutional investors such as insurance companies or brokerages usually do not focus on picking stocks per se; rather, they operate like an actuary, selecting the odds of particular outcomes and insuring against the bad outcomes in the cheapest way. For a large number of investors, the returns come from \\"cheaply-held risk,\\" meaning that risky (but potentially higher-performing) assets are insured against massive losses in the least expensive way prudent.  Naturally, a cheap way to hold risky assets is to not insure against risk, but of course this is extremely dangerous.<br /><br />For a smaller number of investors, the returns come from providing the insurance: writing put options, exotic swaps, and so on. Portfolio insurance (in the forms of exotic derivatives) has become a major source of income for the entire FIRE sector. Even if one nets out the immense losses of 2008, it's been a very lucrative business worldwide.  More about that in a minute.<br /><br />As with other forms of insurance, the paramount consideration is pricing risk, which depends on the size and frequency of market fluctuations.  In theory, these fluctuations not only ought to be random, but the frequency of each variation (ranked by size and direction) ought to map out a Normal (Gaussian) curve, as other random phenomena do.  Instead, it maps out other curves.  Since there MANY other curves that could potentially do the job--and softwares for applying them, too--this is not really a serious hurdle.  But the problem doesn't really end there.<br /><br />If anomalies like the 6 May 2010 1000-pt. drop in the Dow were randomly distributed THROUGH TIME, then adapting risk evaluation methods like the Black-Scholes formula (used to compute the value of derivatives) would be easy. Once we've replaced a Normal distribution with something that fits the data, we would still wrongly expect 6-May-2010 shocks to occur very far apart.  But while volatility overall is not at unprecedented levels, individual anomalies are larger and more frequent than ever; and even if we focus on much more commonplace events, we find that they have very un-even distribution through time. In fact, such shifts come in consecutive (or almost-consecutive) bursts; this is known as \\"autocorrelation,\\" and it makes a hash of any effort to actually price risk.<br /><br />Prudence says that capital managers should keep value at risk below 20% of the value of the portfolio, which should be easy with a reasonable amount of hedging.  But if one acknowledges the possibility both of very large numbers of anomalies, AND their autocorrelation (incidence close together in time), then hedging adequately becomes prohibitively expensive, eliminating gains from trading.<br /><br />Mandelbrot argues that the patterns of price changes are fractal in nature; the (log) price history for the Dow, for example, looks rather the same if you show a 330-day chart or a 330-minute chart.  Revealingly, he demonstrates how to use fractals to simulate a fictional trading chart that mimics the statistical behavior of the real stock.  However, after explaining this backstory (and including the marginally relevant story of H.E. Hurst's study of the Nile), the authors have little to add.  This is not the fault of fractals per se; indeed, several studies of multifractal models of asset returns (MMAR) compared to GARCH(1,1) suggest that fractals are indeed a stronger tool for capturing the true risk of asset returns.*<br /><br />Part of the problem may be the difficulty of explaining the mathematics/nature nexus clearly. Mandelbrot is not merely a brilliant mathematician, he's a gifted writer; his 1997 paper introducing MMAR is remarkably easy to read, considering its historical significance.  But for even broader diffusion, a prominent financial editor co-wrote the book, and probably decided the upper limit on how much could be explained to non-statisticians.<br /><br />However, a more serious issue is the lack of rationale for the revised theory.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I should never even have watched the first episode of the Vampire Diaries...<br /><br />I am not the target audience for either the show or the CW network (I'm 35, well past my tween, teen and college years).  Unlike many who fell in love with Dracula, Interview with a Vampire and Anne Rice, I was never into vampires or any other supernatural/science fiction melodramas.  In fact, until recently, I had never even heard of True Blood or Twilight (and I have yet to see either of those franchises).  So you may wonder -- how is it possible that I am now a Vampire Diaries addict?<br /><br />It's really very simple -- vampires or no vampires, it is the best show on television right now.<br /><br />The writing, direction, production, pacing and acting is all superb (especially given how many of the young actors on the show had little or no experience on television series before they landed this show).  The casting was spot-on (especially the three stars) and right from the beginning I was able to relate to all of the characters.  Even the guest stars have been cast perfectly (although given the death toll on this show, I have learned not to become too attached to any of the cast members, be it a guest star or one of the contract players).<br /><br />This show could easily have degenerated into an annoying teenage melodrama (especially since the first season has focused on setting up a love triangle between a seventeen year old human girl and two centuries-old vampire brothers and I have always hated triangles).  Somehow, despite its premise, the actions and reactions of the characters have managed to stay believable (for the most part) and relatable (and I don't even mind the triangle -- yet).  Even the non-supernatural storylines manage to surprise you (the teenagers don't react the way you expect TV shows to write them and the relationships are surprisingly mature, open and real).<br />Thanks to the writers, the pacing of the storylines is so fast that most story arcs begin and end within two episodes, usually by hitting you with shocking cliffhangers which are then answered immediately within the same episode or the next episode.  And, despite the dark and supernatural storylines, the show manages to not take itself too seriously and infuse just enough snarky humor to keep it entertaining.<br /><br />The show runners like to say that what drew them to the show was that it wasn't just about vampires; it was about a town with a rich history of relationships and a history of the supernatural.  That is true, but what drew me to the show were the terrific characters, writing and storylines.  Most of the time, I forget the show is even about vampires (and that is high praise, given that I'm not really a vampire lover).<br /><br />So in sum, despite my normal aversion to teenage shows, vampires and the supernatural, I am now utterly addicted to a teenage vampire drama on the CW called The Vampire Diaries -- in fact, don't bother to call or e-mail me at 8:00PM EST on Thursdays -- I won't answer because I am completely engrossed in the goings-on in a town called Mystics Falls. Come join me -- I guarantee it won't take long for you to get addicted -- maybe then, we can start a support group for TVD addicts.

B00386EZJU|5.0|This has to be one of the best scores that I've heard in a long while. Since Howard Shore scored Lord of the Rings in fact.    The music has been so well blended and cut into the movie......they're practically symbiotic. In fact I can't imagine this HTTYD existing without this soundtrack attached.    Favourite tracks have to be This is Berk, Forbidden Friendship, Test Drive, See you Tomorrow and Where is Hiccup?    I rank Forbidden Friendship highest just for the emotional attachment it makes you feel at that point in the movie. Powell must have really gelled with that scene to write this piece. It just screams Toothless. Additionally if you have pets (and i have a few cats) the impact of this scene will resonate all the more. Never heard a xylophone used so effectively before.    Test Drive comes in a close second for me. Just for that feeling of flight. But with a different twist, a more grandiose feel.    Wheres Hiccup has such a tender solo piano part. I immediately started interpreting it for guitar. A little more difficult.....but that inspirational    This CD has been in my cars CD player for 3 weeks straight now....and I'm still not tired of it....and still play it from track 1 to 25.    I highly recommend it......whether you have seen the movie or not.

B002RSDW80|5.0|Since so many people have already reviewed this movie I will simply add that the casting of parts in this movie is superb!  I have no idea how Meryl Streep is able to immerse herself into a role so thoroughly but you think you are watching Julia Childs--her voice, inflection, mannerisms, tilt of the head and gait are perfect.  This is a fun and entertaining movie and a beautiful homage to Julia who made \\"French cooking accessible for American women without servants\\".  I had no idea how the classic book came about or how Julia became a great cook and American icon.  Bravo to everyone involved in this movie esp. the incomparable Meryl Streep.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|Angelina Jolie is a credit to her profession. I have seen, owned, enjoyed several of Ms. Jolie's films on DVD -- but few more so than \\"Changeling.\\" The film is, in short, a movie and a half. Director Clint Eastwood has given us a well-paced, disturbing (yet strangely uplifting), riveting picture here -- and his choice of Jolie in the lead could have been no better. She gives what one can only aptly call a truly tour-de-force performance here. The lady certainly deserved her Oscar nom for this film, and I'm sorry that \\"Changeling\\" did not make it as her 1st Best Actress win. In looking up that year's winner (2008), one can scarcely criticize Kate Winslet -- always superb as well -- so I'd not deny her what Academy voters considered a deserved win for \\"The Reader.\\" But, I must tell you: Angelina Jolie is absolutely mind-bogglingly superb in \\"Changeling.\\" Her performance is measured, often under-played (to great effect, I might add), and ultimately immensely powerful. One of the film's themes, per website Wikipedia, is female disempowerment. Well, same is a tough sell with Angie around. Her role as Christine Collins, mother to the suddenly-missing nine-year-old Walter, is anything but disempowered -- despite the all-powerful, disgustingly corrupt LAPD of 1928 and/or its fierce machinations. Why? Because Ms. Jolie, as Christine, endures it all -- and she truly is put through the mill here -- with suitable dignity, pride, strength, and a mother's fierce belief in her goal: the revelation of the truth and return of her missing son. Angelina Jolie (very properly dressed, coiffed, made-up and mannered for the period) is alternately intelligent, compelling, emotional -- while never hysterically so, unless due to completely understandable provocations -- motherly, tender and fierce. In short, she alone is perhaps the perfect match for the film's Machevalian LAPD. Several good performances here, to be sure (as well as an excellent script, despite a few unresolved holes, from which Eastwood could shoot so effectively), but \\"Changeling\\" is ultimately a one-woman show: the film belongs to Angelina Jolie; always compelling, worth watching and experiencing -- but, to date, never more so than in this marvelous, frustrating, distrurbing, yet well-worth-the-effort film.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I could not connect to the characters in this book.  The main character cares about nothing (which is fine, it's the author's character, but I cannot relate), but the real problem is with the love interest.  A police officer who falls for a transient hobo (is there another kind?) who was arrested for a brutal murder?  She lets him buy her lunch and asks him to stay at her house after a few sentences of conversation across a couple of days, falling straight into bed.      Even though I didn't buy into the characters, I definitely like the author's style in writing action sequences.  These were well written and very descriptive, forming very clear images in my mind as to what was happening.    As a cheaper ebook, I'd probably try another to see if the author evolves/improves in sketching characters, but based on this first taste of this recurring character at this price, I'll probably look elsewhere for a popular fiction series to read.

0374531269|4.0|A Long Way Gone is a an auto biographical novel of Ishmael Beah.  It is his personal story of war in the Sierra Leone.  It all starts in 1993, when Ishmael is 12 years old.  He recounts that the war broke out in his village Mogbwemo when he was away with Junior and Talloi, learning rap music, at his grandmother's village.  Ishmael sees a Volkswagen pull up to his grandmothers house.  First, a man, vomits blood,  then a woman, and bloody children in the back.  They had tried to escape when the rebels opened fire on them.  That night, he dreams that he is shot.  He wakes up and checks the side where he dreamt he was shot, confused about what was real and what was a dream.  \\"I woke up and hesitantly touched my side, I became afraid, since I could no longer tell the difference between dream and reality.\\"(15)  Ishmael deals with the tragedies of this war in many ways.  He tries to sing rap songs, memorizing more and more lyrics in order to block out the sounds of war.  He also guides his thoughts back to his childhood, to happier days in his village, so that he can have good memories of these places that are now war torn.  He remembers a man that used to tell him to be like the moon.  His grandmother explained that the sun is sometimes to hot, and the rain is not always good, but the moon gives much happiness-therefore we should always try to be good to others, as the moon is.  \\"A lot of happy things happen when the moon shines.  These are some of the reasons why we should want to be like the moon...\\" (17)  \\"Whenever I get the chance to observe the moon now, I will see those images I saw when I was six, and it pleases me to know that that part of my childhood is still embedded in me.\\"(17)           Throughout the book, Ishmael uses stream of consciousness to go back and forth between his new life in New York City, his life during the war, and his childhood, before the war.  \\"A shudder racked my body, and I tried to think about my new life in New York City, where I had been for over a month,.  But my mind wandered across the Atlantic Ocean back to Sierra Leone.\\" (19)  \\"We opened fire until the last living being in the group fell to the ground.  We walked toward the dead bodies, giving each other high fives.  The group had also consisted of young boys like us, but we didn't care about them.  We took their ammunition, sat on their bodies, and started eating the cooked food they had been carrying.  All around us, fresh blood leaked from the bullet holes in their bodies.\\"(19)    \\"I stayed awake all night, anxiously waiting for daylight, so that I could fully return to my new life, to rediscover the happiness I had known as a child, the joy that had stayed alive inside me even through times when being alive itself became a burden.  These days I live in three worlds: my dreams, and the experiences of my new life, which trigger memories from the past.\\"(20)  He shares another painful memory of the rebels coming to their village, and the sick twisting of meaning and symbols during the war.  \\"One of the messengers was a young men.  They had carved their initials, RUF, on his body with a hot bayonet and chopped off all of his fingers with the exception of his thumbs.  The rebels called this mutilation \\"one love.\\" Before the war, people raised a thumb to say \\"One love\\" to each other, an expression popularized by the love and influence of reggae music.\\" (21)  After many years of war, Ishmael goes back to his uncle's home and meets Mr. Kamura.  Mr. Kamura works for the UN in the CAW program (Children Associated with the War).  He announces to Ishmael, that he has been chosen to go to the UN in New York City, to talk to people about the war.  This is how Ishmael comes to the United States.  He is among 57 children among 23 countries who have gathered to tell their stories at the United Nations First International Children's Parliament.  Relationships are made and Ishmael goes back to Sierra Leone with great hope.  There is peace for a time and then, another democratically chosen government is overthrown, bringing another war.  Ishmael doesn't know if he can make it this time.  \\"The entire nation crumbled into a state of lawlessness.  I hated what was happening.  I couldn't return to my previous life.  I didn't think I could make it out alive this time.\\"(203)           Though his life has been filled with tragedy, the author finds wisdom and joy in the memories of his childhood.  The author uses stream of consciousness and tribal story-telling to weave his novel and share his heart wrenching war-torn life in Sierra Leone.  His tale is a real account of modern-day war and a call for the world to wake up and work to put an end to it.  Ishmael also communicates the complexities of the war.  He ends the novel by sharing an old riddle told to the children of Siera Leone once a year.  The story goes that a hunter is hunting a monkey.  The monkey speaks: \\"If you shoot me, your mother will die, and if you don't, your father will die...\\"(217)  The children are asked, \\"What would you do if you were the hunter.\\"  Ishmael ends the novel by sharing his answer.  \\"When I was seven I had an answer to this question that made sense to me.  I never discussed it with anyone, though, for fear of how my mother would feel.  I concluded to myself that if I were the hunter, I would shoot the monkey so that it would no longer have the chance to put other hunters in the same predicament.\\"(218)

0307346617|2.0|I found out about this book by accident, when I went to Borders and asked about it (I couldn't remember the author's name) she led me right to a table where they were piled up. She said it was on summer reading lists for high school students and that made me suspicious.    The whole thing just never feels the least bit authentic; for an oral history it doesn't sound like real people talking at all. Then there are the shoehorned footnotes, my favorite was a guy explaining he was the SAW gunner, and in the same sentence said it was a light machine gun. The author felt in necessary to make a footnote describing the SAW as a light machine gun. You could have removed about a hundred and fifty pages from this thing. It's just a monotonous string of caricatures in a hodgepodge story about a zombie apocalypse.    It probably would have been better if done in the style of \\"Hiroshima\\", only because you wouldn't have the terribly awkward dialogue and back and forth between the fictional interviewer and interviewee.    It's just bad writing.
1416955070|5.0|This book surprised me in a lot of ways. Not only was it full of twists and turns, but the characters were written very well. I've come across many books where only one, maybe two of the characters appealed to me. That was not the case here... I didn't meet a character that wasn't so interesting, I couldn't help but love them. The romance in this book is also wonderfully written. I know others have said that it makes them \\"uncomfortable\\" but it didn't have that effect on me. In fact, I thought the author made a huge risk by putting this romance into the series, and it paid off. I was so pulled into Jace's world, that relating to Clary was very easy. I was rooting for these two from the moment they met, and it was easy to see that this was going to carry the whole series to the very end.    This book was also extremely funny. I found myself laughing and that rarely happens to me over a book. I really enjoyed the time I spent with this series. All the books were excellent. I am so glad that this series was recommended to me, and I would recommend them to everyone else! I'm just sad it's over.     The only complaint I do have is that, once the last book ended (City of Glass)... you are left with a feeling that, \\"it shouldn't be over.\\" There is so much more to tell and the reader wants to know, \\"what happens now?\\"  Maybe one day Cassandra Clare will tell us more? Gosh, I hope so!!    If you loved the Twilight series, I could almost be sure you'd love this.

B003MOHX8S|5.0|Two Steps From Hell has only just started selling their music to the public.  That's because, like other \\"trailer music\\" companies, their music is normally licensed directly to the marketing departments for moves like No Country For Old Men or The Dark Knight.  However, TSFH is the cream of the caviar, and online piracy (yes, unauthorized youtube uploads qualify) has built them a surprisingly large fanbase.      tldr; We are extraordinarily lucky that they have deigned to us to buy their glorious, magnificent amazingness this is so good
0307454541|2.0|I'm getting tired of buying books that critics have raved about, only to find that they stink.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of those books.  The pacing of this novel is incredibly slow, often getting mired in backstory and explanations, not to mention the mind-numbing repetition of the same facts: I have a memory.  I get it.<br /><br />None of the characters in this story were very interesting; they all played into some tired cliche or other, i.e. male crusader who is irresistable to women, pushy, manager type woman who has sex on her own terms, abused young woman.  I was not invested in any of their story lines, and found the plot contrivances and the characters' supposed motivations to be ridiculous.  The main character, Mikael Blomkvist is portrayed as being an honest and decent guy bent on exposing fraud.  I thought he was a self-righteous jerk.<br /><br />In addition to the horrible cliches and bad writing, I found the descriptions of sexual torture to be gratuitous and upsetting.  Other reviewers have commented that there is not a clear enough tone of condemnation in the novel for comfort, and I have to agree.  And the ending, when everyone agrees (against their better judgment) to stifle the revelation that one of the Vanger family members is a kidnapper, torturer, and rapist, I wanted to throw up.<br /><br />Overall, I have no idea why people have found this book so interesting.  Poor plot that tries to be complex, and fails, one-dimensional, unlikable characters, and shoddy writing make this a pass.

B0027WNRIG|1.0|If they offered a remaster of Pyromania for $15, this would be a 5 star review, but they offered the famous LA show from '83 as an extra, and charged extra, and that is what most people are buying this for.  But the concert is HEAVILY edited.  This concert (which was broadcast over the radio in it's entirety) clocks in at 100 minutes.  But this CD cuts it down to a little over 70 minutes, that's almost a half hour cut out.  Now about 10 minutes is extraneous applause between encores, but besides cutting out almost all of Joe Elliott's between song banter 3 songs themselves are heavily edited:  Hit And Run which clocks in at 10:18 was edited to 6:14.  Travellin' Band which clocks in at 8:43 was edited to 5:31.  And most egregious, Rock of Ages, originally 13:49 was cut to a mere 4:53.  That's over half of their biggest hit at the time just cut out!  Additionally the 2 1/2 minute Phil Collen guitar solo after Switch 625 is just tossed away.  The odd thing is that they could have fit almost an extra 10 minutes on just the single CD, and could have fit the whole concert in if they put the first few songs on the end of the 1st CD (the studio album).  There is no excuse for this and because of this anyone who is buying this for the live concert should track down a copy of the radio broadcast instead.  The CD might have better quality, but with the radio broadcast at least I feel like I'm listening to a real concert, not a hack job.
B003L0V758|5.0|I knew from the moment I saw the video for \\"Tightrope\\" that there was something special about Janelle Monáe. With so much thoughtless and aimless music being released in today's music biz, to find this album is incredible. This young lady has a passion for this music and it shows in each thought provoking track. I am finding words for this album hard to come by. Excellent, passionate, incredible barely scratch the surface for this young lady's talent. You have to listen to this album with an open mind and a true love for creative talent. Then and only then will you be totally fulfilled by the musical buffet that Miss Monáe offers. There is nothing typical about this, it's true creativity at it's best. I only wish the world would open their ears and minds and take in \\"The ArchAndroid\\" genius. 18 tracks and no filler. Great job Janelle and company really. I wish her the best in this business she deserves it.
B000QCQ8Y4|3.0|I have never had trouble with Child's ability to tell a story. What I don't like is just how this series progresses. You might have a beef with my judging this pretty well crafted story as being a part of a whole Reacher series. Its just that while I can take Reacher saving the day in an epic fashion against a hoard of bad guys, I cant see some nomadic dude wandering across the country ending up in fights equal to James Bond scenarios.<br /><br />Reacher is obviously 100% crafted on the character of Rambo. In Bad Luck and Trouble, he is Rambo with a mathematical mind worthy of Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting. He buys a new shirt twice in this story and changes out of his old one in the store, throwing the old one away. He says that he doesn't like to get bogged down with baggage. Hmmmm, didn't change his underwear for the entire novel? Must have been getting pretty ripe.<br /><br />I really dont like series' that turn the main character into superheros from one book to the next. Here Reacher is not quite a superhero, but he has the ability to be walking down a very busy street talking with his friends and is able to react to the sound of a muffled round being chambered 20-30 feet behind him.<br /><br />Silly timing starts off the book. One of his old army buddies puts 1030 dollars into his account at a bank. Reacher could have gone the next couple of months without checking that balance.<br /><br />Reacher has these seven old army friends that this story revolves around. Their slogan is \\"You do not mess with the special investigators\\". They all are willing to drop everything in order to help each other out. All seven of Reachers friends talk in worshipful observance of the Special Investigators to their friends and families. Why is it that in this, the 11th Reacher book we hear about them for the first time? I know I know, this is a little out of line, but what if it turns out that one of Reachers old jobs was as a stock analyst and he goes and investigates a huge money laundering scheme in the next book. Using his old friends who were once everything to Reacher before he went into the army. I mean, I hate it when an author just lands a huge chunk of important past into a series like Child does here. Especially 11 books in.<br /><br />Bad luck and trouble always finds Reacher. I seem to remember a story where it started off as Reacher hitchhiking and some gang kills the lady who picked him up???Something close to that. I mean, give me a break, one guy just cant step in so many piles of dung.<br /><br />In this story... I AM VERY SORRY (but I cant get into who the bad guys are, its revealed way too far into the book), the bad guys in this book are too insanely impossible. Trust me on this, its almost laugh out loud bad. Suffice it to say that once again Reacher saves the USA from disaster. He sleeps with a woman in a very cold removed manner (every reacher book i have read treats women like a commodity). And he lives up to his very high Rambo personal ethical standards.<br /><br />THe writing - 5 stars, the story - 3 stars. The series at this point, 1 star. If these were stand alone thrillers they would be a lot better.next book. Using his old friends who were once everything to Reacher before he went into the army.

B0000024YL|5.0|As most other reviewers have stated, the recordings here truly are some of Simon & Garfunkel's greatest.  What makes this an essential album -- IN ADDITION TO the duo's regular albums -- is the inclusion of four live cuts and an alternative take of \\"America\\" that don't appear on those earlier albums.  These aren't just rarities that are nice to have; they do much more, providing a fuller picture of duo, flowing together with the previously released cuts in a seamless whole that stands by itself as a great album.    Unfortunately, Columbia/Sony has neglected to remaster this outstanding collection.  While there are other, bigger S&G collections that do have better sound quality, none has the concise yet masterfully selected group of songs that this album has.    Please remaster it!!!
0307454541|2.0|I will admit this book is a page turner at times.  It kept my interest up until I found out that I knew most of the ending.<br /><br />There are two things going on here.  One is the mystery of a child's sudden disappearance and the uncovering of family secrets.  The other is an unnecessary battle between a magazine and their arch nemesis businessman who is trying to bring them down.  Unfortunately, the first story ends too quickly and is unsatisfying (not to mention disgusting at times) and the second story goes on forever and no one cares.<br /><br />Every woman Mikael comes in contact with has sex with him.  He also goes from a journalist to a genius crime sleuth overnight.  This guy is amazing.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is a creepy, vampire woman with a disturbing backstory that has messed her up for life.  I'm not sure how she could ever be considered a likeable character.<br /><br />Nothing original here.  Not when it is obvious how part of the story will end.  At first I could glance over some of the darker parts of the book until they became a larger part of the story.  You can tell a good story without all of the stuff Larsson throws into his novel.  It's been done plenty of times before, but I guess if you make it dark and sadistic, it's original these days.<br /><br />I guess we're just bored with our American mystery writers so we are going to start reading mysteries from other countries that are just like the books we have, but with different places and names.  Give me a break.<br /><br />It was a decent read at times, but disappointing and way too long.  Maybe one day I will read the others, but right now I need a break from this guy.
B003FMTZOM|5.0|Wow. Christina you're really reaching out and opening up with this whole album. What an eclectic mix of heart-felt songs and blatant dance tracks. Sexy and irreverent, yet remaining literally tongue-in-cheek throughout. I give it a five star rating out of five. Of course, I love everything you do. Here's my first reaction to the CD my step-mother (the Chief Flight Attendant) just brought me back from China!    1. Bionic    Bionic, with its staggered beat and reverse-echoed, hole-punched vocals, is one of my favorite tracks on the album. It could be that this is because it's the lead track on the album which has been playing over and over, most of the day and night. The vocal phrasing on this song is immaculate. The \\"Ready to Go\\" part reminds me of that song by Republica. Was that on purpose? X=X-X-T-T-T-I-I-I-N-N-N-A-A-A!    2. Not Myself Tonight     \\"Wanna get crazy?\\" you ask at the outset. X-Tina's breaking out and \\"kissing all the boys and the girls\\" with this one, and you're \\"in rare form\\" from beginning to end. It's definitely sexy enough to turn the boys to men and the men (like me) to boys. Girls are always going to have a love-hate thing with you, Ms. Aguilera, hating the brashness on the surface but secretly wishing they were you when it comes to crafting and delivering a purr-fect song. The last verse sounds like a classic Donna Summer vocal until the robo-hole-punched thing happens again. Thought my player was messing up the first time I heard that, but I think I do like it.    3. Woohoo feat. Nicki Minaj     This one is classic. It defies critique. Hats off to Nicki for the backups and interior rap. The \\"you know you wanna put your lips where my hips are\\" line made me start the track over several times. My eleven year-old son looked at me funny and I had to say \\"Yep, that's what she said\\". This track is best enjoyed with a good set of head-phones in a dimly lit room with a couple of bong rips. The rastafari part at the end makes me wanna scream...\\"Woohoo!!\\"    4. Elastic Love     More electronic pulsations to start the track, and I feel a bit of a Devo influence... maybe a nod to the ladies of the eighties, like Karla DeVito, Whale or Missing Persons. I dunno. It's not noticeably derivative, just seems \\"New Wave\\" in a nostalgic way if that's possible. Oingo Boingo meets Elastica with a twist. Makes me want to hear the Aquilera version of \\"I know What Boys Like\\" by the Waitresses.      5. Desnudate     This one makes me think Lady Gaga has been spinning in the Aguilera iPod a bit. Of course, when Gaga hit the scene, I thought her impersonation of you was pretty good. Her early works weren't that great, and I know she has the Aguilera influence to thank for a few of her vocal stylings. A little droning, but the \\"Get Naked... for Me\\" backup chants and exasperated moans in the chorus and at the end are a highlight. The only thing I don't like throughout the album are the \\"hand-clap\\" drumbeats. They remind me of sitcom laugh-tracks for some reason, like we're supposed to clap along or something. Just a pet peeve, and not that noticable unless you have programmed yourself to notice it, like me.    6. Love & Glamour (intro)     This part is a little self-indulgent, but we loves it when you do that, we do!    7. Glam     THis one substitutes a finger-snap for the claps. Maybe it's because I just watched you, and then Janet Jackson, perform on the American Idol finale', but this isn't one of my favorite songs on the album. I still like it 'cause it's you, but it reminds me of that whispery style that Janet uses all the time now... right up to the middle part where the Aguilera wails come in. That's the amazing part that saves the song. Still, a filler track for you would be a #1 single for Ms. Jackson... 'cept she couldn't pull off the wailing part to save her life!    8. Prima Donna     The farther I go with this album the more I understand the cover art. Amazing vocals with synthesized claps for a snare beat... confusingly electronic but still naughtily nice. \\"I'm a Prima Donna. I can rule the World!\\" indeed!! The bass drum on this one has my speakers jumping around the room. The synth keyboards are mixed so low that the vocal seems almost a capela with drums. The percussion track adds a nice effect at spots and the weird chorus on the backing vocals is surreal.    9. Morning Dessert (intro)     This is some really sexy stuff, pretty lady. \\"Touch me here, touch me there...let me give you Morning Dessert.\\" I hope your guy appreciates this stuff, 'cause the rest of us are getting very jealous.    10. Sex For Breakfast     Excuse me. I'll be back for the next song. I can't write while this one is on. The lyrics are so sweetly cruel. To really experience the vibe of this song, the listener should get some Strawbery Cream and the One you Love handy before starting the track.    11. Lift Me Up     Now, where was I... Oh yeah, the review. Lift Me Up is a hit single for sure! Might have been the best choice for the 1st one out of the gate. A more traditional song than \\"Not Myself Tonight\\" all the way around. The drums sounds are real and not over-played, the bass is very well mixed and though there is still some spacey ambient noodling going on, the vocals are just plain perfect. This is why I started listening to you in the first place. \\"Rise Above\\" Milady, you don't need a boost!! I might have to put this one up on my Blog (just kidding).    12. My Heart (Intro)     Nice touch on the \\"Ma Ma\\" part, Max.    13. All I Need     Please don't ever let anyone cover this song or use it in a commercial. It's so personal, and we do appreciate the window into your \\"real world\\" and the precious relationship you share with your son. As a parent of three, I can identify with the full sentiment of this song. My 24 year-old daughter, Tiger Natasha, introduced me to your music and nearly drove me crazy with \\"Genie\\" back in the day. I called your publicist and arranged a phone interview for her \\"Glitz Teen-Zine\\" website back then and she freaked out. Now, all these years later I'm sure you are a wonderful mother, and now it is I who have become a great fan of your music.    14. I Am     This album is like a trip to Disney World. The electronic pulse is fading and giving way to a very sentimental and traditional sounding core. I love this song. It's a mellow piano ballad, but just as powerful as anything I've heard so far. Reminds me of the better Fiona Apple songs like \\"Extraordinary Machine\\" or \\"Never Is A Promise\\".    15. You Lost Me     The old \\"one-two punch\\", eh? A great piano ballad followed by the jewel of the album. Another single, and I hope this one has a video interpretation, too. I just saw you it \\"live\\" on American Idol! I'd like to see it in person, that is If the tour does eventually happen and I can manage to get a refund for the tickets I bought for the cancelled Summer show in S.F. You should close the show with this song as an encore. Amazing.    16. I Hate Boys     This one reminds me of the \\"Beautifulgarbage\\" era tracks by Shirley Manson and Garbage. Of course, you have a lot more range than Shirl, and they use heavy guitars... but believe me, it's a compliment.    17. My Girls feat. Peaches     It's great how you smoothly morphed back into the cover android at the end of the album. Synth sounds abound, and a cool Elastica-like bass riff, too. Peaches reaches with the \\"BFF\\" bit. Best to leave that stuff for the next Paris Hilton album. It's a Gurl-Power anthem, sort of... but not the best track on your album. It's more like a Pink or Gwen Stefani song, and in high-contrast to the previous three on the CD.    18. Vanity     Are you Snow White or the Wicked Queen? This song would seem to imply the latter. \\"I make myself so much wetter\\" and \\"I turn myself on!\\" are a couple of highlights. My sister talks to the mirror, too, but that's a different story and she takes meds for that. I'm not sure I would have ended the album with this track, but it's agood one for the X-Tina \\"alter\\" files. I think you should perform this one with the Pussycat Dolls or Spice Girls or something for full effect.    All in all, I love this album and will buy copies for all of my friends.  XXXOOOXXX
0646497855|5.0|You know they say you can't make an omlette without breaking eggs. That's what the book is all about then. That's something that you say which means it is difficult to achieve something important without causing any unpleasant effects. At first I just didn't consider Target Band 7 a serious coursebook at all but then things changed suddenly for me. I read the free e-book chapter then found invaluable information that turned out to be one of the most inestimable and rare ingridients of how to make an omlette, of how to pass the exam in other words. If IELTS is an omlette and I have my precious recipe book then, let's see how appetizing my stuff will be on the real day of the examination. Recommended of course, mouthwatering I'd rather say.
B00002R0MC|4.0|i bought the 4 cd box set and i guess i got a special deal because mine only came with 3 of the disks....but the three i got were still worth it....Great!
B000FS9MV0|3.0|Renee has a great voice, but this time tamed down some of the vocal dynamics that I liked in her previous album.  Worth a cheap buy if you like her, but not her best work yet.

We are dependent on him.<br />He is not an interruption in our work - he is the purpose of it.<br />We are not doing him a favour by serving him. He is doing us a favour by giving us the opportunity to serve him.\\" - M.K. Gandhi<br /><br />Delivering Happiness is about Pleasure, Passion and Purpose. Tony Hsieh is an instant inspiration to anyone who wants to start a company and(or) formulate a set of core values that the employees actually follow. As they say, actions speak louder than words. That's exactly what Tony is about. A man of actions. A no nonsense CEO. A no BS leader.<br /><br />What started as a quest for earning money quickly turned into something purposeful. You can feel the transition of Pleasure into Passion and ultimately to Purpose. The Purpose that keeps him, his employees and his customers happy. His thirst for achieving something big is clearly evident in every word of this book. I am sure He will not stop with Zappos! He is meant for something big, something of greater value and purpose.<br /><br />This book is not a biography but gives you a fair picture of Tony's personality as an achiever and a passionate leader, someone who always wants to break the rules and go against conventions to achieve his purpose. A living example of someone who works relentlessly towards his goals. I, for one, drew a lot of inspiration.<br /><br />A company is a living being and it is the responsibility of the leadership to give it a face, a character, a culture, values and principles. Also, employees must be able to connect themselves to the values and principles. Most companies come up with \\"Core Values\\" that employees hardly remember. This book gives you clear understanding of why those values are important and why it is more important for employees to follow them and why companies fail if it fails to inspire it's employees.<br /><br />Tony writes all about this in this fun filled roller coaster ride of successes and disappointments. This is a book of inspiration, motivation, advice. This a book about what makes us happy. This not only applies to running a business, but also to an individual looking for higher levels of happiness in life. This is a fairy tale of hard work, achievement, success, uncertainty and of course, profits. A must read for budding entrepreneurs and leaders who want to build some culture.intments.

1931559317|4.0|I used to use planisphere for a while for finding stars and other sky objects but I thought I could use more detailed information for night sky.    This sky atlas seems to be reasonably well organized for finding or locating DSO(deep sky objects).  With spiral handy book, it's easy to keep same page open for a while compare to other types of paperback which require some other entity to keep the same page.  It's been organized for spring, summer , fall, and winder along with good time zone for observing certain DSOs.  The one thing I find bothering is that on the alphabetical search page, the constellation names and matching page numbers  are printed rather too small to read easily, especially at night with just red dim light.  They could have used larger bold face letters or so for readers to read easily.    However, overall it's not too bad with many DSOs in the constellation with reasonable accuracy for the price.  It's sturdy pocket book for more detailed information compare to most planispheres.    Isaac
B0000AYLLQ|3.0|Not bad, but not the best french language album from Celine.  If you're an english speaking fan, you should skip this album and just buy the On Ne Change Pas which features hits from this album.  The vocals on this album and in general her french albums are just as or sometimes more melodic than her english albums but the vocal strength of the performances are not as dynamic or powerful...but still good enough to buy the french albums for cheap.
B000002AH7|3.0|I am an admirer of both Miles Davis and Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez but I found the combination disappointing. I thought that Davis even sounded flat on occasion. Pity, so I think I'll stick to the guitar version for this piece of music in future and enjoy Miles playing the ballads.
0375842209|5.0|I'm not going to get into the content or plot of this book.I'm going to give my impression of this book.    It's narrated by a sardonic death tired of humanity's unquestionable need to kill one another.From the opening scene to the ending Death literal and figuratively haunt's this novel.It's a dark and bitter reflection on humanity.It's also a story of how we manage to find a small piece of comfort and sanity in a world blown to hell.If you have any interest in war time Germany or the dark side of humanity and how we manage to survive this book is for you.This is one of those books that will haunt me for years to come and is one of the most heart-wrenching book's I've read.    One side note I have no idea why this book was marketed to kids,it's is way to dark for most kids.
1935251740|3.0|Lanza and Berman bring up some interesting points - namely it is humans that superimpose all of the notions of science, religion, etc. on a universe that doesn't exist unless we exist in it. The idea of light being the fastest anything can travel is disspelled, is one of the many notions that science is trying to wrestle with. Biocentrism says it is because of us that we don't understand it and when we think we do, another notion comes to challenge it. The limitations of homo sapien sapiens is also the limitations of science. The key concepts of science and our misunderstandings of them are well-presented in this book. The biggest bump in reading this, was how Lanza interjected his personel trials into the book. Overall, an unusal concept in science that needs more exploration and better work.
