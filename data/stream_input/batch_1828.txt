B008HK3XOU|5.0|There are other more expensive cases but this one is great.  I love the half fold on the back side to use it as an easel and the elastic strap that holds the case closed.  I would buy another case just like this if we get another Kindle Fire HD
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is awsome I love it I love the animals I love the cat and dog the most but they are still all cute.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|Lo recomiendo completamente, son gente seria y justo a tiempo llego todo. Totalmente recomendado, exactamente como la  foto,realmente estoy agradecido. Mi hija se volvio loca cuando se lo entregue!!!
B008G59IBI|4.0|With [[ASIN:B00AHCF9E8 &iexcl;TR&Eacute;!]], Green Day's 2012 Trilogy of albums comes to an end. [[ASIN:B009B50QOU &iexcl;UNO! [Explicit]]] sported the most commercial success (bowed at no. 2 with 139,000) while [[ASIN:B00A12VW86 &iexcl;DOS! [Explicit]]] is arguably the best of the trio though experienced less success.  &iexcl;Tr&eacute;! is expected to sell even more modestly than &iexcl;Dos! did. Sales for none of the trio have been remarkable, but all three albums have been above average and enjoyable. &iexcl;Tre! has its exceptional moments just like its counterparts, epitomizing Green Day's consistency.  Had the best of the three albums been merged into one,  Green Day probably would have had a juggernaut on their hands.<br /><br />\\"Brutal Love\\" opts against the obvious, opening the effort with a mid-tempo rock ballad. Reaching back to classic, traditional rock, there are tinges of country-rock incorporated as well - on a punk revivalist record of all  things! Solid songwriting truly shapes \\"Brutal Love's\\" success: \\"Turn out the lights, close your eyes/turn up the silence, the heartache of your life/dance forever, under the lights, this brutal love...\\" All-in-all, going against the grain bodes well in Green Day's favor on this particular record.<br /><br />\\"Missing You\\" accelerates the tempo with Green Day's signature driven guitars reinstated. The epitomization of bright punk-pop, \\"Missing You\\" is pleasant, sound, and enjoyable.  The songwriting plays like a teen who has experienced his first heartbreak: \\"I'm missing you... you're not around and I'm a complete disaster.\\" Two for two Green Day.<br /><br />\\"8th Avenue\\" delivers this installment's first brief cut (under 3:00). Driving and similarly bright like \\"Missing You,\\" Billie Joe Armstrong reaches back to his youth asking his love \\"...meet me in the bathroom stall/meet me at the whispering wall/before all the flames burn out...\\" On \\"Drama Queen,\\" Green Day contrast tempo again opting for slower cut.  Initially only accompanied by acoustic guitar, bass and drums eventually enter in buttressing the production.  Some musical highlights include the incorporation of piano as well as a bluesy guitar solo.<br /><br />\\"X-Kid\\" also features a killer guitar solo that wails.  Quicker, \\"X-Kid\\" still resists the lightening speeds that truly defined much of &iexcl;Uno!.  As evidenced by previous cuts, Billie Joe Armstrong focuses on youthful themes. \\"Sex, Drugs & Violence\\" truly epitomizes that sentiment, in which Armstrong sings \\"Back at school it never made much sense/now I pay but I can't pay attention.\\" He goes on to finish his sentiment on the chorus: \\"Sex drugs and violence, English math and science/safety in numbers...\\" \\"Sex, Drugs & Violence\\" may be a stretch to make the forty something a teen or twentysomething once more, but it does sound very much like classic punk-revivalist Green Day.  \\"Sex Drugs & Violence\\" ends up being one of the best of the entire trio of albums.<br /><br />\\"A Little Boy Named Train\\" is catchy and possesses a driven sound while \\"Amanda\\" accelerates the tempo even more, finding Armstrong stating \\"I'm not playing with your mind/unless you think I am/and you were crushing my heart/like a battering ram...\\" The lyrics are schmaltzy and ultra cheesy, but assuming Armstrong's sentiment is to deliver &iexcl;Tr&eacute;! from a teenage male perspective, he and his band accomplish that well.<br /><br />\\"Walk Away\\" establishes an anthemic nature on the chorus; by the end, Armstrong adds some extra grit to his distinctive snarl.  \\"Dirty Rotten Bastards\\" reminds one of \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" from American Idiot due to the ambitious stylistic changes.  It's indulgent, Armstrong is profane, and the cut is all over the place - but it is distinct and quite an interesting listen.  At nearly six and half minutes, it is the longest cut on any of the trio.  That said, its restlessness makes the six and a half minutes go by painlessly.<br /><br />\\"99 Revolutions\\" proves driven, quick, and straightforward; just a solid, well-rounded cut.  Closing cut \\"The Forgotten\\" is shockingly tender - almost too much so for the punk-revivalists.  The biggest quibble might be that a five minutes, the cut remains a bit too static and safe, particularly for such a rebellious bunch as Green Day are.  Who else could've made such a political statement with \\"American Idiot\\" in 2004? Quibbles aside, \\"The Forgotten\\" shows off a different side of the band, enhanced further by Tom Kitt's lovely string arrangements.<br /><br />How does &iexcl;Tr&eacute;! stack up? Ultimately it is consistent with the trio.  &iexcl;Dos! still remains my personal favorite and maybe &iexcl;Uno! would be my second choice, but overall, all of the trio are solid affairs.  The argument, as suggest prior, can/will be made that merging the best of each album would've delivered a home run.  That argument aside, those who invested into the trio now have enough Green Day to last them until they record a new album, which only happens every couple of years. A solid close to an underrated trio of albums.d cut.  Closing cut \\"The Forgotten\\" is shockingly tender - almost too much so for the punk-revivalists.

B0055MBQOM|5.0|I'm a professional photographer and having my monitors calibrated is so important. My lab recommended that I use the Color Munki and i've been so happy with it. My colors match up perfect with the lab and my pictures are printing wonderful. So glad I got this.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Fun, fun, fun and very touching too.  I don't know how many &#34;kids&#34; would appreciate this film....but, if you are of a certain age It's a big winner
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|When different generations converge to solve problems, it's priceless!  Brad Pitt does a great job holding the story together.  A movie to view and recommend to others.
B001UDPAB0|4.0|Love these movies and heard the Blu-Ray versions are pretty low quality so I stuck with the regular DVD box set and they seem fine.  Good value overall
B003INBNXO|5.0|I loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is one of my top 5 movies of all times.  I encourage everyone to buy it.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Women will obviously love this film because there are a bunch of very attractive men half naked throughout, although men shouldn't be turned off from this film because of that (the film's opening scene does feature a topless Olivia Munn after all!).  Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's 11 trilogy, Traffic, The Girlfriend Experience) is a masterful director and, despite the story being kind of silly with some crazy Act Three nonsense, the film still is very enjoyable and McConaugheyheyhey gives a great meta-pretty-boy performance.<br /><br />And the dance scenes are pretty amazing...
B0083SBMBM|2.0|Frankly, I was disappointed by this film.  I expected it to be much better than all the superhero films from which it flowed, but it came up short.  The storyline was tediously protracted, with sparse heroic actions taking place, and too many scenes being shot in the dark.  The characters were okay, but the plot was rather banal.  The film's only strength, in my opinion, is when the Hulk picked up one of the villains like a fly swatter and smashed him repeatedly to the ground -- left and right -- in a &#34;pissed off&#34; response to the villain's arrogant assertion of God-like superiority over the Hulk and insulting the Hulk's intelligence.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am a junior in high school and The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the best book I've ever read. I'm the kind of person who will do everything not to read a book but it was on my bucket list to finish a book that I will love. I can now check that off because this is the only book I have read and fell in love with. I almost want to read it over again.
1416562605|5.0|The White Tiger is quite simply a diamond in the rough. It chronicles the tales of how a poor Indian driver breaks the system of poverty and finds wealth. It's a gripping novel about class in modern India, corruption, wealth, culture, and much more. On top of that, the book is simply layered in humor and sarcasm despite it's grim telling.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|great film, great acting.  perfect reboot to bond franchise<br />craig is great, dench is very good too.  poker game scene is great
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love the music.<br />Such a great CD to listen to on my way to school in the morning....<br />Amazing talent!

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app! My husband and I use it all the time. It really helped keep things organized during wedding/honeymoon planning.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great game! Not too hard, not too easy. Creepy storyline. Kept me highly entertained for the evening. This was my first hidden object/Alawar game. I will buy more now.
0394179692|5.0|Re-read this recently after several years, and it still made me laugh like crazy.  Great use of local New Orleans color, and great characters.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|What the hell? This is NOT the same as the app I took for a test drive! There aren't as many sounds or binaural beats, which is the only reason I bought it! This is a SCAM - I want my $2.99 back!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Very fun and interactive. I can spend hours on it. I recommend it to anyone that loves my little ponies. Not only do you get to build your own ponyville but you can play and interact with the ponies as well.
1451613512|4.0|I wonder what  possesses an author to write a book such as this. Is it a resentment of<br />treatment interpreted as unjust, is it love of country and seeking change, or is it the simple<br />knowledge that they can shock. The book is the accumulation of acts of self interest and<br />imperialism. Oliver Stone shows the negatives of each president, starting with Teddy and working right  up to Barack. He reveals foreign policy and the basis for foreign policy of<br />these presidents.<br />  As a Christian I must say that Oliver Stone reveals what many of us have known for<br />a long time, and that is that the U.S. is not A Christian nation any longer.<br />The book is extremely negative- AS Oliver Stone says it will be at the beginning.<br />I gave it a (4) instead of a (5) because by the end the negatives had begun to feel normal.<br />Some positives were needed along the way but there were none
B005LAII1C|5.0|I've been a big fan of Seth Macfarlane's work with Family guy and American dad. If you like those shows, then you'll love this movie. Ted feels like a Seth Macfarlane creation and is a ton of fun.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|So far so good.  Sharpens very well and I have not had an issue with the flip out serrated sharpener yet.  Only time will tell if that is durable enough.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|This enables you top connect an iPad to your digital TV.  Although you get a message that says &#34;Device not supported,&#34; it works great--I've used it for presentations at work with no problem.
B003JBHQP4|5.0|Amazing Product, loved it, great for reading CF card! Very handy device to have :) would highly recommend it to anyone!
B000BF0D9M|5.0|I was just exposed to Jesse Cook via PBS.  This cd set is great! I would recommend to anyone. wanting to feel alive.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is the most amazing Movie in 3D, if you have a 3D TV, then this is a must buy for sure. I think it was restricted to panasonic TV only earlier.<br />I had been wanting to buy it for a long time buy was always 150$ for 3d earlier.<br /><br />Just AMAZING!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Lots of fun. My only complaint is that it takes too long to regenerate energy. otherwise great free game for kindle.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Mcewan gets into a woman's feelings in this book in a way that few male authors can. His scenes between to two lovers are both rowdy  and erotic.
0385360177|5.0|In book two you really get to know the characters and the full story begins to unfold. I couldn't wait to read book three.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a lovely, intriguing movie.  I give it a &#34;14&#34; out of 10.<br /><br />The acting is excellent - each person is totally believable.<br /><br />Well written, well acted - good script.
B004TL3R24|5.0|Excellent accessory to any manfrotto tripod if your looking for a easy fast way to transport your tripod. Comfortable wear, and fast access, highly recommend.
B002R88G4U|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book!It was so easy to understand and like the characters. Have recommended this to so many friends
B0063GORYU|5.0|Would recommend to anyone.<br />Its fast and easy to play. I like playing this game better on my kindle than my laptop.
B006RUJST6|3.0|An easy read. Not very taxing. A good holiday read. I liked the storyline and it was easy to follow
0525423656|5.0|it was a great, quick reading book that i couldn't put down. i would recommend it to other middle school children. i would borrow it to anyone who asked.
B00267QOEQ|5.0|This movie is always fun to watch. I had to make this movie part of my comedy collection. I had to have this movie in 1080p!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Well Done Phillip! I love all songs.  The material is excellent.  I highly recommend this CD.  I can't wait to see you recording your  second album.  Good Luck!
B001HN6940|4.0|I wanted this movie because Tim Burton was a part of it and I'm a big fan of his movies. The movie is just ok, unfortunately. It is neat to watch in 1080p with all the visual effects.  I had to have it for my collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to read the 2nd book. I hope they will the movies of the other books. Great book to read!
0545128285|5.0|My 9 (almost 10) year old son LOVES this book! It's the SAME EXACT tale from Harry Potter!! We are HUGE Harry Potter fans, (I think I may be a bigger fan than my son! Lol) and we were SUPER excited to find this!! I found it over the summer at the library & my son checked it out. After reading it, he REALLY wanted to own it. So, I just bought it for him for Christmas! :) He is going to be SO happy when he opens it!! It is DEFINITELY a must have book! EVEN if you-or your child- aren't Harry Potter fans... It is a MUST HAVE! The tale is that good! It will definitely become a tale that will withstand time, just like the Grimm & Mother Goose tales!!! Do not hesitate... Just BUY IT!! :)
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed the book but at times hated the dialogue. I'm not sure I will be purchasing the next book. It didn't end in a way that I would want me to read more.
B008G12EUY|5.0|I had a problem because a ordered this CD/DVD from Colombia, so I wrote an email to amazon because the the CD didn't arrived on time, and they instantly answered me about the problem that was in customs, so I waited a bit longer and evrything gone right since then.<br />Excellent CD, nice music and I love that you could get music from everywhere without problems.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase.  I got it quickly and it was exactly what I was expecting to get.
B0085YNML2|5.0|I love &quot;munch time&quot;  it is woo much fun. I love the little comelion the most.  I have often wondered what it eating.  Munchy Munchy
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Boy these books just suck you in.... LOVED all 3 of them!!! Wishing there were more books in this series.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|For a free app it is not that bad.  But they do get you to purchase the full version because of the lack of songs.
B009AY04A8|4.0|kind of a fun game but way too much boring dialogue. annoying when you get charged for bad taps just trying to move screen around.
B007SY3CEW|2.0|The same as what I said about the national anthem one.  Some songs are hard but some are easy.  Need more songs.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Phillip is a true musician and has incredible talent. i LOVE every song on this album and I am 58 years young!!!!
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|I read a few reviews and the permissions section of the app description (which I always do,) so it sounded good and I downloaded it. Once I purchased and started installing it, it wanted a permission that was NOT listed in the description. It wants permission to read all of your info...including contacts AND all your personal and confidential info! (There is NO REASON any app needs that kind of permission! (It should only need write permissions.) Once you are at that point, you can uninstall it, but you cannot get a refund for it! They got my money for an app I refuse to use and my tablet has very little personal info on it, so if you don't want to give permission for an app to read your personal and confidential info, don't download! It is not considered \\"stealing\\" if you give permission for them to take it freely. Confidential? Like what? Passwords and charge card numbers? They don't specify.
1401924751|5.0|As with all Doreen's cards this deck is very helpful in assisting you regarding what you may need to do in your life,
B009O07NDY|5.0|Saw the movie and within an hour of leaving the theater had purchased the soundtrack.  There is a distinct carry over from the LoTR trilogy in terms of themes, but that is to be expected, we are returning to the same world of before.  The dwarven theme is my new most favorite addition to the Middle Earth themes and can't wait to listen to it continuously over the next few days.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a great book and brought to life the struggles of the main character. I always wish for happy ending but this book concludes with reality of the times.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is the first Jack Reacher book. I want to read the others.  Lee Child has developed an interesting character that I intend to follow to see how he develops.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't like about the book, and it is very minor, is that I seemed to be able to guess what was going to happen next at nearly every turn.  That is certainly no disqualifier, but
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Even though I love Matthew,I was kind of disappointed in the movie itself.I know others will enjoy it,but I did not
0984380213|3.0|An excellent book that greatly simplifies the sales prospecting process. Asking people for help has always worked, and Aaron Ross has elevated it to an art. The other thing i really liked about the book is Aaron's suggestion that asking sales reps and business development reps to track all of their activities (i.e. calls) is counterproductive. He recommends having them track only results (i.e. demo's, proposals, unit sales and revenue) are a far better use of the rep's time , freeing them up to make more calls and have more success.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|This is the kind of movie a child or an adult can watch.  I admire people who can take dogs and  get them to do these antics and make a story line that makes sense.  Get it for enjoyment for old and young alike.
B000O77RLE|5.0|Highly recommend this film.  WW2 and Clint fans MUST have this Blu-Ray in their collection.  Also be sure to get the companion film, Flags of Our Fathers&#34; about the flag raisers at Iwo Jima.  MUST HAVE!!!
0425206211|5.0|Die Trying (Jack Reacher, No. 2)  A fast read and enjoyable, I'm reading the whole series in order which is the way to read Reacher novels
B009DH371K|5.0|Loved the video, I only wish more bands would have shot film back in the day. I would highly recommend.
B0080YGZ20|4.0|I first heard of Kimbra through Goyte's song &#34;Somebody I Used to Know&#34; and wanted to know more about her. After YouTubing her I decided to buy the album and have enjoyed it ever since. Fun dance tunes and interesting use of vocals compared to other pop-ish singers.
B004SIP9W4|5.0|I Enjoyed this movie very much, it would appeal to anyone that likes music and dancing.  Love Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|It is a great action packed flick that will entertain through multiple viewings. The plot is basic and simple so do not think that this is going to be a murder mystery. The subtitles and dubbing are the same so you won't miss out on the story from watching one or the other. There are plenty of &#34;ooh!&#34; moments and &#34;OMG that hurt!&#34; moments. All the fight scenes are spectacular and the movie overall is entertaining.
B0085YNML2|4.0|This game is a very cute fun game but it is kind of easy for me but I really like it and I would recommend this app
1401326110|5.0|Not only does the author read the book, but he does the voices of a African American urban pastor AND an elderly Jewish rabbi.....The author is a masterful storyteller and brings this audio book to life unlike anything else I have \\"heard\\".  It is a MUST listen to!<br /><br />It is rare for me to say LISTEN to it instead of read it.....This is one of those times
B005LAIHY0|2.0|This is a $5 movie at best or rental.  I love si-fi, but this is week at best.  I cannot recommend paying for this movie!<br />The quality of the produce was fine by the way.
0425263908|5.0|If you haven't already read this book then plan to do so when you have a few hours of spare time, as once you pick up Bared To You, the first in a trilogy, you won't put it down. The characters have you hooked right from the start and this book is HOT, RAUNCHY, PASSIONATE and EROTIC, causing your emotions to run amuck! It is easy to form an instant connection with the characters and, before you know it, the hours have passed and you've been sucked into Sylvia Day's sexy and steamy world.<br /><br />This book is definitely what you would class as a real page-turner. It shows how fast paced a relationship can become, especially one that isn't planned, and some of the problems that can arise because of this. As much as you know this story is fictional it can be very real too, thanks to the issues touched upon and skilful writing. Eva is a woman who, though at some points is vulnerable, will stand up for herself, speak out and knows her own mind - she will hurt feelings, if need be, and possesses an extreme jealous streak. On the other hand you have Gideon, who has power, wealth and hot looks to boot. He has never had to work at keeping a woman, until he met Eva. They aren't your normal everyday couple, they both have issues they are dealing with from their pasts but are working through it, and this journey takes the reader on a roller coaster of emotions. How two people who are fighting such inner demons can have so much naughty fun is beyond me, but somehow it works and gives the story a good edge.<br /><br />The only downfall in this book is its slight repetitiveness; Eva runs when things get tough, Gideon chases her and there's lots of make up sex. Although, the ending makes you want to pick up and devour the second book straight away. Definitely one for the `keep pile.'<br /><br />Review by Stacey Vincent on behalf of BestChickLit.com
B007CGLRWA|5.0|There's a reason why so few people gave this movie only 1 or 2 stars. My guess is that they feel some sort of guilt related to the content of the movie. This was a stunning, heart-wrenching film that made me shout to everyone I know to go and find it (rent it, buy it, find it, watch it for free, I don't care). Adrien Brody scores huge in this and the other stars (and their characters) are very compelling. \\"Art-house Depression Porn\\" as one 1-star reviewer wrote. Lol. But I guess one can make up a label for anything. I guess that person doesn't like to feel emotions. Imagine if movies weren't supposed to make us...feel. As for the reviewer who decided that this movie is meant to portray inner-city schools and their lower-class students with contempt, that's also a very wrong analysis of the film. You'd have to be an extraterrestrial to think all schools and innner-city kids are like this. And we are not as stupid as that reveiwer implies that we are. What's important here is the ride. And you get more than your money's worth.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln has always fascinated me, but the realism of the era and the personal portrayal of the man were stunning in this movie. And to think, our history would be completely different now had he not been the determined, persuasive President he was during such turbulent times. The political divide and partisan hatred then are so relevant, as well as the courage of a few who stood by their convictions while others regarded them as traitors. Well done, and a movie not to miss!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|The movie isn't funny at all. I really wanted to laugh but couldn't come close, except maybe at it's stupidity and juvenile attempts at humor. Don't waste your money.
B0085YNML2|5.0|there are lots of different levels that are fun and challenging.I come speechless when it comes to this awesome and fun game.
1592402038|4.0|This book gives you exactly what it says it's going to give you--  a no tolerance approach to punctuation. It is a funny book that not only gives you a good laugh or a \\"been there, done that\\" feeling but it also tells you absolutely everything you need to know about punctuation. Although it may seem like the book probably doesn't cover much, many will be surprised at all the book entails. Read or buy this book, you won't be sorry!
B009GED3HS|1.0|The episode Lobster Crawl does not down load the entire episode. It is only 31 seconds and not even the first 31 seconds. I would have thought this would have been corrected by now. Everything else is fine but it has been over two weeks. This episode really should be up and running by now. Is this going to be a regular thing Amazon Instant Watch?
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Alien Anthology is a great gift set for anyone who loves the Alien mythos. While the first two movies are without question a masterpiece, the other two movies in the set are lacking. Aliens 3 being the worse movie of the four (in my opinion) but is still watchable and does have a few moments of brilliance and originality. If you're considering getting this set in regards to the new release of Prometheus then you only need to get the first movie entitled Alien to understand and get caught up on the references in Prometheus.<br /><br />I give the set 4 stars because the movies and mythos is great however the packing is lacking. While beautiful, the collection is set so that the blu-rays &#34;slide&#34; out of the sleeve. I can see where people would get upset at this. if you're not careful you could end up scratching the disc.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book made me reevaluate my life. Every single American should read this at least two times. Though Jay is a little extreme at some points (really, only 10 black articles of clothing?!), I was truly inspired.<br />A must read. Get it now.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you're an Alien fan this is the collection for you. It has great extras and alternate versions of the movies as well. Do yourself a favor and pick this up. Awesome price.
B0083EW97W|5.0|Every twenty something girl can relate to John Mayer. In Born and Raised he pushes his boundaries and does it well. I love country and bluegrass and of course Mayer's distinct voice, so I give this album two thumbs up. You do have to listen to it about 5 times before you appreciate it fully though.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This movie is so wonderful.  I enjoy watching it every year, and this year is no exception.  The story is so wonderful and heartwarming.
0316228532|1.0|I was quite disappointed in this book from the beginning. The writing is shockingly juvenile, choppy, and repetitive. It was actually surprising how poor the writing really was in a lot of places. It also just felt like Rowling was so happy to finally be able to use profanity, that she overused it, rendering it pretty much cliche. Ditto for sexual content. Both have their places in a good storyline, but sloppy overuse is just off-putting. It came across as trying too hard. The point of view within sections switched from character to character so quickly, it became impossible to know who was doing the speaking/thinking. The characters all seemed pretty one dimensional and cookie-cutter. The domineering family man who is also the town big shot. The teenager who can't stand his parents (this was overdone in multiple characters). The 'bad girl' with the heart of gold. Boy with crush. Woman unhappy in relationship. Mamma's boy. It goes on a little too long. The book never seems to figure out what it really wants to do. The plot, which is almost nonexistent, peters out way before the end of the book. We're introduced to this town and large number of its citizens, but we're never given a reason to care about them. The most dynamic character in the book is the guy who dies after the first few pages. I kept wishing this character was around because I didn't like any of the other characters. No one was sympathetic, no one was interesting, no one had any redeeming qualities (except maybe the dead man, Barry Fairbrother). A lot of the characters also did or said things that didn't seem to jive with the way the author described the characters earlier in the novel. At the end of the book, I breathed a sigh of relief that it was over, even though nothing really happened at the end. I mean, it did, but, like most everything else in the novel, the ending was rushed, unbelievable, and forced. I can only be thankful I borrowed this book from the library and didn't actually put out anymoney for it. I won't get back the time I spent reading, but what can you do?
B002YVAT72|5.0|I love this product.  I purchased this as a gift.  I received it before the scheduled date and the packaging was perfect.  Although I purchased for someone else, I have enjoyed using this product as well.  The set up is simple and it's so lightweight.  It's a perfect gift for anyone who loves vinyls.
0547884591|5.0|I usually don't write reviews. However the book arrived two days ago and I've read half if it! I enjoy Tim's writing and his personality shines through. It's a fun read and the recipes are interesting enough without being overly complicated. I don't mind the organization of the content. The first section on meta-learning is an interesting read. I am already trying to incorporate some of the tips into my piano practice!<br /><br />I would have no hesitation in recommending this book. But be warned, it's not just a cookbook!
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is wonderful for the holidays.  It is fun and uplifting.  It's a great way to start the holidays.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I never realized how much this movie would be my life... and this is one of my favorites.  Love will follow you always - as it says in the title!  This is my favorite movie of all times!  Such a great movie... the three stars in this movie have made this movie my absolute favorite..<br />Buy this one and enjoy it for all times!
B009Z8FUB2|5.0|I've been a fan of his since 2005 and the Pride & Prejudice soundtrack. Since then he's done an amazing job with the Jane Eyre OST and this one doesn't disappoint. Fantastic mix of great melodies and traditional Russian tones.
0618871713|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I'm not a graphic novel kind of person, but this is a great story, and the illustrations really add to it. Bechdel is intimidatingly brilliant, but she largely pulls her punches here so we mortals can follow along. I'm always interested in how books are constructed, and I find the structure of this one particularly interesting. Tension comes not from what is revealed or what happens but from the way layers of meaning move the story in one direction or another. I've bought this book five times now to give to friends. By the way, in case you're worried--it reads just fine on Kindle. Sometimes you have to turn the device sideways to enlarge the frame, but even with old-lady eyesight like my own, you should be able to read it just fine. That'll save a few bucks and hopefully convince you to buy this one.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works well with no conflicts with Android phone.  Great weather warning system as an option.<br />Easy to understand menu options to tweek as needed.

B00979CS50|5.0|If you like the way Neil Young sounds when he teams up with Crazy Horse then this is for you. If  you are old<br />enough to remember the 60's and 70's ( bits and pieces anyway) you will find the lyrics meaningful and<br />find yourself thinking about them as you go about your day. The music on these CD's is excellent and it combines with the lyrics to make a really GREAT CD.
B004JRVQX0|3.0|Sure, it works, accessing a program is one thing it can do for the user. However, It is still a lost usb input, with this iLok hogging a port on a computer which will never see travel of the computer or the iLok.<br />And while we're on the matter, as I am continuing a conversation of internal dialogue on here, WTF is with computer companies not understanding the U in USB? It's Universal! And so, now everyone uses it and computer companies don't feel compelled to aim for more inputs. I mean, c'mon, I've got so many electronics that I plug into my computer that something that I have to remember to have plugged in, if I want to use a program, is excessive when all of my usb ports might be taken by hdd's, controllers, and various other i/o devices. This is partly too the computer design fault...somebody thinks even the average man can survive on only a scant few usb, and other relevant i/o interfaces, on our computers. I say unto you that that is foul archaic understanding of the world of computer usage.<br />But hey, it might be nice to be able to take my licenses to a different computer when needed...or something like that.<br /><br />Won't the first humans to mature under a weightless atmosphere be weird to see and how it affects their growth?
B002IPG400|1.0|This novel was boring. I couldn't stay with it. The lives of the characters did not interest me.I did not enjoy Emma's matchmaking!
B001QWBM62|4.0|As the title says...excuse the lack of proper english usage and punctuation, etc...but it's versatile little recorder with some inputs. search of forums and whatnot can tell you the issues of this little thing.
B004LX0D36|3.0|Jane Austen's books do not thrill me. The illustrations in this edition are nice, but the story is long and tedious reading.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great family entertainment.  The family really enjoyed it and I would recommend it. We will enjoy this many more times.
0385523904|5.0|NOTHING TO ENVY: ORDINARY LIVES IN NORTH KOREA<br />Barbara Demick<br /><br />Nothing to Envy is at least as pertinent today as it was when first published a couple of years ago. That is not just because North Koreans' lives continue to be fraught with unspeakable restrictions, though that is true. The book speaks, as well, to the conditions of people in many parts of the world where people are trapped in intolerable systems or by individual oppression, and can find no way out. Or they can see a possible path to escape, but the likelihood of being caught and tossed into an even worse situation is too great to risk. For many years I have studied what situations or states of mind keep women abused by intimate partners from leaving them, and what factors eventually cause them to break free. Barbara Demick shows us what makes North Koreans endure seemingly intolerable conditions, and what enables them to leave. The situations of the trapped North Koreans are as varied as those of women in relationships with abusive partners. Yet,their lives of personal oppression and political tyranny exhibit great similarities too. Demick made the wise choice of focusing in detail on the lives of just a few people, so that readers feel we know them. Then she follows them after they leave and we see the very different circumstances of their free lives and how they handle their new situations. I couldn't help asking myself, throughout the book, \\"What would I do?\\" I think that must be a common reaction. The author's capacity to put herself in the shoes of the people she comes to know enables us to do that as well. What better purpose can a writer have?
B0000558PI|1.0|We had no idea that this DVD would not play on our DVD player and that there are Regions for DVDs.  Tried using codes to get our DVD player tricked into playing the disk, but after an hour of trying to figure out how to do this, we gave up!  Got the DVD disk cheap so not worth returning.  Only buy Region 1 disks if you live in the US.  Lesson learned for us!  The movie is very good however!
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Really love this series and the music is great. For those that have not yet purchased the CD and are interested, you can purchase the Extended version with 4 extra songs at Target for $12.99.  I think the extra $ is worth it for the extra songs.  If you are a fan of the show, you will like this CD.
B000059XUO|5.0|The Crow is by far one of my single favorite movies in my collection because of the message it contains for fans of the movie.  I first saw this movie in Paris France a long time ago.  But reason I say it one of my favorite movies is because of a couple of lines within the movie those being \\"Real love is forever\\", that is at end of the movie, at the start of the movie \\"If two people are meant to be together...nothing can keep them apart.\\"  That is how I feel about my girlfriend because we have together real love and we will be together forever.  So if you like a movie with drama, lots of action, great gun fight scene (scene being where Brandon Lee lost his life because of the real bullet in one of the guns), and mutiple visuals that will take your breathe away.  Two scenes for myself was the Brandon Lee hanging on the broken window in the loft, and the crow scene near the water where it's lit up with gasoline.  Another scene I enjoy lot was him walking into the Church great visual.  But for being a dark movie with lots of bad elements it is by far a very powerful movie and will keep your intrest from start to finish, bonus note to add the soundtrack is as amazing as the movie so pick that up as well with the movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book so much! It was so fun to read and I would definitely recommend it to everyone! It's definitely worth it.
B000PY52EU|4.0|Black Snake Moan is by far one of the most powerful movies I have seen in my lifetime.  It combines within the plotline elemets of love, lust, passion, desire, being lost then being found, hope, forgiveness, and so forth.  Even it's Samuel L. Jackson singing in the movie with his own voice which even appears on the soundtrack as a bonus note for fans of this movie.  Ricci gave one of her best preformances also and the connection between Jackson's character and Ricci's makes the movie so good to watch over and over again, plus the blues music is so very good and enjoyable.  So if your looking for a different style of movie to watch then pick this movie up and savor all the actors in it, the great music, and the powerful story line within the movie beyond the phsyical scenes to get the point across.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|After a hard day of work this is a fun distraction!  I'm not a game person but I figured this out (most of it anyway!).
6305313687|5.0|American History X is by far one of few movies I give 5 star ratings to.  The movie itself is very powerful with a powerful message within the movie showing how a young boy growing up with certain feelings about society and the people within that society can change his life around.  Some of the scenes within this movie are very hard to watch because of the violence of the scenes, and the main character slow motion shots of him on the street with the black guys trying to rob from his truck stays with you for life, plus the look in his eyes no feeling no compassion.  Though it also shows that same main character how he was able to change once he got out of jail for his crime and try to live a better life and watch out for the family he loves.  It proves that we can do something wrong in our past and be able to forgive ourselves and go on the right path because like one of the ending lines in the movie the one playing the brother says \\"What have I learn from all this, is that hate is baggage...\\"  I totally agree with that line in  the movie there is no room in this world for hate because it will consume you take over your body, mind, heart, and soul and destory you.  Plus also there is no room for racism in this world because that will also lead to you being destory all within your body, mind, heart, and soul.  But if your looking for a very good movie filled with drama, violence, and learning to forgive yourself then pick this movie up and see for yourself how powerful this movie is and see if you end up loving it as much as I do for the overall picture and message it tries to show us about the world around us.
B0035V35PI|5.0|One of my favorite movie. My kids and I enjoy this also they ship it pretty fast for people using po
030758836X|5.0|I loved it..can understand why it has been on the bestseller lists for weeks!  I could not put it down!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best I have. it is basically like minecraft in the xbox and Pc.<br /><br />also this app is a work in progress so there is going to be many bugs and the app came out only bout a few months ago so its buggy and also the blocks still need to be coded in correctly so be patient people. just wait a few updates and it will be better
B005LAJ16I|5.0|this show is awesome. Can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD. I don't get showtime, can't see the expense, but won't miss buying this DVD as long as the show runs. Homeland movie marathon. Hooked me with the first show.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I wasn't expecting much, but I love scifi and it was 1.99 and you know what it was a really good movie. If you're into scfi it's worth the watch.
B00756GKBA|5.0|In true Madonna fashion, this CD is different than anything else she has ever done, yet still as amazing as her early work.
B00003CX8Y|2.0|I was excited to finally receive this movie, after finally finding it for a decent price. However, I'm currently watching it and although it's only been on for little over a half hour it has skipped at least 4 times. I tried cleaning it off and it still skipped in the same spot. Gave it 2 stars because shipping was decent, but disappointed that I can't watch it uninterrupted.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it. its one of the best apps I ever downloaded. I would recommend this to anyone. its fun and challenging
B009AP4MGE|4.0|I love Glee, but I don't find myself anxious to see the next episode the way I felt the first seasons. It is still a great show though.
0345529057|5.0|Best series I've read in a long time. R.R. Martin really knows how to work in that important detail to really paint the picture in your head. worth the read!<br />Get caught up before season 3!
0316228532|3.0|J.K. Rowling's writing style in this book is very different from that of her Harry Potter books - more language and sexual references.  The main problem for me is that it wasn't until I was half way through the book that I found much action.  The second half does have some punch, but it takes 250 pages to get there.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|it's the kind of app where you have to pause it breath, unpause it, and play the scaryest app ever!!!!!!!
030758836X|4.0|I understand the questions regarding why the story ended the way it did....wasn't close to what I expected.  However, after months and months of reading similar plots and predictable endings, this was a completely new & different read...Really enjoyed it- will definitely pick up another Gillian Flynn book :)
1936608898|5.0|This book was recommended by a co-worker and I'm glad I bought it.  The science behind this new approach to eating is solid and provides a great way to find out if you are sensitive to a particular food group.  I, and my co-worker will begin our Whold 30 on January second.<br /><br />Having now complete my Whole 30 (a reset so to speak from the book) I am feeling great.  I would recommend for anyone wanting to eat in a healthier way.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great product. And NO calories. No carbs. No taste!!!! But it takes<br />on the taste of what you put in it or on it. Much better texture than<br />the noodles.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love it  it's very helpfull and I like the sound of the alarm I like the features and colors
B0053O89JM|5.0|This completes all the House tapes. It was a used copy and haven't<br />Used it yet,  but am sure it will be just fine. Great price and speedy delivery. Thanks!!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book carried an intensity and honesty that was brutally forward. Amazing read! I would recommend this to anyone who has a story worth telling. Because somehow, in reading this story, you find your own.
6303023355|5.0|the movie gets off to a great start then slows down. adding jerry reed as part of the film was a brilliant idea on the director's part. and the part where golf course measurements were used to save gene's life was a genius idea, an original. first of its kind. danny glover turns out to be his guardian angel, and to help guide him home to safety, risking his own safety as well. The true tale based on how well service men in the armed forces can and will sacrifice their own lives to help each other stay alive and make it home.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Based on all the Rotten Tomatoes score of 33%, I wasn't expecting anything out of this movie - and was hoping my wife would not get mad at me for renting it. It turned out to be pretty entertaining and had a decent sci-fi storyline. What was really amusing was the way they tie back to the board game. Overall, this is a nice popcorn action sci-fi movie and Liam Neeson was better in this than in Star Wars Episode 1 (I know that's not saying much, but he gives this movie a tiny bit of credability!)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The word of God is Timeless. For this ever-evolving world.<br />For the every soul that looks forward to a Heavenly Reunion.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|I had to pay a slight mark-up to get this, but it's so worth it. Samus is on-model, flexible and a ton of fun to pose dynamically. She's a real conversation piece at the studio! Love it.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|I like hidden object/ puzzle games.  This one has a fun story line and so far I am enjoying it. So far the most annoying thing is: when you pinch the screen or move it around it counts as a &quot;strike&quot; against you and 20 seconds of your puzzle solving time is taken away! Seems like such an easy fix and such a common issue that developer must know about it, unless he/she doesn't bother to test their own games.  Also I haven't found a way to save my progress if I need to come back later. Glad I got it free and didn't pay or I think I would be a bit upset. Such a shame, but sometimes it's the little and most obvious things that matter most.
B00993FEUK|5.0|I think this movie was marketed poorly as a schlocky zombie flick; it so isn't! It has an engaging, emotionally driven story with the best character designs and sets I have seen in stop motion, period. Plus, this movie doesn't talk down to kids or assume they are stupid; it's witty, direct, clever and unapologetic. Give the DVD some love, keep the craft alive!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|this is an awesome app with backgrounds<br />stickers<br />paint<br />markers<br />colored pencils. it is an app for the creative imagination typed person. even thought its two bucks- its worth every nickel.
B001PO53IO|3.0|This is a good product for Blu- ray movies.  My 11 year old son really likes the Clone Wars movies.  I do however wish that the package included DVD's too.  He mistakenly took it in the car on a long trip, and could not play the movies because we only have a Blu Ray player at home.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars, but for the long delay between energy recharging and the constant requests to go and rate the game.
B005LAII08|5.0|This is an enjoyable movie, and the combination of formats is perfect.  It can be viewed on all of our devices!
B0036EH3XE|4.0|I loved it until the final one hour. I knew everyone has died. However, it was not clear when and how they all died. I really liked it in general.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Enjoyable movie and with all the formats included it can be watched on all my devices.  Very happy with this purchase.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It's really cute. Remembering what the new characters do might be a mystery for a while. I wish there were more levels.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Beautiful artwork! Very fun and challenging game and it works perfectly with the kindle fire. I gave it five stars!
B007SY3CEW|4.0|This is a fun app to use. I took piano at a very early age and can not remember a thing.

B006YXTRHY|4.0|This is for teen girls everywhere - including my inner one. The movies are much better than the books (I only read Breaking Dawn because I wanted to know how the movies ended).
B0085YNML2|1.0|I installed the new app on my Galaxy Tab running android 2.2 froyo and the app won't run, when at the loading screen it just dumps out to the desktop with no warning.  Needs higher version of android I guess.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|I feel like this app shouldn't be paid. There are a few more options than normal drawing pads, but there aren't a lot of colors.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is an awesome of game of strategy<br /><br />Ps this is awesome cool awesome awesome cool awesome cool so so cool
B0094BB4TW|5.0|(Updated 1/1/13) Finally, the Kindle gets a Facebook app that DOESN'T redirect to your browser! It's finally it's own app. With this last Facebook upgrade, the Kindle was upgraded very soon after my Android phone app was. I recommend this app for your Kindle.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|While the film starts out promisingly, with good (if not limited) characters, and decent acting,  it quickly goes down hill once the main threat is revealed.<br /><br />At that point the film becomes a jumble of implausible or unexplained subplots, which despite the movie's length, feel rushed.  The main plot lacks subtlety, and feels only tangentially connected to the character struggle.<br /><br />My first instinct is to blame editing, which makes its awkwardness especially known in the action scenes, (shot of person, shot of action, shot of other person, shot of action.... WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?.  After thinking about it a bit, I just feel like they were trying to cram in too many angles (literally and figuratively).<br /><br />Also, the sound design, good lord, do I need swelling music in every scene?  How about you turn that down so I can hear the muffled dialog?
B006RXQBJS|4.0|Yes, it's about bugs. It's a pretty interesting concept. I love the director. It's very dark, which is typical. I'd recommend for people who like horror movies.
1936608618|5.0|This is a great book. It's easy to read with lots of pictures. A big portion is dedicated to technique.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Your Kindle doesn't come with a stock camera app. I downloaded this one and have been very happy with it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game was already awesome when I got it on PC but they made it better by making it potable.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This is a very interesting book. I really like Neil Gaiman. It's not what I thought it was going to be.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I noticed that Apple users are always getting updates and new items in this game before everyone else. I have been playing the kindle fire version for some time and kindle users users are last to get new things, sometimes not at all. If you have a kindle beware: the games is addictive but you will but frustrated that everyone gets cool updates while you sit on the sidelines watching!
B00005K3O4|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite movie!  DVD came in great condition & plays with no problems.  Case is in great condition too & we purchased it for a reasonable price!
0887307280|5.0|Wow! I am not an entrepreneur--yet, but I am so glad I found this book before making the leap! I've seen many friends and acquaintances struggle with the issues discussed. If only they had read this book, they wouldn't be burning out on their businesses now...
B0025KVLTW|4.0|MMT speaks the language of \\"mature Beat-niks, I mean Beat-les.\\"  Lennon was fascinated with the early Beats more than he ever related to the younger \\"hippies\\" whom the Beats made fun of.  Lennon eventually married an older Beat-nik artist as this was the only person he could relate to.  Yoko Mama.  Such a wonderful gal.<br /><br />In this album there is consistent clarity and focus on Beat alienation:  The Beat-les versus all you uninvolved sleepy headed people still out there on the bus in a trance.  For this message more than anything else the work is something to be treasured and taken quite seriously as art.<br /><br />After making this record the Beat-les were stuck with the huge problem:  \\"How do we ever TOP this one?\\"  I believe they never did although later records had flashes of great brilliance.  As a pure unadulterated statement of Beat philosophy this album hits the mark.  For that very reason this album was the beginning of their end and their eventual breakup.<br /><br />I am not going to explain how this album works.  Or defend why it is what I say it is. The world's greatest Beat-nik album.  The world's greatest Beat-les album.  That would only lead to endless arguements with those who love to turn every comment you make into a pissing contest. If they would just shut up and listen to something once in a while but no, they are \\"grotty, hideous, spotty little teenagers\\" as George Harrison described them.<br /><br />I would conclude that yes, the Beatles DID love you.  But they were also a bit impatient with how obtuse the popular reaction was whenever they pointed out the shortcomings of society.  A year earlier you may recall the KKK wanted to lynch Lennon for saying that Christianity was fading out (which by the way he felt was too bad).<br /><br />It is ironic that this album is one long message to the few that are not hung up and one long kick in the pants to those that refuse to think for themselves. Many songs describe what it is like to live ina world full of fools.  And yet the public perception of the Beatles continued to pidgeonhole them as spokemen for the \\"peace and love---hippy generation.\\"  What a mystery indeed.<br /><br />As John described it in his one line review of Magical Mystery Tour for Rolling Stone in 1967: \\"There are only about 100 people in the world who understand our music.\\"<br /><br />Oh well.  Please don't be long.

B0086449YA|5.0|Mark K recently opened at Bob Dylan concert and stole the show.  Couldn't resist listening to this seventh solo album with mix of folk/blues/rock offered on this album.  Privateering owes much to Celtic tradition as it does to the American Deep South and features the likes of Afro-Celt Sound System's Mike McGoldrick on the flute, American mandolin supremo Tim O'Brien, alongside many other world-clas musicians.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I am absolutely in LOVE with this series! I have all of my friends addicted to it too! It's fun to see all of the &#34;Roseanne&#34;, Star Wars, Video Game and Comic puns! A must have for any Geek out there!

B006VFLIYK|2.0|David is a highly talented suspense writer. He missed the mark here.  It was shallow and trite. I will be less inclined to read him again.  I think he got the NY Time's best seller rating on his prior reputation and the public's expectations. He is in danger of becoming Alex Cross or John Grisham.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Bob Dylan's latest cd is worth having and gives clarity to his recent concert tour.  His now throaty husky voice adds clarity to the 72-y-o's prolific songwriting.
B0091THRCU|4.0|I like the material and its zip up pull lever function when pulling the phone out. Seems like it will last long enough.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|A very different type of game with a themed UI that runs smoothly and a theme on the graphics as well. It allows for custom maps to be mad and a place to view others. Adds to replay value in my opinion. Very impressed and highly recommend it to anyone.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|We loved it.  We got the TV series also and watched it before the movie so we knew a little more about what was going on in the movie.  Very entertaining - won't be the only time we watch it.  The kids have already borrowed it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Am glad I didn't know about this series when it was on.  Would have been REALLY upset when it was cancelled.  Liked the series even better than the movie, Serenity.  Will watch it over and over.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|this game is fun & challenging. It helps to keep your brain active & better for boredom than a game with no thinking involved.
146500632X|5.0|So i bought this product at a great price....recommend amazon not other sellers! It came very quick (in my case) and had all pictures of one direction on it! Perfect xmas gift
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is always going to be a way to keep up with the activity of friends & family. The only problem is that its so small.
1451696191|4.0|The item arrived in time in the conditions explained no trouble at all excelent service<br /><br />And its a great book i recommend loved it and the movie is good aswell
0307895475|5.0|Its a beautiful book with Comprehensive coverage of a very large game. I would recommend it to lovers of Skyrim!
B008AITJ24|5.0|Great service. Arrived in two days even though they said it would arrive in five to seven days. Blue Ray's looked brand new no scratches.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|what an awesome holder I really like it. The color is so rich looking as with the other item of the same color.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was a great ending, full of hope and heartache with quite a few surprises.  It showed the weakness
B005LAII1C|5.0|a great comedy very crude and what you'd expect you got to have a sense of humor for this movie ted was well done  Seth MacFarlane did an awesome job with this flick the voice of peter griffin only added a great familiar touch of family guy , the bond of some thing from your childhood can be priceless to add some humor in the mix makes it even better , so give this movie a chance  i just think the negative reviews on this movie are bogas them people just could not relate any of there life to this movie
075669812X|5.0|Big book, Good quality and great price!!<br />A must for the Lego lovers in your life!<br />From Soup to nuts.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|if you play the right games you can accumulate points pretty quickly. otherwise it can get a bit tedious and frustrated.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|its a clasic and sweet tycoon kind of game. you breed dragons and have them level up. just so you know, when you downloaded it don't use any of the gems they give u, later on you have to buy them using real money.
B000H7J9RQ|2.0|The vender should know about this and put that in the discription of the DVD.<br /><br />Always check before purchase made
B001EN71CW|5.0|This series was phenomenal! I loved the acting, the stories, the atmosphere. I can't believe that it ended as it did. There wasn't even a &#34;season-finale&#34; like episode at the end of the first and, most tragically, last season.<br /><br />Someone needs to get all of these wonderfully gifted actors back together and pick this show back up. After watching the last show, I was literally thinking,&#34;What the Hades!&#34;<br /><br />Of all of the shows that I have watched over the last 10 years, this one ranks at the top of my list. Tell me this isn't it. Had I the money, I would produce this show myself just so I could enjoy its story! It deserves at least 5 seasons!<br /><br />Whoever pulled this show should be publicly flogged and fired. If you ask me, they didn't even give the season a proper close! Unbelievable.<br /><br />Still, I greatly enjoyed getting lost in this series and am glad that I invested in the Blu-ray. It made for an immensely entertaining escape while it lasted. . .  :-)
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Maybe it's because I went to Caltech for graduate school, but every episode of this show really clicks for me :)
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This app is completely useless. It can't be uninstalled from my phone and it's constantly taking up system resources even though I don't use it. Somehow, Amazon made a mobile app that's worse than the stupid desktop mp3 downloader.<br /><br />I still can't fathom why every company that sells music needs to have their own stupid player. I guess their marketing folks are happy to lose users just to get more stalking info and push their products harder.
B000MGVCFO|5.0|Ever since I first heard the quadraphonic version of this album -- and long after I was VERY familiar with the original stereo LP -- I was absolutely blown-away by the sound-immersion of the track &#34;Procession.&#34;<br />SACD brings what I'd only heard previously via 8-track into no-hiss digital clarity.<br /><br />As another reviewer has noted here, &#34;the song literally dances around the room&#34; and I'll state uniquivocally that this PURE multi-channel recording is a centerpiece for anyone wishing to demonstrate a sound system!<br /><br />Beyond the &#34;effects,&#34; however, the number of wonderful songs on this disc brings the Moodies at their creative peak to the ears of those who loved the time, loved the band, and loved this album!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|addictive. chalengeing fun relaxing for when you just want to forget about everything and zone out. would highly recommend. also works your mind and makes you think.
0525478817|5.0|“Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.”<br />This is a quote from TFiOS, and it sums up quite nicely exactly how I feel about it. A must-read.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|As a big fan of Ridley Scott and Alien I am very happy to own that set of 4 disks<br />I like almost all of the features and extra materials, the quality - both : sound and picture are astonishing, behind the scenes and director's, producer, writer reviews and explanations are great addition .<br />There is only one thing I dislike.<br />That is the fact that I can not watch the alternative begging and ending scenes as well as other additional scenes that was not included in the theatrical version in a real full movie edit , instead had to watch them separately with no option to watch them in the whole movie context .<br />Definitely not a good step to sell the whole story considering that even with them the concept still raise a lots of question.<br />How ever I will recommend this to all fans of the fantastic space movies because this one is the mile stone in the history and it will be for at least more than decade.
014241493X|4.0|Reading this book made me feel as if John Green had reached inside my skull and sucked out all of my hidden desires and secrets. He really knows how to write for his demographic. This book is great, skillfully written and brutally realistic.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought this game was fun and I really enjoyed it. I recommend this game to anyone who plays games a lot. a tip I can give is save your points the more points you have the more games are available to you. also there are games that are not usually shown in the main games and cost a lot more so SAVE THOSE POINTS! another thing before I stop is when you play everyday you get bonus points for that day. Well bye for now and hope you get this game!
B0091V6TF4|5.0|This is my favorite version of this release since the early vinyl LP's.  CD one features all the title songs chronologically, which I like very much.  CD two includes a good cross section of score music or incidental lyric songs from each movie in the bond canon. I like a lot of the closing credits songs from the later movies, and they have that too, which is nice addition.  Oddest entry included is the wonky &#34;Do you know how Christmas Trees Are Grown&#34; from &#34;On Her Majesty's Secret Service&#34;. I would rather they included the cut &#34;Kingston Calypso&#34; from Dr. No, a piece that used to be considered part of the title song from that movie.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|This game is enjoyable on the kindle<br />I play the game for hour with ease<br /> Also would allow kids to play . Extremely simple to do.
B007GYM86M|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I also liked the fact that it was co-written by his widow and included quite a few quotes from people who seemed to really know him.  I have not read the other Belushi book but I know some reviews of it claim that it is not as accurate as it could be.
0553801473|5.0|Of couse everyone who has read these books are waiting on the final 2 or what is left to come--if ever they do.  I have watched the TV series as well.  I plan to reread the books, although some of the overkill on the last book I will skip--its all been said on this site with the many many reviews I've seen .<br />the age factor is the worry for me--His age,  My age<br />still I would recommend  every book--
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really loved this game. Its so much fun. I just don't  like how you have to spend money on some parts.
B00979CS50|5.0|How does Neil Young continue to produce New material for so long. The work with Crazy Horse is alway good but this is exceptional. There are no &#34;hits&#34; on the two-disc album but the guitar work and Young's classic voice is first rate.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is the best grocery shopping game in the world this game is great for your kids because it can very likely teach them some strategy skills for when they get older in there life
B003W77SAS|3.0|It's a well-produced album but there's only a couple of classic songs in the mix. It's not a must buy.
0810979772|5.0|my child love sthese wimpy kid diary books will read again and again like the hard cover timely shippingwell boxed y
B009JBZH54|5.0|Exactly what i expected.These movies are excellent. The packet was the quality i ws expecting too. I got it on time
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was written about a very dark tim ein our history and how it affected those involved. It was vey emotional and invoked many different feelings.  I highly recommend it.
B0049D1TCM|5.0|I love this cd. Took me a while till I grown to like each and every song. I like the special meanings in songs and the lyrics can be very empowering especially for women. I love Roman's Revenge - EPIC song. I love the deluxe version and the extra tracks. Love MUNY!
B00942S4OY|5.0|My daughter loves this CD.  She loves the band and was thrilled to get this right after it was released.
B003HE2B9Y|5.0|But they are not as good as the originals! However its a must have for all true fans. Must part in your collection.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love love love love love love puzzles. this app has tons of them for free. I haven't even got to the paid ones yet because there are so many free ones.
B008NEVPCC|4.0|I enjoy this cd and the songs. Very hip and modern styles - nothing deep or serious but overall good pop! Love swagger jagger and want you back!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a little difficult at first but still fun! takes some time to get used to the controls! I would recommend
B002QB1910|5.0|This is Rihanna's best musical Cd yet (for me). I really like all the songs. the only song here I dont love is Stupid in Love. However the rest is really good. Too bad there was no deluxe version back then.
1608871517|3.0|Beautiful book with interesting background info.  However I am livid at the author auctioning off these masterpieces he created for profit. They should have been enshrined in a museum for fans to view.  Shame on you.
B005TZFZ7E|5.0|I really like this album. I just dont know why it came so suddenly and why it did not get a well deserved tour on its own. The deluxe version is very good w the bonus songs. I love Fool in Love - Esther Dean is a genius song writer.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|I being 39 absolutely love this movie. It makes me want to dance. My 7year old and 17year old both love it as well. I really like the story line which just makes the dancing even better. I have watched this at least 40 times but on my DVR. I am glad to have the DVD and have the special additions that I don't have with my DVR.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I like the Re Up Cd. Good songs, good lyrics. Cant wait for Pinkprint in 2013. I love Pink Friday Roman Reloaded CD the most! This is Nicki's best cd in my opinion. I love the different genres represented and love how multifaceted Nicki is in her music. She is a great rapper and a joy to listen to. I love her lyrics. I never thought I will like music like this but I do now! I love the bonus songs too. Love the lyrics - very clever.
B0049U4INC|5.0|I will be most definitely reading and rereading this amazing book again and again!!<br /><br />Chock full of details, experiences, and amazing stories. Guy has also clearly conducted his research on the topics of business, marketing, and psychology bringing in both anecdotal as well as empirical research to support his case for enchantment.  He has outlined a clear plan on how you to best attract customers and users that will love and rave about your products and services!<br /><br />What I truly loved was that Guy spoke on the importance of \\"Ethical Enchantment\\" throughout the book.  He stated again and again that his goal was not to brainwash or \\"hard sell\\" but rather to design products and to help you to clearly define those customers that would be most likely to be enchanted.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and will also be recommending it to my university colleagues and friends as a great example of an accessible but detailed marketing book.  It's on my list as a re-read and I think it will be one of those books I read over and over again.
B006MOW98E|5.0|Can I give more than 5 stars? These were the best short stories I have ever read. And in the past couple of years I've read A LOT of short stories and novellas from various genres. They are young adult. I don't know if that is clear before you buy.  The romance aspect is tender and natural. From the description I was expecting more intense romance.  What I got was better because it was the natural development of young characters with a variety of things going on in their lives. The clever witty writing alone was worth reading.  The characters were extremely well developed. The stories were highly engaging. I will recommend this book to everyone I know.
B003L20IHO|5.0|I like Zac Efron's acting although I am a recent convert.  He played in teen movies but when I watched them, I realized this kid is really talented.  I've enjoyed this movie alot and have watched it several times and will probably watch it many more times in the future. He's good and I will most likely buy other movies he is staring in.
B00913DPW2|1.0|I could not get the game to function after the fist little obstacle. It does not have any help feature to guide you through when you have a problem or can't figure out how to proceed.
B00164GDA0|5.0|I've always liked this movie and was very happy to get it on Blu Ray.  I've watched it many times and have never lost interest in the story or the characters in it.
B009MO57H6|4.0|I have all the Resident Evil movies. I like them because I think Milla is hot, the acting is decent, and the plot is good for a sci-fi movie. Plenty of action maybe a little too graphic but I like the movie.
B00866JLEG|5.0|Zac Efron was really good in this.  I enjoyed it.  As a veteran I could connect with the story. I hope to see him in many movies in the future.  This was very good...maybe not given alot of attention by critics...but I don't pay attention to them...the only critic that matters to me...is me.  I was the 'Lucky One' to have bought it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Good basic calculator. I love the fact that the buttons and screen are huge on my kindle. I'm blind as a bat and this lets me work with it easily.
B00005JOA0|5.0|I like period stuff so this fit the bill.  I keep looing for more and hope that you will have these kinds of movies available.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|As I'm about to dive into being an indie author this is a valuable reference to get me started. I didnt realize just how many things I was about to waste time doing before reading this.
B000007XUQ|5.0|If you like Christmas music, I don't think there is a better singer of the classics than Karen Carpenter.  A must add to any collection
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This has become my go to program on the kindle. It lets me keep track of so much so easily.
B009O07NMA|5.0|If you're a country fan, this CD should be in your collection.  I especially like their new big hit, &#34;Cruisin.&#34;
B005COO1X6|5.0|Nope, never. Creepy, fun ride. It's very standard King fare. If you enjoy his fiction you'll enjoy this. It's nothing groundbreaking but is an enjoyable read on a dark stormy night.
B007HO392S|5.0|What can you say about Carrie Underwood that hasn't already been said.  A big-time performer who is pleasing to the eye.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I got a this app for free and I thought this game was going to be one of thouse free cheep stupid games. but it is a good little game. though a little warning it is hard.
0756665949|4.0|This book is a lot of fun.  A must-have coffee table book for the LOST enthusiast, full of cool pictures, quotes, and factoids from the series that will remind you of everything that was great about LOST.  As much as I love this book, I'm taking away one star because it is not as comprehensive as I had hoped.  If you are trying to find out, for example, what song or music was playing in which episode, or the list of guns used in each episode by different characters, and so on, you probably won't find that type of detailed information here.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|Movie is fun , smart and entertaining, the Brits do a movie right, especially a Christmas movie.  Go get it, your kids will love it and adults will love it even more!    [...]
B001AQO3QA|5.0|You can't get much better than this box set. All the original movies plus the directors cuts. Fantastic buy and amazing movies

B0079R8KXG|5.0|Case # 3, finally found one that works for me.  It is easy to use and carry, also looks good.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|I didn't like this at first, but it's growing on me.  Still not a favorite (apart from track 13, Rowing), but if you're a big fan of Soundgarden or Audioslave, you'll probably like it.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great game, takes lots of effort and time but its lot of fun and you can waste lots of time with it.  Love the music.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Fun game, I completed it in just 2 days. Some levels are EXTREMELY hard to complete on my tablet due to items I needed being outside of the touchscreen area.
B000002A46|5.0|What a wonderful CD.  I have enjoyed every last song.  I would highly recommend this CD.  This is one for keeps!

B002AS463W|5.0|This movie is great romance storyline about two people who spiral out of control for a moment of passion. Leaves you wanting more with the end but wonderful movie.Great acting.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|It has been years since I've enjoyed a novel more. I am a Steinbeck fan for sure but somehow I'd never read Grapes. You will not be disappointed. Not only are the characters and the story compelling, it is a detailed contrast of America 80 years ago that offers some stark differences (and similarities) with America today.
B001VLC3T8|5.0|This is a great rooster by Schleich (I think all their animal toys are great).<br /><br />We use it instead of the starting playing marker in the board game Agricola (hence it's our 'starting rooster'). :>

B0094BB4TW|1.0|When I first opened this app I thought I was being punked. This app is so clunky and glitchy, I have no intentions to use it.not only will this Facebook app not allow you to see your entire news feed, but it won't even allow you to like  comments in a thread. You cannot share anything from this app either. You know, I realize now that I should've gotten the iPad Mini instead of the Fire. The whole experience is one grand disappointment.

B00962341U|5.0|I have been a huge Leona fan ever since & I own ALL her Albums & They are all wonderful.<br /><br />BUT Glassheart is by far her BEST WORK! Every song is beautiful & brilliant & her vocals are even more immaculate than ever! I can't tell you which is my fave track since they are all so damn good!  But I will handpick 'Lovebird' 'Shake You Up' & 'When it Hurts' as core tracks in this beautifully written masterpiece that is Glassheart! <3<br /><br />I personally thought Leona should release an Acoustic set and luckily for me the Deluxe I purchased has 3 of them. I can't get enough of them! Leona Live is truly a force to reckon with, truly a class act!<br /><br />GET THIS ALBUM!!!<br /><br /><3

B00005JMYI|4.0|The DVD was in good shape but the movie was not as funny as I remembered it to be. Getting older I guess...
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|this is a really good hidden object game. the overall story is ok but it has a lot of items for you to find.
B004I744AS|5.0|Has everything, well  done, makes words more fun than you think. Get it, use it, smarter with it. Buy it. $4.99
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I downloaded this for my four year old. She likes it however it is a bit advanced for her. I find myself playing it when she isn't around so she will have more coins and ponies to play with. We've both enjoyed it
0316154687|5.0|Need I say more?  It was the cover art that drew me in; it was the humor that kept me going.  Great read.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I bought this with high hopes for another Dark Knight. In some ways it delivered. The visuals were extraordinary and the soundtrack superb! Acting was all around good and all did well with the material handed them.<br /><br />As a villain Bane was terrific. But the Batman himself lost much of his fire and Alfred lost all of his previous toughness. The substitute father, and even mentor, image that Michael Caine as Alfred supplied in the previous two films was replaced by a whiner.<br /><br />I just finished watching for the second time and must say that it was better on the second viewing. I could actually read more into the characters on the second go round and the pacing of the story worked better. Yes, it was a long movie but that actually worked for it and not against it.<br /><br />Those annoying aspect ratio shifts were back with a vengeance. I have a 2.35:1 screen and really prefer to watch movies in that aspect. When the shift to the 1.85:1 material occurs it drove the scene off the top and bottom of my screen..... VERY ANNOYING and did not add a thing to the presentation. I gave up trying to shift it around on the first viewing but on the second did shrink the picture each time.<br /><br />All of the negative reviews based solely on the \\"Ultra-Violet\\" thing is a mystery to me.... They want to watch this kind of movie on a computer? Sorry, when I purchase a Blu-Ray the idea that there is a digital copy available is nice bonus but certainly not the main purchase point.<br /><br />While I don't think this will go down as cinema history it was a good movie over all and well worth the watching.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Me & the kids love this action movie & all  the heros almost done purchasing their individual movies as well
B008MG1E4A|5.0|FIRST HAND ACCOUNT AND A DETAILED READING OF THE MOST WANTED MAN IN THE WORLD.<br />EXCELLENT BOOK and a Must Read
B007XF4J66|5.0|Planned as a B movie, it became instead the all time classic.  Rick's cafe is full of all the old time great supporting players - Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Claude Raines etc. - but the pure pleasure of it is simply watching Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart, and Paul Henried. They joined together and made this movie not just memorable, but the symbol of World War II Hollywood movie magic.
0810993139|5.0|It's a Christmas gift but my son loves the books,its already here under the tree wrapped and ready so I'm happy!! :)
0061692042|5.0|I am a big Richard Ford fan, having read most of his books and running out to get his autograph on my copy of Independence Day when he came to our local bookstore. His characters generally have expansive imaginations which become the grounds for much of the content of his books. Canada is in that mold - it is less about action and more about the meaning that can be ascribed from reflection. The difference here is that this character is not an adult. Frank Bascombe, for instance, is an older man with the complicated thoughts that come from living life. Bascombe had to work through a divorce and a less than satisfying career. That's not the case with Dell Parsons - a sixteen-year-old boy who is only commencing his life.<br /><br />This is a book about judgment. Dell's basic problem is that he has been paired up with bad role models. Both his father and the subsequent substitute are bad people that are at best indifferent to his needs.  In each case, Dell ignores the signs of trouble. The facts are there before his eyes but his initial thought is to assume only the best. I don't think its a spoiler to say that the problems begin when his parents decide to rob a bank. After all, that information is revealed before the end of the first sentence. But that is the key point. Dell's twin sister, Berner, is similarly affected by the robbery but she takes an entirely different response. Whereas Dell sees that he is ultimately responsible for his safety and prosperity, Berner takes a different path.<br /><br />This passage sets up the basic point of tension in the novel:<br /><br />\\"It's odd, though, what makes you think about the truth. It's so rarely involved in the events of your life. I quit thinking about the truth for a time then. Its finer points seemed impossible to find among the facts. If there was a hidden design, living almost never shed light on it. Much easier to think about chess - the true character of the men always staying the way they were intended, a higher power moving everything around. I wondered, for just that moment, if we -- Berner and I -- were like that: small, fixed figures being ordered around by forces greater than ourselves. I decided we weren't. Whether we liked it or even knew it, were were accountable only to ourselves now, not to some greater design.\\"<br /><br />Berner becomes a victim and Dell becomes a survivor. Berner never finds a place in life after the robbery. In her last days, she still finds fault in her struggles in the decisions of her parents. She sees the grand design and herself as unable to counter it. Dell makes himself accountable. To some extent, most people play some part of both of these roles. In Canada, though, it is pretty much everyone around Dell that sees the choices in their life as predestined. For example, Dell's father often blames his employers or his luck for his failures when the readily visible truth is that he deserves his lack of luck. Even Dell's mother, a woman with significant intellectual gifts, lacks the common sense to push back against the bad idea to rob a bank.<br /><br />I saw a few \\"100 Notable Books of the Year\\" lists and Canada was not included. To me, that is an incredible omission. Any Richard Ford novel is something of an event but this is probably one of his better works. I enjoyed this far more than I did either Lay of the Land or A Multitude of Sins. It is interesting that he has chosen to write about a young person, because almost everything he has ever written has focused on older men. Ha! Showing us new stuff.power moving everything around.

B00AMBH70S|2.0|Too much dialogue and not enough action. I was expecting more high octane action and the usual twist and turns of a \\"Bourne\\" movie.  What I got was drawn out dialogue and a very boring movie.
B0085YNML2|5.0|This game is on par with other games like cut the rope and angry birds with cute graphics, good physics and interesting puzzles.  This game is right down my alley for whaf i like. Am very happy i got it for free but would have gladly paid for it.<br /><br />So far after about 20 levels in i am not seeing a downside to this game.
B0087HT36U|4.0|This is a great game. Some levels are difficult and others are quite easy. I suggest anyone give it a try and I think you will enjoy it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game!!  I love the toca boca apps, but to bad this is the only one! I have all of them on my iPad, but only this one on my kindle.
1476712042|5.0|Just a great book, it has good moments bad moments, it makes you happy, sad, mad, and everything in between. Its just a great book and I can not wait until the 2nd one comes out.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I first heard of Ed Sheeran from his song A Team. I thought it was a good song, but not enough for me to purchase the CD. I seen him in concert last night and found he has many great songs up his sleeve. He played 45 minutes and each song was great. I looked this CD up when I got home and downloaded almost immediately. His music is reminiscent of Jason Mraz. Though A Team is played on the radio, I think Lego House, Drunk, U.N.I. at least should be as well though my current favorite is You Need Me, I Don't Need You. I recommend you see him in concert, but until then this CD is a good way to hear his music.
B0085YNML2|5.0|Love the design. So cute. Graphics are slick and unique. Sounds are funny. Puzzles are clever. All in all a great game. Very polished. Nice job, developer!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the ease of play and also the action of finishing<br />a winning deal. Also like being able to play with Vegas scoring.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|My wife and I watched a few episodes of this show on television, and we really started to enjoy it so we purchased the seasons.
1451695195|5.0|Have read a number of near death books and found this to be the best written and most readable.  Especially fascinating since it is a neurosurgeon his experience.  Compelling and inspirational.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|I love Matt Damon movies and I love John Grisham.  I purchased this because I loved watching it years ago and wanted to see it again.  It is a fantastic and simple little movie.
0062124293|5.0|One of the funniest books about true feminisim ever!!!  It is salty, hysterical, insightful and educational.  Enjoy, I did as did all  my friends who were lucky enough to receive one as a gift.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|I split ISP charges with my neighbor two houses down, but with the AWUS036NHR, it's like I'm only 2 rooms away from the router, and that's with stucco and plaster walls. This is a great follow-up to the AWUS036H b/g adapter (which is still a great adapter but doesn't work with my MacBook Pro running10.8).<br /><br />Initially I rated the AWUS036NHR One-Star because it would drop the network connection every minute or so, signal strengths would vary wildly, and connection speeds would dip to a crawl.  After contacting their tech support department, however, they were able to tweak the driver so that the connections were much more stable, AND they sent me a new unit.  This did the trick.  I still get dropped connections (I have to refresh available networks and reconnect, no big deal) but only every hour or two, and only when surfing.  When downloading, it doesnt seem to be an issue.  If you run 10.7 or 10.8 and do encounter any of the aforementioned issues, contact the company directly at tech@alfa.com.tw and they'll be able to send you the most up to date drivers.  They usually got back to me in a few hours despite the time difference in Taiwan.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game is so fun and funny awesome but after a while it starts to get hard I love this game
B004AKCME8|5.0|I was actually disappointed. I only read the first book but was enthralled. The story was rich and deep and entertaining...the movie might be good for children, but it just bores me. However it's a gift and the person getting it will enjoy it. Thankfully they left out most of the negative things in the book and this is more fun and silly.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice app to spend time with. Price is also right, with minimal ads. Simple solitarie, no special versions.<br />Again, nice app for free.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Great product! They can hear me and I can hear them perfectly!! Good price also! Can't beat it!<br />I used to have Bluetooth in my other truck people couldn't hear me at all and I couldn't hear them. This little device has come a long way!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|There is no doubt that Tom Clancy started the techno-Military thrillers many years ago.  I couldn't read them fast enough at the time. Nobody really pulled geopolitics and advanced warfare techniques together before him.  His more recent co-authored efforts didn't have the polish and edge of your seat experience that his early books did. He as been eclipsed by Vince Flynn and others,.......till Now.  I couldn't put this one down.  It is a scary and believable  read for our time.  All you die hard Clancy fans will love it.  I look forward to the next one from the new pair.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This is a very irreverent comedy that has so much humor.  If you are easily offended then TED may not be for you.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book I hate that it is so expensive though. I really enjoyed it though. Jeff's a wonderful author and illustrator though :)
B009HEJXFS|3.0|it is not the best of the three movies but it had its funny moments. I like Will Smith but this seemed slow
B008MM9630|5.0|pretty cool game. here there is an update but haven't gotten it yet on the kindle. plus I cant open cookies at the moment..
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This book was a waste of my time.  It answers none of my questions,is full of b.s. filler that no one cares about,and never really gets to the point. since he never does die,this is only another NDE read. I want my $8 back. Boring
B008CP6RWU|4.0|I love my FPS and TPS games but it sure is nice to take a break from those genres and play something  artful, peaceful and unlike other gaming experiences.
0783223161|5.0|After a while you ask yourself how it started, you have no idea what's next, and you have no idea how is going to finish... you will not get bored.
B007IJDXFK|5.0|I thought Falling Deeper and We're Here Because We're Here were about as good as this group would get. I'm happy to report that I was wrong in that assumption. There's no need to break the release down to separate songs. This certainly has highlights but I like to view it as a whole and it's an overwhelmingly beautiful whole, at that.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear what comes next. Anathema in this current iteration (I was never a fan of the really hard stuff) is an instant buy for me.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The story was a fun and enjoyable read. At times it's a bit wordy, so don't try reading it if you're tired, you'll read the same line 20 times and still not understand.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|I have the free version of the on my HTC Rezound and this is a great game. The learning curve was normal for a game like this. My only wish is that I did not have to spend so much time circling the landing strip on the land or carrier to get my plane aligned straight on with the target. Most of the time I have to do a fly over instead of land because my approach is wrong. I like the graphics and controls. It can be a bit dark at times.<br /><br />Man does this game soak up battery time.!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Have enjoyed the series so far and am anxiously awaiting the rest of the series so I can see how all comes out.  I like period pieces and am pleased with the story, costumes and scenes in this series.  I hope it is not too long before I can complete my set.  Everything arrived on time and in great condition so that pleased me as well!!!
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My grandson loved his calendar. He is trying to wait each day for his Advent Prize...He wants one every year.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I love the entire Batman series matter of fact he's my favorite comic book character. I liked Batman for the fact that he's a normal guy who knows the odds are always against him but he still carries on the battle anyway. Just about everything Batman does is about him overcoming and conquering something. What makes him work is that he's human with no super powers, no special abilities, he's just a normal trying to do something extraordinary and at times it takes away from his personal life and mostly he doesn't know who he is as a person and gets lost behind his mask as a protector of the city. In this film you don't really see any of those things that make Batman... well Batman. The movie starts out with him having Abandoned the City as a superhero and for what? This series is about the birth of Batman and him becoming a superhero. How is that possible with in movie 1 he establishes Batman, Movie 2 he is establishing his role and value in the city and movie 3 he has basically abandoned everything he did and stood for in movies 1&2.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" isn't exactly a fitting title for this movie, it's more like \\"The Dark Night Falls\\". You would assume that this movie would be about Batman once again rising over the villains and connecting deeper with his purpose of being a crime fighter. You really don't get that with this film it's more like the feeling of Rocky coming back from retirement for his last fight. This was actually a very depressing Batman film and there wasn't much about it that made him feel like a \\"superhero\\". Throughout the movie he is always one step behind the villain and seems to be in great distress. This isn't at all what Batman/Bruce Wayne are about. Batman is overly cautious about protecting his identity and his \\"belongings\\". You would never find his vehicles so easily and you would never just be able to walk into the Batcave like that. Hence why he goes to the trouble of secluding all his equipment in an isolated cave. It just seems highly unlikely that anyone would ever get their hands on any of his technology by such simple means. Of course that's all just part of the plot for the movie but the comic version of Batman isn't so naive.<br /><br />What I'm really just trying to get at about the movie is that it's depressing because it always feels like Batman just wants to give up and not really be Batman anymore. The more he sees a challenge in the movie the less he wants to put on his cape. His girlfriend was killed and his 2 face was killed and now he's fallen into depression again although he became Batman because his loved ones were killed to begin with, it just really contradicts the first 2 movies. To see Batman defeated and not comeback even harder and even worse without a plan is just kind of sad. For example, When Batman takes a hit he usually goes back to the cave, heals, comes up with a plan, and takes it to action to defeat his foe. In this movie THAT NEVER HAPPENS! He never actually follows what Batman would do. For example in Batman Vs. The Predator (great comic book btw) Batman is literally almost beaten to death by the Predator. He has absolutely no chance against him and barely escapes with his life. While Batman is healing he puts his mind to work and starts to figure out a way to beat the Predator so he designs the unbelievable suit of Bat armor that puts him on the same level as the Predator and gives him a fighting chance. THAT is how Batman should play out. If he loses a battle he uses his logic and abilities to figure out a way to win or at least increase the odds. There is absolutely none of that in the film and the ending plays out on a note that is very unBatman like.<br /><br />For a majority portion of the movie you hardly see Batman at all. He's maybe in it for about 45 minutes total out of the almost 3 hours of this movie. This movie mostly stars the supporting actors and the Batman makes his appearance. There is Catwoman in this film but this version I don't know. Michelle Pfeiffer's version was Purrrffffeccct and probably would have been a better fit in this movie as her character in Batman Returns was already Dark and seductive. The new Catwoman kind of seemed over the top and cartoonish plus I don't remember her ever calling herself \\"Catwoman\\". The actor that played her wasn't seductive and alluring enough to really pull you into her character and therefore it didn't make sense to see Batman falling for her. In the Batman Returns it makes sense because she is mysterious and seductive to Batman and they have an odd romantic chemistry and that's exactly how their romantic story is. They work as a couple because she's just as weird as he is. In this movie you never see that chemistry.<br /><br />But getting back to the movie it's just really depressing and not a very uplifting Super Hero movie. I was actually hoping at some point maybe Wonder Woman or Superman or maybe all the Justice league would come in and help him. Batman just seemed so lonely and depressed in the film it made you feel depressed watching him, and that's pretty much how I felt about it.<br /><br />3/5 for a good but movie but not a good super hero movie. I'm kind of disappointed the trilogy ended this way as 1&2 were completely amazing beyond belief.'t know.

B003RNU8KY|5.0|One of the few albums anywhere that you can just let play from beginning to end at be COMPLETELY satisfied.
B0033AGJ5E|1.0|Had to return the DVD as it was not compatible for the United States. Had I realized that I never would have ordered it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|A great set of sci-fi movies masterfully done by Sigourney weaver, one of her best!!! Right along with with &#34;The Abyss&#34;.
034580404X|5.0|Once I started reading it, I was hooked, couldn't stop reading it,now all my friends want to borrow it too many friends to go around, so I told them to order it themselves.
B008FC4WA4|3.0|This was a fast, fun read, but don't expect it to be as good as About a Boy. It's OK.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I play this game on Facebook and I do enjoy it; I wish they could link up though, as I love the touchscreen option for gameplay.
B000NY17J6|5.0|liked this item and would recommend it to anyone that is a Linda Ronstadt fan. My husband was thrilled to get it
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great writing... I wish all my friends and family would understand the teachings of this book.... we would all be better for it.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|We all know the story through film and television, this book is the greatest. It must be read by all who have heard or read about Dracula.
B006CQLGXG|4.0|Lovely book. Great story of transformation. The only problem I sometimes found was that Charles dickens used so much description at times that I got confused. Still a wonderful Christmas story.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I'm someone who thinks that if you truly like and respect an artist then you have to buy his or her studio albums and not just greatest hits complinations. So I'm not really into Michael Jackson compilations, as I rather buy the studio albums. But this one isn't just another greatest hits compilation. Besides Michael's greatest hits it also contains rareties, demos (many of them are as great as the released material - Cheater is a big favorite of mine and the We Are The World demo on which Michael is singing the whole song is, in my opinion, better than the well known US for Africa version), film music from The Wiz and Captain EO, songs from the Jackson 5 and the Jacksons.<br /><br />It leads you through Michael's career from the Jackson 5 to 2004 when this boxset was released. Hours of great and at times mesmerizing music - Michael Jackson style. There is also a concert DVD included (Bucharest 1992).<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the package which is very beautifully done and of excellent quality. There also comes a 57-page book with the package with color pictures and writings about Michael's career.<br /><br />If you are a casual Michael Jackson fan and don't want to buy all the studio albums, but want an essence of Michael then this is the boxset I recommend to you. If you are a more hard core fan then that's why you have to have it in your collection.
B00A50PE6K|3.0|THis is disappointing from the Glee Cast. Their 1st Christmas album was rockin' good. The 2nd one wasn't quite that good. This one is for folks who want old-fashioned Christmas songs, sung in traditional fashion, that you can get anywhere. Their singing is great of course, but it is NOT exciting!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|When it first came in I attempted to attach the clip for the mic and it immediately broke. Disappointed, I emailed Amazon and they immediately sent me a new one and picked up the damaged one. The new one was perfect!!! I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH THE MIC!!! Even running directly into my Canon T2I the sound is &#34;acceptable&#34; for stuff that is not too critical. I look forward to using this more.
B004NELBPC|5.0|I love the range of subject matter. Everything from politics to lifestyle. Personally, I could do without the 'celebrity' gossip.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|Hello,<br />What else do you say Sinatra Live At The Sands<br />Count Basie's Orch arranged by Quincy Jones<br />I would find it hard to believe that it gets better than this.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Got this for under $20 as a gift and it is awesome. Great box set, big and looks like it is worth $200! Can't go wrong with this. Limited edition and numbered. Only 250,000 were ever made.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|there  was a  time  Aerosmith  seemed  to  be  making some sort  of a  artistic  statement,  however  this  album  was  by the  numbers  and  while  steven tyler  being  associated  with american idol  caused  rumbling  in  the  smith  camp,  the  hype  through  the  show  was  suppose  to  showcase  the  band  to a  many an idol  hopeful or future act,  as  to how  its  suppose  to be done  and  instead  its alot of  filler  that feels  like high 3rd  tier  tracks at  best.  this  band  still  has  its  moments  on  stage,  however  nothing on this  album  is  what i'd  call good  to  great.  just  ok to coast  to.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Pretty sure this book is *real* live literature and that the film will dirty my opinion of it. But it should be taught in classes everywhere as just being a great book, critical thinking and all that. If it's not already being taught.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I love Dylan and am so happy that he is still giving us great tunes!  Please keep the music rolling.

0345803485|5.0|According to my wife, this is a really good book. Don't buy it for those who are... how would I say this... don't buy it for those who are not terribly adventurous in the bedroom. :) Also not appropriate for younger (less than 18) readers.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I enjoy this app. The layout is simple and the music is relaxing. I would like a bigger selection of pictures though.

B00632HWOG|2.0|The only problem is it keeps closing when I try to delete mail. I can only delete a few emails before it closes.
B0086449YA|4.0|Besides the fact that most of the songs sound very similar to one another,<br />It still sounded like pure music to me. I mean at 1st i figured \\"Yeah i'm going to rate this a 3\\"<br />but i just couldn't do it to Mark<br />He is still the best musician alive today.<br /><br />So to sum up 3 stars for the whole album<br />and an extra one because it has been created by the legend!!<br /><br />Thank you Mark
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The book started a little slow for me.  Once I got into it I couldn't<br />Stop. I am a sucker for a good dog story and a good cry.
B00A13719E|4.0|I rated this album four stars because it is a really good collection of songs. As promised, Christina has released a collection of songs that is totally different from the previous albums work. She expresses a lot of thoughts about being strong and rising above criticism and hate. It's good see her being this strong through all the hate she unjustly receives from media and fans alike because she has the nerve to be happy in her own skin. My favorite tracks are Circles, Blank Page, Just a Fool, Make the World Move, Let There Be Love, Light Up The Sky, and Sing For Me. The entire album is very good. I can listen to it from start to finish. The only reason I didn't give it five stars were the remaining two songs on this deluxe edition; Shut Up and Your Body remixed. Those two are both throw away songs that don't give anything to an otherwise great collection, I'm looking forward to the next sound she tackles.
B00589AYWW|5.0|outstanding! - a great read. i wish both mr. bush and mr. cheney had read the book in the the year 2000 following their first election
B008M721MS|5.0|it was a really good item i cant believe i have one, everyone should get one of their own!!! its the best toy i ever had!!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I love this story! It's a must read for sure. Made me appreciate the true meaning of Christmas even more than before.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I saw clips on an flight.  It was too demonic and I did not expect it.  The title was deceiving to me and not understandable.  It appeard to be &#34;space travel and challenge related&#34;.  There is enough demonic things in the world and I do not want to support it.  Movies like this leads to other mental states of demonism.  No thanks!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The story was fun and esy to read.  The characters had depth to them.  One major complaint though is that the book centered a fair amount of time in a baby, and it would have been nice to have angel epilogue with their baby involved.  It would have brought the book full circle.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|All of her best songs on one album with one quick download... Perfect!<br />I use it when I can't sleep, listening to the CD helps, recommended for insomniacs!
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This is a great sequel and middle movie to a great franchise. Matt Damon is wonderful, the action is intense, the whole movie franchise and idea is one of its kind. And this is the second one! Picks right up where the first one left off, continues the action and suspense, takes some emotional turns, etc. Really, get this film, its a great one to have in the collection.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think it is a good app. too many taps though. can they improve it? I will kelp playing it.
B00023B1LC|5.0|That's all I have to say about it really. Great film. But I'm sure you already know that by now.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it yet, then you shouldn't be on a computer because you're Amish.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this for my little sister. when I opened it, it was trying to download another 102 Mb.?!?! a brand- new kindle fire cannot even hold that much memory... point is I hate this app.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I waited for this movie for a long time. A VERY long time. While watching this on ANYTHING other than a big screen doesn't quite do it justice, its still an epic movie for two reasons:<br />1) The music. Its amazing. Turn that stuff up. It rattles your core, puts you in the right frame of mind and entire world, and is unlike anything you've heard before. But its wonderful. Somewhat electronic, somewhat backgroundy, COMPLETELY epic.<br />2) The visuals. This is one of the most visually stunning things I have seen in my entire life. The bright lights amidst the dark world they are in, the glowing lines of light bikes and discs, everything is amazing in this film. The story line is fun, a more modern update on the older version, and has some really cool moments. Its nothing too completely intense, hence the Disney, but that is good as it allows for all types of viewers.<br />This movie has kicked my butt a few times, and it is truly something else. If you haven't experienced it yet, please, do yourself a favor, and check it out. Its pretty cool!
034580404X|5.0|I know alotbof people get hung up in the bdsm in the book but I found that the story line to be the best thing about the book. So glad that Christian was able to grow throughout the trilogy and to come to terms with his past.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This is a fantastic way to end the run of Matt Damon's time in these movies. They did really well with wrapping his story line up, and the movie is just as good as the previous 2. Fans will like this one, if you haven't seen it already, I'd definitely recommend you do it. Make sure you watch the 2nd one first, though, just round the whole experience out.
B001P06GX4|3.0|When I received the package, the outer box was damaged and the actual game box was also damaged.  I am waiting until Christmas when my grandson opens the game to see if the game is damaged.  If so, I will return.<br /><br />This is the first item I've ordered from Amazon or one of its providers that arrived damaged.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This is just like the computer game. Although it is on a smaller screen (I play on my Kindle Fire) I still don't find it much harder than the other version. Its a good game, and I'm glad I got it.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|I bought these items for my wife. She is very satisfied with both items. I would suggest both items highly.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Works well with no problems on mytouch 4g. Fun Enough game your basic &quot;Find It&quot; game with a little Harry Potter twist. Picked it up as the FAOTD, but I cant justify payin 2.99 for it, maybe if it was 99&cent;. Kept repeatedly asking me to rate the game every three levels. Dunno if this is a newer version but you can pinch zoom, although there are some problems with the HUD.
B0063IH60K|2.0|While is play solitaire ok the problem is there are ads between every hand played this positively sucks.<br />Get rid of the apps and I might be willing to give it a 3 star rating.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is the best building game, I like when I can choose what I build and where I put my buildings. I'm a creative person, who like to build things and create my own cloths
1423165691|3.0|The book was not what I was really expecting.<br />There really appears to be no organization to it.  Just a bunch of sketches from the Disney archives.<br />Character sketches are not kept together i.e. Mickey Mouse is not kept together with other Mickey Mouse sketches.<br />Other than the lack of organization the book is a good reference.
B00138H876|4.0|Well worth the money. I have allways been a Dylan fan, and as I said in the header Complements any colection!
B000002JSN|5.0|What can I write that hasn't already been written about this album. It has everything, and even though it is a double, the band manage to sustain the energy and the interest throughout more than 80 minutes of great music. Most people prefer Led Zep 4. For me, this is the best Led Zep album.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I bought this app and paid full price for it but, the app will not install on my Kindle Fire. I am very upset please fix it.....Thanks!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this appp makes you at least twice as efficient as you are now. trust me and use this and remember everything!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is the best game ever yea it is addicting. and very easy and hard and very fun thank you
B0060FXBNM|4.0|I love Transformers, and this set was just amazing to have in Blu-Ray. If you only want the movies and no special features at all then get this set.<br />My one only complaint would be that the first Transformers isn't really Blu-Ray. You can see the grain in almost every single shot. Other than that the other 2 movies are perfectly fine.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a really great game. You can feed, clean, and play with tons of adorable pets! I give it 5 stars.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this app it is like the number one app!!!!! :-)<br />I play it like every minute!<br />I would recommend this app to my friends!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This is one of the first albums in years I bought the day of release!  So worth a listen they are so talented!
B002ZFQD0E|3.0|I wanted to love this album. I really did but that's not going to happen but I do enjoy some tracks on this cd and do think it's one of the best pop/rock albums in recent years and that's saying something for an album I'm not in love with.<br /><br />The Pros<br /><br />Janelle is very playful, soulful, and a big bright personality and that comes out on tracks like: Dance or Die, Faster, Tightrope and Come Alive (I can play this song 10 times in a row and not get tired). She can also be loving and eccentric and that comes out on songs like: Say You'll Go, Locked Inside and Mushrooms and Roses. Those are the stand out tracks<br /><br />The Cons<br /><br />The album overall is kind of boring and drags on. She only ''pops'' on certain tracks (mainly the ones I named). All of the interludes should have been left off, they were unnecessary and some of the songs sound alike. Either she wasn't singing in a different tone or the beats were similar all I know is they were forgettable and by the time I got to the long ass hell BabopbyeYa (it's about 8 minutes) I couldn't wait for the album to be done.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad album but also not a great one. She should stick to more fast James Brown inspired songs and leave the Prince moments she tried to pull on this album to the Purple One.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|Loved this book. Easy read. Great performer, friend and an inspiration to his fans. Fun read.  ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Deathly Hallows produced into 2 movies gives us MORE.  The story picks up with Harry turning 17, now an 'adult' to the wizarding world.  Thanks to Hermione's intelligence and planning, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are able to escape when Bill Weasley's wedding with a half-Veela ends on a bad note.  The friends end up like nomads, setting out to hunt down Horcruxes instead of going back to their 7th year at Hogwarts; eventually one of them leaves.  However, with help from the foresight of Albus Dumbledore, the trio are well-equipped to face the evils set into place by Voldemort and his followers. As an avid fan of the books, I don't feel I can give a proper review; the acting, scripting, scenery, graphic effects were all satisfying and perfectly presented. A keeper- an instant favorite DVD in my collection.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|It's been worth the wait! Now LAWRENCE OF ARABIA in it's Blu-ray form reflects the magnificence of its original 70mm release. David Lean's masterful direction and Robert Bolt's screenplay have given the cast the roles of a life-time. There is no other film more visually striking then this one. FIVE STARS in every way for the film and the disc.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed the story, though I still, even after having finished the trilogy several months ago, feel as though I was tricked into buying one story as three parts.
B007JNR518|5.0|Some consider THE HORSE WHISPERER to be too long -- not me. For me this is one those special films that I return to again and again. The Blu-ray release is a huge improvement over the former DVD release. This is Robert Redford's masterpiece. Beautifully photographed and edited with a powerful sound track that helps capture Redford's masterful direction. The film takes the high ground by avoiding the novels soap opera romance with something that is far more inspiring. It is a great story of the healing power of love. Performances are all outstanding.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It truly is an interesting storyline. I care for the characters, cheer them on.  It's a bit escapist, as well, for anyone who isn't commonly exposed to high-finance lifestyle.  Better written than the 1st book of the trilogy, still somehow padded to 'fill' a book, I believe.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great App! Has local weather and alerts!  Easy to read screen with most common info:  Time, Temp, RealFeel, Humidity, Visability, UV Index, Sunrise and Sunset Times, Winds and graphics to show current conditions.  Also a very helpful iconbar at the bottom that I use mostly to get the 15-day forecast.<br /><br />This is my favorite weather app!  It has everything I want to know at a glance, and a link to Accuweather.com if I need to know more!<br /><br />Five Stars!  My highest recommendation!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey introduces us to newly graduated from college, Anastasia Steele, and wealthy troubled Christian Grey.  They meet, they get together through a series of events, they learn that they each have some of what the other needs.  The cliffhanger at the end grudgingly made me want to read on. Without it I would have passed.  It should have been sold as one book, not three, and I feel a tiny bit cheated for having to pay for 3 books to read the whole story.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|A unique telling of a much-loved story from childhood that has been turned on it's head and re-energized.<br /><br />The Summary<br /><br />Cinder is a teenager that is living with her stepmother and stepsisters much like the Cinderella from old that we are familiar with. She also attracts the attention of a prince, in this case Prince Kai, that no one believes she is worthy of and he is throwing a ball. That's where the resemblance to the traditional story ends. I felt Cinder had even more going against her due to the fact that she is a cyborg and living as a servant to her stepmother and stepsisters. Cyborgs in the Lunar Chronicles are treated like slaves that have no feelings and are meant to be beneath everyone else. After a disease that is sweeping through New Beijing hits too close to home, Cinder is thrust into the fray and begins to unravel a lot of truths...about her past, her present, and what may become of her future.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />Cinder is so easy to empathize with and I liked her right from the start. It's not just her either, the side characters were all enjoyable except for the ones you weren't supposed to like which of course, I didn't. The story is unique, enriched, and complex. I was worried at first that there would be a lot of language about robotics and science in general that I might not be familiar with and would have a hard time following along, but Marissa Meyer described everything well and kept the story easy to understand. The plot progressed at a great rate and remained interesting from start to finish.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that since there was so many other things going on, there wasn't really a lot of romance. There was really just a spark and initial budding. I hope to see more later in the series.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I believe that even though there was some foreshadowing used in this book, and the reader might draw the right conclusions, it still held a lot of surprises. It was a very unique story that gave me everything that I can ask for from a book. I must read the 2nd one, Scarlet as soon as it is possible.ises.

B0098VYCCE|4.0|great special effects, a bit violent but very good; Theron is excellent as usual; like the twist on the prince
B00992CF6W|3.0|I just downloaded this game and can not find the survival mode at all. If someone could help me or tell me where to find it that would be great. anyone. I thought it had been updated to have the survival mode at least that's what I read from reviews and read online.
B0092QITO2|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this remake. It's been years since I've watched the original. I remember that version as somewhat cheesy with low budget special effects & cinematic style.<br /><br />This new version succeeds in several ways for me.<br /><br />It does a great job visually. Sure it borrows from Blade Runner and other movies, but it does it well. I loved that the movie created the kind of density of urban grit like in Ridley Scott's Los Angeles, 2019. The tunnel through the earth was kind of new, if somewhat a stretch of physics. But I routinely accept things equally as unlikely such as Star Trek & Star Wars FTL travel.<br /><br />The sets and cityscapes, design of the cars and urban areas were visually delicious.<br /><br />I liked the Bourne-esque action too. Nicely done.<br /><br />I found Collin Farrel's not overly intellectual Quaid/Hauser to be likeable and vulnerable, tough and sexy. Kate Beckinsdale did a great job being the bad guy.<br /><br />I liked the nods to the original, especially the lady in the security checkpoint.<br /><br />It's a fun, energetic popcorn sci-fi action film. It's not deep, it will not elevate your soul or make any heavy handed important statements about society or the origin of man. I think it's important to judge a film on it's own terms without so much preconception & expectations and also be able to just enjoy a  visual ride.<br /><br />If you are a fan of hard core sci-fi & don't have a stick in your i/o port then check it out.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is very hard to not play it bu the thing I don't like is it stopped at the first world end!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love how it tells how. any hrs I have till it goes off. love that I can choose music. and love that I have to answer math questions to disable really makes me wake up and think

B007WPLZAK|4.0|I so enjoyed this movie. The characters completely moved me.  I recommend to anyone.  It is worth the time.  I want to read the book to have a better understanding of the characters.
B005EVV5GI|5.0|Like at least one other reviewer, I purchased this boxed set in order to have Klemperer's account with the New Philharmonia of Mahler's Seventh Symphony, a recording that had been out-of-print for some time. My go-to version of this work has pretty much always been Leonard Bernstein's original account with the New York Philharmonic on Sony, but I think it's likely that after a few more sessions with it this rendition will supplant the Bernstein as my first choice. Both recordings are excellent, but somehow for me Klemperer's better evokes the era of Mahler than does Bernstein's, which is rooted in a more universal sensibility -- of course, others may prefer that insead. Point is, as much as I love the Bernstein, I think I'm getting to love the Klemperer even more. Meanwhile, the accounts of the Second and Ninth Symphonies and Das Lied von der Erde are considered classic or even definitive by some, and while I'm so sure about the latter I can definitely sign on when it comes to the former description. Between Klemperer and Bruno Walter, I have always preferred Klemperer's approach to Mahler, and while I don't know that I would consider these renditions of the Nos. 2 and 9 and Das Lied the best ever, I certain get a special feeling when listening to them -- I suppose because I talk myself into there being just two degrees of separation between myself and Mahler when listening to Klemperer conduct him. Even ignoring that illusion, the performances of those two works under Klemperer are marvelous to hear, and to me at least they sound better in this release than they have in previous editions. The remaining pieces in the set -- two songs from Des Knaben Wunderhorn, 3 Ruckert Songs and the Fourth Symphony -- are also very nice if not the high points of the release overall. Sadly, this boxed set comes with no notes at all, though the only work that is split between discs is the Symphony No. 9, whose first movement finds itself all alone with the complete No. 7. Despite those shortcomings, this is an excellent buy and at the price worth it for the performance of the Seventh Symphony alone. Recommended highly.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Worst movie of the year......century....bad bad Matthew McConaughey looks really bad aging fast.  I only rented it because someone said it was good....but will no longer trust her opinion.....loose story plot, slow painfully slow...do not buy or rent PLEAZSE

1449410243|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Oatmeal. I happen to love his humor. I loved 5 very good reasons to punch a dolphin. A dolphin became our office mascot and we have a blow up one we punch to let off steam. That being said, the previous book sampled from all the oatmeal has to offer. It wasn't all dolphin humor. I was expecting the same from this book. I found the list this book was named after very funny. And a few other jokes. But overall, it was too many cat jokes. It was, in fact, ALL cat jokes. I also found the Bob cats lame and they went on too long. Totally disappointed. I will go back to reading the oatmeal on line, because it is really runny.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this little game and play it all the time.  I would go there again and buy another one.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|The basic setup is easy and once you find all the little buttons and have the drivers installed, it works great. Getting clean sound and good dynamic range out of it is easy as well. I'm still learning audio, so I don't know that this is the best, but for the price, it really can't be beat.

B006GECE9Y|4.0|Good app, fast browsing and have great tools but if you arer geting this app to have acces to flash content on the web you will need a addon called super video player for dolphin that you can only get from google playstore and i guess you are here cause the play store rejects your device, lets all hope some one gets the addon on amazon app store so we all can be happy browsing...<br />Over all app is great !!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|A good book to read anytime of day especially on trips when you need a good book to read in my opinion.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was an interesting and thought provoking novel.  The way it's set up keeps you guessing.  Of special interest to parents to try to place yourself in the perspective of Jacob's parents.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Okay book very sad in some places because some people die but it is written so you almost feel like you are there.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I found the trilogy to be compelling and couldn't put it down.  Actually haven't talked to anyone who read it who felt differently.

B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Great combo package for this type of movie. The package arrived on time and the it was sealed and protected. Great job!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Bought this or my 5 year old neice......2 words:  TIME OCCUPIED!!  SHE LOVES IT, and just wants to Master this thing for hours on end!  SHe has the 2 easier ones, and they were too easy for her.  Bought this....she has been stuck a few times, but gets it.  It states ages 8+....but for those who have Heavy Brain active children, this is highly Recomended!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It'll be interesting to see if, when Ridley Scott makes a film version, he changes the title. I'm not sure I would go see a movie that is called &#34;Wool&#34;. But that would be a mistake because I'm thoroughly enjoying reading this book.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I rate it only 3 cause you need a lot of these investment dollars to do stuff they make you post or do reviews like this kind of sucks reall and then when you do sometimes you don't get the. money
B004IWR06S|3.0|Matt Damon is a reluctant psychic in this movie, and encounters two other people by happenstance. By the end of this movie, the three shall meet. I think that the visionary scenes needed some work and elaboration, they were scant and vague. A lot of this movie is depressing...and I prefer somewhat lighter fare with more substance.
034580404X|5.0|I havent finished the third book in the set yet.  It is something you cannot put down and dinner has been late on several occasions.  You really lose track of time once you begin to read.

0375869026|5.0|Recommended to me by my 5th grader.  Upon opening the book and beginning to read, I couldn't put it down.  Simply wonderful!  It is a book that can be enjoyed by adults as well as children.  I thought the book provided a window to school life that as a parent I can often be too far removed from...the story is sobering at times, yet the caring, compassion, and friendship that develops as the story progresses is heartwarming.  I particularly enjoyed that the story was told from multiple perspectives...really felt this rounded it out.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|Yeah, I bought all three!! Really got caught up in the hype.  Would not recommend.  If you feel you must read the trilogy, save yourself some money and time, and read the first half of the first book and skip to the second half of the third book, you will have missed nothing more than aggravation.

B000RHKARY|4.0|The first half of the album was &#34;right on&#34; !  The quality of the bonus tracks was severely lacking....fuzzy and garbled.  I couldn't even stand to listen past the first bonus track!<br /><br />I bought the cd to recreate a favorite old album and I was not at all disappointed!  I merely turn it off after the original &#34;Crusade&#34; tracks.
B00AE2I4B6|4.0|Dancing was awesome! The acting wasn't too bad. Storyline was ok. really enjoyed dance scenes. Choreography was very good. I enjoyed watching this movie although the love story is beginning to be redundant.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset hasn't disappointed since I've got them.  Very comfortable to wear, sounds are clear, crisp and I've had no complaints on the quality of the mic while speaking through them.  The wireless range and battery life are ahead of the curve compared with other headsets I've used in the past.  I'd highly recommend these to anyone who, like me prefers excellence in a gaming environment, you'll not regret this purchase.
B00004WIDQ|4.0|I saw \\"Jurassic Park\\" at the theater with my then-girlfriend wife in 1993. There was much anticipation concerning Spielberg's dinosaurs and, as far as that goes, the film delivers. The story is a good-enough stage for the dinosaurs and the characters are okay. As my title blurb points out, this is essentially a Disney adventure with horrific dinosaurs.<br /><br />The latter is where the film excels, but it takes a whole hour to arrive. The good thing about the long wait is that it creates much anticipation. (\\"[[ASIN:B00003CXXS Jurassic Park III (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]]\\" does the exact opposite and suffers for it). When the t-rex sequence arrives it is both most welcome and truly horrifying. Two other thrilling scenes are memorable - the t-rex chasing the jeep and the closing velociraptor sequence, particularly in the kitchen.<br /><br />As far as the principle cast goes, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are effective as the male protagonists while Laura Dern is likable enough. She doesn't trip my trigger in the sex appeal department, but that's just a matter of taste. The kids are good, especially the girl (Ariana Richards), while Richard Attenborough comes across as Santa Claus. Wayne Knight plays the quasi-villain and he originally struck me as wandering off the set of another movie. Seeing the film recently, he's still a bit over-the-top and cartoony, but provides a necessary contrast to the other characters.<br /><br />The film runs 127 minutes and was shot in Hawaii, Dominican Republic and Costa Rica.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The dinosaurs and thrills are A+ while the story and characters are just good-enough. This is a straight-ahead family-friendly adventure with little depth and there's nothing wrong with that, especially since the film delivers what we came for - realistic-looking dinosaurs, and more - total horror.<br /><br />GRADE: B

This game is very easy to play and almost impossible to fail. To Me it's kinda like an add-on to Cut the Rope with a twist. Ifyou best all the levels if the game and want more then this is a perfect game to add on to the fun. Great to pass the time as well. A great way to exercise the mind and still have fun. Hope this helped.[...]. Thanks
0547564651|4.0|As parents, we hope that our children will be smart. We want them to do well in school (and hopefully enjoy it, too), ace the SATs, and thus be high-achievers throughout life. In short, we equate intelligence with success. When was the last time that we wished that our little ones had grit, or perseverance, or optimism? Author Tough argues that qualities like those might be the ones that really matter in terms of the success of your child.<br /><br />Having a little one, I browse lot of parenting and child rearing books, and am always on the lookout for something that seems to have an interesting and new perspective. That said, I definitely wouldn't classify this as a \\"parenting\\" book, and would recommend it to anyone interested character.<br /><br />How Children Succeed shows how character defines us in terms of not only our day to day life, but also our life as a whole - our successes, failures, and ability to thrive in the world. And it's not just Tough who is interested in character qualities - in recent years, researchers and educators have begun to evaluate and track students based on certain interpersonal indicators. By looking into school systems with value systems different than just test scores, and seeing the successes of the students they produce (in terms of eventual graduation from a four year college,) the book makes a strong case for character.<br /><br />The changes in my parenting style that will result from this book are subtle, but it has definitely made me more open to allowing my child to fail in order to help her learn perseverance and grit, and to look less at the grades she earns in the future and more at the journey she took to get there.
B0037VNX44|5.0|I'm not even sure I fully appreciate this movie yet, but it was very entertaining. Tom Hardy does a great job. Definitely worth checking out.
0375869026|5.0|Auggie is not your typical fifth grader. Actually, he's not even a fifth grader, he's homeschooled. And he's homeschooled because he has mandibulofacial dystosis which, for those of us not in the medical terminology know, is a congenital abnormality of the face. Abnormality may be a little too lightly stating it - Auggie is more than abnormal. His eyes are halfway down his head, and his ears (what he considers to be his worst feature) are squashed, cauliflower like, and in need of hearing aids. He's had to teach himself to keep his tongue inside of his mouth, and when he eats (slowly, carefully, and only with very small and soft foods) he makes a tremendous mess. This is after a multitude of facial surgeries that have spanned his whole life, however, so he used to be worse off. The doctors didn't even think he would live.<br /><br />Although they've tried to protect him from the world since birth, it's time for Auggie to go to school. With other kids. Who are normal.<br /><br />Wonder tracks the story of Auggie's first year of school. Middle school is hard on anyone, but for a kid like Auggie? Yikes. The story rotates between a cast of characters, each retelling the same occurrences, but from their own perspectives. I fell in love with Auggie, his big sister Via, his friend Jack, and the rest of the crew almost immediately.<br /><br />Sometimes funny, sometimes sad (true story: I cried three times while reading it), this book is a great read. I completed it in a day, and am left wondering what sixth grade will bring (though author Palacio has already said that she's not planning a sequel.) While officially a kids book, I would recommend this for any age.

0345803485|1.0|I really tried to like this book and even went so far as to buy the second... unfortunately the book was just too shallow. It fails as a romance novel and then fails even worse as a sex novel in my opinion.
B000J670ZI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br />I would recommend anyone who<br />likes Cary Grant and Katherine<br />Hepburn to watch this movie
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Sleeping would be a much better use of time than watching this movie.<br /><br />Good special effects, spotty acting and over-acting, really weak story development, character development non-existent.<br /><br />Other than that there is nothing to recommend this movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If even half the science is correct visits to mars is very possible. Could not put the story down.  Highly recommend.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|As I suffered through this movie (thanks to someone else in the house wanting to watch it) I tried to put my finger on why it wasn't working for me.<br /><br />Batman came across so weak. The first part of the movie is nothing but talking and debating about whether or not he should return as Batman while various incidents are happening in Gotham. This was very boring. Then after a fight with the villain where he loses easily he spends another good portion of the movie stuck in a prison. So it wasn't until the last fifteen percent that he sort of showed he could fight back.<br /><br />The other problem is that Batman came across so one-dimensional it was hard to care about him. He lacked emotion, other than being cranky about everything. Then there is continual death, destruction, violence and misery without let up. Oh yes, and torture. I just don't enjoy watching helpless people be tortured and even Batman was helpless on several occasions. Because of the dark nature of this movie, everyone is sad and miserable all the time. It's all very grim and insanely serious. Whatever happened to some comic relief? Basically, they have turned Batman into a horror movie because the villains are similar to the types you see in horror movies. At least Batman managed to save everyone in the end...but of course we all know in the end that's what is going to have to happen.<br /><br />There is a detective (Robin) who I liked more than Batman simply because he was actually doing something. Then there was a \\"Cat\\" woman who was interesting for being unpredictable. The little twist at the end suggested another sequel. *sigh* I only wish that movie goers would stop supporting these reboots and go for something new and good...rather than familiar and boring.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow, this book was intense...I couldn't put it down! Great writing and very suspenseful. I didn't know what to expect next!
0316228532|1.0|I started reading this book with great hope and expectation. I was disappointed. Too many characters to keep track of. The characters were recognizable, but I just didn't care what happened to them. I got though about 7 chapters and fell asleep on it. I tried again when I woke up. Put it down and don't plan to touch it again.
B004K00NEO|5.0|GRAND KIDS ALWAYS ASK PAPPY TO PLAY THIS MOVIE AGAIN AND AGAIN, VERY ENTERTAINING...A MUST VIEW VIDEO FOR ALL AGES
0307120007|3.0|my kids (now in their 40's) had this book and loved it.  i got it for my 12 month old grandson.  the current version is cheaply made, with sharp corners. the material is lightweight, and it looks as though it will fall apart soon.  the old version was made of heavy coated cardboard with rounded edges and corners.<br /><br />also, i guess the story is a bit dated now, as there are so few mothers with wedding rings, and daddies are often absent.  oh well
B000KC5350|5.0|This is the same as my original suction cup mount that I received when I purchased the Nuvi many years ago.  I keep hoping the Nuvi will die so I can get another one, but it keeps on working!  Anyway, I am very careful with these suction cups but my DH is extremely rough on them.  He continuously adjusts the mount and keeps it in his car which sits out in the heat; hence, he's gone through at least two of these becuase the hinges crack after so many adjustments.  Once I mount this, I rarely move it - just insert the Nuvi and pop the Nuvi off.  If I need to take the mount off, I release the clip holder but let the mount slowly release itself rather than trying to forcefully it off immediately.  (If you forcefully pry it off, some of the backing may stick to the window and it will wear out sooner.)  DH has gotten his own gps so I shouldn't have to replace this one!
B000T433CO|4.0|Had a great time watching this.  Yes, predictable.  But terrific actors -- Cameron Diaz and Jude Law have never done much for me, and they were both wonderful in this.  Great settings, too.  A bon bon.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The most amazing restoration ever produced. I saw the new print at the NY Film festival last month. The blu-ray release retains<br />every bit of the quality. If you are a fan of this film, this is the ultimate experience. Hopefully there will be more 4K restorations in the future.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This box set has literally dozens of hours of extra material. Just fantastic! Plus it was offered at a crazy low price when I snagged it. So awesome.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|Beautifully done! A great tribute to a very special person who lived a life we can only imagine. I'm not a star-struck person but rather someone who choses to admire only those deserving of it. I research everything about The Beatles I can find and sift through the ever-present misconcpetions. I know of their hypocracy (e.g., While not as hypocritical as Paul or John, George writes of living in the material world and tells us we should limit our possessions lest they possess us... writing such things while sitting in one of the rooms of his castle). I'm realistic enough to accept these things, look past them, and listen to George, the man. I have always admired him for his honesty, his humor, and for his wonderful ability to truly not care what anyone else thinks of him. You'll see a lot of that in the video, along with some great historical photos and films which are very factual. You'll definitely learn something about him. I'm not a fan of his later music, and the video contains a lot of that. However, it does show his devotion to his beliefs. Of course, his greatest music is also included as are interviews with his close friends such as Eric Clapton.
B009X01C64|5.0|Marware makes a number of cases for various mobile devices. I already have a Marware Microshell for my 7\\" Kindle Fire. I have been using that case for about one year and the Fire still looks brand new.  This review is for the Marware Revolve Portrait and Landscape Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\". I have been using this case since I got the Fire HD 8.9\\" in late November, and I can honestly say that this case brings protection to a whole new level.<br /><br />Made of leather, and lined with a soft microfiber interior, the Revolve has much more padding than the Microshell. The case rotates 180 degrees and gives you three viewing angles in either portrait or landscape position. A hand strap on the inside of the case gives you the option of using the Kindle with one hand (useful when standing in a train or bus) and the lid automatically powers the unit on when it is in sleep mode.<br /><br />The Fire HD 8.9\\" snaps tightly into the plastic shell and the case also has a strap that holds the case open or closed. I'm not sure \\"which way is up\\" for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\", but when you insert the Fire into the case, make sure the micro HDMI and charging ports are on the outside and the speaker grills are exposed in the back.  Of course, since you can rotate the Kindle, you can always flip it around to access the HDMI or charging ports.<br /><br />I like the Revolve a lot. Although not inexpensive, the Fire is not cheap either, and the Revolve offers a lot of protection (good if you take your Kindle to work or on vacation). I like the watch movies on the Fire 8.9\\", and having the option of various viewing angles is also very useful. Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|if your board this is a game to play I like it due to all of the different games that u can play the thing I hats is the ads they have
B008NABUU8|4.0|This was a fun though not quite a physics game. Once you found ways around the standard way of doing things, it was relatively easy to  get 4 stars on all the bridges you build. A few were very challenging to complete. I liked the stress meter and the zoom in function. They helped a lot. I didn't like the grid per say. You could only connect at the corners of the squares that make the grid. It makes it hard to do other than 45 degree angles. Overall I liked the game very much. It was a good thing to do when you had a little time on your hands that you could stop playing when you needed to without having to start over again.
0399226907|5.0|My daughter loves this book and playing with where the caterpillar ate through the food.  I love how sturdy it is.  Great story and my daughter loves saying beautiful butterfly at the end.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I found this movie to be not as funny as expected.  The story is great, a kid and his teddy bear being his only friend and such but all the cussing and crude humor was a little much.  The bear sounds like peter griffin and Mr. Punishment rolled up into one, kind of hard to see it as a movie in itself and not another episode of family guy.  The comedy was good at the beginning but got very old after awhile.  If they would have improved the comedy and cut out the stale jokes it could have been a fun movie.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|One of the best black & white films made should be in every one's collection, while it may seem a bit slow compared to modern film. It has one thing most of them don't which is I can watch this film over and over an always see some thing different or see what is going on in new way.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|The movie was pretty funny but this was the 1st time I had a n amazon movie stop so many times to buffer, I don't know if it was your end or mine but I watched something on netflix right after and it was fine.<br />Mike
0385536828|2.0|It just took a lot of grit to finish this book.  And it took McEwan a long time to say what he had to say.  I kept thinking the book needed some editing to eliminate the verbosity - and then darned if I didn't read a review that said pretty much the same thing.  The truth is that by the time I got halfway through the book, I started skimming - and I knew I wasn't missing much of anything. By contrast I just finished Emily Giffin's \\"Where We Belong\\" and I kept thinking that I dare not miss a word because every word counted.  Go figure.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Sometimes the puzzles were annoying bot with a little break and going back  they could be solved. The hint guide was good. I had to use it a couple of times. Like other games like this one, I wish there was a zoom in feature. At times, it would make it easier to see what's going on. The way the map was laid out and worked, for lack of a better word, sucked. It was all but usless and did more to irritate than to help navigate. More than once it was easier to keep back tracking and getting a bit lost trying to find where you wanted to go than to try and use the map. It wasn't a deal breaker, but it didn't do anything for the game either. I didn't think the puzzles were overly difficult like others had written. When I needed to use the hints, I was LIKE DUH I should have figured that out. It was more like I couldn't see the forest through the trees.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Phillip Phillips delivers!  Great CD, including the song HOME!!  Very happy to have it before Christmas, makes a great gift.
B0067FGYGQ|2.0|I added this CD to an order after hearing Sharon Van Etten's vocals with Rufus Wainwright on the [[ASIN:B009A9EKGM Holidays Rule]] CD on \\"Baby It's Cold Outside.\\"  I like the electronic wail of \\"Serpents\\" on a breakup song, \\"You enjoy sucking on dreams; so I will fall asleep with someone other than you.\\"  \\"Magic Chords\\" is a slow song with a haunting melody, \\"You got nothing to lose this time.\\"  For the rest of the set, I don't get much of a buzz from the material of Van Etten as a songwriter.  There aren't emotions that make me feel like I jump into her skin.  On \\"Give Out\\" and \\"All I Can\\" her singing style of sliding between notes seems untrained and amateur.  So while I am spinning \\"Serpents,\\" the rest of the disc will probably sit on a shelf.  Taxi!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Neat little film enjoyable if you are eight or eighty years old, has a story line that you can watch multible times an see some thing different every time.

0316228532|2.0|Not ever having read her HP books I thought I'd give this novel a try.  Patience, fortitude, resolve -- I needed all of them, but to no avail.  Got half way through and decided that these characters didn't warrant any more of my time.  But this is just J.K.'s first baby step away from HP.  She'll read the reviews and hopefully start again in some other direction.  She should at least include one character you'd like to have tea with -- and that would be one more than I found in Casual Vacancy.
B00913DPW2|4.0|I enjoyed the game overall. Had some issues where it was difficult to discern what was on the screen. A zoom feature would have helped a lot. Also, a better hint system would have been appreciated. The puzzels could be hard at times, and sometimes you weren't sure if you had completed everything or not..
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest for kindle fire rocks!! Its amazing and works great! I love this App! Any free time?  Pinterest here I come!!
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I saw this band on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" and bought \\"Some Nights.\\"  Three of the tracks have caught my ear.  The title track bangs out like a happy rock march which is juxtaposed by the deep anxiety in the lyric, \\"Oh lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for.\\"  \\"Carry On\\" again taps into the Celtic march feel, joyful and celebratory despite difficulty and uncertainty, \\"May your past be the sound of your feet on the ground.\\"  The bonus track \\"Out on the Town\\" also appeals to me with what sounds like a mock police siren \\"Woo woo woo\\" in the background.  What fun!  Enjoy!
B0063IH60K|4.0|The maneuvering in this game is easy and fun. The only annoying part is the ads. The game is a nice  addition to my kindle.
1451696191|5.0|In the novel, The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky, the reader is introduced to the life of Charlie, a misfit freshman in high school who is dealing with the suicide of his best friend Michael. Charlie writes letters to an anonymous individual he thinks will understand what he is going through better than his family will. Throughout the book, Charlie meets siblings Sam and Patrick who introduce him to \\"the world of misfits\\" and show him the meaning of friendship. As the year goes by, Charlie starts to uncover secrets from his past that leads him to understand why he is so different. This is a heart wrenching story about joy, love and the awkwardness known as high school that will leave readers laughing on one page and crying on the next. This book deals with a lot of personal struggles that may not be suitable for sensitive readers. Charlie and many characters experiment with drugs, alcohol and sex and Charlie discovers a very dark past that, again, may not be appropriate for younger or sensitive readers.  Overall, readers who like deep novels with a built up plot twist will love this book.
B008220DIC|3.0|\\"The Master\\" is the only film I've seen that I call \\"psychologically disgusting.\\" Don't get me wrong, the cinematography is gorgeous (I truly wish that I could have seen it in 70mm), and the commentary underneath that shows religion through charisma as the ultimate poison is brilliant. In spite of this, the performances, particularly Amy Adams' (giving Lady Macbeth a run for her money!), are so well-acted that once I left the theater, I felt like I had paid to watch humanity get defiled onscreen. I almost vomited.<br />The crux of this review is that if you can take psychological thrillers and/or men and women behaving shamefully (and then some), then at least give this film a rental. Everyone else -- \\"The Hobbit\\" is now in theaters. I'll buy the popcorn.
0525953728|1.0|The authors have been working so hard at not revealing any secrets that they achieved it too well, nothing is revealed, no details, and the story gets thin and bland. The heroes train hard, get in, make a few mistakes, solve the problem, get out. Not exciting to read, for an action that probably had a lot more to reveal.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|The edges are sharp and not smooth. Dust gets in the case which is visible through it. Back side of the case is very dingy looking and yellowish.<br /><br />If you want a simple protective case it's good. But for the money, I would suggest a Speck Candyshell.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like games like this.  mini games rock.  g5 games are my favorites but must they all be so macabre and filled with ghosts and demons?
0470876417|5.0|This is a great book, if you are running a business or plan to, this is a great starting point. It is unique and has unique writers I used it for a doctoral strategy course. Its by visionaries and challengers, you can tell. I am pleased with the seller.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like the game a lot but frustrated. Level 23 and it reset twice! Does anyone have any suggestions? Please and thank you.

0345803485|5.0|Seem to be pretty silly, but I'm a bit of a slow reader for these kinds of book, so it'll take awhile. Seem good for modern likeness. ;)
B005LAIHZY|4.0|First and foremost, this is a great movie.  Pixar in top form on all counts, and the short included with this title was the best I'd seen since they did the old guy playing chess against himself.  My one issue is not with the film, maybe just my blu-ray copy, but maybe it's a bigger issue: a chapter from the end, the movie hiccups and skips to the end of the chapter.  It's not scratched, and it's done every time my family has watched the blu-ray version.  The DVD works fine.
1451695195|5.0|Don't be put off by that word &#34;heaven.&#34;  This book written by a neurosurgeon who was only tepidly spiritual before this experience is a moving account quite different from the other near death experience accounts I have read.  I have found it quite exciting and have been recommending it to my friends both churched and unchurched.  I also find it very personally hopeful.  The book is structured by interleaving a narrative reconstructed from clinical notes and the accounts of others with a fascinating account of Dr. Alexander's own experiences while in a very deep coma for more than a week and it raises questions about consciousness very thoughtfully.
B001U887PQ|5.0|These are perfect for the winter. It's crocs + socks! I live in a pier and beam house so the floors stay cold. These are perfect for running around the house, or going out.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I loved it I was able to get going really fast. Also the hints helped me through times that I was confused in. I also really like the extra quests along the way. Yes it's easy to<br /> Play because I beat it in under a week.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have played the game many times on my computer.  Than I got the free one on the Kindle, only too few to play. Bought it and like it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A fun app, great for waisting time here or there. There is one drawback though. Getting investment points can be a really pain.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Just picked up the Blu-Ray of The Dark Knight Returns Part 1.  This is an awesome adaptation of the graphic novel (at some points shot-for-shot), and I'm very excited to see the second part.  The main thing as an animated Batman fanatic I was concerned about was the lack of Mark Hamill as the Joker.  I realize this isn;t the first project he hasn't been voicing him, but STILL!  But I am glad to report that Michael Emerson will be one of the few people I'd enjoy taking the mantle from him.  Job well done again, DC!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love it, great show! Will definitely buy the next season when it comes out. Really looking forward to it. Awesome.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app, works really well and is a ton of fun. thanks so much. I wish all apps worked this well.
0374214913|5.0|Please consider \\"Masters of Atlantis\\" (5 stars) by Charles Portis, if you liked this book. It has similar goings-on of secret societies and the like. See my review of it if you need more information.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I picked this mic up because I was looking for an inexpensive lavalier mic that I could use to do live video. One thing I noticed when I was testing it out was that when using it with my iPhone 4 (and additional mic connection cable) that the level that it recorded at when using the Voice memos app was terrible. I tested it several times to make sure it wasn't me or a loose connection. I weathered on and recorded a couple test videos with the iPhone (FiLMiC video recording app), and the sound input was great! I;m wondering if it is just something with the Voice Memos app? In any event, if I just want audio I can always record with a video app and just grab the audio from it.<br /><br />This is a very inexpensive way to record quality audio. I suggest you pick one up.

B0046YK4NE|5.0|Women & Children First is still one of the best Van Halen's albums in their discography. It follows the hard rock and heavy metal influence from their earlier releases but with more melodic solos throughout the entire album. It is certainly not their best album, but still a memorable item to own and collect.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Number 1: Please ignore any negatibve reviews/comments regardint this novel or the Twilight Series.<br /><br />Number 2: I did not want this book to end.  This is an amazing conclustion to the Twilight saga that will leave you wishing there was another novel to follow.  I love how it is written and how lose ends all come together.<br /><br />This is a gread love story and I reccomend this series to anyone who loves one of the best romances ever written!
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen created Elizabeth Bennett - every respectable man's ultimate woman - and Mr. Darcy - the role model for all gentlemen. She combined romance and wit with real characters and a story that has enchanted every generation since it was published. For some, the language is a barrier, but perseverance will reward any reader with possibly the best book ever written.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Got this app for free but I would hardly pay the 2.99 for it. I love hidden object games, and this one ranks up there with the best!  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzles and hidden object games!

0071771263|5.0|I'm a TOEFL teacher and this is the best material for TOEFL practice. I highly recommend it for those who just want to practice. The only drawback is that there is no CD ROM - only an audio CD.

B000NSN5UG|5.0|Third Stage is certainly one of Boston's best albums, arguably one of the best albums released during the 1980s. It features both heavily incorporated melodic and memorable riffs and vocals that are accepting to virtually a general audience. Third Stage is arguably one of the most underrated albums in Boston's discography. I personally find this album to be tasteful and easily approachable.

B007XC9BSK|1.0|When I found this item every photo showed the Mack filled with cars. It is not. Misleading. Thought for $17, not bad. WRONG. Cheap made and definitely would not have ordered had I seen it in person first. Got a set and drifters at Wal-Mart for $20
B009VB7QQA|3.0|My expectations for this were pretty low, so it was a bit surprising that I found this movie mildly entertaining.
0792844890|5.0|A lot of fun, well-acted, genuinely funny, an A-1 cast.  It's Mel Brooks at or near the top of his movies.  Highly recommended.
B000YHG72E|5.0|funny, not recommended for kids under 10 that REALLY believe in santa and may not even think about santa not being real.  wathed it with a 4 year old, and i think we opened up a can of worms.
0618918248|5.0|My son's view on religion is very different than most Americans and I am somewhere in the middle.  I do believe in God but a wise teacher once told me it is best to know where the other side is coming from.  Need to be dared try you might learn something.
B001Q4Z5Z4|3.0|The only reason I watched this movie was because of Jason Statham!! It had a bit of a Mad Max feeling.  Over all I liked it. I like anything Jason is in!!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is just the right amount of Alien in one package. The extras are worth the purchase price alone. If you are into the world of Alien, this is a must buy.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|This was my daughters favorite movie when she was little. We watched it twice a day for awhile. Such a cute movie!
1449410243|5.0|Oatmeal will forever be awesome!  Both me and my friends love him, and I recommend this book to everyone that still got that little three-year old inside them that secretly laugh at poop jokes!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|This is what it is. As someone that seldom has disposable income, I find it a lot better that others.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So much fun and I don't have to spend all those quarters like I did when I used to play the real arcade games! Love it and recommend it to young and old alike.
B000002OVJ|5.0|this is what live rock music is all about.the who in thier prime just crushing it song after song after song
B000P0J0EW|3.0|Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were super. But the story is really so so. It is a good movie and it should not be rank No. 1 on IMDb.<br /><br />Crawl through 500 yard of sewer pipe people will be killed by the pioson waste gas. For 20 years digging a hole on the wall the posters will be ruined in weeks for him to get in and out. I do not think he can stay in the same cell for 20 years. Inmates moves in and out. Prison will rearrange the cells.<br /><br />They did not change the warden and guards in 20 years is hard to believe. Every inmate has his own cell is not real either.<br /><br />The cells are one next to the other. The hole digged by Tim Robbis will lead to other cell. Not outside world. How did he knew the hole will lead to a waste pipe? How did he know the pipe is bigger enough for him to go through? How did he know the pipe is not metal and he can break it with a stone?
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This is a great girl power film.  No princes involved!  Movie has some scary moments for young children.  Merida is beautiful with her red curls.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I love this book. I cant even count how many times ive read it, but I vividly remember the first time i read it.  As soon as i read the last chapter of the book, I immediately read it again. It was mind-blowing. And provided me with a whole new perspective on the story. I love this book and cant wait to read it again.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Just like on the big machines, you'll find this does what it's supposed to do, and does it well. No complaints here.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Sure you might not want to watch it every day or even once a month, but after seeing it once, I know I will want to see it again. It is not a Ha Ha comedy,it is a black comedy that the Brits do so well. Like \\"One Foot In the Grave\\" and such. You get humor and reality all rolled into one, just a whole lot like real life. What appealed to me, besides the great cast, was being set in India. I like seeing and learning about other cultures and lifestyles and I get \\"into\\" it as if I was there trying to make my way through the crowds and hearing all the noises that are the large cities in India. I also appreciate that everything is not the whites only country club setting, and we see the hard scrabble side as well. I think they did a good job of showing the up sides and the down sides of anglo-european/anglo-americans that try to live outside of their native lands in countries where they tend to feel they are special. This is even more unusual being that they are all older and in theory set in their ways, yet most of them manage to adjust and decide to stay on. Only one decides she can not and will not cope, she is totally unhappy to the point of making everyone else miserable too, and you are releaved to see her head home. Watch this, then watch \\"Jewel in the Crown\\" to see the difference in the attitudes of the Brits. Bear in mind that Jewel is set circa world war 2 and the feeling of entitlement is so much stronger. Another good one to compare this one to is \\"Ghandi\\" or \\"Passage to India\\" All great British made flicks. I have to watch this one again anyway just to absorb more of the backround. Most scenes there is so much going on, it is hard to see everything... Just enjoy even if you don't like all the characters....
B00005MK9Y|5.0|great sound, very upbeat, bob marley was a true showman.perfect for driving with the widows down moon-roof open.....and a joint
B007SGM084|5.0|If you like hot romance and excellent character development, these books are for you. I couldn't stop reading them. Enjoy!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book was difficult to read at times, as Jaycee explains in detail the abuse she suffered at the hands of her captors.  However, the overall feel from this book, for me, was one of inspiration and hope.  Jaycee went through things no human being should ever have to endure, yet she emerges with a sense of purpose and hope that leaves this reader in absolute awe of her strength and character.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game, just bought it to stave off finals week brain bleed and it sure is working! Only problem is now I don't want go back to studying :) Buy it!!!
B000KJT8IG|4.0|My review focuses primarily on the Bluray disc specifically. The movie is a 5/5 but the Bluray loses a star for not being superior in anyway to a DVD.<br /><br />THE GOOD: Overall, this is a modern Christmas classic and one of Chevy Chase's best. The film still holds up over 20 years later and is still heavily enjoyable.<br /><br />THE BAD: However unless the DVD looked downright dreadful, the Bluray isn't very impressive. It doesn't seem like a newer digital transfer, as the video looks like something you'd see on regular TV, It's certainly no better than a DVD. If you already own the DVD version of this film, it's doubtful that the Bluray's video quality is anything better than what you already have (assuming your DVD player is capable of up scaling to 1080).<br /><br />The special features are pretty much non-existent, sans a commentary track and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Ultimately: If you have the DVD, but were thinking on upgrading to the Bluray, don't. If you don't have either, and the DVD is cheaper (and your DVD player can up-convert to 1080) then you might as well just get the DVD. The Bluray isn't any better or worse.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I grabbed this game because it was Free and I've always been drawn to dragons. My initial thought on first look was nice graphics, the dragons are cute ... but it doesn't DO anything.  ie.  Kind of boring. But I kept coming back to harvest food &amp; feed the dragons. Before I knew it I was hooked!  Now up to level 14!  As I refuse to shell out money (well OK, I did spend $1.99 on a bag of gems) I love breeding the dragons to see what I end up with for offspring. I even got a Reindeer Dragon! Fun for young and old alike. Graphics are especially nice on the Kindle Fire HD.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|And actress Louise Fletcher was brilliant as the blank that is 'Marlene DuChard'. Ilsa Lund.  Oy.  With all the revisions in the script, how I wish they'd given a reason, other than beauty, for either Rick or Victor Lazlo to want anything to do with this woman.<br /><br />I have an hypothesis:  Rick didn't want Ilsa at all.  He knew she was eye candy.  Rick never wanted a hanger-on, and he dumped her, but chose to reinforce his own freedom by having a fantasy \\"true love.\\"  Rats!  She shows up in Casablanca.  Rick is a gentleman caught in the act of self-deception.  Why dash Ilsa's own delusions about herself?  Treat her nice.  Make sure she leaves with Lazlo.<br /><br />And Victor?  Who knows why he kept Ilsa along for the ride.  Then again, for some odd reason he has celebrity status in the resistance.  He can't go anywhere without someone recognizing him.  One wonders if he didn't take out ads.  Victor seems caught between being an underground resistance fighter, and wanting to be resistance royalty.  As royalty, he would need a queen.  That would be Ilsa.  Couldn't ilsa have a job?  How did she \\"help\\" her celebrity husband's resistance work except that they made a nice picture.  I'd bet that Lazlo was miserable when he realized that he was stuck with Ilsa.  (He should have run to the plane).  Wait.  I've got it.  He needed Ilsa's adoration.<br /><br />Note that when Lazlo moves to counter the German presence with \\"La Marseillaise,\\" Ilsa just sits there, all swooney-eyed.  She doesn't love Lazlo - she worships him.  Wouldn't you stand up and sing?  Or stand up?<br /><br />If they'd both let Ilsa go, what would have become of her.  Not being able to come up with an answer to that question is exactly why I'll never be able to accept the alleged romance in 'Casablanca', or Ilsa's strong presence.  Again, Neil Simon got it right at the ending of 'The Cheap Detective'. It was the only rational solution to an 'Ilsa'.<br /><br />Rick and Louie having adventures forever.Now, that's the thrill of the ending.
0385535147|1.0|I highly anticipated this book and bought it when it was newly released. When I first started reading it... I got bored fast. It does not read like a typical Grisham book. I took a few weeks away from it and finally finished it. It was disappointing and predictable halfway through. I would recommend passing on this book or wait till you obtain a copy for free. You won't be missing out.
141659521X|5.0|I read this and thought I was reading non-fiction in real time.  The infighting and distrust of the CIA, State, FBI, and DIA are portrayed in the story as displayed in the whole Benghazi fiasco.  A VERY GOOD book.  Highly recommended.  Then go on to DeMille's &#34;The Panther&#34; for a similar experience in reading &#34;real-time&#34; intrigue.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Bought this because I liiked 2 songs, no I actually like every song on it. Have listened to it over and over and have 3 freinds that bought it now too
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love Ellen degeneres and reading this book was like she was actually talking to the reader. Hilarious and motivating.
B006T3RM08|2.0|The trackpad gets stuck and the 'on' switch mechanism disconnects my trackpad every time. It was awesome for the first few months, but now it's completely unusable. Wish I would have spend the money on a handcrafted wooden tray. 3 times the price, but never sticks.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Only got this because it was a great deal during Christmas and it was definitely worth every penny. I have only skimmed through the entire box set, but it is packed with loads of extra features that most movie buffs will enjoy. Also, it's cool that each movie has the theaterical and directors cut.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Love the progression and beautiful presentation. Someone put in a lot of work to make this successful. Thank you for the fun.
B005LAII08|5.0|Another Disney classic that my girls love! Just bought a 3D tv and the 3D version was awesome. No doubt in recommending to friends and family.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|This is a great romantic movie about fate and how we can sometime over think certain things. Great cast as well and great direction. This is a must see for any romantic
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have seen Tom Cruise in. It was superb and I would recommend it to anyone!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love puzzles and this app works fine. Very fun.Never lose any pieces either! Many to choose from too. Love it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The worst of the three books. Take a long time for it to start up. The ending is bunched up into a few pages.
B006LSZECO|5.0|NOT some cookie cutter formula story. High praise from me. It is so good I can' t  wait to share it with my husband
B005LCECU6|4.0|Great Cd, It's Raw and sounds good. The only thing I don't like about this is they keep panning the guitar from the left to right side. The three Extra tracks from 1975 sound like mud . Still It's nice to hear this from 1974 with neil on drums.
034580404X|5.0|Sent quicker then stated, new books, good packaging, excellent service<br /><br />Price was easy to compare and came as stated Thanks
B001JV5BIA|5.0|Great movie that is full of suspense. It kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for what would happen next!
B0091LS07E|4.0|Alicia has reached a graceful age and her music shows it.  She has grown and is proud of herself, I love the album.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|One of the all time best movies ever made.  The cinimatophography is unbeliveable.  ther are no CGI special effects in this movie wat you see was all real action recorded on film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|tons of fun games for everyone! from action to logic to memory you can find games you will love. download install and enjoy.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|This movie was true to both the plot and and the art of the original comic.  If you're looking to purchase this because you enjoyed Frank Miller's &#34;The Dark Knight Returns&#34; you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />A warning to the wise consumer:  They have divided four issue comic series into two movies.  This movie ends at the same point as &#34;The Dark Knight Triumphant.&#34;  Therefore you may wish to wait until Part 2 or a combo set is available.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Simple game but a fun time waster if you are sitting waiting for an appointment. It can be frustrating if you want to play for free and run out of coins but worth it.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|This was a Very Good move and I enjoyed it very much. It was everything I had hoped for and more!
B005LAII08|5.0|A surprisingly enjoyable movie that has drama, comedy, and pathos. Great annimation and good character designs.  This movie was very enjoyable and I'd watch it multiple times.
B005XLN97M|3.0|I bought this beach house for my 4 year old after she begged for months for a Barbie house.  I couldn't afford the dream house or any other doll houses I found that fit Barbie.  Finally, I found this beach house and it appeared to have good reviews, and was a good price.<br /><br />We gave her the toy 1 month ago and it seems that every time she plays with it, I have to go fix it.  She is a gentle child and doesn't break any of her other toys, but I am constantly putting the stairs back on or fixing the door.<br /><br />She does love it and plays with it all the time, but it is very frustrating to have to fix pieces on this house every day.  I have a feeling it won't last very long, and this makes me hesitant to shell out the money for the  more expensive Barbie houses in the future.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really liked and couldn t stop reading it all the breaks I got during the day.<br />Nice story, very hot and also very addicting.<br />I recommend it
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mine craft The best game ever on kindle heck yeah pick it up! just buy it. check +++++ just do it
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I have not been so  enchanted by a story  for a long time - up until Pi reached land after seven plus months as a castaway. Then what followed was, to my way of thinking, superfluous. I can think of a number of reasons why the<br />author might have decided to finish the book this way, but none of them is worthy of the great story of  Pi and Richard Parker,
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|This was a great movie to watch. Very funny with a little bit of a serious side to it. Another great performance by Jonah Hill.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is a huge hit at our house. We love it! Will Ferrel could make any movie worth watching, but he is amazing in this one!
B00080Z53O|1.0|The screenshot shudders everytime a new subtitles comes on screen, or every few seconds. Gave me a massive headache after about 10 minutes. No problems without subtitles. Poor production I suppose.
B0034G4P80|5.0|To be quite honest, I really didn't even want to see this movie, but I'm glad I did. It's one of the best super hero flicks yet. Great story line, great effects and a hot leading man. What's there to not like?
B003HLM2QO|4.0|This is such a different take on Ozzy song writing and I think it came at the right time. Gus G plays a great guitar and I personally like him better than Zakk
0385535147|2.0|A REAL PAGE TURNER. AS USUAL, GRISHAM HAS THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE CULTURE OF THE AREA AND HOW THE PEOPLE INTERPRET THE LAW.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|This was one of the best movies that I have seen in a while. Liam Neeson was great as usual.
B003WC5EQI|1.0|I don't get it, this seemed to revel in destroying a poor innocent girl. There is something misogynistic about it. She is too innocent, and everything that happens to her is too awful. I'm sure some viewers would point out that the unfortunate circumstance she was put in is what would happen to many girls historically, but why would we want to watch it? A sad story works when it doesn't relish in torturing the characters. It should be real and not overdone, here the dialogue was flat and melodramatic. They also felt very cartoonish: she is smart and pretty and innocent, her family is childish and uneducated alcoholics. Why would she be so different? I saw no redemption in it.
B004RV0JX6|3.0|The sweetest side of Will Farrell co-starring &#34;I can't go wrong&#34; Zooey Deschanel.  I really fun take on Christmas and &#34;Elfship&#34;.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Got this copy pre-ordered 1 week before the release date and it arrives just 2 weeks after. Cant stop playing it since then. Its a must on my to-do list before going to bed :D
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I played this on my ego 3d and my daughter plays on the fire. the game looks great on both devices. I tried it first and played a couple days before finding it on amazon. the pets look really really good. this game is much simpler than the my little pony one but it has the same  over priced iap model as most other gameloft games. I removed it from my device its a larger download and although cute it gets repetitive too soon and getting the acuter things is costly and also time consuming. it would be okay if there were more things to do while waiting for things to build. my daughter keeps it on the kindle but I haven't seen her play it since I first showed it to her. also this. uses tapjoy as a way to get the premium currency but tapjoy sucks.  gameloft id can be acquired but I cant get it to let me add friends which is another big thing with these because some items require things you can only get with currency you get from friends. we liked washing the animals and playing ball. I also liked doing the play activities that were on the houses.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this app since back in the Palm OS days.  The Android version is even more powerful.  I love it even more!
B0046JLTAQ|5.0|We have always enjoyed listening to Pit Bull's music and this selection is one of the best. We weren't disappointed in any way!
B0085YNML2|5.0|Simply put, it is the best game on my kindle. As I said, it Is a kindle. I do not have issues on it, so do not be discouraged by the thought it may glitch. It is a game where this takes place, tap flower -&gt; swing on flower -&gt; release tongue by tapping -&gt; walk up to bug-&gt; eat bug. It is a little bit more complicated than it sounds.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Great Cast and wonderful storyline, effects and soundtrack.  Keeps your interest, plenty of action and great surprises in-store. One you'll reccommend to friends and family and great for guys and gals.
B000UR9TQE|5.0|Everything went smooth, Zeppelin is the greatest band ever and it is always special to see them play. It is nice to see Jason following in his dad's footsteps!
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved everything about the books. I hope there are more to come! It is so addicting and I literally finished the trilogy in less than a month.
B00722ZHG6|5.0|Birdy is an album you can listen to over and over, song by song!  I just absolutely love it !
B005LAIH54|5.0|My family and I really enjoyed watching this movie. We are fans of Mythology and this movie was right on!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Highly recommended. Always kept you wanting to read more. An amazing story that is breathtaking. Very well written. Will definitely read more books by Picoult.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|excellent cd.  recommend it to folks who are looking for &#34;quiet&#34; moments in their life.  varied selection and nicely arranged.
B000GFLEJA|1.0|Never got to watch because bluray became the stamdard.  Wish i would have never made this purchase.  Should have bought in bluray format

B008FYZIVY|5.0|Many friends were hooked on this program, so I decided to check it out.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am looking forward to Season 3.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This story had me from page one. I was impatiently wait for this one since finishing Cold Vengeance. It did not disappoint in the least.
B0001O3YD0|3.0|Not bad, but nothing new where the story is concerned. I actually got bored with it even though I'm a Van Diesel fan. I preferred &#34;Babylon A.D.&#34;
B0015DWLD0|4.0|A quirky read that seems to be overly assisted by the exotic and currently fashionable locales in relating the story...a mixture of Dickens, Dostoyevsky and Norman Vincent Peale. In the end I was glad for it to end and did n't recall much beyond unpleasant detail well told.
0374533571|5.0|This is a must read! Matthew Quick's story will have you hooked from the start. The character's pull you in and have you rooting for them. Loved, loved, loved it.
B005LAIGWS|5.0|We have bought all of the Ghost Rider movies and this one fell right in line with the non stop action!
B0037RDPEG|5.0|This sort of narrative is not normally my choice but a friend recommended it and I was absolutely taken in.  Fun, not too goody goody and I learnt a lot.  The perfect read for me. Totally original.
0764197843|4.0|It's good to practice TOEIC exam with this book.<br />Many Thai people in pantip.com recommend. Great for preparing the examination!
B0067AC5KA|2.0|The first book  was average at best.  The second drones on with very little story telling.  I saw the movie and expected the books to move at a good pace.  We have more on how to build a watch than just telling the time.  Stieg Larsson preaches more about his personal causes than on telling a great story.  They did not have to leave out much of the first book because there was very little of a great story.  The second book is even worse and I have not even ventured to start the third.
B00003CXTG|2.0|The packaging was a bit worn and the movie skipped during key parts. I was not satisfied with the quality of the dvd....
B00631YUPG|5.0|It was for my grandson's birthday and he loves lego's.  He took 2 hours to assemble it and seems very happy with the finished product.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|Nice product; compact, TSA approved which is handy; power plug adapter also fits inside without damaging the kindle. Like the color combos
B006Z9SP3E|2.0|I feel that the author is grappling to find anything interesting for his characters to do.  They've become predictable and boring.  No more Archer for me for a while anyway.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the movies and book series. I cannot wait for more books and more movies. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!

B007OAAK0O|5.0|Diana Ross, the stuff legends are made of. Would love to see her in concert again.This woman<br />puts on a good show
0316069434|3.0|I want to say I couldn't put this book down. I want to say that the plot grabbed me and held my attention to the very end. I want to say that the storyline was fresh and entertaining. Alas, I can't say any of those statements. It isn't that The Black Box is a bad read; it isn't. It is just mediocre.<br /><br />After Connelly's last book, The Drop,  I was hoping that he would take Harry Bosch in a new direction. Harry's nemesis, Irvin R. Irving, was dealt with and no longer an issue. However in this new novel, Irving has been replaced with another, newer nemesis for Harry. Simply there was no new direction, just a remake of the old problems and situations. Same old Harry against an uncaring, politically motivated police leadership which is not above using Internal Affairs to thwart Harry's investigation.<br /><br />Having Harry work in the unsolved crimes division should have provided amble new grounds for his methodical investigative skills. Maybe it will in future novels, it just simply didn't work in this novel. To solve this case, Harry has to work on his own time, in fact, he has to take vacation time to solve the case. He has to go to Central California and confront several, sterotypical, one dimensional characters, including a sheriff and his politically connected friends. It almost seemed like a plot from the old TV series, Big Valley. Like so many other fictional heroes, it is alright for Harry to break the law if it is for the greater good.  Personally, I feel that there is something wrong with that trend in modern suspense fiction.<br /><br />The one refreshing plot element is the continuing development of Maddie, Harry's daughter. I wonder how  long it will be before she is the heroine in a new series.<br /><br />I will continue to read new Harry Bosch novels. I am comfortable with him and like a family member I sometimes expect more out of him.
0439023513|4.0|Hope we never live in this kind of world but the end of the series gives hope for the future of people.
034580404X|5.0|Really really good - exceptional.  At first I didn't think I'd like it because of the subject matter but it is awesome.  Really good writing skills and keeps you interested the whole way through.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|THE ALIEN MOVIES ARE NOT REALLY THAT GREAT OF MOVIES - STILL ONE OF BEST CREATURES BUT ACTING AND PLOTS NOT THAT GREAT - NICE PACKAGING
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It is awesome and it is an epic conclusion. It makes the whole series a lot better. It has a lot of action.
1449410243|1.0|Special ordered this book based on the title, thought it would be funny.  WRONG!  Vulgar language, juvenile material and offensive.  I am going to give this back to the bookstore I got it from, refund, exchange or not.  I don't want to even see it in my house!!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|From the moment I saw the first trailer, I wanted to see this movie.  I finally got a chance to see it last month and I was not disappointed.  This is easily of of the best films of the year with probably the best cast of the year.  This film is based of the best selling book of the same name and David O' Russell captured it perfectly.  The film stars Bradley Cooper as Pat Solitano.  His mom has just picked him up from a mental institution in which he has spent the last eight months for assaulting his wife's lover.  Even though the doctors feel as though he needs more time there, Pat leaves and head home...well at least his parent's home.  Pat wants to get his life back on track and his wife back by working out, reading his wife's summer reading list for her class and work on his \\"issues\\" even though he believes he does not need his medication in order to do it.  This is going to be easier said then done because right after his fight with his wife's lover, she put a restraining order on him, she moved away and he lost his teaching job.  After being invited to dinner by his friend, Ronnie, he meets Tiffany.  A woman who has just lost her policeman husband and has issues of their own.  Even though things are rocky between to two of them at first, they eventually form an odd friendship.  When Pat learns that Tiffany has a personal connection to his wife, Nikki, the two of them strike up a deal.  If he agrees to be her partner at an upcoming dance competition, she'll agree to supply his wife a letter from him.  At first glance, this might seem like a crazy idea for a romantic comedy drama and that there is no way in hell that this could work.  Having said that, this film amazingly works.  Its funny, heartfelt, insightful and inspiring.  What makes it so good is that all of these people are not caricatures of people.  They are real people with real hopes, dreams and issues.  To me, the best characters are the ones we can identify with and you can do that to a certain extent with each of these characters.  David O' Russell directed and wrote this film.  I give him credit for being able to make a great film that included mental illness, the Philadelphia Eagles, comedy and drama all in the same film.  He got nominated for a Best Director Oscar for The Fighter (another amazing film) and should receive writing and directing nominations at the next Oscars.  Jennifer Lawrence is truly one of the best and brightest stars today.  Even though her character is suppose to be older and she was only 21 at the time of filming, she is completely believable as a damage woman looking for a silver lining in her life.  She was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for Winter's Bone, gave another acclaimed performance in the huge blockbuster The Hunger Games and I see another Oscar nomination for this film.  She deserved the first one and she really deserves another one.  Robert De Niro is back ladies and gentleman.  After a few years of films and performances that were not that well received, he comes back with a vengeance in this film as Pat's OCD father.  Add to his list another Oscar nomination for this performance.  He walks the line of concerned father and superstitious Eagles fan beautifully.  Jacki Weaver was great as his concerned mom.  She earned a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for Animal Kingdom as the mom from hell and she does a complete 180 as as woman that wants to see her son get back on her feet.  I think she should get another one for this film.  Chris Tucker was in the film as Pat's friend from the mental institution and all I have to say is welcome back Chris.  We know him mostly as loud mouth characters from Money Talks, Friday and the hugely successful Rush Hour franchise.  He really tones it down to be a more realistic character and he is still funny as hell.  I don't know it it will happen but he should get a Best Supporting Actor nomination because he was truly memorable in this film.  The rest of the supporting cast is great as well in their roles.  I reserve the highest acclaim for Bradley Cooper.  We mostly know him from comedies like Wedding Crashers, Hit and Run, and the highly acclaimed (and funny as hell) The Hangover.  Last year, he made a film called Limitless that showed that he does have some range.  His performance from Silver Linings Playbook takes that to another level.  This is not only his best performance to date but this is also one of the best performances of the year.  He was extremely believable as Pat.  Even though his character was highly troubled, we saw a guy that was really trying to get his act together.  You see Pat at his best and you see him at his worst.  You feel for him from the moment he leaves the mental hospital to the moment the film ends.  You really want him to get his silver lining.  If he is not nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, it will be a travesty.  This is easily one of the best films of the year and one of the best films ever made.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I own 2 of these, one black and one desert sand (khaki).  Unlike higher-priced automatic mov't watches, which I own quite a few, these 7S26 movements are completely maintenance-free for 20 years, not to mention that they have been around for decades and are very tried and true with cult followings. I think there is something to be said for that.  :)  Both of mine keep absolutely perfect time and the reserve power (wound spring) will last about 2 days if not worn.  I am constantly banging and knocking my watch on door knobs, seat belt buckles, etc. and neither has yet to have a single nick or scratch which honestly surprises me!  I added a Hadley-Roma SS band to the black one (Amazon: Hadley-Roma Men's MB5919RTIS&C 18 18-mm Titanium Finished Stainless Steel Watch Strap) and it really looks and feels great, like a $300 watch, not a $60 watch, though I must say I do prefer the stock light-weight nylon band for everyday use.<br /><br />In short, I would much prefer to wear this over a more expensive and more pretentious watch as it is extremely comfortable, durable, dependable and if anything happens to it, it's a very simple and inexpensive replacement.  I would recommend this watch to anyone who appreciates quality,  function and simplicity.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is good. i really liked it and i am a 6th grade girl so i stopped reading the books.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This show is so twisted, but apparently I like that. I knocked off one star because I'm not as in love with Season 2 as I was with Season 1. I think it's because we don't really get to know the characters in the same way. I'm not really invested in any of them or feel committed to any of the story lines. I'll still watch and be horrified week after week though!
B002ZG99N6|5.0|As good as his first directorial effort was, The Town completely blows it aways.  Ben Affleck plays Doug, a career criminal from Charlestown that is looking for a way out of his dead end life.  He is the leader of a crew that goes around town and robs different banks and armored cars.  One day, his crew robs a bank but things don't go according to plan and they take a hostage.  Since she lives close to where these guys live, Doug decides to keep tabs on her to make sure if she really knows anything.  The problems really start when Doug and the hostage start to develop feelings for each other.  This is when the big question comes:  What will happen if she ever learns the truth about Doug.  The Town is truly one of this year's best films and it is a crying shame that it almost entirely shut out of the Academy Awards expect for Jeremy Renner's strong performance as Doug's frinend, Jem, and it netted him a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  The direction, writing and performance are all first rate.  When you watch this film, it feels real.  The robberies, the settings and the characters all feel reel.  I tip my hat to Mr. Affleck for his excellent direction, strong screenplay and for turning in a great performance as the conflicted bank robbery.  Jeremy Renner was scary as hell because you had no idea what this crazy fool was going to say or do next but you can see the loyalty he has to Doug.  The rest of cast including Blake Lively, Rebecca Hall and John Hamm were all amazing as well.  I highly recommend watching this movie.
1847246761|5.0|I began reading this novel three times.  And was bored out of my gourd!  But once I got past the first 100 pages, the story was absolutely phenomenal and I discovered one of my very favorite literary characters since Scarlett O'Hara and Scout Finch. Fascinating, complex plot lines.  I would cringe to think of my writing published without editing...and I'm certain that somewhere, Stieg Larson would cringe to know that his stories were published without his own editing.  Still, great story! Great characters!
B0036EH3XE|4.0|Why this ending? Why ending one of the greatest tv series ever in this miserable way? I loved it and would watch it again. I just wished for an alternate ending.
1400159555|4.0|A trippy little book about future space exploration, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, near light-speed travel and dead alien cultures, Revelation Space has apparently disparate plots that take a while to weave together.  Lucky thing that everyone in the story is long-lived enough to bring all the plots together in a satisfying tapestry of delight.  I liked it very much, for the detailed descriptions of the technologies, the humanness of the protagonists (even the evil ones) and the strangeness of the dead(?) aliens and the malevolence of the Universe (see also Fermi Paradox).  I liked it so well and enjoyed the weaving that I'm not going to tell you anything about the book other than you should get it, read it (or listen; that's what I did...by the way, the narrator varies his speech volume enough to make car noise an issue--fair warning) and thank me for not giving anything away.<br /><br />You're welcome.
B005PK553C|5.0|This show was what I waited for all week. It was so gruesome and horrifying, but awesome nonetheless. I rarely get scared, but this was genuinely creepy. The acting was all so fantastic too. If you're a little sick, you will love it!
B002ZG980U|5.0|You have just directed a masterpiece with The Dark Knight, what do you do for another follow-up?  Create another masterpiece with a little film called Inception.  The plot is a little hard to describe but I'll try.  Inception tells the story of Dom Cobb (played by Leonard Dicaprio in an oscar-worthy performance).  Cobb is a professional theif but not in a conventional way.  He uses a piece of technology that was originally developed by the military to allow its soldiers to injury and kill each other without actually doing it to each other.  He uses it to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets.  He's also on the run from the police for something they believed he did.  After failing his last job. he is offered another one from the same person he was trying to steal secrets from but this job will be his hardest one yet.  The client wants him to perform Inception.  Its basically the reverse of what Cobb does.  Instead of stealing something from a person's mind, the client wants Cobb to put an idea into his competition's mind.  It is described at being very hard and the film does a very good job at explaining why.  In fact, it not only does a very good job at explaining this technology but it also explains dreams, ideas and a bunch of other things that you would not expect.  Even though it explains everything, it doesn't insult the audience's intelligence.  You might think that might just be a standard heist movie but with Christopher Nolan as writer and director, it is far from standard.  It has depth, intelligence and creativity.  I don't think there has ever been a movie like this.  It is part heist movie, part action adventure and part character study.  There is nothing bad that you can say about this movie.  The performances, script, direction, music, editing, visual effects, etc, were all top notch.  It is a crying shame that for as many Oscars this film was nominated for, Leonard Dicaprio did not receive a Best Actor nomination and an abomination that Christopher Nolan was not nominated for Best Director yet again for creating another masterpiece.  Films don't direct themselves.  If you are interested in a compelling, character driven, mind-bending film, I highly recommend this one and I'm surely that a lot of other people would too.

B009K45Y62|5.0|Chistopher Nolan is in my opinion one of the best directors out there. Combining his skills with one of the greatest super heroes of all times gives us one of the best trilogies in movies ever seen. This limited edition of the last movie is just perfect. A little souvenir of the broken cowl is the right representation of this last installment.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|I found this to be a quite entertaining movie and liked the interaction between all of the actors.  A nice change for Johnny Depp from the pirate movies.

B001EN71CW|3.0|This was a great show that was unfortunately cancelled before it’s time.<br />This review will concern itself with a minor little problem: the lack of details provided about which of the 14 shows appears on which of the 3 Blu-ray disks included. You’d think they could have added a paper insert, or a simple listing on the back cover.<br />If you want to play a particular show, and you don’t remember what disk it’s on, you’ll just have to remember pop them all in until you find it. This is but a slight pain in the rear, but could have been avoidable if Ruppert Murdoch’s bean counters had but a little respect for the people that buy their products.<br />I heard from someone who owns the DVD version that a proper listing is included with the DVDs… this may have made a difference in my purchase if I had known in advance.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|Pros: It has been over a year since I purchased the I7 2600K. When I first got it, I immediately water cooled it and overclocked it to 4.9 GHZ.<br /><br />I run this CPU 24/365 at overclocked speed and it has not had one single problem with it. It has handled everything I have thrown at it and not missed a beat.<br /><br />I previously ran an AMD 955 OC'd to 3.8 GHZ. and it worked fine but the Intel I7 2600K blew it out of the water.<br /><br />Everything is fast. Running an SSD as my OS drive, the I7 2600K is perfect with any SSD. It will match any software that you can throw at it. It can do videos with ease. It does not get hot even at 4.9GHZ.<br /><br />I can run several programs at the same time and not have any problem. The I7 is by far the best CPU I've had the pleasure of using.<br /><br />Cons: It was expensive when I bought it and has held the price even today. Not really a con as that shows it still is in demand.<br /><br />CPU cooler is a dead horse. When you buy this, you know you will need a better cooler.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: Water cooling or better air cooling is needed as this CPU begs to be overclocked. It is made for it.<br /><br />The I7-2700K is just a higher binned 2600K and for the extra $10, it is worth it. But if you already have a 2600K, you gain very little by upgrading to the I-7 2700K.<br /><br />This CPU should be a hall of fame contender. One of the best of the best.
B004TTHLBE|3.0|This is a good book for fantasy-lovers.  Since I'm not one, I struggled with this book.  Gaiman's writing style is really good so my only complaint is the genre is not for me.

B00005JNX0|5.0|Who doesnt like Madagascar? Great movie, my nephews love it and they keep watching it over and over. I will get them Madagascar 3.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Pros: It knows how to use energy properly.<br />Heat Sync an fan are good.<br />Bulldozers anything you place in it's way.<br /><br />Cons: None so far.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: Hey I'm a 3d graphic designer an I use the bulldozer 8120 everyday.<br />It takes on those big tasks of rendering shadows an mental rays.<br />I had no problems with the cpu at all. I was really scared after reading reviews but tbh it's the same as reading a game review you really don't know if you'll like it until you try. So that's what I did it's about my 3rd month of using the cpu which seems pretty fair as most people write negative feedback in 1 month.<br /><br />This is the funniest thing on my build.<br />My PSU is only 250watt on 2 12v rails. I thought this would be an issue but I tagged the 8120 with a beautiful good cheap Mobo called the M5A97 which I also bought here at Newegg.com.<br />It an EPU / TPU mobo so couldn't go wrong. Equiped with an ATI Sapphire 5770 and 5gb of Ram from HP.<br /><br />Sadly I cannot run the cpu an an overclocking rate I havin't bothered trying I'm running the CPU at 2800 Tcore Disabled.<br />All fanspeeds are high. I balance my PC to be energy efficient at the right times. It's been tested during gaming I've ran on ultra Borderlands 2, Assasins Creed 3 and 2 , Global Agenda , Sleeping Dogs. All at the same time without a stutter or power strain. There was no noise the Heat Sync that came with the CPU I'm happy with it it stays at around 30-40c. 40 being when I ran everything lol it's normally 29 but anyways.<br /><br />I could go on about how my rig is but there is 1 thing for sure I love this CPU and as I'm going to be making lots of animations in 3ds and blender for UDK I'm happy to say that when I release my underground game I hope I can place the Logo &#34; Created using AMD&#34;<br /><br />When I hit the 6 month mark I'll come back with a video ;)<br />BUY IT !
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I play this game all the time.  If your waiting for a dragon to hatch or a habitat to finish getting built, you can still race your dragons to win coins,  gems,  ect.

Write it in a review.

B001E45XT4|5.0|Pros: These headphones are great, they are really comfortable because they have a cushioned inside (where the ear pieces touch your head) and it is very comfortable. The bass was awesome and everything sounded great<br /><br />Cons: The cushions may be a problem with wet hair or if I sweat but I will have to see about that. They are really big as well so I look funny while playing games, but that's not really too bad.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: These are great and you can't beat the price
0316069434|3.0|\\"No hobby cases, Harry.\\"<br /><br />That's the message from Cliff O'Toole, the new lieutenant heading up the Open-Unsolved Unit. O'Toole thinks Bosch is overly fixated on a murder case that started during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles, twenty years ago.<br /><br />Says O'Toole: \\"You are the worst kind of police officer, Bosch. You are arrogant, you are a bully, and you think the laws and regulations simply don't apply to you. I'm not the first to attempt to rid this department of you. But I will be the last.\\"<br /><br />Bosch, of course, put the T in tenacious and he'll even go ahead and take a `vacation' to pursue a lead. Harry Bosch has a bullet casing--a bullet casing found near the body of a female photojournalist who was murdered in an alley and now, given the intervening two decades, Bosch can put it under more scrutiny with new technology at his disposal. And he has personal motivation. Bosch had been one of the cops to find the body during the riots.<br /><br />Bosch struggles for space and freedom to pursue his instincts against the grain of police bureaucracy. Bosch follows every single scrap of evidence like the master sleuth we admire, blowing through apparent dead ends and seeing things that others have not.<br /><br />Bosch is pursuing the \\"one thing that brings it all together and makes sense of things. You find it and you're gold.\\"<br /><br />For the most part, \\"The Black Box\\" works. Bosch follows the victim's past and starts making links to a moment on a cruise ship that was used for R & R for soldiers in the Gulf War.<br /><br />For me, several things didn't quite click. I didn't think O'Toole's anger at Bosch was warranted. Bosch's alleged crimes within department rules seemed relatively minor. Yes, he wandered slightly outside of protocol, but his steps didn't seem to justify putting a fellow cop out on the street to trail Bosch--a cop who plays a critical role in coming to Bosch's aid at the end. And once Bosch follows his leads up to central California, I had the feeling that Connelly wanted Harry Bosch to teach Jack Reacher a thing or two about toughness and guile. The Hollywood-esque ending felt a bit over-the-top.<br /><br />Harry Bosch is one of the best at breaking down a case, figuring things out, asking questions, pursuing every angle and, of course, never giving up. He's also a rogue cop, albeit a rogue with heart. \\"The Black Box\\" is a good read but I wish the climax had its feet as firmly on the ground as the first four-fifths of the story.tral California, I had the feeling that Connelly wanted Harry Bosch to teach Jack Reacher a thing or two about toughness and guile.

B0059XTU22|4.0|I love the Lord of the Rings books and movies, and so first and foremost, as a huge fan, this movie is a wonderful return visit to the fantasy world of Tolkien's Middle Earth.  But the process of watching the movie proved to be a chore as it became apparent that Sir PJ (Peter Jackson) had burdened this movie with some terrible film making decisions.<br /><br />First the good parts - Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage, the key new actors playing the young Bilbo and Thorin Oakenshield, are outstanding!!  Andy Serkis does another fabulous turn as the twisted and tortured Gollum - his scenes with Martin Freeman playing the riddle game are worth the price of admission/DVD/BluRay alone!!  Ian McClellan is wonderful as always as Gandalf, and Cate Blanchett has never been so lustrous and beautiful as the elf queen Galadriel.  Ian Holm as the older Bilbo, Elijah Woods as Frodo, and Hugo Weaving as Elrond all make reassuring reappearances.  (Christopher Lee's reappearance as Saruman is a bit redundant).  Manu Bennett (Crixus the gladiator in the Spartacus series) does a fine job as Azog the pale Orc.<br /><br />The many, many battle scenes in this movie are awesome.<br /><br />The back stories of the dwarves, how they lost their kingdom under the mountains and how their enmity with the elves began, is told in rich detail, one of the key benefits to  \\"The Hobbit\\" getting stretched out into three parts.<br /><br />So what were the bad parts about the movie? And how could anybody accuse Sir PJ of bad film making?<br /><br />The bad part of stretching a small book like The Hobbitt out like this clearly are the slow and overly long padded parts such as the introduction of the dwarves  and Radagast the Brown's long segment.<br /><br />However, the biggest complaint of many movie critics has been how cheesy and unnatural this movie looks.  Nobody so far has clearly explained why, so here is my analysis.<br /><br />I watched this movie in 3D IMAX in 48fps.  Very simply, 48fps is a fine technology - it makes everything much clearer, and cleaner and does not make you vomit.  People who do not understand film making technology have unfairly blamed the many technical ills of this movie on 48fps.  It is NOT the culprit.<br /><br />The real culprit, what did make my stomach churn (and I do not get sick easily from watching movies with jittery camerawork) was Sir PJ's excessive use of camera motion in the vast majority of scenes in this movie.  Even simple close up shots of individuals engaged in conversation were framed by unnecessary dipping and panning camera movements!!!<br /><br />This was not the jittery handheld camera motion of documentary style movies like the Blair Witch Project.  These were PLANNED camera moves, done for stylistic purpose, no more.  Terrible, awful film maker's choice.<br /><br />What made this worse was the fact that these excessive, often useless camera movements appeared to be SPEEDED UP, as if somebody had hit the \\"fast forward\\" button on the movie all of a sudden and it was playing at 2x or 4x normal speed during those camera moves.<br /><br />Indeed, I suspect that what may have happened was that as Sir PJ realized that this movie was going to end up at nearly 3 hours long and that he had ONLY SHOT some of his key scenes with this extra camera movement,  that he needed to speed things up a bit and so he probably did fast forward through those scenes with the camera moves.<br /><br />Another problem  I started to notice - the digital lighting effects.  In previous DVD/BluRays, Sir PJ and his minions had explained their extensive use of digital post processing to enhance and correct for the unevenness of their filming, especially lighting effects.  With \\"The Hobbit\\" captured entirely by ultra-high resolution digital cameras, the end movie appears to have been post-processed to the max.<br /><br />The excessiveness of the post-processing, this attempt to make every scene appear digitally picture postcard \\"perfect\\" becomes apparent when viewing the scenes as a whole.  The scenes end up looking completely unnatural in appearance, very similar in \\"look\\" to what you get with TV soap operas, which are typically shot indoors in studio sets with multiple soft light sources that eliminate shadows,  poorly lit dark areas, overly bright reflections, and imperfect colors.<br /><br />As a result, very strangely, the most plastic and fake looking scenes in this move were the Hobbiton outdoor scenes, which were all filmed outdoors, on real, naturally created sets, and yet looked like an indoor TV studio set BECAUSE THERE WERE NO SHADOWS ANYWHERE AND THE DIGITALLY PERFECT LIGHTING WAS PERFECTLY DIFFUSE.  I noticed this as I was watching the movie and started looking for shadows in those scenes.  When I couldn't find any, I looked at the sky to see if there were a heavy dark total overcast of clouds blotting out the sun, but no, the sky was blue and bright.  And look carefully at Gandalf in every outdoor scene - wearing his broad brimmed hat, his face should always be in the shadows, and yet invariably, his face is unnaturally and brightly lit by a magical and cartoonish lighting while the bottom of his hat sits in total darkness.<br /><br />Sir PJ's  technical choices for this movie were clearly made with a film maker's zeal to do more, not to make a cheesy looking made-for-TV movie.  But combined together, they have the opposite effect.<br /><br />The excessive amounts of digital post processing for lighting, combined together with the excessive cartoonish fast forwarded camera movements, are what most make the movie look CHEESY and poorly crafted, despite all the high tech 48fps and outstanding motion capture and other high level attention to detail and special effects.<br /><br />It is little wonder that some of the best parts of the movie are where the camera director and post processing digital editor were throttled,  leaving us with fairly still, or simple slowly panning/soaring movements, as well a natural lighting.  It is in these scenes that all the beautiful visuals of this movie get their chance to shine through and take hold in our brains and allow us to immerse ourselves back into the world of Middle Earth.es apparent when viewing the scenes as a whole.

And look carefully at Gandalf in every outdoor scene - wearing his broad brimmed hat, his face should always be in the shadows, and yet invariably, his face is unnaturally and brightly lit by a magical and cartoonish lighting while the bottom of his hat sits in total darkness.<br /><br />Sir PJ's  technical choices for this movie were clearly made with a film maker's zeal to do more, not to make a cheesy looking made-for-TV movie.  But combined together, they have the opposite effect.<br /><br />The excessive amounts of digital post processing for lighting, combined together with the excessive cartoonish fast forwarded camera movements, are what most make the movie look CHEESY and poorly crafted, despite all the high tech 48fps and outstanding motion capture and other high level attention to detail and special effects.<br /><br />It is little wonder that some of the best parts of the movie are where the camera director and post processing digital editor were throttled,  leaving us with fairly still, or simple slowly panning/soaring movements,as well a natural lighting.  It is in these scenes that all the beautiful visuals of this movie get their chance to shine through and take hold in our brains and allow us to immerse ourselves back into the world of Middle Earth.

B005UBNKWO|5.0|Pros: I have used this with two MBs so far and did not need to upgrade the BIOS first for either one... gotta love that.<br /><br />Easy to OC (I'm running 3.8 without any heat or stress. Will probably pop it up to 4.0 soon, but everything is running super fast as-is, so no hurry.<br /><br />Cons: None... stays cool, runs fast. What more can you ask for?<br /><br />Other Thoughts: Currently paired with 16GB 1600 RAM on a Gigab. 9 series MB and an older 4000 HD series Graphics card (256bit)... eventually I will upgrade to a 6000 series and take full advantage of the graphics capabilities, but I'm more into photoshop and family video work than gaming, so no hurry.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|In the tsunami of post-9/11 novels of Muslim terrorists and the Americans who hunt them down, veteran thrill-master Nelson DeMille's \\"The Panther\\" runs squarely in the middle of the pack - solid entertainment that suffers from uneven pacing and an increasingly annoying John Corey, whose wise-cracking is unrelenting, rarely funny, and distracting. (\\"Zamo is also a martial arts expert.\\"  Corey: \\"You draw soldiers?\\")  As others reviwers have noted, John Corey is a polarizing protagonist - readers either love him or find his constant quips juvenile and unnecessary.<br /><br />The fictional \\"panther,\\" an American-born Muslim from New Jersey, the mastermind of the October 2000 suicide bombing of the USS Cole, and now head of the emerging Yemeni wing of Al Qaeda.  Given their war-on-terrorism history, Corey and FBI wife Kate Mayfeild are the perfect bait to lure the Panther out of his cave, so the pair is extorted by Kate's NYC-based boss into taking a one-year assignment in Yemen to dispatch Jersey-boy-gone-bad.  While DeMille reminds the reader about every page what a dangerous hell hole Yemen is, his depiction of the country's ancient cities, ruins, and culture is compelling; well drawn images of \\"dark mud brick buildings looking like high-rise haunted houses,\\" veiled women, and Kalashnikov-toting Bedouins is as surreal as it is foreboding.  Coupled with some neat Predator drone and Hellfire missile operations, the opposing ends of locale and technology are clearly the strengths of DeMille's latest effort.<br /><br />But plot and characters?  Not so much.  Kate Mayfield's role is limited to telling Corey to grow up - an unnecessary reminder; the cast from the State Department and CIA flat and stereotyped.  Corey, meanwhile, while harboring suspicions of the true motives of the CIA in this caper, offers little to the case beyond his dislike for Yemen and his competing US intelligence agencies.  The first half, mired in New York, and drags through the worst of Corey's quips, though once in Yemen, both tempo and suspense pick up.  Liberal and overdone foreshadowing insures few twists and even fewer surprises, leading to a climax that satisfies while only moderately increasing the pulse.<br /><br />In short, \\"The Panther\\" is not DeMille's best, but it's a notch or two above pedestrian and worth the time for his fans.  For a more authentic look at espionage in the post-9/11 world, I'd recommend David Ignatius (\\"Bloodmoney\\" or \\"Body of Lies\\"), or for shear adrenaline and no-nonsense action, any of David Silva's Gabriel Allon novels.ps, though once in Yemen, both tempo and suspense pick up.

B00A77II0U|5.0|The graphics and storyline was excellent. This is one of the more fluid search object game. The items are semi hard to find but the game didn't take forever to finish. I think it took me 6 hours but that's because I used a lot of hints. If I didn't use hints, it might be 8 hours long. It's a really good game and very spooky. Thanks for the great care and detail the developers put into the game!

Add that to great overclocking potential and an awesome price-point and look no further-- you've found your processor.<br /><br />Cons: Upgrade the cooler that comes with it if you decide you want to overclock.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: I'll never understand why some people trash talk this processor. Paired with my Radeon HD 7870, it runs everything on max settings with no overclocking whatsoever.

B006CEYM3Y|5.0|The game is great and pretty simple (assuming you're reading reviews on it because you've played euros). You have six actions, all of which feel pretty well balanced. They are available to you depending on how you manipulate your 'rondel', which is a challenge in itself. I never felt like any of the actions were too overpowered or underpowered and the balance allows for a good amount of strategies. Some actions are easily overlooked, but after multiple plays, you can really see their value, such as the Senate action (gives a small amount of victory points and some Senate votes) and Trajan action (which lets you pick up bonus tiles you can complete later). They aren't as instantly gratifying as the other four can be so it can be easy to look past them, but you probably aren't doing yourself any favors by doing that.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of this game and other board games is that while you have a general feel for who may be winning, the victor is not really clear until the end game bonuses are all taken into account. So while the scoring track might have one player currently ahead by 20, that is no guarantee that when all bonuses and such are counted after gameplay ends that he will be the winner. I've come from about 35 points behind after gameplay ended to win by one point. It keeps some suspense in there.<br /><br />Great game. If you're considering it, look for video reviews for it online to really get a feel for if it's meant for you.
B005FISBTO|2.0|(Spoiler) Well after Season 5, I was really sad to see Lumin go but I was happy for her.  In this season every disk has a giant Showtime add you have to sit through on every disk which is really annoying.  I thought the benefit of buying the show on DVD over renting is that you would be spared of that but with this season it is not the case.  Also in the preview they show the ending of this season which I also really hate.  Yes, on disk one they show you Dexter stabbing the main Jesus freak in a church and his sister catching him.  This made watching the whole season a lot more dull than it already was.  The word god and Jesus are said so many times you can make a drinking game out of it.  I felt like the season was not well written.  Maybe I would have not cared as much if Seasons 4 and 5 were not so amazing but they were and this one kinda bit.  (Spoiler) The big bad is a skinny white boy (Tom Hanks's son) who seems too wooden to me a crazed killer to me.  I really felt he was miscast.  Maybe that was the point, to have someone who did not seem like a killer to be one but I still did not like the style of acting he brought to the role. His big plan is to make art out of dead people that will bring about the rapture.  It does not make a lot of sense.  I love the idea of a killer that makes art from dead people but strapping a bunch of body parts to horses to look the the horsemen of the apocalypse is not the same as them actually showing up. Honestly you can just play the scenes between the main characters and skip the whole plot line with the bad guy and move on to season 7.  Nothing in this season really matters save the end witch actually you see at the start.
B000TEPCRI|4.0|No one would accuse Kate Bush of rushing. Some fans may grow impatient waiting for her next release, but many claim that the wait ends up being well worth it. And that wait has continued to grow over the years, from an approximate two to four years between releases in the 1980s to an almost agonizing twelve years between \\"The Red Shoes\\" and \\"Aerial,\\" then another six years until \\"50 Words for Snow.\\" Usually the market doesn't tolerate such brash interregnums, fearing potential loss of fan interest and income. Quality typically suffers in such situations. Throughout her career Bush has never sacrificed the quality of her product for a quick payoff.<br /><br />Though one possible exception that likely remained completely out of her control looms. Perusing her discography, one sees wide gaps between all releases except for her first two. In 1978, \\"Lionheart\\" appeared a mere 9 months after her acclaimed debut \\"The Kick Inside.\\" Apparently Bush felt the album was rushed, but the record company probably didn't want the frenzy over \\"The Kick Inside\\" to fizzle in case Bush ended up as a one-hit wonder. We know now that they had nothing to worry about. Never again would two Bush releases appear in such rapid succession.<br /><br />Given this frenetic numbers race to the marketplace, one would expect a mess of an album that sounds incomplete and unfulfilled like a Wile E. Coyote fall without the accompanying dust cloud. True, \\"Lionheart\\" does pale somewhat in comparison to \\"The Kick Inside,\\" but that really means that it's not quite as unforgettable. It really has everything its predecessor has, except a massive hit like \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" but only at a slightly lower intensity. Plenty of gorgeous Bush-esque melodies grace its thirty-six and a half minutes. \\"Symphony In Blue,\\" \\"In Search of Peter Pan,\\" \\"In the Warm Room\\" and \\"Oh England My Lionheart\\" are as lovely as anything on \\"The Kick Inside.\\" \\"Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake\\" and \\"Hammer Horror\\" provide just as much groove as \\"James and the Cold Gun\\" or \\"Them Heavy People.\\" \\"Full House\\" and \\"Coffee Homeground\\" even include some angular melodies in the spirit of \\"Kite.\\" Still, something, possibly something ineffable, seems lacking in comparison. In some ways \\"Lionheart\\" sounds more heavily produced and constrained than the relatively more raw production of her first album. Nonetheless, as follow ups to heavily praised debuts go, this one doesn't disappoint. Many acts would kill for a follow-up this good.<br /><br />The real differentiator here is \\"Wow,\\" a song that musically seems to glorify stage fame while its lyrics simultaneously hint at satire and mocking of narcissicism and self-glorification. It remains one of Bush's best songs. The initial fluttering synthesizer and overall song structure, with subdued verses and explosively lush chorus, point to Bush's future development more than any other song on \\"Lionheart.\\" Perhaps that explains why \\"Wow\\" was the only song from this album to appear on the 1986 retrospective \\"The Whole Story.\\"<br /><br />Though some, including Bush, express dissatisfaction with \\"Lionheart,\\" it nonetheless showcases her melodic, harmonic and lyrical inventiveness and demonstrates that \\"The Kick Inside\\" was no accident. Subsequent albums would definitely outdo this rushed production, of course, but Bush would never again allow a record company to push her to completion.much groove as \\"James and the Cold Gun\\" or \\"Them Heavy People.\\" \\"Full House\\" and \\"Coffee Homeground\\" even include some angular melodies in the spirit of \\"Kite.\\" Still, something, possibly something ineffable, seems lacking in comparison.

B0062W3GRY|5.0|I just started watching this show recently and I have to tell you it's amazing, but disturbingly so. I watched the Halloween Pt. 1 and 2 episodes about Tate's past on Thursday 12/13/12 night, past midnight so 12/14 really. As I found out the next morning, a 20 year old man killed 27 people (including himself) and 20 of them were children at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The night I watched the show, I remember having felt empathy for the victims-AND Tate himself-and really questioning how we became a society that pushes disturbed individuals to commit such unspeakable acts as those in Columbine and Virginia Tech. After this shocking coincidence, I just wanted to write some reflections in this review. American Horror Story is well a written, thought-provoking paranormal anthology in it's own unique genre. It speaks to the deep, dark parts of the human psyche in an effort to fully understand people at their core. Watch it, but not mindlessly. Enjoy the show, but don't be desensitized to the violence and horrors of real life. Let it inspire in you a need for change, to help, and to connect with others even if it's just over a series review.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This is one of my favorite seasons ever.  All the new characters were great. In my opinion it may be the best written season of all time. \\"spoiler\\" It falls on the end of season 4 where Dexter looses his wife.  He goes back to life with less purpose and like a zombie. Then he finds crazy people who are torturing random women so he actually saves a lady (Julia Styles) from a nut bag.  Then they fall in love and they both kill the big bad.  The plot line is amazing.  Julia Styles is great. The new cop and his sleazy helper played by Peter Weller were great and the big bad was terrifying (Johnny Lee Miller).  Maybe you can blame the cast on the season being so good, maybe you can blame the writers but in the end this season is the best one if you ask me.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|It is pretty difficult to describe what kind of a film Alexander Payne's new film \\"The Descendants\\" is. Some will think it is a comedy drama about messy nature of life. Others may feel the film is rather sad, dealing with life's most devastating moment. Perhaps both views are right.<br /><br />The story itself is simple. George Clooney plays Matt King, a successful Hawaiian lawyer and sole trustee of pristine land on Kauai Island. His wife Elizabeth has been in coma since the boating accident a few weeks ago. Having been too busy, he doesn't know how to talk to his two daughters, precocious 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and rebellious 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley). In his voiceover Matt pleads with his wife to wake up.<br /><br />Ironically it is Matt who has to \\"wake up.\\" He learns that his comatose wife had been \\"seeing\\" someone. With his wife's health deteriorating, Matt sets out to seek the truths about that guy, with his daughters and Alex's slacker friend Sid (Nick Krause) only to find unexpected consequences. And Matt has to make a grave decision about a tract of land in less than a week.<br /><br />With the beautifully shot on-location photography in Hawaii, \\"The Descendants\\" sometimes looks like a visual travelogue, but the beautiful images sometime hide uncomfortable surprises and facts Matt didn't want to know. The film is part Matt's spiritual journey that is, skillfully told by the director, is amusing and touching at the same time without relying on conventional settings. It may not be all that uplifting, but overall optimistic.<br /><br />The film is in a sense a character study of Matt (played superbly by George Clooney), but other characters are equally intriguing. While Alex tends to conceal what she really feels (like her father), her sister Scottie takes things as they seem and behaves accordingly. Looking at Matt and his daughters reminds us what we understand least is often someone very close to you.<br /><br />To me, the strength of\\"The Descendants\\" lies in these characters whose emotions seem often unaccountable (even to those who possess them), but still genuine and realistic nonetheless. Alexander Payne explores how our life could be messy and painful - and also amazing - in his own unique style.

And the fanboy in me would like to see more of Jake Epping if anyone could do it well it would be Mr.King
B004SIP8OI|5.0|I have seen Kill Bill Volume 1 several times now, and each time it it grips me from start to finish.  There is just no walking away from this picture.  Describing the plot is simple: \\"woman looks for revenge against former members of the gang who tried to kill her.\\"  That's the easy part...discussing it in detail is hard.  It just doesn't lend itself to a \\"She did this and he did that.\\"  Tarentino has incorporated so many styles here, from Japanese action films to Anime to American small town duster to almost graphic horror picture.  Its a tribute film...and it is a trendsetter.  And I don't think in hands other than Quentin Tarantino could it have been done as well.<br /><br />A revenge pic can always be a downer, but Tarantino keeps it engaging from one battle moment to the next, while even introducing some humor into it, and EVERY - SINGLE - ONE of the incidents where \\"The Bride\\" confronts those who have done her wrong is an action masterpiece of its own.  Whether it is the tightly-enclosed livingroom and kitchen battle with Jessica Fox, or the pastoral setting of Lucy Liu's Japanese winter garden, Tarantino is in complete control.  No small feat.  And the actors are wonderful, especially Uma Thurman.  Even the tinier moments are nicely-casted.  Sonny Chiba is mesmerizing as a former swordmaker.<br /><br />The video quality of the Blu-ray is exceptional and colorful.  But Tarentino certainly makes it hard to describe.  One moment, you are watching a black and white film, then an animated film in blood-dripping red, then ...oh, I give up.  Anyway, the great news is that it all look superb.<br /><br />Audio is a knockout!  Clarity is incredible and you will likely have to bring down the volume lest someone think people are being killed in your home and furniture being smashed.  Bravo!  All the musical themes overwhelm the senses (as well as all of your speakers).<br /><br />The extras are good but in standard definition.  A too-short making of documentary, plus a 5-minute section of two songs by the all-female band 5,6,7,8's.  There is also a collection of trailers of Quention's fillms.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0525952926|5.0|I fell in love with Ken Follett's writing when I read his outstanding debut `The Pillars of the Earth', which opened my eyes to the wonders of a literary masterpiece that was so exquisite it literally took my breath away. Hence I could not wait to read the sequel `World without End' that was truly spectacular, as Follett's writing just knocked me speechless. His next trilogy set in World War one began with the ambitious work that was `Fall of Giants' and which although it was so dissimilar to his previous works that I had loved so much, was a masterpiece of historical fiction that was just astonishing once again and so I concider myself to have been hypnotized once more! Regardless of the era, whether the narrative is set in the muddy trenches or the precincts of a great cathedral, Ken Follett's writing is unequal to anything else and which raises the standards so high for fiction in general; as he is the equivalent to JRR Tolkien in the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Winter of the World is the second installment within the Century of Giants trilogy, where five linked families live out their destinies as the world is shaken by tyranny and war in the mid-twentieth century.<br /><br />Set in 1933 Berlin, Hitler is strengthening his grip on the people of Germany. Eleven-year-old Carla Von Ulrich struggles to understand the tensions between family members, as it impacts and disrupts her once stable life. Within this cataclysm and great turmoil steps her mother's formidable friend and her former British MP, Ethel Leckwith, along with her student son Lloyd, who all too soon learns of the brutal reality of Nazism. Lloyd also encounters a group of Germans who are opposed to Hitler, but he wonders if they are prepared to go as far as betraying their own country? It is such people who are closely watched by Volodya; a Russian with a bright future in Red Army Intelligence.<br />The international clash of military power and personal beliefs that ensues, will sweep over them all as it rages from Cable Street in London's east end to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. At Cambridge Lloyd is drawn to the dazzling and totally captivating American socialite Daisy Peshkov, who represents everything his family despises. However unknown to Lloyd is that Daisy is more interested in the aristocratic boy Fitzherbert; who is an amateur pilot, partier and leader of the British Union fascists.<br />Meanwhile in Berlin Carla worships golden boy Werner from afar, but as the `twist in the tale' goes nothing works out for them as they expect, with their lives and hopes in life smashed by the greatest war in history...<br /><br />The greatest war in the history of mankind shakes the foundations of the Earth like an almighty earthquake, of bloodshed and inhumane slaughter.<br /><br />This is a truly magnificent, spellbinding epic tale of global conflict and personal drama, which is uniquely ambitious, and which is a deeply satisfying trilogy. Intricately plotted and cleverly crafted down to the tiniest of details this is an epic tale that will capture your imagination, touching your heart and soul with its realism and thought-provoking poignancy. Stirring, emotive and totally candid Follett captures the harsh reality of the First World War, in all its gruesome glory by bringing it to life before your very eyes. His fictional characters merge together with iconic figures from the past, thus interweaving fiction with fact in such a way as to transport you back in time. The author's research is so thorough that not even the smallest detail has been left out, for one can almost feel the electric tension radiating off the pages and smell the putrid stench of death; it really touches all senses as you are pulled into a world that is atmospheric and `alive'. It has a `text book' quality to this trilogy due to the accuracy of the evidence and yet it is a tale to get lost within, where the character's lives are as true as yours or mine set within the harshest of eras as the Nazi ruling shook the world forever.<br /><br />At 815 pages long this great slab of a book is something to really stick your teeth into and which certainly kept me busy for many months, as I was glued to the pages that were filled with such magnificent writing that touches one inside. Follett humanizes history and makes it fascinating to read about, intensely emotive and so, so important thus I cannot enthuse enough about his work. The overlapping stories within this book paint a vivid, remarkable and at times heart wrenching vision of humanity at that time. Just astonishing...g shook the world forever.<br /><br />At 815 pages long this great slab of a book is something to really stick your teeth into and which certainly kept me busy for many months, as I was glued to the pages that were filled with such magnificent writing that touches one inside.

030758836X|1.0|So I try really hard with every book I read to be open-minded. You could even say empathic towards the author. I want to know what he or she is truly conveying with the book's message or plot or whatever. I have to say that Gillian falters on so many levels with this book that it's hard to give her even one star for a review, and here's why:<br /><br />Now, before I rip into this book, I should point out that I DID like some of it. The first part was somewhat promising, and the second part did carry some momentum, but then....well, think LOST. four seasons of pure TV brilliance followed by a fifth season of WTF? and then the sixth season slowly revealing the writers of that show never DID have a story, they just sat in a room and whiteboarded a bunch of questions without ever thinking about how to answer them. I mean, purgatory? Come on!!! Especially when you told SO many people right at the onset that the island WASN'T some middle ground place. And in a way, that's exactly what has happened with GONE GIRL. The build is interesting, the did he or didn't he played with in a clever way, then the reveal that Nick is not so innocent as he seems (I'll try to write this without giving away any spoilers, in case some of you still think you should read this because the NY TIMES says you should and oh yeah, Gillian's EX-COMPANY EW of COURSE gave it a completely unbiased \\"A\\" writing), but ultimately, the third section of the book just leaves you wanting something way more definite, more complete. And yet it's not. It's so Lost. It's incomplete in a very NON-COOL Murakami sort of way.<br />Perhaps my main gripe is this: There WEREN'T TWO NARRATIVES here. You would be smoking crack to believe everyone that says that. I literally felt NO distinction between Nick and Amy's narratives. Sure Amy is all kinds of evil brilliant. But the same vocabulary and language Gillian uses to let us know just how COOL AMY really is, she uses that same exact language in Nick's side of telling things. I mean, both Nick and Amy used words in their storytelling that just didn't match the personalities we're supposed to believe each have. Amy maybe, but NICK? Come on Gillian, you can't qualify using big words in Nick's narrative by saying he was a journalist. I detected almost NO Midwestern to him, nothing of the sort. He doesn't feel like a Male character at all. He feels like a male character written by a female author. For this, Gillian, I give you complete credit. All you do is come off as pretentious sounding when you try to make Nick sound like...well, Nick.<br />Speaking of which, the supporting cast of characters were truly stereotypes to the point of maddening cliche. And you using a very terrible cliche at the cabins with Jeff and Greta? I won't say how or why, but lets just say it's completely unbelievable. And disgusting that Amy, who is so completely manipulative and calculating, would let her guard down THAT much. Come on! Yet a few pages later, we are supposed to believe she rolled around in the trunk of a car JUST in case some police detective looked in there for hairs? Hmmmm. Uh, NO.<br />I think the problem is that Gillian comes from a magazine like EW, who I do appreciate their reviews on things, but ultimately she can't forget her past. Gillian writes this book like she's submitting it for an review that's titled \\"How to do your best to sound cool and write scary characters for a fiction book in 2012.\\" I can literally picture Gillian sitting up in some mountain retreat going over and over again sentences and asking herself, \\"How can I make this sound cool and chic? I got an EW deadline coming up!\\" That would've been ok I suppose if you weren't writing from TWO perspectives. Nick the Bar owner and guy who gets by on his good looks and who just happens to be a journalist in a past life doesn't make him Nick the dude who keeps a thesaurus in his pocket wherever he goes so he can talk like he's in the know. Gillian just shows that she doesn't know. At all. How to write a male character.<br />Stick with the crazy, woman!<br />I won't spend much time on the end of the book except to say that it is painfully obvious you talked many times to a police department on things (like how to get around a wiretap). It's especially not believable that Amy would know so much about police procedurals. I guess we have the internet to blame for that though. What's perhaps worse is the fact that you just end the book. I'm sorry, but believe me, the story WOULDN'T HAVE ENDED the way it did. Gillian owes it to her audience to at least TRY to give us a great ending, but instead, we're left with a maddening conclusion. A purgatory, if you will.ow. At all.

What's perhaps worse is the fact that you just end the book. I'm sorry, but believe me, the story WOULDN'T HAVE ENDED the way it did. Gillian owes it to her audience to at least TRY to give us a great ending, but instead, we're left with a maddening conclusion. A purgatory, if you will.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|I was enjoying this book, but suddenly I dropped my kindle and now it's nothing more than a brick. No amount of rebooting has made any difference.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Looks great. More attractive than the smoke colored one. Not too slick, not too grippy. Solid protection. Very cheap. Perfect.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|I could listen to this album all day... In fact I have and I got it on release day! It's that good.<br /><br />I'm a huge CC fans and this album is better IMO than II but I still like their first one better.<br /><br />Don't hesitate, just buy it. Your ears will thank you.
0609610570|5.0|Excellent book on leadership and driving & working through  others to get tasks accomplished.  Examples from some of the greatest leaders!
1612130283|1.0|The plot was not deep enough to hold my interest.  It might appeal to younger women.  The book borders on pornography.  I couldn't see the purpose in writing it in a modern day world with the role of women the way it is.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|the game seemed too easy at first. it got harder though and was really fun to work on.<br />seems easy, but gets harder. good fun
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|not bad. wish they would come up with updates for other games before making a new one. more fun without dialogue.
B008Q09K2U|2.0|Half of the book is wasted -in my opinion - on what ifs, therefores and Corey wisecracks. Too bad, because the plot is original and good.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and looks great in 3D.  The movie arrived on time and I have already watched it with my nephews and family.  I highly recommend getting this movie in 3D if you have the 3D system to watch it with.
B0086700CM|5.0|its awesome never bored when I play. everyone I know loves it and I do too.  TEMPLE RUN IS THE BEST.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Great movies, great price.  Lots of extra features and in a nice little package as well.  Not huge as some 8 disc sets are.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I love this app. It 's very accurate and I can save a number of locations. I 'he tried other weather apps and none of them had the ease of use that this does.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I received this movie as promised.  I highly recommend getting it in 3D if you have the system to watch it with.  I've already seen it with my nephews and family, they loved it.  You must have a 3D entertainment system to watch it in 3D.
B006TTC5JK|5.0|it was so funny and confused i give you 5 stars on this sheet!!! And GOD blessing you wish you have a happy holiday!!!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It's was a good movie however it was not as good as the first three movies which starred Matt Damon.  Jeremy Renner did a pretty good job as the main character and the movie was interesting.  This movie had good action scenes and the ending leaves the movie open to continue the series.  I would love to see the next movie costar Damon and Renner.  4 out of 5 stars for me.
1451695195|5.0|I believe 100% in Heaven by faith alone but this book solitified my belief even more by reinforcing the fact that science cannot and will never be able to explain why we love, and where we came from. The fact the a scientist was moved to believe he was<br />in Heaven not only by his experience in Heaven but also by his brain having no capability of conjuring up Heaven images and experiences should make everyone a believer. My son was killed 4 years ago & it is so important to me to know 100% that he is there with Jesus!!! This book gave me much comfort!!!
B003ES5ZPK|1.0|don't buy these thinks they are bery bad . i buy 2 of the one becouse i tod is was going to be cheaper but no one of the 2 work at all
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We enjoyed the series on television and can now enjoy it wheneer we want.  I love the period costumes and the wit and humor of Maggie Smith's role.  I find the contrast between the lives of the aristocratic family and the many servants needed to run the household is very interesting.  I anticipate the toll the war will take on the lifestyle of the rich that surely will be depicted in the third season.
B000YHG72E|5.0|this movie is absolutely hilarious i am not a huge fan of Christmas music or movies this movie defiantly put me in the mood for Christmas and cracked me up!!!
B008DL466C|3.0|I eagerly awaited the coming out of this album and was very disappointed. Lyrically, every beat sounds the same: how much money he has and smoking weed. I realize rap culture has come to embrace these things, but they don't need to define the album, which in this case it did. I love Wiz and will be waiting for redemption. I give it 3 stars for some dope beats and typical Wiz charm.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|The end dragged with details of her counseling but the story helped me realized how bad it was for her!
B0085YNML2|5.0|Game Play:<br />The game has four chapters in it and they are: The Terrarium, Mystic Lake, Blazing Desert, and Lost Jungle. Each first level of each chapter is unlocked so you can start on the chapter you want to. The goal is to get the chameleon to stick his tongue to a flower and swing so you can get the stars and then eat the bug. You have to position the chameleon just right so his momentum will get him swinging and allow him to get the star. You also have to tap the screen to get him to release at the right moment as you need his momentum to carry him in the right direction and grab the next flower. You tap the flower that you want him to use next but you only get to use most flowers one time. Spinning flowers you may get to use multiple times.<br /><br />The game is fun and challenging and changes as you go along. For example some of the flowers are spinning like fans and they can sling the chameleon faster and farther.<br /><br />Main screen:<br />* Play<br />* Options - control music, SFX and back to main screen<br />* Credits<br />* Facebook<br />* Twitter<br />* Gamistry Developer Facebook page<br /><br />What I like:<br />The game is cute and the graphics are well done for this level of a game. The music is good in the background and the SFX are well selected. The game play is fun and challenging and the physics used in the game are implemented correctly and are fun to use in the game.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />It seems occasionally that touching the screen to have him release from a flower has a bit of time lag in it so it may cause you to miss your mark. You just have to play the level over again.<br /><br />The only permission is network access but it is used to link you to Facebook, twitter and the developer's Facebook page.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Overall this is a cute and fun game. I liked playing it and it reminds me of several other top level games with swinging objects in them. This one has a unique approach in that the swinging object is the main character and you are planning his route to get the stars and the food. I liked the graphics, music and SFX.<br /><br />If you want to keep your children off of Facebook and twitter then turn off your WIFI, set your device in airplane mode or turn on your parental controls.<br /><br />I rate this app as a 5 star game and your kids will like it a lot.<br /><br />Size: The size is 19.20 MB uncompressed.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* Network communication - full internet accessis the main character and you are planning his route to get the stars and the food.

B005KELW26|5.0|Keeps my Kindle Fire clean and I love the color.  Also helps when I carry the Kindle inside my purse.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Harry Bosch, our classic detective noir, is at his best irascible, dogged and determined best. It is a \\"who done it\\"tour De force, filled with misdirection, obfuscation and clever plot construction. A fun fast read for  cold winter night.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Still need to know what the black berry tiles are for. That's when you've finished and decide to keep going.
B0059XTU1S|3.0|Not even in the Hobbit book, but pretty much saved the movie from being a complete snooze fest.  We've already seen orcs (not depicted although vaguely mentioned in the book), we've seen Galadriel (not depicted in the book), we've seen Saruman (ditto); we've seen giant eagles (in the book but not until the end), giant spiders (ditto) and the Sting (ditto).  And although we hadn't seen trolls in the Lord of the Rings trilogy (or did we?  I think I spotted some in the dark army in \\"Return of the King\\"?), there was nothing scary or funny or remotely interesting about them.<br /><br />As for the company of dwarves, their depiction here is something like a cartoon Braveheart.  My gut reaction was, \\"Trust Tolkien (Anglo-Saxon snob) to give the boorish creatures Scottish accents\\", then I remembered - he didn't.  Peter Jackson and his company of screenwriters did.  How cliche'.<br /><br />No, I wasn't looking at my watch after the first ten minutes, really I wasn't.  I was looking at my lap because the 48 bit frame rate made the sweeping landscapes blurry and headache-inducing.<br /><br />Spoiler alerts:  How do you turn a single volume whimsical childrens' story into a 9 hour trilogy of films?  By stretching  every  single  scene  out  a  very  very  long  time  and then putting in a bunch of stuff from other Tolkien books and other movies based on other Tolkien books and...well, a whole lot of other stuff you just made up!  With all the CGI tricks in the world at his disposal, Jackson could not make Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett look younger?<br /><br />But far be it for me to question the motives of the studio or the Tolkien Estate...kerching, kerching.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This movie was just great.<br /><br />I can sit here and blow sunshine up your ass all day.  But ain't no body got time for dat...I got bronchitis.<br /><br />Go see this movie ya dummy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mnecraft is a great game after my Pc died and no longer plays minecraft Ive beennplaying it on kindle instead but they need signs armorial minecarts redstone science and large chests plus nonlinear mp
1401900526|5.0|This always is a much-appreciated gift for anyone facing a turning point in life--and who isn't?!  Very insightful and thoughtful on many levels.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Pretty good product, though I have never owned another headphone amp so I can say comparatively how it is. However, there is a noticeable improvement in sound quality, with deeper bass and more clarity.<br />The equalizer settings is where you'll get most of these improvements but there is no way to change exactly how they are set up. It would have also been nice if the unit had a place to put the male-male audio cable, right now I just have that attached to my headphone cord with twist-ties.<br /><br />Otherwise worth the money I think. Probably not what &#34;audiophiles&#34; would want in terms of power but hey, not everybody needs a 5K sound system for their headphones.
B004S5BTD0|1.0|Not a move I would recommend seeing. Strange and weird and not a very good performance by either actors.<br />If you like Matt Damon I would recommend &#34;I Bought a Zoo&#34;.
B00009ZYBY|4.0|I like movies and stories where the primary character is a doer (&#34;talks the walk and walks the talk&#34;).  These days, many people in charge are there because they have the money or have been promoted or elected to their position without really doing the work that they want others to do.  In the Gladiator, Russel Crowe was both a leader and a fighter.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I moved through the levels quickly and only needed a redo on a few puzzles ; mostly had plenty of time.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Thought this album was one of Joe's best.  A culmination of new and earlier works that really worked.  If you are a fan you will love this album.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This DVD replaces my Video from 25 years back, and time has not diminished the story. The special features alone make this a worthwhile addition to my collection. Thanks
B0086900TI|5.0|Have seen the movie on line but have no dvd player at this point as my pc crashed. Will watch again a soon as my pc is fixed or replaced.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|T h e  Sherlock  Holmes  m o v i e  G a m e s Of  S h a d o w s  was great
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|This is my first year buying the Star Wars advent calendar. My 8 year old son loves his advent calendar but he has been disappointed with some of the doors. I must say getting out of bed in the morning is a bit easier when he has the surprise waiting for him. IMO the price is a bit high, for the tiny prizes. A few of the figures were not in the right spot so sometimes it was frustrating for my son to try and figure out how to put the pieces together until the right door that matched the figure with the instructions was opened.
B005LAII08|5.0|Pixar awesomeness, in 3D.  Need I say more?  OK, maybe I'm biased.  Reminds me a little of brother bear, so if you don't like that I suggest renting it first.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is better than the one that came with my android.  It recognizes more cities and it is simple to use.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The ending was sad to see that Percy and Annie feel into Tantartus but there might be hope for them
B00003CXDB|5.0|This single-disc version was just what I wanted.  Not too many \\"special features\\" or \\"extras\\" that clutter up things.  The seller shipped very quickly and the quality of the disc was above par for a used item.  It even included the original brochure.  This is an important movie.  I honestly think that Gordon Gecko's character was not a fluke.  On Wall Street, there are likely hundreds of Gordon Geckos out there.  They're just a lot more careful about how they conduct business than Gordon - and becoming even more clever as time goes by.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My husband is an avid fan of all the Angry Birds \\"stories\\" He asked if he could downloaded this particular game<br />to my Kindle Fire HD, an early Christmas gift (that he bought me). He loves the game!!!!! I have to ask him if I can use MY kindle, for reading and surfing the web. All fans of Angry Birds will like this game. Enjoy!
B004SBULWE|5.0|I had no idea how many apps run in the background. I love this little app. It is good for my usage.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The sound is excellent and you can really crank it up if you want.  The Dolby surround is fantastic while gaming or watching movies.  Excellent if you want to do things late at night without disturbing others.  The microphone is very sensitive and the position and angle is completely adjustable.  I'm very pleased with these.  The only minor problems is 1) the Win7-64 pops up multiple messages to plug and unplug every time you boot up and 2) Sometimes applications don't choose the right output device and will play out of the primary sound device.  You might have to manually disable the primary sound in your control panel.  I'm not sure if this is an issue with Win7 or Logitech drivers.  Battery life has been excellent.  I've never had it run out and the wireless range works everywhere in my house which is three levels with basement.  Contrary to what others have stated, the battery is easily replaceable (instructions for removal come in the documentation) and it's inexpensive.
B005KJZDW6|5.0|I got this when it came out and its a white vinyl instead of red. I love the lovely calm sound...all classics for sure. I'm glad they didn't take risks...Christmas is about comfort and this album gives you that feel. WORTH HAVING IN YOUR RECORD COLLECTION.
B0009XRZ9M|4.0|If this movie finally becomes the Christmas classic its creators intended it to be, it will be in spite of themselves, due more to the genius of the original author of [[ASIN:0395389496 The Polar Express]], the ever expanding electric train version: [[ASIN:B0006GYMTI Lionel Polar Express Train Set]], [[ASIN:B000LGTCTI Lionel Polar Express Hot Chocolate Car]], [[ASIN:B000XMBUQ8 Lionel Polar Express Disappearing Hobo Car]], [[ASIN:B0017T4WKW Lionel Polar Express Coach w/Conductor Announcement]], [[ASIN:B003MUS1YM Lionel Polar Express Abandoned Toy Car]], [[ASIN:B000LSPU0Q Lionel Polar Express Elf Hand Car]], etc., or the enthusiastic trainiacs at rolling railroad museums around the world who've leaped upon the bandwagon, uh, special express (by doing Polar Express themed train rides during the Christmas season), rather than to the somewhat flawed efforts of the creators themselves at least IMHO.  I did not care for it much when this movie first came out, but my dislike is softening with repeated viewings.<br /><br />The first problem is the plot...<br /><br />or lack thereof.  When you remember that the original is a picture book for children, getting 100 minutes of comprehensible animated film out of that is going to be a problem, and unlike the similarly challenged creators of the much better IMHO [[ASIN:B000B6CODO Jumanji]], the creators of the Polar Express movie didn't have available the obvious course of just lengthening each game turn scene.  Instead they inserted a couple of roller coaster wild ride scenes.  The extended wanderings through the eerily empty work environs of the North Pole quickly grow tedious but the long, long sequence involving losing (and finding) Hero Girl's ticket, meeting the Hobo and traversing the roofs of the cars, roller coasting down the steepest drop in the world, and ice skating with a train, is arguably the high point of the movie.  It also makes no darn sense whatsoever.  Just for example there is no SANE reason for anyone, ESPECIALLY the Conductor and Hero Girl, to be walking on the roofs of the cars!  In addition, after all of that friendship forming under pressure and adventure, I was disappointed to find that none of the children, not even Hero Boy and Hero Girl, seem ever to have met again.<br /><br />Note: One reason for purchasing the [[ASIN:B0009XRZ9M Two-Disc Widescreen Edition]] is because it contains a deleted scene which among other things reveals the origin of the Hobo;... not that this will make this character's actions any more comprehensible though!<br /><br />Finally, there is the problem of the Motion Capture process itself.  As movie reviewers at the time noted, computer animation resulting from motion capture just looks creepy to those used to other forms of animation.  This is a near fatal defect in what is supposed to be a warm would-be Christmas classic but, making a virtue out of a necessity, turns out to be just what you want when making a creepy instant Halloween classic like [[ASIN:B000IFRT2Y Monster House]].IALLY the Conductor and Hero Girl, to be walking on the roofs of the cars!

B004GJDQT8|5.0|So far I have liked this app, direct line to my amzon pages, and so far has worked perfectly for me.
0553565915|5.0|This book is a great comfort read for anyone experiencing the death of a loved one. I recomend it highly.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I suppose its good if you like this type of thing.  I actually can't remember the last time I bought a CD.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is a fun game. There is a zoom now. The items are not too small nor is the screen too cluttered as previously mentioned in other reviews. I guess there was an update.<br />Works fine on the kindle fire hd 7 inch. Very Harry Potter'ish. So far so good.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|We got 2 of these, one for two brothers to share (ages 6 and 7), and one for a Star Wars/Christmas/Advent calendar lover (in his 30s). All of them were very excited and have been enjoying the surprise for each day leading to Christmas.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Got this today.  Tried twice to use it and after the intro, it takes you to a screen that says there is an update.  Press yes or no to continue.  If you press yes, not only does nothing happen, but your Fire is then stuck and the only way to get it operational again is to turn it off and then back on.<br /><br />Thought perhaps it was a fluke so tried it again, this time pressed no for the update.  Same thing happened...Fire got stuck and had to turn it off and then on again to get it to work at all.  I had no choice but to delete this app and I have a rather disappointed child who loves LPS and can not play the game.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|My wife and I love this movie. If you can get past the heavy-british-urban-slang (there were some points where it could really use subtitles) its a great movie.  It had great character development and I was really happy with the new and original monster design.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|shows only the 10 most recent posts, then a  few more in totally unreadable mode. worst fb app ever.  fix asap, pls....
B005FISBTO|5.0|By far the best season of Dexter but only if you have seen the previous seasons. I have already preorder season 7
B001EN71CW|5.0|Josh Whedon at his best.  This series should have run for years.  Great cast with great stories full of humor and action.
B00004SYHW|1.0|Sorry , but I truly could not abide the narrator.  Smarmy beyond tolerance.  It the March girls were 5 or 6 years old I could perhaps understand the way their voices were characterized but considering they are teenagers.....well, intolerable.  I really tried, but I could not listen for more than half an hour and then I was done.  Too bad they didn't find a better narrator.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This game is pretty challenging but not ridiculously difficult. I had fun playing for  several hours...until I made it to the final stage and the runic code puzzle thingie froze (apparently other people have had this problem).
B009DKFST6|5.0|It might be my favorite Pitbull cd next to Armando. It's a really strong cd, I don't think there is a single weak song on it. I really love his collaborations even the unexpected ones like The Wanted. His song with Jennifer Lopez is really good and his message for single working mothers really touches me.  I have to say that pretty much the only J-Lo songs I like are the ones she does with Pitbull.  His song with Christina A is really good and I love the hook. The &#34;Christian Gris&#34; stuff cracks me up as well. 11:59 might be my favorite song.. at least for now but it seems to change. lol Great CD you can't go wrong!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great move for kids and adults, full of action & humor.  Great cast and story. Fantastic special effects. Love'd it.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I have had no problems running this app on my Kindle Fire HD 7&quot; . Both the single shot and video modes worked, exceeding my expectations. The images are easily accessed via the starting page links of the app.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read this in less than 24 hours. It gets crazy at the end but we'll worth it. I would recommend this book!!!
B005V4FJC4|5.0|It's my favorite modern Christmas Cd. Just pulled it back out and I'm really enjoying it. Zoey has a really interesting sultry kind of voice. Rocking around the Christmas Tree is really fun.
0739308742|2.0|Having listened to the first three books on CD read brilliantly by Roy Dotrice, I wonder why they switched to John Lee for Book IV on CD.  His voice is virtually the same for every character,and with so many characters, I had to constantly skip back to see who was \\"talking.\\" And there really is too much TALKING and not enough action in this volume. Back to Roy Dotrice and John Snow and Jamie and the Imp!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun and fast pace really enjoyed this game can't wait to see the next. The objects in the hogs where the right size is that you could see them.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Received as a gift for Christmas. It is new and still in sealed package. It was packaged and shipped very well .
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I FREAKIN&#34; Love this CD! I absolutely totally love it. Every song on the CD is great  - I've had it on repeat for days. It's probably my favorite of all the Maroon 5 cd's.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked off because I was able to look word up for homework for my English class. I would recommend it to my younger friends.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|I loved this movie. Channing tatum is wonderful. Lots of action and graphics. I loved it must all bc tatum was in it ;)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its cool I just wish it had more games and better graphics. but over all I like it a lot

B0053O89RY|5.0|Enjoy this series because it is up-to-date and the cast of people bring many reminders of people I know, yes..
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! It is worth the money. I wasn't sure when I ordered it but I am enjoying it. No problems on the Kindle.
B004EI2NM2|1.0|Really, that's all I can say about this film---whether it's the acting, the script, the plot, the excessively dark lighting, the so-called love scenes. Awful!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Slow start but as the story  goes on  it keeps your attention. Iit slows down again mid way and never realy gains momentum again  unlike his other books i felt he got bored with the story and just stoped writing.
B000W91RUG|5.0|arrived on time ~ no damages. Now I can watch my favorite episodes over and over! LOVE BIG BANG THEORY! WAY too funny.
B003L77GG0|5.0|What a terrific price for the last season, we had all the rest of the series, so this was perfect. The speed with which we recieved the package was great, the quality great, no problem!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Downloaded this app after experiencing the original \\"limited\\" version App.  I have used it every time I travel and at work.  I am very happy with the ease of its use and that it does what it says it does.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|This is one of the Series I have ever seen. It is like reading a really great book that you do not want to put down until you have finished.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I ordered this and a few other Jillian Michaels exercise dvd's to do on my own at home.....let me tell you ~ these are awesome! As a fitness instructor, these are MY go-to work outs to do! LOVE IT!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This is the first movie I like Kristen Steward performance other than Twilight Series. Chris Hemsworth does great. Charlize does pretty good too.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am enjoying this game I think it's stupid you have to write a review just to rate the game though.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Not sure why 20 more words are required....  don't remember receiving an email for this at any point.  But I have it, it works and I love the movie.  Can't I just give it 5 stars and move on?  Preferred the other system better.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love BIG BANG THEORY....cant get enough.....and THIS is perfect. I can savor each episode over and over. Arrived on time, no damages and picture perfect!
B007MU85D0|5.0|Great album. Not a bad song on it. First saw these guys on Fallon and glad I bought their music.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|i bought this because of sultans of swing, a ggo album alaround knopfler is one of the best guitarists today
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Not sure why 20 more words are required....  don't remember receiving an email for this at any point.  But I have it, it works and I love it.  My only criticism is that there weren't enough special features and the gag reel wasn't nearly long enough.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|I like Bruno Mars and every song is good on this CD.  It's his best so far.  Would recommend buying or downloading it!
B00136JS12|5.0|I bought this album new years ago on vinyl, and its just as awesome now as it was then! Features the hit &#34;More than a feeling&#34;
B00004Y6NX|5.0|my personal favorite of dire straits, knopfler tears it up on this album, his playing is unique , and unlike others
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I haven't actually had time to watch this yet... but am sure it's fine... and apparently 6 more words are needed.<br /><br />PS:  Don't like this system at all.
1118273052|4.0|Trading is mostly about information, but I have found you can have all the info in the world and lack confidence, you will miss some major moves. This book is a great confidence builder in the way of the stories tod by Jack. I found it moving in how the interviewees fell down and got back up only to suceed at the highest levels. Its a great read and I highly recommend it...
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a quick read.  I didn't want to put it down.  Not at all what I thought it would be.
B008NB0SQO|1.0|So, once again, I must stick to my aging VHS version of this film.  Why, oh why, can't we be given the option to have the film with the missing song?  Make it a branching disk, so those that want it can have it, and those who don't don't have to.  Is that really so hard?
B00785P2QC|5.0|fantastic game good graphics its fun I recomend this game to everyone. its a very good game for the price
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book ever! I love the Hunger Games series. I woul reccomend it 2 anyone over 11! I love it!
B000641D2Y|1.0|The DVD is letterbox, not widescreen.  Looks awful on a Widescreen TV.  Do not buy unless you have a tube TV.
1439102813|4.0|This is one very talented author.  I was introduced to her when I stumbled across the book \\"Left Neglected\\" which just blew me away so when I saw this book in my library bookshop for $2 I just had to snap it up and read it right away.<br /><br />Her writing style is, again, very smooth and just sucks you into the story.  The subject matter was a very difficult one but she handled in a very undramatic way.  That is what draws me to this author.  She writes about the unimaginable but makes them seem like everyday life and I guess they are to a lot of people in the world!<br /><br />Her knowledge and experience of the subject matter of Alzheimer's shows through in this book, in fact, a little too much so.  I dropped a star from my review because some of the technical detail and drug terms almost detracted from the emotion of the story for me.<br /><br />What made this a must read was how she got the reader inside Alice's mind as it was splintering apart and makes you feel like you can understand what Alice is going through - and God forbid that any of us actually go through it in real life.  She kept the emotions just from Alice's point of view and didn't try to go into what any of the other characters were thinking or feeling in any depth and this really worked.  If she had tried to write this with a different chapter from each different characters perspective then the rawness of the subject would have been lost.<br /><br />Not an easy read because of the subject matter but easy because of the flowing style of the author.  4 out of 5.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The acting and action are fantastic.  Always a favorite.  This is definitely one for your collection. We are looking forward to the sequel.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Simple, but very entertaining. Take my word for it, if you buy this game, you won't want to put it down!
B0085YNML2|5.0|Its adorable and fun. You have to think of ways to get the stars and get the worm or slug thing. Its a free version of cut the rope except instead of the worm moving to lizard the lizard comes to the food. So fun totally worth your time and you font have to pay for it so its even better.
1416972250|4.0|City of Glass (Mortal Istruments<br />very interesting.  i'm reading the series and it is geting more interested with each book i read
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Shameful app... I hate to say this but I gotta use my iPod touch to check Facebook. I was expecting more from this tablet.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A classic Christmas movie to bring some laughter and lightheartedness to the holidays. I never get sick of watching this movie.
030758836X|1.0|I enjoyed the book until the ending which made it feel like a total waste of time. Author should have realized that after all the build up this ending would leave readers speechless in a bad way!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|A very individual experience.  When he got to heaven there wasn't anyone else.  I had a NDE and did feel the need to share but expanding it into a book seems too much.  It was personal and I relish the peace it gives me.  Maybe I am just too private to put it that far out there.  I really don't think anyone I tried to share it with came away with any more acceptance of it being okay.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is the best one yet you mite have to wait a little to get stuff! You will be amazed it is the best so try it now you can get seasonal dragons see for your self see your friends! Buy island's the sun dragons give you 50 gold a minute! You can earn or buy gems!

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this app is great and its cool because I can just draw anything that I want to draw and am going to draw a house and a lake. its something that anybody can downs want to do. this is so amazon or even better supergreatness.I can even go and share my review or picture. and its a draw something free that's like over the top.)
B00002MZ4V|5.0|This is a great collection, a very full one with 2 CD's.  I have listened to each track over and over and am always amazed as to which movies they belong to.  It's a good starting place for deciding on favorites in movie music; John Williams is hard to beat.
B00632HWOG|3.0|This app was an amazing email app until I updated it. When I updated it, it slowed down and has to ferry your account almost every time you use the app. If you had the original, don't update it!
0156027321|5.0|I've read this book before, and own a copy already, but could not get to my books that are in storage as fast as I could find a copy on Amazon, so I decided to purchase this before the movie was released in order to read it again.  The &#34;used&#34; copy I received looked brand new!
B009CPEOC4|5.0|It was a complete look inside her life and very sad. I wish it would have worked for her with Russel.She is a true performer.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I wish this book was longer and actually finished the story but other than that it was good and entertaining.
B005LAII1C|1.0|This movie is NOT for children and adults should find it vile.  Great premise but we walked out on it right away in the theatre. Don't waste your money!!
1594135851|4.0|very cool twist too the story i only read half of the story so far and love it canit wait to read the next book

B007J4T2G8|5.0|amazing!!!! so hot! 5 stars! if you love a good romance with a spicy twist, this is the book for you!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|you should be able to use hair gel ya know?  and hair spray. possibly better stuff because you don't have a lot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's difficult to say anything about this book that hasn't already been said.  However, I think it's important to note that this story does a lot of things that other fiction often does not address (which is why I've given Hunger Games 5 stars).  The protagonist doesn't have a \\"destiny\\" complex as so many other heroic protagonists do in literature.  She doesn't hurtle into dangerous situations with abandon with the \\"author's knowledge\\" that she will prevail.  Instead, she is hamstrung with very practical matters of survival, not the least of which is hunger.  I would recommend this book to both young readers and adults alike.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Use at Church with my Kindle Fire and my cell..great software...Pastor loads up sermon notes on LIVE which is a function of the software....this allows us to review and study during the week.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would have given this a 5 star, but a new advertisement has caused an annoying screen flicker to occur when you move the cards. Other than that, it is a very good solitaire game.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Every so often I take a break from more intellectual pursuits and go for a fast read.  The Racketeer fits perfectly into this category, and it is a quick read with zero challenge.  Hence my three star rating is more of a genre rating, than the book rating.<br /><br />It is exactly what you expect from this author, no better, no worse thank the others I have read by Grisham.<br /><br />Sociedad Hispana Doylestown book club
0307949486|4.0|I can see from a lot of these reviews that there are diverging opinions when it comes to the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  The first 100 pages left something to be desired, but the later end makes it well worth the wait.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|same crap different guy .. some decent action but also to much waiting, and the plot was boring and the ending predictable
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Works great for holding my GPS hand held unit.  Comes with two sizes of u-bolts for standard size handlebar or larger bar mounting.
B00338QENI|5.0|I did not regret buying this book even though initially I thought it was more science based. The author does a great job in shedding light on a woman that never got the recognition she deserved.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked Mocking Jay and it still managed to strike an unconventional tone, but I thought a lot of the plot driving devices were gimmicky and contrived.  The first book was exceptional, and if you liked it, then definately read the next.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game!! Its keeps me interested by adding new games every time you get enough points. Try it out!! :)@
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good game just wish didn't have to wait so long for new coins cause I don't buy coins but is a interesting game
B001AQO3QA|4.0|All the movies looked like new in this collection.  And they all had the theatrical verson as well as the special edition version as well which was a great bonus to boot.  Very satisfied.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Good blu ray disc movie. Product is same as described. shipment to indonesia took 30 days. Last word need to mention. Excellent.
B007L6VR12|5.0|This movie arrived at my house promptly. It was soo good I watched it twice the first night it arrived. I loved it so much I decided to buy a few more to give to people as Christmas gifts.
1451695187|5.0|Very good, did not want to put it down!! Finally someone with a scientific background and education admits what I have believed all along that there is a God who controls everything according to his will. When you first read about the butterfly don't forget about it. It is heart touching. That is if you have a heart.
0670023329|5.0|Its amazing what is still going on in North Korea.  Kids born without hope due to the &#34;sins&#34; of their grandparents.  Forced into starvation and hard labor, and growing up with a mentality to trust NO ONE.<br /><br />This book is an easy read from a literary point of view, yet very emotional in the details.
B009YU6FJM|4.0|If you are involved in any way with any genre of music from rock to heavy metal, chances are, you've been exposed to Deftones, and chances are, you liked what you heard. Since 1995 Deftones have put out nothing less than quality in their music and Koi No Yokan is absolutely no exception.<br />The album starts with the heavy hitting, but no too harsh, Swerve City. Chino's vocals are pristine as always, and the track is more than enough to get you moving. Leathers and Poltergeist are probably the two heaviest tracks on the album and appear back to back within the first half of the album making the beginning of the album easy to catch on to and leaving no room for boredom. Afterwards the album follows a steady pattern trading off between mellow and heavy tracks so that there's not really any dragging moments. Tempest, Gauze, and Rosemary are the three real stand out tracks, mixing heavy grooves with great musicianship and artistry.<br />As a fan of progressive and original sounding music, Koi No Yokan is a golden find. Mixing originality and progressive elements in easy to catch on grooves without sounding too slick and overproduced. Revolver Magazine voted it as the best release of 2012 and it's not difficult to see why.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Got this DVD for a person who loved the movie and likes to watch them again.  It will be a good gift.

B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It just wasn't very good. A couple good laughs, but they were cheap. The story sucked. I watched the whole thing, but not without a sigh or two.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app. Its so easy to use that i prefer using this over the website. It works even better on the Kindle Fire than on my phone.
B008NEVP1S|4.0|Aimee Mann has always been the articulate man's musician.  The sonic palette here is reminiscent of her best work, &#34;I'm With Stupid.&#34;  It rocks harder than &#34;Bachlor No. 1&#34; or &#34;Lost in Space,&#34; although not as hard as her aforementioned 1997 effort.  Great lyrics and most of the tunes are quite catchy.
0345803485|3.0|Better written than I expected, too much sex by the time you get to the third volume the novelty has worn-off and I found myself skipping the sex scenes.
B00005JKGZ|3.0|i bought this as a gift so have something to look forward to later. i have never seen this movie or any of the collection items it offers, but hope they will be interesting.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I love the music.  An added attraction was Sarah Brightman at the end of the show and 4 of the phantom singing together.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This movie was mildly entertaining but only toward the end with the motorcycle sequences. The plot--such as it was--was disjointed and hardly made sense. Heck, I disliked this movie so much, that I'm not going to comment on it further other than to say that it wasn't worth the cost to view it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|LOVE this game!!!! But there are a few glitches due to its newness. My game's been restarted twice now...Hope they get stuff fixed soon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very intertwining:) also I don't think it needs wifi so its great!! very injoyable love it could play it all day!!!!
B00755646W|1.0|My old dvd is better. The only blu ray parts of this vhs to dvd to blu ray are the credits. I guess if you like snowy black and white and color blu ray buy it. This is not blu ray.
B0013O123Q|1.0|I couldn't stand to watch the entire movie. That this movie actually won awards is a testament to how disgustingly sick society is.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Excellent book!! Mitch Albom is a fabulous writer and this particular book is<br />so thought provoking.  Throughly enjoyed it; it was a fast, easy read and well the worth<br />the money.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game starts off easy and lulls you into thinking it is no big deal. Sooner than you can switch it off you find yourself puzzled by the complexity of the level you're  on....and then you just can't stop playing....its fun and puzzling. Try it. You might just like it.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|It doesn't work very well.  Neither do other downloads.  Would like to have more aps that would work on my tablet.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|If you are looking for a good search and find game give this one a try. The story is ok and the play is not to difficult. It keeps the kids entertained.

B003EV6DBM|4.0|Not as good as seasons 1-4 with David Tennant & Christopher Eccleston but still done very well and worth watching. a must have for any Doctor Who Fan
B00632HWOG|1.0|used the app daily until yesterday when I downloaded the update. now nothing will download-just sits in &quot;loading&quot; for the past 14 hours.wish I could undo the update. Yahoo please please please repair this mess you created! so disappointing....
B007HACDLK|3.0|It was OK however this was not the best book by Vince Flynn. The book was still an enjoyable to read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the first movie before I read the books. The books were<br />So much better. They gave so much more detail and explained<br />So much more. They definitely make you wonder if one day that will be our children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren future. We must hope not and do all we can to prevent it.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Excellent.. A must see. David Tennant is a cosumate actor and the stories are very well written, most episodes take you on tour of all your emotions from excitment, laughter and heart break . A must have for any Doctor Who Fan
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This is the twelfth Pendergast novel offered by Preston & Child and the plotline and character development is still as strong as ever. I have read every one of them; always looking forward to the next. Two Graves appears to be the third in a multi-arc series; more to come? Seems that way. It's difficult to review a book without spoiling it for the potential reader, so I shall not talk much about the plot which has more twists and turns than Lombard Street. Read the publisher's plot description for that. My reviews are about whether I enjoyed the read. Short answer: yes.<br /><br />The only negative I found with this release was with the beginning. I like our protagonist Aloysius best when he is using cerebral attacks and not Jack Reacher physicality. There was too much impulsive action and not enough rational thought in the beginning with the kidnapping of his wife Helen and the subsequent search for her. P&C quickly settled down though and gave us the hyper-logical thinking from Pendergast that we enjoy. Without giving away too much, Pendergast does meet up with two adult twin sons he never knew he had, Alban and Tristram; discovers a Nazi enclave; and has a run in with yet another volcano.  The main plot travels from New York to Mexico and on to Brazil. P&C entertain us with two separate and minor sub-plots; one with Constance Greene and Dr. Felder and the other with Corrie Swanson which serve to keep these characters alive and well for use in subsequent Pendergast novels...as well as serving as a relief valve of sorts for the main plot.<br /><br />The other fun part of reading Pendergast novels on a Kindle is the ability to just bring your cursor down to those ancient or European only  multi-syllabic words that nobody knows the meaning of and presto!...there's the definition. Admit it; Pendergast stumps the bejesus out of us with some of his dialogue.<br /><br />I'd like to give Two Graves 5 stars simply because my man Pendergast is in it, but I have to be honest and knock one off for the slow out-of-character start and an ending that became sort of obvious a tad too early.  Buy it though...you'll enjoy it.and knock one off for the slow out-of-character start and an ending that became sort of obvious a tad too early.  Buy it though...you'll enjoy it.
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|What can I say/write? It's John Frusciante! Buy it!!! John is one of the few true musicians these days, and this album shows how he's always growing as a musician and a human being, something hard to find in this immediate satisfaction times... BUY IT!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|When purchased all the series available I was so pleased with the purchase because this way I got to watch commercial free the first 3 seasons and found out I missed alot more than I thought-so worth the price.

B004YM6JLO|5.0|Would totally buy all the series that come available-if you ever missed any on tv or just want to watch commercial free it's worth the money.

B000HKW7E0|5.0|No issues with the blu-ray.  I found this to be extremeley competitive pricing for $10.  I've ordered other blu-ray's from amazon recently that have skipped straight out of the package so I'm happy this one doesn't.
0553801503|4.0|it was probally the weaker book i have read but it was still really good though. Can't wait read the next one.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Highly recommend to anyone who loves watching the tv series. I seen parts on these that I didn't remember seeing on tv.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Brimming with complex relationships. Youthful charm and understated slightly surreal humor. This is one of Anderson's best. This combo pack is how all movies should be produced.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|The Ultimate Bee Gees:  Great compilation of melodies and memories from three of the most unusual and highly<br />talented voices from the Twentieth Century,  2 of whom are no longer with us.  A fitting tribute to perfection !!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|At first I took reading and performing the activities suggested with a grain of salt because it all seems rather far fetched. However, now that I've completed most of the 28 day exercise, there's forward momentum in all areas of my life and I see the world very differently than before. It's funny when things began to change I was actually concerned because everything in my life started to go so well. Perhaps you'll have the same odd experiences and I hope that you do.
1577314808|5.0|This book came in perfect condition and was very Inspiring to read. Definately recommend for those looking for a simple to read and understand the message of living for the now moments.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|Great toy, but beware to all those with obsessive personalities. It will consume you! You'll hate the fact that you love it, or you love the fact that you hate it. You'll want to throw it but you won't be able to put it down.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|moral of this movie: gingers always win. who could dislike a movie with that sweet of a message? not me. it's super cute and parts are funny. it's a bit long, but in general the least annoying rom-com i have ever seen.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|I would have given this more then 3 stars but when you zoom in and scroll its starts giving penalties for randomly clicllking!! Your not clicking on items your moving your finger across the screen!!!
B006OV7RQ4|5.0|MMMM is not made for the typical popcorn crunching, explosion and car chase seeking movie goer so I can certainly understand the negative reviews.  The style displayed is subtle and quiet, letting the viewer think about rather than be told about what is happening.  Be sure to check out the short film that comes with the DVD.  While only a few minutes, it's better than most films five times as long.
B006O6F932|5.0|I am surprised at the detail in this set. It is amazing and my daughter loves it.  She just turned 9.  The price on amazon beat everyone else by far. It came in a timely manner and I know it will entertain my daughter for a long time.  The only thing I wish it included is perhaps a draw string bag for all the accessories that can't be inside the structure during storage.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I'm a grownup in a stressful job, so i read the same books my 10 year old nephew reads to relax, which is not at all pathetic (maybe a little pathetic). I love these books! I read a lot of Greek mythology when I was young, so this series is super interesting, and for my nephew, who has never read any mythology, it's all well-explained so he doesn't feel lost.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|When reading this, I was in a constant state of amazement.  There are so many words to describe your bravery and constant will to help your Team and your Country.  Being from Texas, I like the story of the Lone Star patch between you and President George Bush. Your service to this County is one that will never be forgotten and we all appreciate you protecting our freedom at all costs.<br /><br />You are a true hero.  Thank you for all that you have done for our Freedom.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Well, more than a bit geeky.<br /><br />Pretty good story that will definitely hold your attention.  The mystery concerns a typeface a code and a fictional sci-fi fantasy series. It's quite interesting how Sloan weaves this all together.<br /> Although at the end, the obviousness  of the solution is a bit disappointing.<br /><br />Worth your time.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Solid interface and cloud syncing between all my platforms is the hallmark of this product. A more robust text editor is my only real gripe.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|do not read this book in public as you will laugh out loud and people will think youre crazypants. so funny. if you love 30 rock, or tina fey in general, you'll love this book.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|My grandchild, age 4, loves it!  It was an early Christmas present, and she has already seen it several times.
B0085YNML2|5.0|For those of you that played worms games &quot;roper settings&quot; this game mixes a similar concept with a cut the rope tye of game.<br /><br />Only requires netowork permissions. The game is entertainingn, music is relaxing, and free app of the day.<br /><br />Suggest you get it. Find it difficult for someone not to like it.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This is a fun game, I truly enjoy it. Yet after you complete a few missions. You have to start using real money. And Sometimes it's very costly. If you're rich and got some money on you. This game will be much more fun. But myself, I'm tight on money. If they made the missions where you didn't have to buy things. It's okay if you have to spend like a dollar not much. But I'm in a mission and this requires me to get more than 90 gems. And I'm sure more missions will require me to spend more. This is quite a down sider. If they would make it easier to get gems and so on. that would make everything much better.
B001F12J48|1.0|This movie is distributed for regular television with blue and red paper glasses.  I am very disappointed.  I thought this was a movie I would play on my 3D player, but was disappointed to find out that it wouldn't.  If you are looking for that also, pass this one by.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|best game ever<br />you can breed<br />buy new dragons<br />feed them<br />battle them<br />you also can<br />hug new islands<br />habitats and.more
B0085YNML2|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo20AJQK8N42PR1]]Munch Time is a fun-to-play, physics based game. The goal is to navigate the chameleon to get to its lunch while collecting points (stars) in the process. Essentially the \\"chameleon\\" collects stars for points using his sticky tongue to swing through the game board from flower to flower. You've got to use your best judgement to determine when to latch onto the next flower in order to maximize your swing or momentum in order to collect as many of the stars on the screen as you can get. But you have to make sure you are in the right place so the chameleon can get to his lunch.<br /><br />I like that permissions are not excessive and you can turn the music and SFX off if desired.<br /><br />The game is appropriate for all ages. I found gameplay to be mostly smooth on my Nexus 7 although it did seem like responsiveness was a bit off once in a while.<br /><br />The game requires good reflexes and logic in order to get the best score. Plenty of levels and increasingly challenging scenarios should keep you occupied for quite a while.
030758836X|5.0|Wow, what a good writer this woman is! I haven't been sucked into a book like I was with this one for a long time. I actually read a few lines of hers aloud to people, constantly impressed by her way with words. Great book. Immediately bought all of her others. Cannot WAIT to get lost in her writing and imagination again. Thank you Ms. Flynn!

1451695195|2.0|I approach this book with great interest but concluded that what the author experienced while in a coma was far too anthropocentric and trite (sorry!) to be credible.  I'd expect a credible vision of the afterlife to be one in which all former living things partake on an equal, non-differentiated basis and one that is beyond good and evil (i.e., not so sappy). If this is what the author experience while comatose, I'm happy that it helped get him through that difficult time, but I do not believe his experience reflected the afterlife that might await humans and other living things -- at least it's not an afterlife I'd look forward to.

B007SGLZP8|1.0|This was Grisham's worst book by far.  The character is all over the place and bogged down in trivial details.  I could not wait to get to the end.  The plot could have been developed so much better.  I will think twice about reading Grisham again.

0345803485|1.0|Have readers really stooped this low?  I'm not referring to the sex, the ridiculous story line, or the juvenile viewpoint.  It's the horrible, lazy, amateurish writing that disgusts me.  If you're going to ride on the coattails of \\"Twilight,\\" then do it well. This book is to novels what bottom-of-the-barrel reality shows are to quality prime time tv.<br /><br />I don't expect a Brit to know everything about the U.S, but if you're going to write a novel set in another country and culture, do some freakin' research!  Not only does the twenty one year old female protagonist speak with BRITISH WORDS and EXPRESSIONS when she's supposed to be from Georgia, (are you KIDDING me?) but she comes across as a middle aged English frump, nothing like an American girl that age.  She has no computer, and when she gets one, she calls it \\"the mean machine.\\"  WTF?  She has no email, no phone, I kept waiting for her to put on a Walkman or finally discover MTV!  It's laughable that she gets all worked up over her guy dressed in torn faded jeans and a leather jacket, who is he, George Michael?  Earth to \\"E.L. James\\"...this isn't 1989!<br /><br />It's a shame that the readers gobbling up this series due to the promise of kinky sex don't care that a monkey could do a better writing job. A monkey would be deliciously kinkier, and a monkey would definitely use some variety in the words and phrases. \\"She bites her lip, she rolls her eyes, his eyes are steely grey, he groans through clenched teeth.\\" These phrases were repeated so often that I wanted to poke my eyes out. Our heroine also constantly exclaims \\"Jeez!\\" \\"Holy Cow!\\" and \\"Holy Moses!\\" When was the last time you heard a twenty something say any of those?  Sounds like my Uncle Earl from Nebraska!  Plus our heroine \\"flushes\\" constantly, for every reason, on nearly every page. The only flushing I want to do involves a toilet and this hideous book.<br /><br />I can't believe people are gobbling up this dreck!  HOLY MOSES I hate this book!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am not a power user of this program. It does some really cool things as far as sorting and keeping track of things like time and place. It syncs so I can use it on my desktop as well as my phone. Unfortunately I rarely take the time to actually take advantage of the various features. It's incredibly useful in spite of my laziness. I have used it to take pictures of things and to keep notes when I am out and notes for things I need to know when I am out. And if I don't name a note it will give it a place and time title.<br /><br />If I bothered to learn all the things it does and actually use them, I am sure I would love it even more.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|If you are shopping for this product then you've already decided that you need audio and video monitoring of your infant child and would like perhaps some extra features (temp, humidity) and possibly access from beyond the confines of your home...  This product cannot deliver these things.<br /><br />THIS DEVICE WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION - this is a fact.<br /><br />So, if your internet connection goes down or if the Withings servers go down - then the system will not allow you to monitor your infant child... therefore it simple fails to deliver what you need it to.<br /><br />Like other reviewers I really wanted this to be great. It looks good, it felt like an Apple product, I even bought it in the Apple store, but sadly this is a Beta product at best and the designers need to build in the sort of fail-safes which any parent knows are essential in order to have a reliable system for monitoring the health and security of your child.<br /><br />Be warned, don't be fooled by advice from sales staff that the system will continue to work on a local Wifi connection without an internet connection (e.g. Airport Express system).  It won't. When the device cannot contact the Withings servers for whatever reason beyond your control then you lose operation.<br /><br />Returned mine for a full refund and went instead for a Summer Peek Plus Internet Monitoring system which allows monitoring over standard radio signal (like the old systems) with an internet gateway for viewing from outside the home. This way the only thing that could fail would be a protracted powercut leading to the rechargeable batteries draining.

The songs on this album lack the dynamic musical talent you find on their earlier or later albums, such as Stained Class or Painkiller. The album itself seems far too contrived and comes off sounding bland to my ears. This album doesn't really showcase Judas Priest's talent.<br /><br />If you're a new listener to Judas Priest, then I would avoid starting out with this album, otherwise you might be turned off from them altogether!

0525457585|5.0|I'd have to admit - I've had never read the book until a few weeks ago and brought the book from a used bookstore. However, I did saw the movie during the mid-1980s and it always been a part of my childhood memories because I have always loved it. It wasn't until a friend's recommendation that I should read the book and I found myself reading it with such an awe. There is a saying of the modern times: \\"The book is better than the movie.\\"<br /><br />So, I finally got a chance to read this book by Ende, and I have to say, it's such an fascinating novel. I can most certainly tell the major differences between the book itself and the movie version(s).<br /><br />There are basically two journeys as portrayed in the novel: Bastian's reading Atreyu's journey by reading a book and Bastian's own journey inside the said book. There are a lot of themes in this book that can be grasped by adults, so this book is not just for children (though, it meant to bring out the child in ourselves).<br /><br />I have found it interesting to see Atreyu's journey as really about bringing Bastian into the story. It appears to be a sort of a sense of dissociation - escaping into the story (or meeting of two selves) - and then Bastian became completely involved in the story and saved the Fantastica by giving the Childlike Empress a name, which starts a new cycle of life in Fantastica. When Bastian became involved in the story, he was wearing the AURYN (medallion) that would grant him many wishes but down the road, it became clear that more wishes he wanted, the more memories he loses. And, he would lose his \\"Self\\" or his sense of identity. Atreyu and Falkor are the ones who see the problem with Bastian's continuous wishing. The more Bastian engaged in his own wishful thinking, the less \\"real\\" he becomes. And, Atreyu has led a rebellion to go against Bastian and take the medallion away from him. In the end, Bastian lost all senses of who he was but with Atreyu's help, he was able to \\"go back home.\\"<br /><br />It appears to me that Bastian and Atreyu are different aspects of each other (since they saw each other in the Magic Mirror). Atreyu never stray from his goal and knew the dangers while Bastian was continuing to wishful think, wanting to be an \\"Emperor,\\" and his wishes led to his downfall. Bastian's actions were surely selfish and in the world where his wishes were become so true and real to him.<br /><br />All in all, it's an fascinating story (and regretted that I didn't read it earlier) and this novel challenges one's imagination as regards to the fantasy world. When we are drawn to living in fantasies, we can always return to reality with fresh new eyes and new energies as simulated by these fantasies, such as fairy tales (with deep meanings to them, unlike the modern \\"stories\\"/films that achieved nothing more than entertainment).<br /><br />With much ecstatic, I would surely recommend this book to anyone, both children and adults.me.\\"<br /><br />It appears to me that Bastian and Atreyu are different aspects of each other (since they saw each other in the Magic Mirror).

1451620829|3.0|If Peter Criss had any sense, he'd be too embarrassed to tell his story. He was put in a position where he could enjoy money and fame for decades, and blew it. Could only be unhappy, and complain about everyone and everything. Talks endlessly about what jerks Gene and Paul are. Without those guys, no one would have any clue who Peter is. Then he experienced working little clubs in little towns for small change after he broke away from KISS, and KISS reunites in '96....you'd think he'd appreciate packing arenas again for big money! But he couldn't. This book was an enjoyable read for the early days of KISS and to satisfy morbid curiosity about what Peter did when he was out of KISS ; I got it from the library because I would hate to put a dime in Criss' pocket. KISS fans will enjoy this.

B009LXEBD4|5.0|Some might think it's too soon for an artist like Kelly Clarkson to have a Greatest Hits album, but just the fact that she has 14 songs that have resonated with listeners and fans around the world speaks volumes about her influence in music and the reach of her gift. Chapter one of this journey for her is definitely a reminder as to why she is considered to be one of the best out there, but also why there will be so much more to come from this songstress.<br /><br />Songs like A MOMENT LIKE THIS, SINCE YOU BEEN GONE, STRONGER and MISS INDEPENDENT became the framework for the brand she has built in the industry, and this album brings them all together along with some new music like the single CATCH MY BREATH.<br /><br />Whether you have followed her career from the American Idol days or just really getting to know her, this is going to be one of those albums you begin to play and hit the repeat button. Kelly Clarkson has not only marked her place in history but is right on time to remind us why she is one of the greatest voices on the music scene right now.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The Hunger Games became enchantingly different than most widely read popular books. Suzanne Collins broke away from the populists Twilight books by Stephanie Meyer's series of four vampire-themed fantasy romance novels, with an enigmatic post apocalyptic land named Panemli that is divided into 12 districts surrounding the Capitol. The principal characters in the story line are teens attempting to come to terms with growing into adulthood, as in most western societies by most accounts. The initial focus district is number 12, which is depicted in similarity to southern Appalachia and its coal mines. Unlike Collins romanticizing the characters in the Twilight books, Collins takes a more pragmatic approach, creating a somewhat harsh reality of what it is like growing up in abject poverty in the coalfields of West Virginia and Kentucky. The characters are believable and emotionally grounded for the most part. The central character is a 16 year old female named Katniss Everdeen who is described as a huntress as in Greek mythology, the woman named Diana. The core teen male characters are Peeta Melllark a baker's son who develops an attraction to Katniss early in the story and Gale Hawthorne Katniss' male hunting companion and best friend. The movie version of Hunger games spends little time in character development as is more highly developed in the book. Thematically Judeo-Christian themes of sacrifice and righteousness are at the movie's heart as in the in the book.<br /><br />There is a surprising absence of cinematic special effects, employed in the film version. I found that aspect of the movie disappointing and more B-movie graded. Little creativity was used in the costuming such as those worn by the tributes during the majority of the film that consisted of nylon/Gore-Tex type windbreakers and odd buckle laden leather booths. My first thought was how impractical the leather boots were given the wet rain forest type environment the filmmakers chose as a backdrop in the movie. The forest scenes reminded me of the forests in the coastal areas of the northwest around Seattle and Vancouver B.C. In reality filmed in western North Carolina.<br /><br /> The use of chariots in the film is corny as is the super high speed train that transports the characters from District 12 to the Capitol for the outset of the \\"Hunger Games\\" a pseudo gladiator styled arena type combat held outdoors using primitive weapons such as swords and spears, the most sophisticated weapon is the bow and arrows used by Katniss. Again, for modern cinema goers the special effects were sadly disappointing.<br /><br />In general, the movie mimicked the book reasonably closely in content. The imagery conjured in my own imagination from the pages was a far grander than the film. The acting was reasonable but nothing of the caliber Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen), Josh Hutchinson (Peeta Meelark) is capable of, I rate the acting above average, but nowhere near Oscar level. The role of Haymitch Abernathy, drunk and former District 12 Games winner was played ably by well-known character actor Woody Harelson. The President of Panemli was played well by seasoned screen actor Donald Sutherland. A surprise skillfully acted part as makeup artist and dresser was played by musician-actor Lenny Kratvitz. The Games host-announcer Caesar Flickerman was well acted by veteran actor Stanley Tucci.<br /><br />The Hunger Games attracted some A list actors along with upward moving Lawrence but some of the punch was diluted by the tight schedule, budget, and lacking special effects. A cadre of little known and a lot of unknowns rounded out the somewhat large cast. The stand outs in my view were Kravitz, Harrelson, and Lawrence.<br /><br />One of the major surprises was the music. Contributors were from several genres, The Civil Wars (Folk), Arcade Fire (alt. Rock) and Taylor Swift (pop-country) The Decemberists,  The Secret Sisters, Miranda Lambert featuring The Pistol Annies,  Neko Case, Kid Cudi. Academy Award winner Glen Hansard, The Low Anthem, Punch Brothers, Birdy, Maroon 5, Jayme Dee, and Carolina Chocolate Drops. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012.

B003O86FMW|3.0|I didn't think this on was NEARLY as good as the first one and that really disappointed me. When Katniss started focusing on the two men in her life and which will she  decide to choose...it lost me. I will probably not pick up the third one in the series.

B009E3EY38|5.0|I had high expectations and this did not disappoint. Even if you are just a casual Zep fan you will love this CD/DVD!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game Its very easy to play I play it almost everyday. This game is so fun u would be able to finish the whole thing in one day
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Level 1 starts out being very difficult and solving many of the clues have no relationship to the action performed.  I'm glad it was a free game.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|My son loved the Miyazaki movie of Howl's Moving Castle. I am looking forward to reading this to him when he is older a couple of years older. It's a great book.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|While watching this I was so thankful we rented it, and didn't buy it. Not that I expected much from it, the special effects were good, albeit a bit transparent at times, cheesy dialogue, and it just NEVER ENDED.<br /><br />But I learned a lesson: Will never force my hubby to watch another \\"chick flick\\" as I now understand the sheer torture he endures.
B001L5U15M|5.0|I've been hauling camera gear around for far too many decades.  I've had the luggage cases, the brief type cases, the suitcases and the backpacks.  I even have a \\"backpack\\" on wheels.<br /><br />When my son upgraded to the 9X version of this bag, he gave me his old 7X model.  He'd hauled it everywhere for two years on a daily basis and it hardly shows any wear.  I hauled it for another six months.<br /><br />However, I like to carry two camera bodies with battery grips and lenses attached in addition to two flashes, a couple of extra lenses and the myriad small accessories needed.<br /><br />I looked at a lot of two camera bags and this 10X model was the only one that'd do the job for me.  It easily holds everything I mentioned above and more.  Amazingly, it is still all easy to access.  At the worst, I have to remove a camera to reach under it to get a spare lens.  I can do that by touch very easily.<br /><br />If you've never used one of these Sling Packs, let me tell you how it works.<br /><br />The inner bag has is divided (by default) into three sections with horizontal dividers to provide a false bottom.  Think of it as looking somewhat like a tic-tac-toe board.  I put things like spare lenses and flash in the bottom with the dividers keeping them safe.  In the upper middle compartment is my Canon 430EX flash.  The other upper compartments hold two Canon Rebel XTi bodies, one with a 28-135 lens and the other with a 70-300 lens attached.  One of the bodies has the battery grip attached as well.<br /><br />There is a zippered pocket in the lid of the main bag they say is good for things like lens caps.  I keep my USB cable and iPad-to-USB adapter in there as well as my latest accessory, a velcro strap and gobo (flash bounce/light modifier.)<br /><br />The outer pocket is huge in this model as well with six inner pouches (two rows of three) with the rear row large enough to hold AA batteries, cleaning supplies, a smart phone and more.  The front row is Tamrac's mesh system with red tags.  Those are intended for holding memory cards and batteries and the tags are flipped out when the contents of the pocket is used (discharged batteries, full memory cards, etc.)  There is still so much room in the outer pocket that I can store my [[ASIN:B000KZALSG Giottos CL1001 Large Cleaning Kit with Small Rocket Blaster]] and not even dent the available space.  That Rocket Blaster is NOT all that small.<br /><br />In use, the strap goes over and rides on my left shoulder with the bag hanging on my right (I'm mostly right handed.)  I then grab the strap and bag and \\"swivel\\" it up to ride like a backpack.<br /><br />I'm 5'10\\" and a \\"big guy\\", the strap size and padding is just fine on my body.<br /><br />When I need to access something in the bag, I swivel it back down and to my front,unzip and the main compartment lid opens away from my body making it easy to reach in and grab what I need.  I can swap cameras in seconds this way though if I'm doing it a lot but not running all over, I leave the lid unzipped.  The front pocket is a little more difficult to access but nothing terrible.  When I'm done shooting, it gets zipped up, swung back around and I'm good to go with nothing banging on or getting bumped by people in the crowd.<br /><br />The construction of these bags is great! As I said, the 7X has seen at least 2.5 years of hard use and doesn't show it.  I expect the same from this 10X.  While it isn't advertised as water-proof, between the materials used and the storm flaps, I expect that it'll protect my gear in any weather I would be willing to shoot in.<br /><br />All in all I can't praise this bag enough as it is certainly the best one I've owned.  The only downside I've found (isn't there always one) is that I didn't buy this sooner.esh system with red tags.

1419705849|5.0|Very funny itvworks on lots of different levels, for both adults and kids.A must read for all different ages today
B0059XTU1S|3.0|Keeping this review as simple as possible... Not even close to being as good as The Lord of the Rings movies but good nevertheless.  Really slllloooooowwww at times.  We know it's one book being stretched in to three movies. Unfortunately this movie felt thin.  Without Gollum I don't think I'd of liked it.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Good product, Now I am able to carry my SLR & camcorder stuff in one bag, safely without any issues. I feel this is little bigger, can be reduced size little bit.
B005LAII3A|3.0|\\"Never remake a hit movie; only a flop.  Otherwise, you will always be competing with the memory of the original film.\\"<br /><br />That's a basic canon of Hollywood moviemakers that seems to be increasingly ignored these days.  Remakes of SABRINA, 3:10 TO YUMA and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL are just three relatively recent examples that prove the viability of that rule.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in the original 1990 version of TOTAL RECALL, directed by Paul Verhoeven, and which is, in this writer's opinion, one of the best science-fiction movies ever made.  (A small caveat: I am not a big fan of science-fiction movies.  There are a very few that I like.)<br /><br />Now, TOTAL RECALL has been remade, this time starring Colin Farrell with Len Wiseman directing.<br /><br />Though the original is a better film overall, this new action-thriller will certainly entertain viewers, particularly those who have not seen the 1990 film.  It does, however, make some essentially cosmetic changes to the storyline of Verhoeven picture, including combining two key characters into one.<br /><br />Set near the end of this century when most of Earth in uninhabitable, this version of the Philip K. Dick short story (\\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\\") has Farrell playing Douglas Quaid, a factory worker who visits Rekall, a company that can turn his superspy fantasies into real memories.  But, when the procedure goes terribly wrong, the line between fantasy and reality blurs.  Quaid discovers that his life is an illusion.  He becomes a man on the run; the only person alive who can save the lives of half the planet.<br /><br />Where this 2012 picture betters the original version of TOTAL RECALL is in its masterful use of CGI special effects, which were not available when the 1990 film was made.  Indeed. Wiseman and his crew have created a marvelous futuristic world that evokes and even betters memories of movies like BLADE RUNNER and MINORITY REPORT.  The action sequences are exciting and the performances from the talented cast (Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel,  Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy) are first rate.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Wiseman has allowed the action sequences and superb visual effects to overshadow story and characterization, which results in his film being less compelling than its predecessor.<br /><br />As previously stated, if you haven't seen the Schwarzenegger version of TOTAL RECALL, you will definitely enjoy this unnecessary remake much more than I did.<br /><br />Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has made TOTAL RECALL available in 3 and 2 Disc Blu-Ray/DVD combo packs, as well as a single disc DVD edition.  All three choices include extras (e.g. gag reel, \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes, etc.).<br /><br />© Michael B.

B005G5PPGS|3.0|Test<br /><br />Testing my new kindle fire book seemed fine.  Not a real review movie was awesome though and book should be the same
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|That was one heck of a bad movie. I loved the idea behind this--a child's toy coming to life--but UGH, what a disaster. The first twenty minutes was interesting and funny and then it just got worse and worse. Don't waste your $.
B002SRQ214|5.0|looking at the the price, this processor is one of the best you can find. boosted up my pc reasonably though i had few problems with my hard drive which has nothing to do with the product though.
B00849CADE|5.0|An individual's view of her native and adopted countries. Her artful description not so much of the physical country but of its psychology.
014241543X|3.0|Mia's day started like any typical day, but her world would soon be underwater. As Mia struggles to keep alive and see from her near death experiences that she has a huge decision to make. Mia can choose(basically) to either end her life or to push forward and survive this tragedy. Through this story almost everyone who means something to her comes to visit it in her hospital room. Starting with her grandparents who are the first people we hear from. She is reassured that she should stop fighting and let go, as her grandparents know that this is a tough battle.<br />Through the story I think what I really enjoyed most was how Forman uses the chapters. Each chapter is almost like a little segment of Mia's life, this helps us figure out ultimately what she should/will do in the end of the story. We learn about her best friend and also about her boyfriend Adam. In the book Adam is a key character because this influences her choice, because he is her only family left and is he worth it? Adam will do anything and everything he can just to get a teeny glimpse at Mia.<br /><br />Love Makes You Immortal<br /><br />I'd rate this book 3 stars, because I honestly didn't like the end and I probably wouldn't recommend it but hey! That's the fun in reading books :)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It is one of my favorite shows and the u.k. version looks about the same for a lot less price
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put this book down - I read it straight through in a little over 9 hours! Can't wait to read the next 2  books.
B000FC13UE|5.0|This was a really fun little collection of short stories and poetry.  I'm not a huge fan of poetry, but if I'm forced to read it, then I will take Neil's poetry over any one else's.  I'm not going to pick and choose which stories were good and which ones were grand, but I will say that there is a little something here for everyone.  BEWARE however, for those that have read many Gaiman novels, many of these shorts include themes not included in his longer novels, namely sexual intercourse.  There are a few of these that are pretty sexually explicit, which is a change from the typical Neil Gaiman stories.  I can't really say anything bad about this collection, and really enjoyed it, and I look forward to reading more Neil Gaiman shorts.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|looks ok but does not work sometimes for some unknown reason.seems not to fit very well. that is the last of my review
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is fast paced from the start and easy:) be careful of using real money though. during the game if you get low on virtual money, DONT BUY THINGS. it will automatically charge you IF you decide to buy a pack. other wise, quite easy to get acorns and coins, EVEN on the kindle fire:)
B002SSUQFG|5.0|The best watch that I ever owned! It is light weight, don't even know you have it on!!!<br />Would recommend this highly!!!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I was kind of embrassed being a 52 year old man to buy an Adele album,  But her voice is incredible and this is a great album.
B004EI2NM2|5.0|The may be the sexiest film I have ever seen. It is not at all pornographic though. A heterosexual will hardly notice that the two partners are both women - it doesn't matter one way or the other - just two people in mad love.
0812984412|5.0|Had read previous reviews of both the book and movie and found the book to be as wonderful as described
B009O07NDY|2.0|Pretty bad compared to the original trilogy. No real themes explored or memorable tracks. No great slow instrumental \\"fantasy\\" tracks as we had in the original trilogy.<br /><br />The best parts of this score are when Shore re-uses themes from the Lord of the Rings soundtracks.<br /><br />This is a poor effort. Just a bunch of loud instruments making noise without any sort of purpose.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy is a great ADULT ONLY work of fiction based on true reality that will introduce you to alternative lifestyles/relationships.  Books are well constructed paperbacks and shipping was satisfactory.
