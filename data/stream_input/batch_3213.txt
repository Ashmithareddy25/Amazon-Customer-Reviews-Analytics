B000JMLFLW|3.0|Just finished reading this.  I only \\"bought\\" because it was part of the free titles available for Kindle (mostly due to copyright being way expired?).  Don't understand why there's such a fuss about this book and why many people were required to read it in high school or college.  Don't get me wrong, I love Jane Austen.  I just don't find this to be her best work.  I would much rather read Persuasion (my personal favorite), Sense and Sensibility, Emma or Northanger Abbey.  I believe with this title (both owning and reading) I have all of Jane Austen's works.
B00DP7UJMY|4.0|Just when I thought I was great at logic puzzles this book comes and makes me turn my brain on and think! The puzzles are mostly decent and varied in theme so there is enough content to appeal to a wide audience. I am enjoying doing the puzzles with my 13 year old daughter. My criticisms are with the kindle book having insufficient effort being put into its production. 1) each puzzle should have a link to its solution. You need to return to the content page and manually navigate to the answers then page until you find the solution. Hopefully you dont accidentally read the answer to the next puzzle. 2) puzzles are barebones. They need more illustration. 3) Hints should be included so you dont resort to the answer too quickly. 4) the solutions need more explanation and illustration. I think the author has been writing these books so long he has forgotten that the joy in puzzles lies in the journey not the answer. Nonetheless the book is going to give you days of enjoyment.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the free sample for the first book the morning that I was going to see The Hunger Games movie.  I read through it so quickly and enjoyed, then enjoyed the movie, I immediately purchased this trilogy.  Pretty engrossing, well-written and at least the first movie was pretty true to the first book.  One should (must?) read the whole trilogy, but the first book is a little like capturing lightning in a bottle.  The rest of the trilogy is very good, but the first book was exceptional.
1451673442|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK - REMINDS ME EVERY DAY TO BE GRATEFUL - LOOK AT THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THINGS - AND LIFE - ! STILL READING IT
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|When I downloaded this game I thought it was going to be fun. But I was so wrong. This thing doesn't load, it's slow, I can't even finish a game with out it saying I took too long to play or my time is up. Don't . Get this app!!
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|I watched this on the advice of a friend and was glad that i took their advice. This movie really helped me to open up and welcome life in general; I really have been focusing on being more aware of not only my surroundings but myself. a great movie if you are searching for something more.
B00D6QUJ6U|5.0|I love this concert, so much so that I had to have it on bluray. You are in for a real treat. The Bee Gees are phenomenal and this concert is a true example of this. You will be dancing or moving the whole time. I love it. I own approximately 30 concerts on dvd and this would be part of my top 10.....want a number #1 you have to see Earth Wind and Fire with Chicago.......fricken amazing!!!
1416550550|5.0|Very good service for a very good book.  The book came in plenty of time, so I was able to finish it in time for my book club.  The club gave The Forgotten Garden high reviews.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I had a hard time getting absorbed into the story at first but eventually I was there and didn't want to leave. The characters are rich and wonderfully developed. I recommend this to anyone. Young or old. It needs to be read. Also consider the audible version, excellent narration!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so so so good. The beginning made me laugh, and it made me feel like I knew Augustus and Hazel. I am going to read this book over and over again. I love it. If you are into romances and comedy, this book is fabulous. I can't believe Augustus died, and all I can say is my God Why. I wonder if John Green was sad when he killed Augustus or laughed and had tea with Satan.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Great movie.  In my opinion much better than walking dead in terms of zombie flicks.  Anxious for the sequel to come out.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Kick ass game. Lots of fun so far. Hope it only gets better as the game goes on but i have no doubt it will. Try it out, think you'll enjoy it.
B003IWRE3I|4.0|This is a good film.  The story is good.<br /><br />I stopped watching this film after the father and son were hiding trapped in the country house taken over by cannibals. It wasn't the suspense, or the revolting idea of human being eating other human beings to avoid starving, it was a combination of both.  I didn't want to see any more.<br /><br />My first reaction to the film was that the basic premise of the story was flawed.  Although some human beings survived some massive undefined catastrophe, there is no plant or animal life left to support them. The idea that human beings can outlast all plant and animal life on this planet is not exactly logical.<br /><br />There is no indication of what went wrong.  I guess that was supposed to be irrelevant, but when you think about it, it's not. I suppose that with no explanation of what went wrong, the premise of the movie is easier to accept.<br /><br />For whatever reason, about two or three weeks later, I decided to pick up where I left off.  All I can say is that I enjoyed the rest of the film and will say that it's worth watching.  This is a film with a very spiritual message.  Even though it frames a rather bleak picture, it's a pleasant break from a lot of the mindless garbage cranked out by the film industry.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  It is a easy captivating read. The fever dreams were interesting.  Had to go to a youtube video to hear Jeff Bezos famous laugh.
B0037471TE|1.0|I bought this as I love the bourne movies. Most of the time the movie does not stand up to the book. This is not the case. The movie is so much better. The book is confusing and is so hard to read it is not a page turner.
0316017930|5.0|This is a book you will not forget.  I have told so many people to read it. Drive, commitment, and luck.
B008602KQI|5.0|Immediately engaging with thought provoking effect that lingers.  The character who created the most interest throughout was Peeta - in the book and the movie, but the story and characters are well-developed. The idea of a central government that uses its people badly is an old historical reality that always needs a new expression and a new audience.  The stark contrast of people who waste to the point of disgust beside the poor districts where people are starving is an excellent tool for raising awareness in young people when they become aware of local and world politics.The costuming was a bit of comic relief and was also effective is showing the difference in quality and talent versus the fast-paced wanna be world.  Overall, this is a great blend of intrigue and social commentary.
075669812X|5.0|My son loves this book and has looked at it until the covers are beginning to come off! He has memorized all of the characters and really enjoys both the pictures and the commentary in this book. If your son loves Ninjago, this is a great gift.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Great movie. Slow beginning but very engaging. Good science fiction. Would recommend to anyone that likes science fiction ..  :o)
B002S0OBMS|5.0|I love the show!!! and was excited to get the CD, not to mention 3 weeks early efore Christmas- although I wish they had a video version of the London production and a CD of the Australian production, I'm happy with the purchase!! &#60;3 Ramin
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There is not much to say about this Trilogy!  I couldn't wait to read the next book.  Now I'm waiting for the movie!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|For any Phan who also has an open mind this production was wonderful!!! I personally think that if the London production had all the bells and whistles that the Australian production had- it would have had much better reviews... and for everyone who says that PTO doesn't need a sequel, I have to say (after seeing this multiple times) I have to say that this seems more like fanfic than a sequel- and that's coming from someone who boycotted LND for years!!! Believe me: watch it once and you'll be hooked!!!
0452295548|5.0|Great addition to my life. It came as expected and was the quality I wanted .I would definitely buy again
0316055433|4.0|This book would have been better with the services of a capable editor.  While at times it was completely captivating, at other times it was totally frustrating.  From plot elements that went nowhere (think of Welty's exhortation to Theo that he warn Hobie) and to spelling inconsistencies (Popchik vs. Popchyk), the writing needed some polishing.
B000E6EH1S|5.0|Great addition to my life. It came as expected and was the quality I wanted .I would definitely buy again
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is a magnificent story, told in a beautiful haunting way by its narrator, &#34;Death.&#34; A message about love and life and forgiveness, all for the ages.
B0091W7K6K|5.0|My husband had tried to find this movie for some time. We went to search on Roku and there it was. The color was great and we had no problems watching it from beginning to end. We  enjoyed it a great deal. Glad to find that your company has a great many back in the day movies.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the first book, this one was fantastic. The story moves along so quickly that you soon find yourself at the end, eagerly wanting yo start the next title.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|lots of fun for kds and adults. downloaded it for my nephews but my fiance and i love to play this just as much
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another really good read by John Grisham!  Even though the story is definitely fiction,  The Racketeer was an enjoyable read.

B00EEPFLHE|5.0|The Quintessential Stryper! The best music since To Hell With The Devil and back to their core sound.  Michael's voice is as good as ever!  Show's ya what clean living can do!
1603427244|5.0|Just what I needed to help with cast ons and bind offs. I have a tendacity to bind off too tightly and its the pits when I finish a sweater and the person for whom it was made can't get it over their head! It will come in very handy.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Great story with strong character development and passionate writing.  Extremely good read that I would recommend to anyone age 13 and older.
B0087FMUCQ|2.0|I could not get it to download to my phone,galaxy s3, so what more can i tell you about it.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Awesome story!  The theme is more mature but not filthy by any means.  The concept and writing style is gripping.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The characters are intriguing.  The story is mildly interesting.  The writing could have been better.  The title is very captivating.  It is a very sexually appealing story.  No masterpiece, but okay to pass time with.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It was pretty good and a lot different from what I had been reading.  I would recommend it for mature teenage readers and any adult, male or female.
B00DXLO0D6|5.0|I dream of Jeannie was made when tv was worth watching. As the reviews/complaints say, all the discs are stacked on top of each other, with no divider. This has not posed a problem for me. I'm watching a few episodes every night before I go to bed, they're a perfect set, & I'm Loving it.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|great game. im kinda obesessed nownits bad. but its really fun. but I ran ot of tokens really fast so I have to wait to get more. butother than that the game is totally worth it!!:)
B00G5G7EXY|3.0|This new computer animated movie does an unsurpassable job at creating beautiful winter visuals.  The story, based on \\"The Snow Queen\\", is fairly well developed.  For some reason, though, it felt significantly weaker to me in its emotional impact than earlier Disney movies like Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin.  I think the reason is because the script is cheesier and has a way of making some of its serious plot developments feel too casual and silly.  What cheapens the script most is the cheap, awkward, slightly silly characterization of the heroine, the kind of persona that made Anne Hathaway's early screen image, and the snowman sidekick was even more obnoxious to me.  His rather effeminate and abnormally goofy reactions were the movie's attempt at comedy, and all of it fell flat for me.  Additionally, the music is lackluster, built upon pop/rock style and on a clichéd form of the Beauty and the Beast/Little Mermaid Disney musical style.  I recognize, being very musical myself, that writing music which carries great power is very hard to do, but my main criticism of the music on this movie is that the songs don't seem to elevate the experience beyond what words alone could do.  In other words, I don't find the musical format to improve the movie; it would be the same if it had no songs, in my opinion.  The pop/rock style in some of the songs doesn't fit a fairy tale at all, either, which I found annoying.  In sum, the movie offers an amazing visual experience with how it depicts winter and the Snow Queen's special effects, but for me, was annoyingly cheesy and not a special experience.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is a useful, though somewhat limited, device for casting multimedia directly from your computer or android device. In the box is the actual Chromecast, a USB to micro USB cable and a power plug.<br />The Chrome cast plugs into a free HDMI port in the back of your TV. It needs power so it can either be plugged into a USB cable in the back of the TV, or you can plug the included USB cord into the power plug (included) into a wall outlet.<br /><br />Installation is easy. You simply plug the Chromecast into your TV, turn your TV to the required HDTI outlet and the Chromecast prompts you through installation.  In less than 5 minutes i was casting things from my PC and tablet to the device.<br /><br />Anything that casts content to the chromecast must be on the same WIFI connection as the Chromecast.<br /><br />Casting from PC requires you to have Google Chrome installed and the Chromecast Extension activated on the browser. Casting from your Android phone or tablet requires you to install the Chromecast app. All of which are free and easy to install.<br /><br />Right now the primary apps that can cast from your Android device to the chromecast include Netflix, HBO GO, Hulu Plus, Youtube, and Pandora. Those apps have a cast icon in them when they are open, so when you want to cast to the Chromecast, you just push the button and you are off and running.<br /><br />You can cast  anything from your computer's broswer. So if you happen to have Amazon Prime streaming, you can stream from your PC and then cast to your Chromecast.<br /><br />Also, though the Chromecast does not have native ability to view videos from your PC, since the Chrome browser can natively play videos in it, you can simply drag your videos to the browser or open them as files. Since they'll play in the browser, and you can cast from the browser to the Chromecast, you can then view videos and content from your PC on the Chromecast.<br /><br />This also means that you can use your TV as a large screen for browsing the web, viewing content from websites like Prezi and Google Docs.<br /><br />The Google Chrome app for android devices does not currently support casting, but I hear that is coming.<br /><br />There is also no native app for the Kindle Fire, but there may be a work around, and when I get time i'll try that out and post my results then.<br /><br />I like this Chromecast so much that I am going to cancel my Xbox Live Gold subscription as most of the multimedia content I use that for is available through Chromecast.ge screen for browsing the web, viewing content from websites like Prezi and Google Docs.<br /><br />The Google Chrome app for android devices does not currently support casting, but I hear that is coming.<br /><br />There is also no native app for the Kindle Fire, but there may be a work around, and when I get time i'll try that out and post my results then.<br /><br />I like this Chromecast so much that I am going to cancel my Xbox Live Gold subscription as most of the multimedia content I use that for is available through Chromecast.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was apprehensive about the Candy Crush game at first as I thought it may be geared too much for kids; little did I know how addictive this mind bender could be. This is perfect to pass time away on plane, subway, or doctors office, anywhere I need to be entertained while I'm waiting. Awesome graphics too and no ads to contend with which is an added bonus on any free game.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|this is; in my opinion, the best angry birds in the series. the different gravitational pulls from the different planets makes it a lot of fun.
B00GIGGS6A|4.0|12/16/13 - Updated Review<br /><br />After a few email exchanges with Huion Customer service, my H610 pro now works flawlessly with all Adobe Creative Suite (CC) programs. Im still going to give this Drawing Tablet 4/5 Stars. The only nagging issue is the drivers. But once Huion helped me through driver issue the tablet works flawlessly. I would definitely recommend this Tablet for those shopping on a budget. Hardware on this device is comparable to Waacom. I believe that what your paying for when purchasing a Waacom is the drivers and support.<br /><br />*Issue with 3rd Party Mouse* If you have any issues with the tablet conflicting with a third party mouse, all you have to do is unplug both devices and plug in the tablet first. My mouse and tablet worked in perfect harmony after that.<br /><br />12/9/13 - Updated review<br /><br />Huion Customer Service - Im thoroughly surprised at how fast Huions customer service responds. I wrote them on over the weekend about my driver issues and they responded that same day. They were helpful, and fixed the issue really fast. *For Mac Users* Download Drivers from [...] NOT huion-tablet.com.<br /><br />H610 - Construction - The pen on this drawing tablet is really comfortable in your hand. The buttons on the pen clicks and work great. I feel like the tablet itself is on par quality wise as my old intuos 2 and vistablet original. The hotkeys are awesome! They are really east to setup.<br /><br />H610 - Drivers - This was my BIGGEST issue with the h610. My H610 pro didn't come with an driver CD. So I went to their website, and the link to drivers were corrupt. I contacted Customer Service and they responded quickly (See above). Once I got the correct drivers installed the tablet worked great in photoshop CC and artrage. Adobe Illustrator on the other hand, the pressure settings didnt work with the drivers. Im currently in contact with Huion about this issue. Another negative about the hotkeys. You can only set the hotkeys to oneprogram. I know the new intuos can program hotkeys for individual programs. Another issue is that my mouse doesn't work when my tablet is plugged in.<br /><br />Overview<br /><br />Pros:<br />1 - Great Price<br />2 - Good construction<br />3 - Good costumer service<br /><br />Cons:<br />1 - Bad Drivers<br />2 - Conflicts with 3rd party mouse<br /><br />Once Huion updates the drivers, I think this tablet would compete really well against any waacom tablet.<br /><br />*Original Review*<br />I'm writing this solely about the ordering experience and the physical product. It did not come with an installation CD.  So I went to the Huion-Tablet.com site to try and download the drivers for my mac, and the zip file was corrupt, so I can't test the actually tablets functionality yet.<br /><br />I received the tablet really fast(received 7 days after ordering, with standard shipping). I opened it today, the packaging was nice, the graphics on the packaging are decent. The tablet itself has a great design, and it is really light. The Pen is a good size and I can hold it comfortably in my hand. A different user posted about the keys not functioning correctly, and sticking, but mine seem to work perfectly fine. Over all the aesthetics of the H610 Pro I give 9/10. Hopefully it functions just as well, when I get the correct drivers.<br /><br />Ill revise the review once I get a functioning driver set from Huion. Hopefully it is soon.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|This series has great characters and interesting plots.  While it helps to have watched other episodes and years, it is also understandable and enjoyable each &#34;week&#34; as a stand alone.

B004KKX80A|5.0|As described my kid loves it he already wore one out he played with it so much so I replaced it with this one. A word of advice check the reviews on the seller closely when buying I ordered from another seller and was sent a counterfeit one, so I reordered here and got the real deal.  Fast shipping
B005K0HDGE|3.0|It's time travel, and I love time travel.  It's a love story bridging two disparate eras.  I wanted to like that facet of the story and for a while I did.  I turned the pages hurriedly to read what I knew must be there.  Sometimes it was, and somehow I let that carry me through the depressing poverty of Oswald's existence.  The misery and the cruel abuse, it was in such sharp focus I needed the love story to be smooth and perfect.  I was in for a stomach-churning disappointment.<br /><br />It's a long book and the end seemed hurried.  Also, I'm a techno-geek and I need mechanical clarity when a universe is altered.  I was disappointed again.  I didn't find out how, why or by whom the mechanism was tuned to behave the way it did but the book is good enough for me to still be wanting to know.  It's easy to see how the story could carry a sequel.<br /><br />One thing for certain.  It's not a story I'll forget.<br /><br />Rob Benham  Author of The Perfect Code.
1843440717|5.0|I love the edition of this novel as much as I love Pride and Prejudice. My friend is going to love it!
B001VTTRC6|5.0|Often you feel let down when you watch a movie based on a novel. Not here. The writing and the actors so draw you in to this group of friends and the culture they live by that  you can't stop watching even though you know what's coming
B001NLCBJI|5.0|Brilliant film that proves storytelling doesn't have to follow traditional and often overused structures.  This film is like taking a long walk through a beautiful city with no direct objective, except to just live in the moment and bask in serenity.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It is so cute and it teaches kids how to listen to directions. It is a friendly version of teenage games.
B00CVDXAAG|5.0|Good book. Prompt service. Based on the TV show castle that I literally watch everyday. Keep more Castle coming. Good service.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is beyond the word great. I have been waking forever to get this game and please believe it when I say they did not disappoint. This game deserves 5 stars and nothing less. I recommend this game to everybody who look fighting and action games, if you do then this game is for you
0440246016|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Child does a good job of setting up suspense. There's a nice scene where Reacher uses keen hearing to get out of trouble. Another good technique is with the narrative following different strands. I thought there were a few too many details about them eating and doing little stuff, but I suppose that contributes to a sense of pacing. I like Reacher himself. There's a nice quirk about his never having luggage.  Best quote: “The more we know, the luckier we get.”
B008EKMB82|5.0|So original, such a cool way to teach Zen principles, so much compassion I felt for the characters. I loved this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT DOWN.  WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT I DID NOT WANT TO READ IT THINKING THERE WOULD BE TOO MUCH GORE.  AFTER SEEING THE 2nd movie and not  understanding a lot of things I decided I needed to read the book.
B00G3HSF7O|2.0|I really wanted to like this film being a fan of Matt Damon but the premise is just ridiculous. I mean do you really expect us to believe that the billions on Earth are incapable of producing science and technology to compete with a few thousand &#34;elites&#34; on a space station?
B008Y7J91M|5.0|I rated it 5 stars because I like it and watch it over and over.  It stays fairly true to the book.  Mrs. Norris is obnoxious and Mary and Henry Crawford are played superbly as are Fanny and Edwin.  The settings fascinate me, particularly the Portsmouth scenes.  It is entertaining and things turn out right in the end.
B000002KDO|5.0|Great gift for my brother. He couldn't find this cd so I ordered it for him. He loves Black Sabbath.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the funniest movies of all time.  This is a annual event in my house.  Sure it's on TV, but having the DVD is so much better.
B002GMNLKQ|5.0|I love everything they do - this is awesome music, they are excellent musicians and songwriters-I never get tired of this,especially the last song Weighed down with Sorrow
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This album is perfection. Each song is very unique, and listening to the album as a whole is a crazy, fun, passionate and exciting experience. Definitely buy this album if you like dance music that makes you feel good!
B00A7W29BE|4.0|This app enables me to snap a pic of a document quickly, convert it to a PDF, and add it to DropBox or email it out within minutes. Great for Dr.'s excuse from school, legal papers to be signed when you don't have a fax, and probably plenty of other reasons we haven't required yet.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|The movie is just fine....what they are promoting as &#34;digital copy&#34; utilizing UltraViolet is horrible.  You have to join two different websites, then install their app on your device to play the movie.  I'll stick with iTunes HD if this is the path the industry is taking.  What a pain...
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Favorite family viewing, what more can I say? We dropped the BBC America channel & had to catch up on the show. Thanks Amazon for making it available so soon!
B0055SWM08|1.0|Kind of fun, but after completing many levels the game locked up and after rebooting the device, all my progress was lost!! Why bother starting over with the fear of losing progress again? Replaying lvls isn't fun so not going to waste any more time. Fix this showstopper!
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Jeff Bridges acting was atrocious. He overdid his character to a point of irritation for the viewer. He sounded as though he had a wad of chew in his mouth. I think Sam Elliot would have been a better choice for this role. Maybe a more serious slant to the plot rather than a comedic bent.The characters were too cartoonish especially the bad guys. They could have been more scary.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|New to game but quite easy to grasp and fun. The color is asy on the eyes , music not bad
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Movie went nowhere. I think it was a poor excuse for an Armagedon type flick. Brad's choice of recent scripts is puzzling.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game reminds me of the city game I played on Facebook a while back. It has some similar features.
B00EEL0LGY|5.0|So far I love this freakin thing!. So cool. No problems yet on the Kindle Fire HD. Great game! Thank you to whoever made it 'free app of the day'.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This moves comes from the old tv show dark shadows it's funny to me because of what they say and do.
B00902AKK4|4.0|Fun little game. I haven't given it much of a go, but from what I have played it's a fun time killer. Playing on the Kindle Fire HD with no problems.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love this movie. This movie is a love/action movie. This movie is about a black ops CIA agent who is retired and they label him as red (retired extremely dangerous). He is just trying to live his life and is in love with this girl who works at a call place. They try their best to kill him and try to take the girl he likes to trap him. He gets help from old friends who are also extremely dangerous.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|It might be fun if you could actually hear it. It has no sound. Everything else on my king has sound. I wouldn't download it, there are much better app's out there.
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|This is a crazy movie everything in it just makes your jaw drop. Must get if you like messed up movies and don't get offended. The end of it did make me cry it was sad and yet heart warming but that's just the end the rest is just crazy and shocking
0385523386|3.0|Originally posted on The Canon! {[...]<br /><br />I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I opened this book. I had heard about the Netflix original show from one of my fellow interns this past summer, and I had seen it recommended on Instant Queue. I was a little apprehensive due to what I had heard happens in prisons...<br /><br />Orange is the New Black was completely unexpected.<br /><br />Right away, I identified with Kerman's character. She could be anyone - literally. She has the personality traits of my co-workers, my friends, my family. She is the typical everyday girl who got a bit of wanderlust after college and fell in with some bad people. In the first few chapters of the book, I admired her frankness and candor when it came to this particular topic. Piper left nothing uncovered, and in this, she endeared herself to me.<br /><br />The memoir itself is written wonderfully. Kerman writes well, with a honest thoughtfulness to her narration that makes the story come to life. The day-by-day interactions with the other inmates was thrilling to read, and her summaries about daily life in the prison - like the cafeteria food, her job hunt, the struggle to earn a GED - made the narration all the more vivid.<br /><br />I admire her way with characterization the most. Each inmate that Kerman interacts with in her memoir makes an impression, and even if she is never seen again in the book, these women stay with you. I was surprised by the overwhelming kindness shown among the inmates, and the memory of each of them makes Kerman's descriptions come to life.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: By the end of the memoir, I've come to the conclusion that Kerman was and is in a very unique position. By the end of her time, Kerman knows she has a safe place to land and a fiancee and family who love her. Not all of the women in the prison had the same. Kerman is in the position to tell her tale and those of the women she knew. It is a unique and interesting memoir, one that sticks in the mind.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Love the show it is very interesting and it threw in twist and turns and could not figure out what was going to happen next. It's about a gosht house.
B00GOZQ2E8|4.0|Addictive fun. Got me hooked as soon as I started playing. Defy anyone not to get hooked also once you get into it
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Full of action! The cast is great and the storyline honors the best Bond movies. Enjoyed every minute. Great movie,
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|not bad. little slow.. fun game.wish wars were a little more realistic. will give you hour of fun. need a better way to earn stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it! I was glad to see it come to Kindle so I could play it there and not just on my PC.
B00915G6MG|5.0|The case is in great shape and all of the discs stayed where they belong. which is something I have had trouble with in the past. Not this time, they are in perfect condition, no scratches at all.
B0000025BL|5.0|I love this album.  Always have.  Good music that tells a story.  I think this is Meatloafs best album ever.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This movie was fantastic! Jennifer Lawrence's performance really warranted that Oscar win...and even though I loved &#34;Lincoln&#34; and Daniel Day Lewis's performance was superb, after seeing Silver Linings I was really disappointed that Bradley Cooper didn't win instead. Phenomenal performance!!! The academy owes him for this one. If you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend!!! HIGHLY!!!
B009I0QTF8|4.0|There are one or two tunes on here that I feel are absolutely essential, and very visionary and individually deserve 5 stars. Much of the rest is interesting, quintessential Flying Lotus, but only 4 stars overall because of the semi-fruitful nature of all the experiments. Good to help chill and derail typical musical formats and mindsets. Loaded with interesting sounds and beat structures.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have enjoyed this series more than many others.  It's incredible how S.Collins paints her portraits with words.  It is trully beautiful!!
B00CEF014E|5.0|Action-packed and intriguing story. Stevenson creates a tense atmosphere in his narrative that never lets up. The twists and turns in Solstice will keep you guessing right up until the end. The fine line between reality and insanity is stretched to the limit as our protagonist, Dana Barnes, battles her inner demons and external foes bent on a hideous plot. Well-researched and compelling, Solstice is a disturbing thriller to the end.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Donna at her best.  Great compilation of her tried and true classics.  Recommend it to anyone loving this disco sound.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|a great read, truly a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that loves to read
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Very good music, but nothing more than was on the TV.  Waiting to see what they come up with next.
0143123173|5.0|Can't go wrong with Walt. Fun reading... Walt always gets his man and does it with style. Ready for the next adventure.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Have always loved Stevie, and in the past was disappointed with some of his other albums.  Not this one.  True Stevie.
B00GIZO674|5.0|I've enjoyed this game on PC for years, and I am so happy it is available for Kindle! The game is easy to learn and the levels increase in difficulty at a good pace. I don't feel like it is too hard or too easy, and it is enjoyable to people of all ages. Good graphics and controls really make this game worth purchasing.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|fun for what is is. gets a little repetitive. I like the power up and its cute you can knock out other minions. better that temple doom because of different worlds
B000301YY8|5.0|Love this CD! James Blunt is AWESOME! The price beat any I found around town in record stores or at Walmart!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|did a better job this time not so many ads And the graphics are alot better on this Version<br /> thank u for good game
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book kept me guessing til the end.  I thought there would be a different twist,however the twist taken was brilliant.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My twelve year old loves this series.  He is reading through them so fast we cant keep up.  Highly Recommend
B008PZ69T8|1.0|My mistake for not reading better... I thought is was the DVD of the book, not the music! Not a fan of Classical Music.
B004S5C8WG|4.0|Well thought out story line and well told. The author keeps track of his story and as usual rarely writes something that contradicts or doesn't line up with the earlier story.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I love the original version, but the extended version is a must for any Tolkien fan. I don't often get excited for movies and this is easily the best movie I have seen in a long while.
B0031R5K68|3.0|As with other Dan Brown books the story line gets a bit flimsy and you are suppose to believe some statements as if based on facts when they clearly aren't, however still an interesting read.
B00FRQ32N4|2.0|Good graphics and a fun game, but you can't play enough or win enough to progress without paying REAL money to &#34;upgrade&#34; your robot. Very crafty.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|My son fell in love with this movie I had to get it because he kept asking to watch it on my computer.<br />I fell in love with it too. saw it all day for 4 days straight. This movie gives kids a sense of history In a fun way.<br />I like the whole caveman concept and the earth changing while their trying to stay alive. Its one of my new personal<br />favorites.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|as always kay scarpetta does not disappoint! I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books and I am  true fan.
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|The cutest movie! I been wanting to buy this movie for my two year old and finally found it at a affordable price. I just love the singing and tap dancing. Entertaining for a family night staying in.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love to play this...from 4 year old.  He likes the minion being despicable. He also likes the fluffy unicorn part.
B007R21JJK|5.0|Have been using this in my gaming PC build for the past eight months or so. It's a great board. I love that it has an ample amount of USB 3.0 ports. I have found that it resisted a short I had as well. I forgot to use a standoff in one location so it shorted against the case. Thankfully everything turned out fine.<br /><br />My current configuration as of this posting:<br />(this board)<br />Intel 3330 @ 3 GHz<br />16 GB RAM<br />EVGA GTX 760<br />2x Seagate 1TB 7200 rpm storage drives<br />Intel 530 180GB SSD for OS<br />LG DVDRW Drive<br />Asus Essence STX Soundcard<br />NZXT Phantom Case (in green)<br />Seasonic 80+ Gold 650w PSU
B00FGM0IEU|4.0|Great history of the music industry.  Wonderful for anyone who loves insights into this interesting recording studios and the bands and persons behind it all.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|Great book.  It's amazing how close we have come since ww2 to all out nuclear war and accidental detonation.  Also how many times nuclear weapons use was suggested during our conflicts.  Chilling!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Love Nicholas Sparks books, and this one was no exception!  You just never know how his stories are going to end.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I like time travel books and as a JFK assassination buff, this one hit the mark twice. Great read and great new twist on the Butterfly Effect.
B00BATG18K|1.0|This one just doesn't draw me in. It feels very forced, superficial, and redundant. Forced myself through the whole thing just to see if there were any surprises. There weren't. Don't waste your money unless you like cheap romance novels.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|I love Stephenie Meyer, the Twilight Saga books and movies! I couldn't wait to get this box set to see and experience all the features created. This is the Ultimate Fan Box Set. I have enjoyed it very much! Every Twilight Fan should get this when you are able to, you will completely enjoy it! I am Team Twilight Forever!!
0753827662|5.0|this was a good choice for the person on my gift list as this is New York Times Best seller
B005HEVBGG|5.0|LOVE Star Trek, in all of its forms! It's been really enjoyable to go back and watch all the shows from this season. I love Sci-Fi, and always have, and this is a good way for me to get caught up on one of my favorite shows.
0307341577|5.0|good story for mystery lovers or anyone that reads suspense or enjoys thrillers by this wonderful author I highly recommend this book
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|I liked the game a lot - it was fun and entertaining with good graphics and characters. I just wish that the game was longer - I was able to beat it in one sitting so now I need to find another one!
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|My kids love it and as an adult I love it as well. What could be cuter than squishing clay monsters to save Clay Jam? I love it and recommend it to anyone.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|When I went to play my Dragonville this morning everything's gone. It all was wiped away. Even the stuff I paid for.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Good game all and all worth the download time and space required for installation. Other then the energy wait time amazing game
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|love Columbo. Brings back the Friday nights that had the mystery shows.<br />Still love Columbo, He used good old fashioned police work.<br />Plus, it has two TV movies! How great!
B00FATEJYE|4.0|I was not sure what to expect from this game because it was few but I was very happy with what I got and love this game.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|Excellent summary with a guide for successful weight loss. Clear, concise complete with how-to's and recipes. Diet works pretty well if you can stand the boredom.
B004XISI4A|2.0|tv show ok , but names and wanderings in a book are tiresome., little other revelations about characters and the like that one expects from a book.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Realistic, gritty, acting makes viewers wanting more! Scenery, music, and props all add to this series. Kurt Sutter leaves nothing out.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I used this app for a year on my kindle fire hd now I have the hdx and it won't let me log in
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love it super smooth no glitches.....yet<br /> I love unoooooo this is def a must have on it phone,tablet etc
B000I9TY4G|4.0|Fun with Adventure and excitement To! Most will like! One of those Old movies that slips past you, and your not sure why!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Best tower defense game ever.  I love the fact that you can pick a hero and take them into battle (remind me of Warcraft III).  There are 4 different type of tower, each where you can upgrade them and pick which 4th tower you want making 8 different tower total.  Only the 4th upgrade tower has special ability which is awesome.  The special ability can be like summon golem, turn enemy to sleep, heal your ally, and so on.  The only problem I have with this game is that it only come with 3 free heroes.  The rest you have to paid for it and they are expensive.  Most of them cost more than the game itself.  I wanted to try out the new heroes badly too but not for that price.  Overall I am happy with the game and it is quite a challenge.
B000P407K4|5.0|At first I wasn't planning on getting this movie, but then my dumb friend clicked the 1-click purchase button. At first I was furious that my friend made me pay 11 dollars for a movie I didn't want. But after I watched the movie I realized it was totally worth it. This movie is hilarious. It just has a kind of humor you don't find in movies anymore.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|One of the best tower defense game ever.  I love the first one (kingdom Rush), so I got this one and it is a great purchase.  It is exactly like the first one expected that all of the tower now have a new 4th tower which is a little different with different special ability.  The hero are all new and they made a huge improvement on the hero system.  You can now level up your hero now and it will stay at that level and you get to pick which special ability you want to try out first which is sort of like a RPG.  The heroes all have 5 special ability and you can upgrade the special ability too.  There are some new enemy and boss too so you need to plan out your defense in a new different way now (For example, you need the new 4th archer tower cause it has the special ability that prevent enemy from casting spell).<br /><br />The only down side I would say is that it only come with 3 free heroes, the rest you have to paid to get them and most of them are expensive (most of them cost ranging from $3, $5, and even $7).  Also like the first one, there are only 21 different stage/map.  But overall if you like the first one, you will probably like this one too.
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|I love how the game plays and how its a city builder but adventure at same time. I love games like this I hope it updates and all that fun stuff
B00006IU73|5.0|This band is great and the music is just outstanding, with great vocals and guitar strokes and other instruments. This is another band I had never heard until I listened to Pandora and have ordered a second CD and will buy more from this great band. This band from the U.K keeps you asking for more!! And it was delivered ahead of schedule by Amazon as always.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|States what it is exactly and it was new in plastic wrap and for a good price. Very happy :)
B00C7EGV5U|5.0|Well written and very interesting story of an African tribe before and after the white man comes with his law and religion. It's written in a readable and flowing way with real characters.
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|Exactly as it states and is brand new in plastic wrap still and at a gr8 price I am happy with it
1400052181|4.0|The book was very informative about cancer research.  It is controversial about who owns the rights to the cancer cells taken--research or her family.
B00FAOV7FI|1.0|Though nicely made, it does not fit the iphone5 even after kneading and bending ... just too tight and therefore useless!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|WILL keep getting G5 games. This is the second game of theirs that I have played.This one was lots of fun. Great graphics, sound and story line. Be sure to go to the extras when you complete the game.
B00EKQ3YZI|2.0|Okay I did not really pay attention to what I was buying. I was looking for a greatest hits collection of Donna Summer so I saw all the hits listed on the tracks and thus bought it. It is all remixes. Personally these songs were so good why remix them. I was very disappointed with a lot of them. They try to update the music but in my opinion they took away a lot of the soul of the music.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Awesome game, it is one of the best games I have ever played. But I don't recommend it for children 6 and under
B0000046KM|5.0|Shirley Horn is one of those ageless voices that thrills and is enjoyed long after she makes her music. She sings one song on this album that is my all time favorite - Where Do You Start.  I first heard it on a random radio station and I had to chase down the disc jockey to find out the name and the artist -- Shirley Horne. I've loved it ever since. I did not realize until I bought this CD that she arranges and plays her own piano music. Wow!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was kind of depressing but not all great books are happy 24/7 it was a page turner I stayed up late reading it cause it was just that good
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Fast & Furious 6 is a great movie that you should see, plus Universal Pictures said a percentage of proceeds from this DVD release of Fast & Furious 6 will be donated to Paul Walker’s non-profit &#34;Reach Out Worldwide&#34;.<br /><br />I love this series but in case you are unfamiliar with the movie here is a summary of it.<br /><br />Fast & Furious 6 is a 2013 American action film that was written by Chris Morgan and directed by Justin Lin.  It is the sixth installment in the Fast and the Furious film series.  The film stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, Sung Kang, Luke Evans,<br />Gina Carano and John Ortiz.  Fast & Furious 6 follows a professional criminal gang led by Dominic Toretto (Diesel) who have retired following their successful heist in Fast Five (2011), but remain wanted fugitives.<br />U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson) offers to clear the group's criminal records and allow them to return home in exchange for helping him to take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw (Evans) and his second-in-command, Dominic's presumed-dead lover Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez).<br /><br />Again this was a great action movie and this Steelbook and DVD are only $19.00.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is a good game for young children as well as adults who are young at heart. My child and I play this game together to see who can clear the level the fastest.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|Sweet game, plenty of levels. Very Marioesque. Only reason it gets four stars v. 5 is because of the controls, but that's unavoidable since it is a tablet game w/o a controller.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|EXCELLENT, VERY WELL WRITTEN, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK WHEN WILL THAT BE AVAILABLE?<br />ARE THERE OTHER E L JAMES BOOKS AVAILABLE OTHER THAN THE FIFTY SHADES TRIOLGY?
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Very interesting story line. I've enjoyed G5 games. The graphics are pretty good. Just wished that it was a tad bit easier to know what to do. But I love the challenge of finding objects to create mini games and solving puzzles to unlocking doors and exploring multiple scenes!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This app is awesome!I love all the songs and is easy for any age to use!Love that there are current songs to play too.
B005RUUUAI|3.0|This season was SOOOOO slow.  The midseason finale and season finale were the only two episodes that I actually got excited about or felt fearful for the characters.  When someone is starting The Walking Dead, I tell them to &#34;just get through&#34; season 2.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is a great game because it is the justice league version if mortal combat and there are a lot of characters you can be or unlock.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Now I can see why people are so addicted to this game. If you have time and get bored and start playing you just can put it down.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|This book was a great comfort to me.  I am at a time in my life when many of my loved ones have passed on.  And even as a person of faith, I miss them and need reassurance that they're at peace.  Like the doctor who was tremendously comforted when he met with Betty, I too am comforted by her testimony.  Thank you.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Loved it Very witty. Acting and scenery was breathtaking. Haved watched this version at least 5 times. Will watch it again.
B00594XOZU|5.0|At first it was really bad . You couldn't log in or register . But if you try now then you CAN log in /register. They have fixed kik. They updated it too. So just download it and see what YOU get. It looks brand new and updated. I hope you guys all change your thoughts about kik and just doenload it. Trust me . It works now.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I chose one star because zero was not an option......app does not open properly and will not connect to let  you play.  Uninstalled, then reinstalled ....still won't work!
B007Z58RLC|3.0|This classic makes you think about whether you are on the right path to achieving your goals. But the editing is deplorable--too many instances of subject-verb disagreement and confusion between \\"this\\" and \\"these.\\" The publisher should honor Hesse with more careful copy editing.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The book is well written, sad, and at times very depressing. If one didn't know what was going to happen, it would have been five stars.  Because of the great feeling of sadness it was a slow read.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I really enjoy Preston & Child, but the last few books have been somewhat frustrating. I understand that they need to leave you guessing so you will read the next book, but you don't want to leave your readers aggravated. This book was really enjoyable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just got this game and i love it. I hope u guys like this game to. I wish they had they had a 1,2 and a 3. That would be awesome.
B00631HASU|1.0|I'd give it a zero if I could. App installed on my Kindle Fire HDX, but open screen was off the side of the screen, and didn't respond at all. I couldn't even close it, let alone start it to play. It's been deleted.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|awesome game I love it it's. really like clash of clans which I love it makes me actually feel like a emporer of rome
B00003CXSP|1.0|The DVD was damaged or incorrecltly manufactured when I received it.  Right our of the box, it would stop in mid play and to get it going again you have to skip part of the movies.  Since it was a DVD, I assumed that I could not send it back so I ordered a new one and it works fine.
B00FPH51LQ|4.0|I thought it was a fun flick based on the Dark Horse comic....... I think all the bad reviews are just a bit too critical... It's not an Oscar contender.
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|The entire core catalog from Bob Dylan at a reasonable price. Bob Dylan's music is essential for any fan of folk, rock, and Americana. The booklet that comes with it is very nice with liner notes for all albums as well as insightful essays about each. The bonus disc collects many of the essential tracks that were not released on the proper albums. And it was a great way to obtain the newly remastered 14 albums. Even Dylan's lesser albums always have hidden gems. This is essential and well worth it.
3527406018|5.0|A good cover-to-cover read. Every physics student should read this book before they take the physics GRE, or even just for fun. Griffiths is awesome.<br /><br />The prereq for understanding this book probably falls around differential equations and basic linear algebra. You can definitely get a lot out of the book without knowing these, but in order to get most topics, you should have taken these classes. IIRC, some fourier transforms were involved, but not many. I would actually recommend reading it alongside other, more mathematically rigorous textbooks, just to actually understand the expectations and ideas of particle physics a bit better, but definitely get this one to show you ideas and histories better.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|If you are a huge Beatles fans like I am, you must get this boxed set. There are many significant differences between the mono and stereo mixes. This set replicates the British Parlaphone mono album sleeves. This was well worth it!
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Although authors like Dawkins can come off a bit pompous, the content is well worth consuming. Even if you are familiar with most of the scientific explanations this book as to offer, it does a great job at putting it into perspective in a way that is often ignored by most science books. I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend to anyone that just likes knowing how things work and how we know what we know. I wish this was part of standard curriculum but understandably the tone of this book would clearly offend people who are not open minded or lack the ability to think critically
B005LAIIMG|5.0|what a great movie. action at every  turn. we had a big bowel of popcorn and enjoyed every action packed excitement!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Required reading for school. Probably wouldn't have read it if is wasn't required reading material. Read it if you have nothing else on the shelf.
B008JFUO36|5.0|we really enjoyed it !!!!  what a surprising ending. keeps you always wondering what will happen next.. great movie yep!
B00005N5S2|3.0|It was ok. Not one of my favorite WWII movies. Mac is a hard character to get warm to, even though Peck does a good job of portraying him.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|It is a different way of getting into business.  Leveraging technology all the way and finding new ways to get things done is here right now.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Required reading for school. Probably wouldn't have read it if it wasn't required. Read it if you have nothing else to choose from.
1439102813|5.0|If a book on early onset Alzheimer's could be written by a person suffering from that cruel, heartless disease, covering life  from first suspicions to diagnosis through the inevitable, inescapable progression, this would be that book. This  author is a neuroscientist, has extensive first-hand experience from contact with, and knowledge of, victims of this malicious ailment  which gives her insights beyond imagination. But to be able to tell this heart-rending story from the mind of a young, brilliant Harvard professor who is in the prime of her life, and has it all ripped apart and away from her, is stunning.  So effective that in the brief moments you are forced to put this book down to tend to life, you will find yourself, as I was, unexpectedly paralyzed with fear of actually being that person. You will also, as I did, want to call everyone you know and tell them they must read this book - this engrossing, heartbreaking, amazing  book.
B000002WYT|4.0|Love Dave Matthews. Rare material is exceptional if you are a fan. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys DMB
B007N8RULO|4.0|Due to my small phone, this one was harder to play on a small screen than Freecell.  I think this game requires more strategy to win and I removed it because I need a bigger screen.  Seemed to lag and make my Kyocera Hydro slow down.  Probably phones fault.  This is my favorite Solotaire game, so I'll just have to play on my pc.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My son has this game on his Nexus (I have a Kindle), but I noticed he was playing levels I'd never seen. To make a long story short, this appears to be a different version than the one I originally downloaded previously, but the names and icons look exactly alike.  So now I have two versions of the same game with the same name, but different levels.
B0087FMUCQ|3.0|It's okay if they cleaned up some of that video that runs before the game starts.  Helicopter is annoying.  It is also very difficult to get a sense of distance which is critical for playing the game.  I think I'd like a more straight forward graphics than what they have.  They are not needed for this game.  Something that gives a better sense of distance.  It's sort of fun and different than other golf games I played.  I'll probably play it for while and then remove it.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Lee Child, as usual, crafts a great story with factual accuracy. This story will have you riveted from beginning to end.
B00ET2ODTE|4.0|This is one version of the truth. Albeit a much sanitized one. And there are many more versions of this story to choose from. I did enjoy this movie tough; it gives a small insight into the sleazy side of “The Business” and how it exploits all of those involved. Also I’m a big fan of Amanda Seyfried and equally big fan of Linda Lovelace, in all her Porn Star, Author, Feminist and Mother, incarnations. It’s sad she died so young and in such tragic circumstances.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I love it. Finally a game kids will like that's related to the bible. So many crappy apps out there. You should totally make more related to bible storys like Noah or the creation of earth or Moses and the plagues.  I love the whole paper cartoon video and the Egypt mummy lol awesome!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|best game ever a lot of choices for bots just sucks a lot of battery life its not to hard or easy its good for kids and adults
B00EKTCQCC|5.0|Stunning! So beautiful, smooth rotation of images. Just amazing! Thank you! Really wonderful app for skeleton. Makes me want them all. Will have to save up for them as they are expensive but so worth it. After all they're meant for medical students.  It even pronounces the body parts if you like.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Enjoyed the story but found it somewhat drawn out during the trial phase..enjoyed all the characters and there parts in the story..
0679809015|5.0|My little guy loves it. We've had it a year and the edges are worn from chewing and gumming- but now that he's one, he absolutely delights in me turing the pages, and him lifting the flaps, always surprised to see what's beneath each flap! Great small size for diaper bag and little hands, too.
B00E9PMMX0|5.0|i don't care what other fans think about the new star wars trilogy if george lucus should add more scenes into all six films anyone don't like the changes in the star wars movies you are not a true star wars fan.
0590259385|5.0|The sweet pictures and pleasant rhymes make this a great early story even for a young toddler. Not sure he understands the story but he enjoys the rhymes and the pictures.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A great read, so many interesting characters.  Kept me amused the whole way.  A great gift for a holiday read too!
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Classic..... Reminiscent and historical. Took me back to my childhood when I first heard this magnificent story read. The moral of the story is classical and transcending. A must read for anyone.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Great game and fun and interesting should refill energy when level up through over all good game it is fun
B000W3Q1HG|4.0|Inspiring, enlightening and frank, just the way I figured it would be. The concept is life enhancing, yet requires discipline and consistency. If your up for it, it will change you.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|He is just one of the best.  I love his voice and I think he is charming.  I have seen him in concert twice and he puts on a great show.  I know he would hate this, but I would love to give him a list of some of the old, wonderful standards and have him do a CD of them
B005GFPZYK|5.0|So excellent...well written and provided great perspective on the life trials that this American Hero endured on his way to becoming a warfighter.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This app is so much fun and if you're a star wars fan you will love it. At one point your little angry bird can use a light saber to redirect lasers being shot at you, or you have your chewbacca birds. It's just so much fun and so great. It's great to explore the worlds and see which birds go best to combat the bad piggies. Highly addictive!
B003VANOFY|1.0|Didn't  work for playing World of Warcraft on my  iMac! I sent them back.  Good quality but not for an iMac at all..
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is absolutely a gold mine when you need it to be. It has a very clear and bright light to fill up a room in a black out in case you can't find your flash light. It can work on a two way camera phone, illuminating one side with a range of colors. It's enough to light an entire room if you just set it down on a surface and walk away, or just light your entire path in front of you. It hasn't failed me yet and I've used the app during a three or four night power outage. Definitely saves on batteries as well, considering you can now charge your phone in a car if need me.
B000002INR|5.0|Hey It's Sunnydale Chick here, and now that I told the rest of my Love story.....I thought I'd give a Heads Up on our band Almost Famous (were like a cover band.......and this has been one of our FAVORITE songs since High school (Only we re-wrote it to 16 and Life......cause me and my guy fell in love with each other when I was 16 and he was a Senior......One who was even held back a year JUST to make sure we'd still be together, That's why I could NEVER figure out WHY Willow wasn't happy when Oz did that for her (I mean I know she was kind of a geek......Besides Faith shes my FAVORITE character on the show so this is more towards the writers) But why WOULDN'T she be happy that he did that? POOR POOR! Writing on their part.....Shame! Shame!  Now 16 and life is about when we went to High school, where all we did was party and spend our time in each other's arms.....worshipping each other, we miss it. We're ALOT like Jane and Ricky in American Beauty.....and we get to re-live all our best moments with our best friends.....are family.......So remember......you DON'T have to follow ALL the rules......in fact Life's ALOT better if you don't.....and if you meet someone in High School that you TRULY love (like me and my guy do) Go for it.......cause you DON'T EVER wanna miss out on a little thing called life!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love using this app. It's become my very own personal best friend in the past months. There are drawbacks I don't like. Number one being that there are no page numbers and sometimes there is no way to navigate chapters. If you lose your place at times you have to flip through and hope to find it again or trial and error. There needs to be a page location that is not just 374 out of 1000, which doesn't reflect the page number. The other thing I don't like is that you can't organize your books. There is no way to make a book playlist by author or by name. I wanted to separate the same author books into the proper series to read by and it won't let me at all, which is frustrating. Other than that though, it is a good app and swiftly allows downloads of new items. Also multiple book bundles get a little wonky when trying to find another book within the bundle to read.
B00G5G7EXY|3.0|The first half hour is a typical lifetime girly pity party about bored girls it dragged on too much throughout the movie.The movie had a good message about bringing out the better side of people but the magical powers seemed con obliged.Animation was good and self indulgent girls will love this.This is the perfect movie for feuding sisters and nobody else.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love love love my Doctor Sleep! Amazon had the best price of this book when compared to other sellers. Wonderful, fast service.

B0035JRUZQ|5.0|John Wayne classic.  What is not to like?  Plenty of action, romance, gunfights, this is a great western movie.  If you like John Wayne you will like this movie.
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|The 3D disc says it is encoded in Dolby digital 7.1 when I play he DVD my Sony Receiver is unable to recognize the encoding. My receiver is 5.2 with ability to read Dolby and DTS encoding. When I checked the DVD Audio menu for encoding formats there were none available. So if you do not have 7.1 enabled receiver you are not going to enjoy th native surround sound experience.

B00867GHS8|3.0|It was very nice to see the movie in 3D . The 3D effects are okay. You can see that the movie was originally not in 3D and rematered in 3D for some of the scenes. I would say a Blue Ray is more than enough for the movie. Not a good 3D choice.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is.l addictive and fun with great graphics.  The graphics on this are surprisingly good. I play this for hours!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Awesome 3D effects. Best Movie. Every scene is well crafted. Overall a great movie watching experience. Highly recommended . A must buy
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|nice graphics and runs well on my Kendal fire.  reallistic the controles are a little odd but that's more the platform than the actual game.
B000002VQQ|4.0|I had never even paused to listen to any Pattie Smith--it just wasn't my thing. However, playing around on the internet one day, I let an album play and discovered, I like Pattie Smith. The sound is great, this album is great.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is such a  great Christmas movie! Every year it makes me laugh and gets me in the holiday spirit
B000001GQJ|4.0|She offers a great deal of herself into the music. She can be rough on the keys, though for me, her passion plays beautifully.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Good writing, and performances. The first episode introducing the characters is my favorite. Benedict Cumberbatch and  Martin Freeman are great together. I highly recommend.
B00C6XBESQ|5.0|I am addicted to Zaz. This is a fun and quality album to have, if you enjoy French pop and all of its sub-genres. In my opinion, Zaz rules them all. Her debut album is a must own, along with Recto Verso.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|fast reliable  easy to use worth it  more than redbox or netflix. You could venture but after the math is done cheaper and more efficent to use amazon prime.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|Obsessed with this album!<br />I listen to it all the time. I love the band and even though it's only two of them now and they have somewhat of a new sound it's not that big of a difference that you would hate this album. it's fantastic.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album speaks to me as a person on many different levels.  Most people I know either love or hate it, so you should probably judge for yourself.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play the com version this version is fun but would be mo fun with mods THIS APP IS GREAT so so so so so so so so so good awesome.  just awesome.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Wonderful movie with amazing special features that truly inspired me to accomplish something great too!  This showed up in great condition and quickly.  I'd recommend to anyone!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|replaced the original cord I got with the Kindle . This cord has held up better then the original that the covering broke off.  Never buy a third party cord. They do not work as well. I have 2 of the thire party cords and they are  work sporadically at best.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I laughed out loud and I cried while reading this book.  What else could you ask from a book?  Only that it was longer....
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love the book,  it is a good read, exciting and it will keep you interested  and intrigued to the end.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Loved this book.  Well written acount of the life of a boy of 14 until he is in his late 20s.  As an artist, I was touched by the importance of a piece of art he held for most of those years.  Tartt drew me into the sadness of his loss of a parent and the abuse at the hand of another parent.  Although there are adults who care for the boy, the secret he carries keeps him separate from the love they offer.  The resolution amazed me in its cleverness and is satisfying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the book,  it is a good read, exciting and it will keep you interested  and intrigued to the end.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great skill testing game! It's a game about dexterity,  skill and choice. Have fun! Ps its the best free game I've played!
B009GI8J1O|4.0|The book is great, but the movie tie-ins don't seem to work on android devices.  When I try to access them from within Kindle app on my phone or tablet, it tells me the media can't be loaded on this device.
B005LAII12|5.0|Funny and crazy, crazy movie. I loved it even though it gets a little silly at times. this movie is for adults only due to the foul mouth teddy bear.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I don't think I need to explain why I gave it a 1 star. Everyone else has covered the problems with this book and the Divergent series thoroughly and perfectly.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun and addictive game! Very cool time killing game and decent graphics that keep you interested and watching your little city grow!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|The book chronicles an unusually eventful year's events like the flight of Lindbergh and the Sacco Vanzetti case and the overheating stock market's pointing forward to the big crash of 1929.  Those events need amplification to remind us of their importance.
B007IK44CK|1.0|can it have more hollywood cliches? It seems like its been written by an 8 year old boy! not good
0451197879|3.0|It was much harder to get involved with the protagonist in this book. I didn't like anyone, and perhaps that was King's purpose. But I finished it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love the accurate time, to the second.  Plan to use it when traveling as an alarm, and probably at home also, especially when our power goes out and we have to reset all the clocks!  Better than our cell phone time.
1781162646|4.0|This is King, making me know and either like or detest his characters; And then changing my mind about them. It's a fun, scary, good story.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Ho! what the difference.  I can get on line without the problems now. Highly recommended. See the information before you get the app. Don't miss out on this app.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very nice little tool. I used it to sharpen my Kabar kukri  machete and my spyderco knife.  I stuck it in my vice and it worked out well.
B006GKHE6G|4.0|The game is fun and the graphics are good.  However the game will not play unless Wi-Fi is turned on.  I kept getting an error message to download the game again.  I then turned tried returning on wi-Fi and then running the game and it finally worked.  This is something that should be changed. There is no reason it should require Wi-Fi to be on if you are not sharing your score etc.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Loads of fun and for once a game that deserves 5 stars. The graphics are cool and the puzzles keep you wanting more and can be addictive once you complete each level.
B009TGODOK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I like everything here - casting, place where the movie was made, idea.<br />Woody Allen as director is perfect as always. I felt spirit of Spain. So my rate is 5 out of 5.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I had been logged out of my kik when Amazon took it out of the app store to update it and didnt have kik for about two months. Now it is back and easy to just log in again. It works great
0517543052|5.0|Simply put, the book feels alive. It's like a bible to me. You get into it and it starts talking to you. The cookbook for a sacred life is like a whole other great book. Get this, some J Krishnamurti and some Alan Watts and you have all you need &#34;philosophy&#34; wise. I have bought this book at least six times. Can't stop giving it away.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a good game with good graphics. Beauty is very cute and it is addicting trying to climb to each new level
0767919408|5.0|Bill Bryson's books are always very well done, and this one is at the top of the list of books we've enjoyed by him.  The history is very interesting, and I've purchased extra copies for gifts.
0439023521|5.0|I am in love with this book! There aren't many books that I read and go &#34;Wow, I have to reread that whole book all over again,&#34; because it is so awesome. Brilliantly written but also easy to read. Chapters that end and mentally force you to start the next one, not allowing you to put the book down.<br /><br />I am not one to like deep romance sub plots, but Suzanne Collins walks the fine line with me between too much and too little. Something similar to series like &#34;Darker than an Angel&#34;. Her writing is great and she makes it seem to effortless. Looking forward to the next series she writes!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|this is a great Christmas story, we really like and now our Grandson is also enjoying it, it is a great story done very well
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I think this app was pretty good but it could have been better. I use ebay all the time. I still prefer the website.

B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a great game for family members of all ages. It's easy enough for young kids (8+) to understand yet challenging enough for adults to enjoy. We had a group of 2 young adults and 2 older adults who thoroughly enjoyed playing.
0440246210|5.0|After 22 novels Grisham has proven his story-telling talent by providing seven short tales of intrigue.  These are masterfully written stories that adeptly showcase his genius at dialogue and scene development.  Each story unfolds with interesting character development and intrigue.  Grisham puts us into each event and allows us to feel as if we know the characters.<br /><br />This is a great primer in genius writing.  I go back and reread one of these tales every few months.  My favorites are Casino and Michael's Room.  We all know some characters like these, or at least... think we know someone like these characters.<br /><br />Highly recommended![[ASIN:0440246210 Ford County: Stories]]

B00BU9DXAY|5.0|this is a quick and upbeat book with great images and it made me laugh, recommend to dog lovers for sure
B002NPY7FE|3.0|Cujo is based on a novel by Stephen King. It goes without saying but the book is much better. Cujo is a dog who gets rabies and starts attacking people. The film does feature a young Danny Pintauro (Who's The Boss?) but it lacks gore and suspense. The character development is fairly good but the film can't quite justify the R rating. The picture and audio quality are fairly good considering the era of the film. There is also a 30th Anniversary version from Olive Films but it doesn't include the making of documentary while replacing the old audio commentary with a new recording from the director and host Jeff McKay (no remastering was performed either). There is 43 minutes of total bonus content and an audio commentary.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4<br />Audio: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, English Dolby Digital Mono<br />Subtitles: English, Spanish<br />Supplements: Audio commentary with Director Lewis Teague, Three-part documentary: \\"Dog Days: The Making of Cujo\\" (2007; 43 Minutes)
0804168431|5.0|This was our book club selection by another member, and I was not expecting such a good read, but this I one of the best books that I have ever read (listened to). The writing is great. I highly recommend this book.
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|UNKNOWN starts with an intriguing premise: Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson), a noted American botanist, arrives in Berlin and is involved in a car crash.  He wakes up from a coma without remembering anything about what happened, and discovers to his horror that his identity has been stolen by another person.  His wife Elizabeth (January Jones) does not appear to recognize him, while everyone around thinks he is stark staring mad.  Jaume Collet-Serra's thriller begins with an interesting premise: the film has a good sense of place, making intelligent use of the Berlin locations, with a fine feel for languages.  Liam Neeson turns in a good performance as the central character, supported by Diane Kruger as his Bosnian sidekick, who has an unfortunate tendency to be involved in serious car-crashes. However UNKNOWN loses its way as the action unfolds.  What started off as an interesting character-study soon becomes a conventional slap-bang-wallop actioner, with numerous car chases, fast cutting and implausible plotting.  Ultimately we end up caring little for the characters and their respective fates.
B003UBTX7C|2.0|Slow moving plot, for middle third or so of the book.. Many twists- not always logical.  Last third was more interesting.<br />Good characters, with varying personalities and contributions. Made for good reading.
B007NYPWS6|4.0|Based on a stage play, CARNAGE shows two sets of parents (Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz) coming together for a cordial meeting after their sons have been involved in a fight.  However that atmosphere of cordiality soon dissipates, as the four of them become involved in a series of arguments, both verbal and physical.  Roman Polanski's film has strong echoes of Mike Nichols' WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF; it is a four-character study of bad behavior, only this time all the protagonists give as good as they get - unlike the Nichols film, where George Segal and Sandy Dennis function as the butts for Burton and Taylor's verbal jousts.  CARNAGE is both horrifying yet blackly funny, as we marvel at the depths to which four supposedly civilized middle-class people can sink to in order to retain their self-esteem.  The only character who seems rather out of place is Foster's Penelope Longstreet, chiefly because the actor does not seem to understand the absurdities of her role.  The film is shot almost entirely in one set, showing how the characters are enclosed in a claustrophobic world of their own making.  However director Polanski has a fine understanding of his character, as his camera picks out every emotional detail in the actors' faces.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|Great trilogy! Ending could've been different & I would've given it 5 stars. Overall fast read, couldn't put it down!
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|...and most fans probably imagined it already: the Star Trek films usually alternate between good and bad, thus since Star Trek X turned out quite good, the next one couldn't be but a disappointment.<br /><br />In the first place, I can't understand why it had to be 3D filming. The movie is already packed full of action, hypnotizing music, heart-wrenching drama, images flitting so quickly by that you can hardly discern them properly: but I guess it had to be in 3D because today's moviegoers, spoilt as they are, might otherwise get horribly bored.<br />The pictures are almost always stunning, as is the music. I liked the portrayal of the villain, his motives were more believable than in Star Trek II; and a few scenes were really moving, like Pike's death. But it more or less ends there.<br />To enlist all that I found disputable:<br /><br />1. The opening scene - these funny aliens looked more ridiculous than any whose sight we had to endure during the original series. Having so much more budget today, is that all the filmmakers can come up with?<br />2. Spock's \\"pose\\" in the volcano when he briefly thought he would have to die - my god, how pathetic.<br />3. Harrisons attack on the Starfleet elite: Kirk screams to the others \\"Down!\\" but doesn't duck or jump to the side himself (?) Later he manages to damage Harrison's helicopter, but when it flies exactly in his direction and crashes into the wall right near him, he just stands rooted to the ground. Is the man suicidal? (Knowing the movie's end: he probably is. But then, why is such a disturbed man allowed to captain a ship with over 400 crew members?!)<br />4. Later, Kirk tells Spock he will miss him. Miss the man who cost him his captaincy?<br />5. Spock and Uhura, two - as is well known - discreet, reasonable and practical persons must carry out their emotional quarrel while they are on the way to a dangerous mission and while their captain is present? And why doesn't he tell them to be quiet and keep such conversations for later?<br />6. Spock' behaviour towards Uhura is cool bordering on uncaring; on the other hand he begins to develop strong feelings for Kirk. There is absolutely no explanation for this.<br />7. Kirk beats Harrison at least 10 times before his comrades utter the first word of protest. Excuse me, what happened to morals?<br />8. Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent actor, but he doesn't bear the smallest similarity to Ricardo Montalban. Why couldn't he simply be some other villain, why in the world did it have to be Khan?<br />9. Dear me, Kirk's and Khan's endless flight from one space ship to the other. Doesn't the director know when it's time to yell \\"Cut!\\"?<br />10. After their helmets were already about to burst, Kirk and Khan tumble into the foreign starship full tilt, skidding and rolling over several times. Of course, none of them loses an eye through split glass or is otherwise hurt.<br />11. At the end of the movie - of course - Kirk can be reanimated. How could he not be brain dead yet after all of that time?! I will move to the 23rd century now, it seems they can even resuscitate people there...<br />12. Action, action and more action. What I liked in particular about Star Trek were the intelligent dialogues, the relationships of the characters and the philosophical, sometimes harassing social questions it dealt with. What has become of all that?<br />13. Character design: it has hardly anything left to do with the characters thought up by Roddenberry. Uhura is a \\"contemporary\\", emancipated woman, and additionally she can't hold a candle to Nichelle Nichols' beauty. Kirk has almost no kindness to show, only heaps of arrogance. Spock is by far too emotional - I will concede that he is traumatized through the loss of his home world, but nevertheless, is that necessary? Scott is markedly jovial, since when was he supposed to be the story's clown? Apart from that, the actor looks by far too small and thin for the role.<br />14. During the originalseries and the films the characters hardly had a chance to develop. Here they have the chance, being still very young. And what happens? They used to repeat the same mistakes, here they can develop - and then they repeat the same mistakes anyway.<br />15. At last, Carol Marcus has her big performance. Only this reduces the film to the usual Hollywood pattern - hero wins over the villain, saves the world and the beautiful (blonde) maiden. Argh.<br /><br />As for the film's moral, I prefer not to start or the patriots will try to kill me online right away. Kirks speech at the end of the movie, stating that \\"we are not the kind of people who seek revenge\\"... oh, well. I will leave this to the viewer's own opinion.
B00FAT9W0A|5.0|Every song on this set is a winner. Their first album will always be my favorite and thankfully  it is well represented here. Strangeland is my second favorite album because they tried to recapture the spirit of the early albums. All in all a good collection.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|So I really looked forward to reading this book, while I understand the saying \\" no such thing as an atheist in foxhole\\" his continuous reference to God was annoying. Also his attacks on liberals as not backing the military really turned me off. As an ex-serviceman who considers himself very liberal in his politics, I find his assumption that we don't support the military at every step as very insulting. I don't doubt his bravery, his courage or that of the men who died alongside him, but killing civilians is never right in war, no matter the ROE's ( so their choice was the correct one). I'll finish the book, and may adjust this review accordingly, but a massive disappointment so far.<br /><br />Having finished the book, I will adjust my rating accordingly, as promised and will admit that I had tears in my eyes. Thank you to those who didn't make it home.
B00FATEJYE|3.0|It gets annoying having to get coins and stuff also you can't get much<br />That's what think about this game

B007SGLZP8|5.0|A well written story.  It kept moving and the best part is you don't know the entire story until the last few pages.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Does exactly what it is supposed to do. I use it for my MacBook Air at my office where I had a 45W charger from my old MacBook Pro. Holds on very well with the magnet in the unit.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|It is one of my favorite horror movies, I only like 3 horror movies so you know that this is a good one, but you have to see the original because it has some things that are better in this movie, but then this movie has some better sciences.
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|I am frankly shocked at the reviews here which give the entire film away. If you know what is going to happen, if you know about Hannah’s past, you will have a totally different take on the early scenes than if you don’t yet know (as of course the boy doesn’t), which is clearly what the makers of the film intended. All I want to say, without including any spoilers, is that the film, as film (I am not commenting on its historical validity, though I taught European history at the college level and could do so), is very well done. The acting is fine, the sex is believable if apparently toned down to achieve an R rating (plenty of nudity but no actual sex shown), and the story is believable. But it is all terribly terribly sad, unrelentingly downbeat, the movie you might want to see just before you commit suicide. I really don’t know why anyone would want to see it; I’m sorry I did.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|Disappointed in this book! And disappointment is an understatement. I read both Divergent and Insurgent as quickly as my schedule allowed. However when I got Allegiant it was slow. I even stopped a third of the way through and read a different book. I never do this. Maybe I was reading it so slow because I was anticipating a horrible ending which it was. Veronica Roth has captured me in the past with her writing and after this I just don't know if I will ever pick up one of her books again. Sorry Veronica. I even talked to a friend of mine about the book and she was just as thoroughly disappointed.
B000GCFG7E|3.0|I was turned onto the series late but have read all but one that the preview was written by a student, it was so lame.  but I've been pretty faithful.  Reacher's been engaging enough and had me guessing enough that I've been willing to look the other way at some reality jumps; I mean he's REACHER!<br /><br />The premise in how he allowed him to get so deeply involved in this episode is week given his typical wariness of getting involved in others business.  Then without plot spoilers, there were some obvious possibilities that never even seemed to occur to him; it was like he got struck with the dumb stick periodically. I'm thinking maybe I'm stupid for considering these possibilities because surely REACHER would have at least considered them, they seemed a little obvious to me.<br /><br />the show down scene was a bit cliche as well and had as many plot holes as swiss cheese; I found it pretty anti climatic.<br /><br />That being said, there were surprises that made me question myself and while it was definitely not a Child's best (I agree with another commenter that Reacher's roaming is limiting character building and becoming its own prison.  Hope to be re-invigorated with the next!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Extremely easy set-up!  Took less than 5 minutes out of the box!  Used WPA protected network and NT an open guest network with password b/c if I chose open network w/password it didn't give opportunity for password - so be forewarned! On WPA protected network, it gave me opportunity to input password.  Also, please note, the chrome cast extension for the Google browser only available on Windows devices running chrome,not android tablet platform  YET. Just FYI. Love Netflix, hulu plus, u tube and Google play on the Comcast!!  Love the price of chromecast!  Right now I move from tv to TV but eventually, I will probably buy more as cast compatible additions occur....just do it!
0062305948|5.0|It is a cute story that my grandson loves & asked me to buy it for him when I asked him what book he would like me to get him next.  He is almost 6-years old and he said that his teacher reads this book to his class.  The one I bought was a special edition.  It had a little spin game, stickers and gift tags in the back.

B00GLX1MG6|4.0|I don't usually like watching comedy movies, but I liked this one for sure.  There was no slow and boring parts.  Good writer and right casting.  I wouldn't mind watching it again.
B00AZ7V0W0|4.0|This movie collection has all the gore, excitement and humor any horror movie enthusiast can ask for. I enjoy these movies and get a kick out of watching again.<br /><br />As for the boxed set here, don't expect anything special since it's all seven movies plus bonus material all on 5 discs. There is a basic cardboard box sleeve for the single DVDs case,<br /><br />Really, this is just an okay collection for $50.00 but I like it for $25.99 (Amazon Deal of the Day).
B00GX59QO2|3.0|I definitely liked the first one much better.  For the first  half of the movie, I almost slept and I woke up a little for the second half.  Overall, it was OK movie to spend a couple of hours on during the weekend.
B008518MOW|3.0|I am rating what I received from rightpricedvd (seller). Unfortunately, the 3D disc I received would freeze about 1/2 way through the movie. I tried on two different players with the same result.<br /><br />Anyway, MIBIII is a pretty good movie with an interesting story showing K does have some emotion under his gruff exterior. I would rate the movie 4 stars. I would rate the DVD I received 2 stars for not functioning properly. rightpricedvd did issue a full refund since a replacement was not offered.

B000ASATZ8|4.0|All four Tremors movies make this a great value for your money. I always liked the first Tremors movie best
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It was a very interesting book and one for thought.  I've never really thought about categorizing my love languages but there is definitely a pattern.  I believe the best use of this guide would be if a couple would both read this book, however I believe that our marriage has already benefited from even one of us reading this book.  Sometimes it is hard to believe that other couples sound so similar.  Can your make a marriage better?  Probably if you are willing to work on it.  This book is worth reading, and probably rereading.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great ending to the series! It's a book for all ages! The author does an awesome job of making the book come to life and allows u to feel like ur a part of the revolution.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is a great game and I love it so much.I would like a update to come out soon.I. love it.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Woah! I've had these for about 6 months now and they are truly great. Excellent clarity, depth and bass performance from a variety of genres. The bass will really kick you in the head for dubstep or hip hop- but its not overpowered for rock, classical or bluegrass. The sound quality is something you'd expect from much more expensive headphones.<br /><br />I had a friend of mine listen to a song on them and asked him how much he thought I paid for them: his estimate- 300 bucks.<br /><br />They are durable and comfortable as well. I'll wear them for hours at a time no comfort is lost. I've dropped them off my balcony and they were completely unaffected (though I wouldn't recommend such an activity :)) Skullcandy doesn't stand a chance.
B00FA1DGIW|5.0|Great album!!! I love these guys music, I really do, and I've been waiting (not patiently) for this album to be available-it was actually worth the wait. Great job guys!
0152465030|5.0|This is hands down one of the best books ever written. It's great for children, for teenagers, for adults, and the elderly. It is one of those books that everyone should read, because everyone will get something different out of it at different stages in their lives. It's almost magic. Such an important book.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Excellent book! Viktor Frankl´s lessons will change how you think about life and how you deal with tough situations. Along with &#34;How Will you Measure Your Life&#34; and &#34;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&#34; this is one of the best books I´ve ever read.
147676459X|5.0|Allie Brosh is amazing. I used to read her blog of the same name, and her drawings inspired me to write my own web comics, which were a big hit in my smaller online circle of law students and lawyers. (I should totally start drawing them again.)<br /><br />So when she came out with a book, I knew I had to support my girl. I'm very proud of her for writing such a great book. The comics are great, her chapters/posts are wonderful and heartfelt and sincere and intelligent - everything you'd expect from Allie Brosh. The pages are brightly colored and glossy, and this is such an engaging, enjoyable read from start to finish.<br /><br />There's about 50% new content, which I know annoys some people because they want 100% new content. But for me, I'm happy to have some of her most amazing posts from her blog - like her posts about her battle with depression - in tangible form as part of a gorgeous hardcover.<br /><br />I'm so glad I bought this. Even though I love to cull my personal library (as my digital library balloons in size) and pass my books along to others who will enjoy them, I know I will keep this one for a long, long time. It is precious and important and so very funny and heartfelt.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go read her blog. And if you like it, as I'm sure you will, buy this book. Keep a piece of her blog on your shelf. It will probably make you pretty damn happy.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I was a serious Star Trek fan when the series first aired.  I enjoy it more now than I did then.
0307719774|5.0|I keep a journal - a large, free-form, sprawling journal - but I've always liked the idea of having a journal in which I wrote one or two sentences for every day and did so consistently for a period of time. THIS is exactly what I'd been thinking of. Normally, I don't like small journals. I want something big so I can write and not feel cramped. But this is a small one - and I like it. A lot.<br /><br />It's small enough to fit in my purse, and given the purpose of this book, that's awesome. For something like this, you WANT something small enough to fit in your bag so that when you've got a few minutes, you can pull it out, write in it, and stick it back in. For me, I can discreetly pull this out while I'm killing time in court (we're not allowed to read books or fool around on our iPads as we wait for the judge to take the bench), and write a few sentences and stick it right back in my briefcase. People just assume that it's a little personal diary and I'm writing a grocery list or something. It's innocuous but more importantly, very convenient.<br /><br />Plus, it's lovely. It has gilded pages, and I think they're so pretty. I have no idea how well they will hold up over the years, but I don't really care. They're pretty now and even if they fade a little, so what?<br /><br />I noticed that many of the other reviews complain that the binding is tight and makes it hard to write in the middle pages of this book. I can offer some help with that issue.<br /><br />It's probably true that the binding is a bit tight. This is what you should do with ANY book where the binding is tight:<br /><br />1. Hold the book so that it rests on its spine. Rest it on the table on the spine.<br />2. Let the front cover fall open, and down. Press it down a little, gently, so that it lies flat on the table.<br />3. Do the same with the back cover.<br />4. When both the front and back cover are flat on the table, with the pages pointing up, then take a few pages from the front and gentlypress them down to rest on the front cover.<br />5. Take a few pages from the back and gently press them down to rest on the back cover.<br />6. Keep doing this until you get to the middle of the book and all the pages are resting flat.<br /><br />This is the best way to loosen the binding gently, without damaging or breaking it. This is exactly what I did when I first got this journal. I loosened the binding gently so that I coudl use it and have not had any trouble writing it. If you are too rough with it, you risk damaging the binding or breaking it, which you don't want to do. Just follow my instructions and you'll loosen it properly, and be able to enjoy this journal for a long time.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|I have to give it 5 stars, for storyline and actors. Best science fiction show ever. Sad to see it end after 5 years. I watched all 5 seasons. Every episode gets better then the  previous one.  I rate it number 1 up there with &#34;Breaking bad&#34;, &#34;Sons of Anarchy&#34;, &#34;Justified&#34; and &#34;The Wire&#34;.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I LOVE THIS DEVICE!!! I purchased this first on here, but since it took so long, I eventually found one at a local Best Buy and bought one locally for one TV, and fell in love with it! So easy to use, almost a direct plug-n-play device. Just minimal setting up and you're ready to stream YouTube, Google Music, Google Movies, Hulu, and Netflix. There was an app where I could even play any movies from my device to the TV, but now that app's gone =( Hopefully they'll restore that
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Great advice for anyone at any age.  I loved it!  I still re-read it and loan it out to others.

B003B96AOW|5.0|My husband literally said &#34;ooooh&#34; when I showed him what I ordered our son for his birthday. They both like Comic book characters, and this character is hard to find. Deadpool comes with the display, but he is fully pose able, so you can play with him and/or display him.

Who'd a think that an Indian (subcontinental, not red) Princess could ROCK so HARD.<br /><br />Get this and see how Neal Purt brought a great band to its knees with his pretentious waffle. Real ROCK lyrics are all about CHICKS and BEER and being ground down by the MAN.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sometimes an author writes a series and the end is trite or just fizzles it out. Sometimes you are too upset with the ending or just plain baffled. The end really surprised me. It was not how I would chosen for it to end, but the closing of this gripping series needed to twist and turn like the rest of the book. I was not disappointed. I highly recommend.
B003K15IF8|4.0|Very well written and beautifully displayed. A must read for all of those that enjoy or love reading. Great great great!!

B00F91RYL8|1.0|This was a extremely poor rendition of the Walking Dead.  It could have been much more realistic in the way people turned into zombies.  The film lost it completely for me when the place that stood strong for so long got taken over in a matter of minutes.  It failed to engage me.  Walking Dead makes you wonder \\"what would I do?\\" But I kept wanting this movie to come to an end to put it and me out of our miseries.
B007V65R54|4.0|Lots of fun examples from politics to hurricanes to poker.<br /><br />Enjoyable to read and good refresher on how to look at data.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Walking Dead started out great then they seemed to have lost the way and the show got a bit boring.  But the season 4 mid season finale was just what the show needed.  I gave 4 stars hoping the the makers will read these reviews and know that there is still more work to be done. I love the new concept in modern day series where almost no one is untouchable...anything can happen at any time and Walking Dead embraces this well.  I cannot wait for the this mid season break to come to an end.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|MaddAddam, like the whole of the Oryx and Crake trilogy, is a double dystopia, with two narrative presents:  (1) an anarchic world of balkanized corporate dominance and environmental degradation prior to the near-extinction of humanity by an engineered superbug, and (2) a remnant community's life in the ruins - and interaction with a community of genetically engineered human mutants designed to be more pacific-- after the &#34;waterless flood.&#34;<br /><br />In MaddAddam, as in the trilogy as a whole, I found myself slipping in and out of suspended disbelief.  My basic feeling was that the quasi-dystopia before the near-extinction of humanity is a powerfully imagined world, while the social life of the band of survivors of the &#34;waterless flood&#34; is cartoonish -- though  at the same time, the evocation of the language and inner life of the bioengineered mutant Crakians with whom the human remnant interacts is remarkable and haunting, an interior Eden. The weakest part is the back-story, taking up much of MaddAddam, of the remnant community's protector and founder, Zeb. He's a superhero, not a character, and his account of his dealings with supercriminals of the underworld reminds me a little of children's author Madeline L'Engle's attempts to imagine gang life in The Young Unicorns: not, shall we say, an insider's account. His narrative voice is self-deprecating tough guy, as if Bono had been a drug lord.<br /><br />Those caveats aside, the earlier narrative of several characters' trials in the pre-flood anarchic thugocracy is fully imagined, as is the nasty brutish society of the global failed state: its faux-civilized, luxurious corporate compounds, in which whistleblowers and would-be escapees are ruthlessly eliminated; its decayed urban infrastructure, where everyone is a squatter; its depraved online entertainments (real-time executions and child sex always on tap), its vicious streetwise child gangs, its multiple forms of sexual slavery; its cults formed in reaction to the chaos (the cult central to the tale is in fact lovingly if slightly mockingly evoked, its theology quite sophisticated).<br /><br />Entering this world has colored my understanding of our own, and our future. Three malign factors plausibly converge:  global warming, which drowns the coastal cities and triggers mass extinctions, disrupting the human food supply; genetic engineering, which further corrupts the natural environment; and the overwhelming of state authority by corporate elites (in cahoots with corrupt latter-day &#34;prosperity churches&#34;), who develop private police forces that merge and morph into a leviathan answerable only to itself.<br /><br />At one point Crake, the young genius who later engineers both the destruction of most of humankind and a race of more pacific human variants, explains that once the central cables of our built environment are cut, our technological society could not be rebuilt (except, presumably, from its starting point, over millennia):<br /><br />  “It’s not like the wheel, it’s too complex now. Suppose the instructions survived, suppose there were any people left with the knowledge to read them. Those people would be few and far between, and they wouldn’t have the tools. Remember, no electricity. Then once those people died, that would be it. They’d have no apprentices, they’d have no successors...All it takes...is the elimination of one generation. One generation of anything. Beetles, trees, microbes, scientists, speakers of French, whatever. Break the link in time between one generation and the next, and it’s game over forever” (Oryx and Crake, p. 261).<br /><br />Crake, a teenager here, is talking about the destruction of the world he knows, the proto-dystopia of the trilogy's narrative past. What's truly scary about Atwood's work is that it's easy to imagine our world devolving into that brutal anarchy-- and that there would be no way back from such a world, either.  That, ultimately is I think Atwood's conclusion, astonishingly enough: that the murderous Crake, who wipes out most of humanity while designing its successor, was right to do so. As the not-so-saintly Zeb sums up toward the end:<br /><br />  “All the real Gardeners believed the human race was overdue for a population crash. It would happen anyway, and maybe sooner was better” (MaddAddam Location 5014).<br /><br />It's hard to gainsay that, if you imagine bringing children into the world that the main characters grew up in.  That makes the book a disturbing Jeremiad. Repent, for the end may be nigh.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Stories of concentration camps abound, but this book gave insight into how many survived the war and the aftermath. The treatment was fair to both those who were brave enough to help the dispossessed and those who were on the side of the Nazis or just too afraid to get involved.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|Fun read with the real story of why the red shirts always die.  Funny takeoff on a number of typical Trek plot twists.
0375842209|5.0|One of the best novels I've read in a long time, deserving of more than 5 stars.  The story is moving, drawing you into the dark, dark days of a terrible world war with its accompanying Nazi brutality.  In the midst of the terrible suffering, the courage and beauty of the story's ordinary people is mesmerizing.  Zusak's stark, tight, gorgeous prose paints poignant and at times painful pictures that are as beautiful as any in a museum.  Read the book.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Craig plays 007 the way I would imagine 007 to be. Far more serious and dark. 007 in the past had seemed to be played as some super hero, cartoon hero.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It's a Really fun game. It has good graphics. and it has simple controls. Feels like I'm part of the movie.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|looking for daily player<br />please add CGVATCC only if you are an active player.<br />the game is good but crashes sometimes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome! I love it! And I absolutely LOVE the new update! You must download this game! Aawweesssommeee!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00866JL96|5.0|Excellent movie with handsome Zac Efron being an ex-Marine with flashbacks looking for girl in photo carried by deceased Marine. The photo does not enter into movie until the very end after he has fallen in love with girl who has a son, jealous ex-husband who is policeman. In beginning of movie he is hired to work in kennel that girl owns as she thinks he is applying for job.  I am sure soldiers I am sending DVD to will enjoy it.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I love all of her books. This one is very focused on the two main characters. Their story is really beautiful.  Looking forward to the next one.
0761174192|5.0|Buy one every year !  A bit pricey but worth it.  It's easy to confuse this calendar with ones that are &#34;tear-a-page off&#34; each day and are not as nice.  Should adverstise with a clearer discription. Ex: &#34; Comes with the display stand&#34;
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|I was anticipating this novel and although it was a pleasant enough read, it didn't rock my socks off.  I didn't laugh or cry (or cringe even) as much as Ms. Fielding's previous novels.  All and all, it was ok.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great app & game !! Many many levels to complete & the app doesn't need an internet connection which is great too
1582701709|5.0|WISH I WOULD OF HAD THIS BOOK ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO, WOW IT IS POWERFUL, THERES NOT ENOUGH WORDS TO EXPRESS, IT'S A MASTERPIECE
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really fun & time consuming game! Many many many challenges to complete which i think is great for a free app.
0375842209|5.0|Great story. Outstanding characters. Well written.<br />Definitely refer to others. Movie can't do it justice.<br />Could have been a true story.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Really fun & great~! The game doesn't need WiFi which is great, & the game itself is fun ! really coool
B00632HWOG|1.0|My app just updated a couple of days ago and it made it worst! Every time you select a new email it &amp;#34;blinks&amp;#34; the screen looks like it turned off then on again with every new email. Please fix this it was just fine before!
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|The app works great! let's me set multiple locations, & even if i'm not in the app, the temperature still shows in the drop-down menu which is awesome. gives you predicted weather for other times of the day which is cool. love tha app
B00G9U7R2O|2.0|I had seen the movie before and enjoyed it so much that I ordered it so that I could watch it with my wife and son. I ordered the movie via Amazon's instant video, the quality of the video and sound was fine but the fact that the connection dropped three times and the video had to load twice became VERY frustrating. More than once I had to exit the screen and go back to the search screen to re-display the listing for the movie and then click on &#34;Watch Now&#34; before it properly reconnected, then I had to fast forward to where we left off. This is a habitual problem with Amazon's instant videos. The problem seems to be more pronounced during peak viewing times such as Friday and Saturday nights.<br /><br />When you order the movie via instant video you are given access to the movie for three days, it might take you three days to get through the movie considering how many times the connection was lost.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Froze everyone in a while for me, but other than that the app was great ! really fun & addicting
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Heartbreaking. True. The author paints such a perfect picture. Exemplifying the world we live in. Death. Torture. Selfishness. Hope. Love. Mockingjay is excellent.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|She out does herself with this CD. It's great she is still going strong. I really haven't listened to stage songs to much but she changed my mind.  Is there nothing she can't sing.  She is still surprising me.
B00C8S9VKM|2.0|BRYSON IS A GOOD WRITER WITH WIT (SEE WALK IN THE WOODS, THUNDERBOLT KID).  HOWEVER, THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT NOTHING. LOTS OF THINGS HAPPENED IN 1927 BUT THE BOOK IS MORE OF A PRIMER FOR A TRIVIAL PURSUIT GAME THANK ANYTHING ELSE, AND BRYSON OFTEN APPEARS TO BE SNIDE RATHER THAN FUNNY
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's a game mostly for kids. It is fun to play but not my kind of game.  I think kids would love it.
B0012DZ356|4.0|A wonderful book of excellent short stories about women and a good example of why she won a Nobel prize
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This is a wonderful CD. I didn't know if she would be able to keep making great CDs. But she is totally fantastic. I have all of her CDs and am still as awed as I was at the beginning of her career. she is so worth it. She is so classy.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I gave this to my son for his birthday - everybody in the household has gone nuts over this great maze.  I can't wait to visit so I can actually try it out myself!
B00F3VOL38|5.0|I was never a real Beatles fan...after all, they destroyed the careers of a large number of my musical heroes when they set foot in the USA.  However, I am a collector of the music of the brith of rock and roll, and, by their gargantuan body of work, must be included in any serious conversation.<br />I did like about 1/3 of the music they made, but never bought a 45 or 33 1/3 disc of theirs until I was in my 30's.<br />So, let me say this about that----these 2 cd's are absolutely fabulous.  The early years, live, in studio with these 4 mop topped multi millionaires, is absolutely priceless.<br />The sheer energy and &#34;youth&#34; of these performances can't be faked.  It is real, and it is very fine to hear.<br />Thank you for releasing this testament to one of the enduring musical acts of all time.
B00932DCS8|3.0|Although I would give the movie 4 stars, I also judged Amazon's streaming and presentation quality, which was not great. About 3/4 of the way through the movie, just as the movie is beginning its climax, suddenly the subtitles from the dialog at the start of the movie re-appeared along with the current dialog. Confusing. Nothing I tried removed the second subtitles. Very disappointing.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|its like your blind and then you can see....good picture quality. good size screen. it does eat up batteries lots faster then without mode. but would not not have it with me
B008JFURII|5.0|Red and Red 2 are in out &#34;favorites&#34; list.  The creative &#34;one liners&#34; keep you on your toes, and I think they did a great job with character development.  The unique and diverse relationships bring lots of laughs.  There are few movies we would watch repeatedly, this is one of them!  We laughed through out the entire flick and have shared it with visiting family over Thanksgiving who really enjoyed the humor, too!  My personal fav's are John Malkovich and Mary-Louise Parker...such a hoot!  Also enjoy that it can be full of adventure and comedy without offensive language at every turn.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Could not stop reading after I started. Some of the language is a bit overkill, and could have been cleaned up a little. But, over all a great read.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|The game is fun but there are issues as far as glitches. You will. Not be able to do everything you are suppose to. One is getting g into special fight areas, clock runs down but then re sets.
B004SYP5WC|1.0|useless, to me. I really do a better job on my own and have no use for this app. It may help someone else.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|Good game not able to connect with Facebook but I still like it. Good bots and action. Fun fun fun
B009HUB40Y|4.0|played this for hours on end. The only thing is- you have to have access to the internet while playing. You can not play in the car.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|this season get better every episode. the episode 8 th is the best. lets see what is next . . .
B00E9PMMX0|1.0|Dear Disney,<br /><br />Here's your chance to do the right thing. Get the originals out of the vault and remaster them for Blu-ray. In fact, why not launch with a 4K remaster? Do what you guys do best...make dreams come true.<br /><br />I'm wishing on this star...this DEATH STAR!
B0034G4OVS|5.0|Great movie! It's edge of your seat and nightmare inducing for anyone afraid of ski lift rides!  Worth a watch!
B006FE83UE|5.0|One of the classic movies,how could you not love this? Would recommend this as an addition to any movie collection.Such timeless subject matter...
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This has been a fantastic journey from beginning to end.  If you have read the other books in the series, then this book will put a nice period on the whole saga for you.  If you haven't, you might start reading!!
B003TQKVGU|4.0|An insightful study of the human mind.  Helped me get a handle on some of my thoughts and actions that I never understood.  Worth a read and evaluation.  Might make clearer some things in your life that you could never get a handle on.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Came fast, the dvds are in small dvd box so its not as big as 8 regular sized dvds ( im not sure how many discs the movies are on as I got it for a gift for someone), came fast and in perfect condition. also for a great price.
B00BXDOSXS|1.0|At first this was the only player I could find that would play mkv files.  There is some kind of bug with video list.  It does not update.  When you remove a video, it does not remove the video from the list.  So, you are stuck with a bunch of dead listings when you remove a video file.  I overlooked this issue until and used esexplorer to find and play files.  Then eventually, no matter what video I selected and played the, the hd player told me it couldn't play the video whether it was really there or not no matter what format it was.  I removed this app and found vlc plus pro player.  Works much better and with all formats.  It even plays higher definition videos.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|A must read for parent, teachers and coaches everywhere. Reading Coyle's book will provide actionable  insight  and clear guidance  on how to bring the best out of anyone
B00992CF6W|4.0|My grandkids play this on my Kindel and evidently it's a great game because they love it and must be forced to put it down.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It can be addictive! My four-year-old nephew is pretty good at it. It holds his attention for quite awhile. It is also good for teens and adults. I can play it for about an hour before I get bored.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Awesome app easy to use to get rid of junk files and saves storage on your tablet get this app!!
B009AP2G26|2.0|I have always loved Glee, but with the new cast members and back and forth from scenes ion NY etc. .  . it has lost its spirit.  And, Darren Criss the most talented of the group has been put in the background, and that has been the most disappointing.  I would suggest a new show - &#34;GLEE  - New York&#34;.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|After a long drought of good FAOTDs finally a good one. I like this game so much i am looking for the board game.

0143117009|5.0|Jared Diamond. Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. NY: Penguin Group 2005.  575 pp. Further readings 32 pp. $17.00<br /><br />Jared Diamond brings us a cogently argued discussion of numerous societies over several thousand years that collapsed, and of a very few that have survived. He has gathered a convincing mass of evidence that the fall of most societies is due to destruction of their environments, which he calls “ecological suicide.”<br /><br />…The processes through which past societies have undermined themselves by damaging their environments fall into eight categories, whose relative importance differs from case to case: deforestation and habitat destruction, soil problems (erosion, desalinization, and soil fertility losses), water management<br />problems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of introduced species on native species, human population growth, and increased per-capita impact of people. (p. 6)<br /><br />Diamond points out that modern society considers itself immune to collapse because of modern technology, but that in fact, we are simply destroying our planet on a much vaster scale and at a much faster rate than ever before. Our much larger population and interdependence upon conditions in distant locations means that environmental collapses in distant places puts us at greater risk than ever before.<br /><br />One of the principal problems is our focus on immediate profits from extraction of resources while minimizing costs – including the expenses for disposing of waste byproducts in safe manners and in avoidance of pollution.<br /><br />…Successful businesses differentiate between those expenses necessary to stay in business and those more pensively characterized as ‘moral obligations.’ Difficulties or reluctance to understand and accept this distinction underscores much of the tension between advocates of broadly mandated environmental programs and the business community… (p. 37)<br /><br />When the mine owner can’t or won’t pay, taxpayers don’t want to step in and pay billions of dollars of cleanup costs either. Instead, taxpayers feel that the problem has existed for a long time, out of sight and out of their backyards, so it must be tolerable; most taxpayers balk at spending money if there isn’t an immediate crisis; and not enough taxpayers complain about toxic wastes or support high taxes. In this sense, the American public is as responsible for inaction as are miners and the government; we the public bear the ultimate responsibility. Only when the public pressures its politicians into passing laws demanding different behaviors from mining companies will the companies behave differently; otherwise, the companies would be operating as charities and would be violating their responsibility to their shareholders… (p. 38)<br /><br />The bottom line is the attitude of “ISEP” – It’s somebody else’s problem.<br /><br />Diamond details the problems of ecological collapse that led to the downfall of almost every society on our planet in recorded history, including Easter Island, Pitcairn (famous from Mutiny on the Bounty) and Henderson Islands, the Anastazi of New Mexico,  the Mayans of Mexico, the Vikings, the Norse in Greenland, Australia, and many others. All fell due to having ignored the limitations of carrying capacity of their environments in the face of overpopulation.<br /><br />The saddest aspect of all of these societal ecological suicides is that modern man has not heeded the lessons of the past. We are repeating the very same mistakes but on such a vast, planetary scale, that we are well on our way to causing the sixth great extinction of our planet. We have no way of knowing what the tipping point of no return might be. Hopefully, we are not already too late to halt and reverse our path to global self-destruction. (See the editorial in this issue for more on this.)<br /><br />The brilliance of Diamond’s book is that he points out that there are alternatives to what we are doing, with clear examples from past and present societies for sustainable ways to live on this earth.<br /><br />One of these is the New Guinea highlands, “…and that agriculture has been going on there for about 7,000 years – one of the world’s longest-running experiments in sustainable food production.” Here, small, family landholdings worked by within close-knit communities are run with careful consideration of the needs of the land and its plants and animals, as well as of the needs of the people. There is a firmly entrenched bottom-up approach that prevails on this island, with local citizens making the decisions that are needed to resolve communal problems. A very important contribution to their success is their self control of population to avoid exceeding the carrying capacity of the land.<br /><br />Similar success is evident on Tikopia, a small island in the Southwest Pacific Ocean. Again, there is a bottom-up structure to their society, with 3,000 years of survival of their culture.<br /><br />My own impression is that much of the success of these small societies may be attributed to the social rule that people do well within a limit of 150 members in their community (or working group). Within this limit, everyone knows everyone else personally and relationships are based on frequent interactions between all members of the group. There isn’t the impersonality of larger societies that allows and encourages greedy and/or power-hungry individuals or groups (be they businesses, corporations or politicians) to build their power and control over other members of the population – for their own benefits, at the expense of the rest of the population.<br /><br />But Diamond does not stop here. He points out that Japan is another example of several hundreds of years of balancing population growth with careful stewardship of their cultivated land and forests. Diamond’s book was written several years prior to the Fukushima disaster that continues to deteriorate and to threaten the health of the Japanese people, their land, and probably – to an unknown extent – of the nearby ocean waters and of many others in the Northern Hemisphere. So perhaps my conjecture about the long-term viability of a society depending on the presence of smaller communities still holds.<br /><br />Diamond makes many helpful suggestions for how to deal with the crisis of our impending sixth global extinction.<br /><br />This is a book most highly recommended for anyone concerned with bettering our world.<br /><br />Review by Daniel Benor, MD, ABIHM<br />Editor-in-Chief, IJHCe alternatives to what we are doing, with clear examples from past and present societies for sustainable ways to live on this earth.<br /><br />One of these is the New Guinea highlands, “…and that agriculture has been going on there for about 7,000 years – one of the world’s longest-running experiments in sustainable food production.” Here, small, family landholdings worked by within close-knit communities are run with careful consideration of the needs of the land and its plants and animals, as well as of the needs of the people.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was brilliant. The creative ending will shock all readers. As always Grisham has out done himself. I would highly recommend this book.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Love the variety of towers and tracks. Runs really well; almost never have any issues with lag. The variety and increasing difficulty lend well to continued play.
B008JFUR10|5.0|A great movie to watch if you love robots or scifi movies.  Watching the blue ray movie on a sony blue ray and a 60 inch screen was really good. The regular dvd was also really good.  I have not checked the additional content so I don't know what is on there.  A good buy if you love the movie.  Great buy!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|1.0|I never got a chance to play the game, because when I tried to open it it crashed my Kindle. I had to wait for the battery to die to get it restarted.
B0031RSBS2|5.0|great as always.  Having to write such a lengthy explanation as to why I enjoyed this book puts me off ever wanting to rate one again!
B00ED2EMJQ|4.0|This is a document of the era, the band, and a level of musicianship rarely found today.  Remastered recording with bonus material is improved and appreciated.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|classic!  Having to write such a lengthy explanation as to why I enjoyed this book puts me off ever wanting to rate one again!
B005NFJAMG|5.0|Best part in the whole movie is when Steven Segal dies... Not being mean but for years he did some impossible stuff in his movies and he was invisible. Great movie and great price
B009GIPDQS|5.0|great twists!  Having to write such a lengthy explanation as to why I enjoyed this book puts me off ever wanting to rate one again!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a great game. i played it all night. its totally addictive. now its time for me to bead off to bed to recharge my energy
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I, too, flew as a child.  I have flip-flopped from a strong belief in God, to a desire to believe, but with real doubt.  This book has helped to restore my faith.  I believe in the reality of Dr. Alexander's near death experience.  I believe he was chosen to live this incredible journey and to report his findings.  Dr. Alexander, thank you so much for allowing us to experience your visit to the everlasting eternity that awaits us all.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|New edge to old Christmas tunes. I love it. The &#34;music&#34; this group makes is so enjoyable. It is a must have addition to your holiday music.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|great for home! must have! life is so much easier now. no doubt and no need to think about it.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|fun for the most part- worth your time.  wish more game puzzles with in the game but keeps u playing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great but the only problem is it needs to update<br /><br />Please update this game and lower the price 7 $ that's outrageous
B00F0AI9Y4|1.0|In my opinion, this album REALLY sucks! If you are buying it based solely on &#34;Wake Me Up&#34; & are looking for similar songs you will be extremely disappointed. Most of the songs could be classified as dance music & have very repetitive lyrics and melodies, not to mention they are sung by different people. I'm not a fan of dance music & really did not like this album. If you like the song &#34;Wake Me Up&#34; but don't like dance music, I would suggest you just buy the single and forego the album.
B005IGZUTC|5.0|I love all of Lindsey Kelk's book. She is an amazing writer. I wish sometimes that I could have Angela's life with a boyfriend like Alex!!!
B009ZQFSRA|2.0|I love sci-fi, and as a scientist and engineer I've learned to overlook some of the more outlandish liberties that some authors take with &#34;future technology,&#34; but this was ridiculous. At every turn I was disappointed with how poorly the story developed and how unbelievable things were. Save time and watch something else.
B005COO1X6|4.0|An interesting story that was a bit more vintage. Very nonsensical and requires a tremendous leap of the imagination and suspension of reality.
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|Easy to learn easy to play large player base. Only drawback is cost an  time it takes to upgrade. Sorry for typos but I've gotta get back to playing.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|i just orderd mine and i cant wait for it to come in the mail im  a REAL WHOVAN AND REAL WHOVAN HAVE SONIC SCREWDRIVER
B00632HWOG|1.0|I don't desire the &quot;sponsored &quot; emails.  The app design appears basic.  Settings are limited on the kindle.  If Yahoo insists on changes,  the alterations should actually be improvements.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just got this game at 1:30 am and have already had so much fun! It is really interactive and perfect for horse lovers! You unlock things you can do with your horse, and it is easy to earn gems :) I love how you can measure out the feed and mix it, and how you can change the horse's appearance. It's really cool and realistic.  Definitely recommend this game.  :D
B00FEPQ212|5.0|Excellent, funny, though provoking.  I felt like I had skied myself.  Thank you for a wonderful read.  Keep it up.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Excellent serial. A lot of good actors with a really original script. I was really sad when finish the last chapter. Must be a new set of seasons, to continue with Harrison and Hanna life and the return of Dexter as a renewed guide for his son, using also Hanna's experience. What do you think? I want harrison be a saint? No way: he will develop the skills of both parents and help the country be free of crap.
B0041KVZ1I|2.0|No fault of the seller,but a lot of The Beatles 2012 vinyl remasters are defective. I just opened this to find there's unlistenable surface noise and static on side 2<br /><br />This is due to poor quality control at record plants Capital leased out. Magical Mystery Tour was ok,but Abbey Road is unlistenable,the static and surface noise ruins the album
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|There are segments of this movie that are entertaining but not as a whole. The ending is confusing and hard to follow and makes no sense. I'd pass on this one.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I personally love the game. I think it it awesome an  I love  playing it. I find it perfect it's not to simple and not to hard and you really don't have to spend any money. I love the look of the characters, and how they aren't always walking around. Like most games. The challenges aren't to hard and you dint have to do Mich which is good. It's not like most games I play. Where they make you spend money and do a lot. That is why I gave a five star rating.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|It is a great movie with great acting and action/drama!!  I would highly recommend this movie!!  Thus director very rarely makes a dud, and this one is great!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glade they finally got  it this was the whole reason for getting my tablet game is really fun to play .
1476758581|5.0|I bought the Secret and the Magic, but had no intention of buying this book until I saw it at the store and picked it up. I was impressed with what it had to offer so I bought it. In this book, Rhonda Byrne shares inspirational stories from a number of people who found the hero within themselves and overcame all odds to success. This book will inspire those who read it. Review written and submitted by Eddie Coronado, author of the Amazon.com book titled &#34;Manifest Your Millions: A Lottery Winner Shares his Law of Attraction Secrets&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A very calming game like Jewels. I never was a game person but these two games have changed my life. A former Frogger player.
0307593312|2.0|Every woman in this book is repeatedly described in terms of her breasts: her breasts were small, large, lopsided, firm, etc. Even our heroine, while thinking of her two dead friends at the end of the book thinks: &#34;their breasts are no longer here&#34;, WTF! Who thinks like that? No woman I know.<br /><br />The author is male, and is apparently obsessed with breasts. One thing he needs to understand is that most women are not. You'd never know that from reading this book.<br /><br />On to the story! The book was very, very long and slow moving. It was difficult to get through because every characters innermost thoughts are written out in great detail; a little too much detail in my opinion. To the point where it gets downright boring. The book is very long, over 1000 pages and I skimmed a lot of those boring innermost thoughts because they did little to help me get to know the character and did nothing to enhance the story. In fact, they were usually irrelevant.<br /><br />Another issue I had with this book is that there are too many unexplained loose ends: (SPOILER ALERT)<br /><br />Tengo's mother...is it significant that she died in the *exact* same way as Aomame's police woman friend? The mazas and the dhotas, what's up with the infertility? It really was not explained. There are a few other things like that which really bothered me, but I finished the book about a week ago and I can't really remember what they are any more.<br /><br />This book wasn't bad, but it most certainly does not live up to the hype.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to this game it is so awesome and challenging. If you update the game twice you will get a free powerup each day. It is a shame that they have not put in another update though.But I would still get this game. I hope this review was helpful.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Seriously! I've wondered for years, what ever happened to Danny Torrence? Ok admittedly as a lifelong Stephen King fan I have found myself wondering about many of my &#34;old friends&#34;. From the start the story is great and holds your attention throughout. Definitely a must read for any King fan. You can see and feel the emotion within and it answers my question wonderfully! Thank you Mr. King!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game. Very strategic. Lol lol lol Apollo  Lol lol lol lol look lol lol. I loved th  game. Put my mind t the test.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|David Baldacci always writes a book that will keep you guessing and trying to figure everything out right up to the very end. This will keep you up at night so prepare to loose some sleep.
B002M5E2DW|1.0|The major belief that the universe can respond to your thoughts in a positive or negative way, depending on how you're thinking and your attitude, and bring good or bad things into your life is completely without merit. As a deist, I believe a higher power created the universe but takes no part in running the universe or intervening in our lives. Which means the universe certainly takes no part in influencing our lives. I believe the book is on solid ground in encouraging positive thinking, eliminating negative thoughts, and being thankful for the blessings we receive from others, etc. etc. etc. But we've read all this in many other self-help books. Cut the Kindle price to $2.99 and the book would be worth that if you have not read these other motivational books.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I love Dexter. I've been collecting all the seasons for a few years and it was cool to add this season to my collection. Not my favorite, but still a classic. You get what you pay for.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I read this book for my book group - I had no idea what I was getting into.  It was well written, I had no trouble staying focused on the book.  But, I did wonder why I was reading the book.  It seemed like a childs book to me.  As I said, I am just not in to fantasy books.  Would love to know why so many others really like this book.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|PROS:<br />If the paci falls it stays where it lands rather than bouncing off to God knows where.<br />You can keep the paci in his/her mouth in the car seat by sticking the monkey's arms under the seat belt straps.<br />This is the only paci we use--great for sleeping because the hands/feet have tiny beans in them that help keep the animal on the child's chest for sleeping (which keeps the paci in his/her mouth--unless you have an active sleeper).<br /><br />CON:<br />The paci doesn't detach from the animal--this is annoying because sometimes I would like to switch out the paci to another one if I don't have time to clean the paci.  (However, the fact that it doesn't detach is nice in the sense that it won't get lost).
B00F031XPS|5.0|A wonderful film about a wonderful artist. No one plays the guitar better; no one, just as powerfully, is more reclusive when not on stage. A superb picture about one of our most complex cultural icons.
B000U27S8U|5.0|This is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL and highly collectible book. It is a leather bound copy by Easton Press of Paulo Coelho's, The Alchemist.  The book is signed by Paulo Coelho, making it all the more a treasure.  How often do you get to hold something in your hand that the author held in his and also hand wrote inside?  The story is a legend... a simple story with a lot to think about.  Sometimes, simplicity is what makes something more meaningful.  I love this book and having it in leather and knowing the author wrote it it and held it is very special.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this for $5 off the normal price on Amazon Prime.  Setup was super easy. Streamed Netflix, HBO Go, Youtube, and Play Movies, all without issue.<br /><br />This really is a cool little device and it is not very expensive. It was cheap enough so that if it did not work out, I would send it back. But it is definitely a keeper. What I like best is I can navigate and search for content on a phone or tablet without tying up the television screen. I think that is a big benefit.  That use case alone makes it more enjoyable to use than Roku.<br /><br />I read rumors that Plex will soon be supported by chrome cast. If that is true, that would be a major win for me. I have plenty of content on my Plex Media Server that I would like to stream to the rooms.<br /><br />Downside of the device? None really, at least not as far as I can tell.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I don't object to a free application being supported by advertising. I do object to a free application being supported by advertising and these ads taking the entire screen for several seconds with no way to know how long I am going to be subjected to them before I can get back to my game in progress. Uninstalled.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|A major disappointment. I have nearly always enjoyed DeMille's work and looked forward to his latest John Corey novel. The plot of this latest was needlessly contrived, the characters were shallow and the dialog was too often reminiscent of Robert Parker's space-filling trick of one or two word back-and-forth verbal jabs taking up pages at a time. I dropped out about halfway through the book and gave it to my dentist.
0385474547|5.0|A classic of African literature, but also universal in its description of the pain from not being able to adapt to change.
B00003CX9W|5.0|It is Fantastic.  I love classical music and the animation with the music is great.  My grand kids love it.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|It was a good book, but not the best one in the world. I mean, during some parts of the book it was really boring, but some other parts were better, so, yeah
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Excellent narrative; takes us back in time and place. Feels like I'm in 1927. Bryson has another winner. Was there a more prescient year?
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was an AWESOME book! I think it is one of Stephen Kings best! I was so excited about it, that some of my co-workers even bought it after I told them of it.! Great Book!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Liked the quaility and price. My 2 year old grandson has older brothers who have legos which are off limits.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I love this case! It is durable, and stylish. It works great when you open & close it! I am a school bus driver, and carry it with me every day. Keeps my KINDLE FIRE HD safe.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have spent a lot of time checking out different card games apps and this version of Spider is one of the best. I can get wrapped up in playing and easily lose track of time.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The story moved at a quick pace. The plot was interesting and held my interest throughout.I would recommend it for mystery lovers.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|THE BEST 3D MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. Ripped this bad boy out to 30gigs which is the cap DvdFab will allow, took a while to render but the final result was EPIC.  I saw it in the theaters on 3D and i have to say it looks better on my 55&#34; samsung 3d tv, the layers of everything just looks top notch.  The water/rain effects make me want to get a umbrella, the visuals of the yagers is more than i ever imagined. One of my fav 3D movies I have ever watched!
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|My first experience with ABR was Constellations and then I bought Leveler and I thought \\"man, these guys are awesome\\". Then Rescue and Restore dropped and it is awesome. I see a lot of people that review this album have the same favorite songs. Well I don't see this song mentioned and it is my favorite. It's called Echoes. Fantastic song. I like Spirit Breaker as well. But honestly as far as metalcore goes. ABR does it right. Even their breakdowns are done awesomely. I am killing this album in my truck and I hear something new on each spin. Love ABR. Rad album
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|One of the best video game movies ever, 3D ripped with DvdFab looks amazing.  Have watched dozens of times and still enjoy it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Ruined the entire series for me.  All the character development from the first two books was ignored as if it had never happened.  The pace was excruciating.  &#34;Death serum&#34; is a nonsensical concept.  Why create a serum that convinces the brain to shut down, when poison effectively does the same thing, reliably, no matter your genetic status?  The ending was repellent because it was unnecessary.  If the event had not happened, the overall plot would have concluded in the same way, only somewhat more satisfying.  WHY???
B00571F26Y|5.0|I read this book after reading Perlmutter's &#34;Grain Brain&#34; and several other books. I began studying the this particular subject (discussed in the this work) after I began researching the Paleo/Primal lifestyle. During studying that particular lifestyle, I'd long suspected that grains, sugars, starches, etc., were the culprits for not only obesity, but the health problems that we face on a larger scale.<br /><br />I got my first dose of this reality when back in 2006, I was nearly 250 lbs and I'd set a goal to get back down to 140 lbs. A daunting task, right? But....I went to a weight loss clinic they put me on a high-protein, low-fat, low-carb diet. Before putting me on that diet, however, they told me that for 2 days as a preparation for the diet, I was to consume as much protein, raw green vegetables and fat as I'd like and limit myself to only one fruit per day. There were no sugars, starches or dairy products allowed during this 2 days. During those 2 days, I ended up losing 3 lbs. I was baffled...I was sure that over those two days, the number of calories I'd consumed must have been through the roof but I still lost weight.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't think much of that 2-day prep phase afterward. I went on with the diet they'd put me on until I reached 140 lbs. But keeping the weight off was a struggle. At one point, I used to utilize that 2-day prep diet when I'd go over my goal weight but still hadn't taken it seriously as a long-term thing.<br /><br />Let's fast forward to now. I began studying the Paleo/Primal lifestyle earlier this year and I couldn't help but think of that 2-day prep period which I underwent in 2006. My studies have lead me to believe that keeping weight off isn't about calories, but about the kinds of food that I consume. Even now, whenever I have a so-called &#34;cheat day,&#34;, I still keep my carbs in check and my weight doesn't fluctuate.<br /><br />A lot of the flack that this book and others like it have caught has come from none other than the vegan community, which consists of a bunch emotional people who can't accept truth. Vegans would have you belief that animal products are the root of all health-related evil but that has been debunked not only in this book but in others like it. Wheat, gluten, grains, sugars, etc., are the true evils in our health. That's why a lot of vegans are such unhealthy individuals....they exclude animal products from their diet and consume heavy portions of the aforementioned crap. You don't meet many obese people on Primal/Paleo but there are plenty of fat vegans.....I wonder why!?come from none other than the vegan community, which consists of a bunch emotional people who can't accept truth.

B00A9V2JSG|1.0|This was literally unreadable.  I will usually power through a read the whole book, but this concept had problems.  If strong emotion is cut out of the population, why the need for religion?  If &#34;love&#34; is the most taboo word in the society, why is her internal dialogue peppered with it?
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Great product with tons of potential. Very much lacking at the moment due to the lack of apps... Main reason I got it was to take it to a friends place and hook up to their TV and showing the pictures I took on my Iphone, However the app that would do that has been banned. So waiting for Google to allow more apps. Would be nice to watch anything on the TV like I can do with Apple TV. Hope it gets better.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Maybe the kids aRe a bit more versatile than I. Have fun with this but repetitive and mundane for my liking.
B008XG1X18|5.0|better than facebook, instagram, twitter, myspace or whatever else!!! pinterest lets you share pictures and is very safe!! I suggest this for a preteen that is just starting social media. I would rate this app 100 stars out of 10. that's how amazing it is =)
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is one of my all time favorite shows. I got behind in watching so I was delighted to be able to watch season 10 straight through on my TV using my Roku.<br />I found it to be worth every dime of the per episode pricing.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|This was a beautifully written story. I truly loved the thorough details on the music.  It brought back fond memories.
B00E4W40C4|4.0|Okay, I bought the extended 3D version because I wanted to see the extended version...IN 3D.  Not an option.  The extended version is just a bluray so now I'll have to watch this movie again just to see the extended version.  If I had known that, I would have just bought the regular 3D version and saved a few bucks.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|I was not expecting to find a somewhat old-fashioned kind of ghost story when i watched this, but that is what I got and i loved it!  Even though it is, by today's standards, somewhat predictable, it was still intense, and there was some parts that were downright creeeeepy..... have watched it twice already.
B008RZ96RS|5.0|Having been a fan of this band for 45 years I always enjoy any new bit of sound that I can acquire by them.<br />The price was excellent as the delivery and condition of what I ordered.
B00FPH51LQ|4.0|This movie seems to have gotten a bad rap, but if you just suspend your disbelief and watch it for the pure entertainment aspect, you can't be disappointed.
B003G4W49C|5.0|only just started reading the book and so far love it, love being able to read it on different devices.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I liked it.  it was not a huge surprise, but the special effects were great, and I thought the storyline was interesting.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I've never EVER cried from a book but this one did it to me! This book is so profound and loving and so many other things I can't even put into words because I just finished and am an emotional wreck. I finished this book in less than a week after staying up way past my bedtime some nights because I couldn't put this book down. GO READ THIS!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This installment of Roth's &#34;Divergent&#34; series is (as usual) well written. It offers some truly deep, introspective narrative even if it is a YA novel. The plot is complex and fast paced, and the introduction of the scientific element of Tris' world was really interesting to read. The split narration was hard to follow at times- I found myself flipping back to figure out if Tris or Tobias was telling the story almost every chapter. The unexpected death at the end of the book did seem unnecessary, if realistic. In a series riddled with so many violent events, and a group of main characters with so much going on, I understand that this particular death was logical. But it was also WILDLY sad!
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|This is the first Cornwell book I had a difficult time reading. I think there was probably too much about the relationships and not enough focus on the work to solve the crime.<br /><br />I was waiting for this book to come out so am disappointed to have to say I found it disappointing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I uninstalled it and now I can't reinstall it!so now it sates open.I think it's glitched but now I can't play it!I wish I could play it on my kindle but I can still play minecraft on my Mac.I do wish I had a gold pickaxe cape on minecraft on the Mac.Message for Mojang:my m.c name: coparoo

B00G2KV92U|5.0|I won't break down song by song, I always believe that you should form your own opinions about what music means to yourself. My introduction to Boston was Third Stage, I loved it! Of course over the years I have discovered the first two albums and have listened to all the records since. Boston has always been Tom Scholz's project. First it was a little more of a band, but definitely by Third Stage it was all Tom. Brad Delp was the primary voice, but even before his tragic passing he was not the only vocalist featured on Boston albums. Life, Love & Hope is a great album. I embrace the different vocalists. Tom's vocals aren't bad at all, just a little different. Is this album a heavy album? No it isn't. Is it a Boston album? It definitely is. I listened to it many times before I wrote this review. Tom is a very talented guitarist, keyboardist, and musician in general. There are some slow ballads on this release. There also some up tempo rock songs. The title track is upbeat for one example. Heaven on Earth is a great song that sticks in your head from the start. So many reviewers protest the use of a female vocalist. Kimberly Dahme is a very talented vocalist and she does a good job on tracks. This release features some re-workings off Corporate America. While I would loved even more new tracks the re-dos are good songs. I enjoyed hearing Brad again on two tracks. My only complaint is the lack of a live drummer. Tom uses programmed drums. They don't sound terrible just not live. The drum programming does not make me downgrade my review. This an awesome Boston release. It has that big rock sound Boston always has. Has Tom progressed the sound from the first album? He has some, but one listen as the first track begins and it is instantly recognizable as Tom Scholz's Boston. Which is what it has been from day one. I just wish he wouldn't wait so long between releases. I know some reviewers don't like it. I do. I highly recommend it! Give it a try. Listen with an open mind. You will like it!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I enjoy reading mysteries about the law and all it's strange intricacies.  John Grisham, as usual, never disappoints!!  I am almost done reading all his books.
B00C8RFS82|1.0|dvd is defective. doesn't load or play. needless to say, a disappointment. I suggest do not purchase this item. not satisfied.
0375851569|5.0|This is a great beginning set to start a collection for Dr. Seuss (any just any collection in general) that includes classic favorites. The books (and outward casing) were all in great condition and the shipping was prompt.
B0091THDOM|5.0|I've been using the case for several days now and I'm really liking it. Great craftsmanship and a good snug fit. The phone being fully encased it is harder to hear it ring, but the added protection from drops and other hazards is worth it. When at home I lay the phone on top of the case and in the car I leave the phone sticking out of the case about one half inch in my shirt pocket. Well worth the money.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|I may be incredibly naive, but I never understood why the rest of the world thought that Americans were so spoiled, opinionated, selfish, wasteful, the list goes on and on.  After reading Baeh's memoir, it puts me in perspective.  To think that Californian's complain when there's too much rain, or too much traffic, or the price of gas is too expensive, and at the same time, there is a 13 year old boy on the other side of the world that is alone, he has lost his entire family, he has to steal to eat, he has to walk and walk until the skin on his feet is peeling off, he has to learn to be a soldier and learn to kill.  Yes, that makes me feel spoiled, selfish, wasteful, etc.  There are terribly horrific things that happen to Beah, and to the people of Sierra Leone.  I feel like Beah could have made his story more gruesome, because that's how his life was.  But he tells his story like you are his friend.  I found that I was looking forward to finding out what happened next, and that as I read I wanted to pull Beah out through the pages, hold him close and offer him protection.  The consequences of militarization in Sierra Leone were horrific, dangerous, unfathomable, and vile and it is important that people in our side of the world understand what is going on in other countries so that we can be a part of making a change.  Also, so we can ensure that these circumstances don't happen in our own country, and it is important to be thankful for what we have and to not be so entitled.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I have this only for stars because it was difficult keeping everyone and their alliances straight. Otherwise a good story. Complex
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This was a very good book in this series. I really enjoy the this author can draw me into this story. If you decide to read this book I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Love this movie! I told my 9 year old daughter that she would like it too, but she didn't believe me at first, she is totally in love with this movie now.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|&#34;Stunned&#34; is a huge understatement.  I thought I knew much of the story of the collapses of 2008...but this took me inside the inner-dealings of the outrageous scams, cons, gambles, corruption & Ponzi schemes I never could have imagine.<br />We should have built an entire jail system just for the crooks & thieves!<br />You just can't make this stuff up...The truth is bizarre, criminally genius & eye-opening.<br />I'd recommend this book to everybody.. especially mandatory for college banking and business courses.
B001O1O71C|5.0|saw the movie and then read the book.  wow...  the ending was an &#34;oh my gosh&#34; heart breaker.  written for youth but holds the attention of adults.
B003GQM52Q|5.0|good acting and good plot with three known actors well worth watching if you are into history that is all
1455525839|4.0|I'm a huge Special Agent Pendergast fan, and have been since reading RELIC. In WHITE FIRE, it was great fun reconnecting with Corrie Swanson (STILL LIFE WITH CROWS) and having a ringside seat as she dives devil-may-care into thesis research and sets about solving the grizzly mining deaths that occurred in the Colorado ski resort area 150 years earlier. Pendergast is his usual brilliant self, and I once again enjoyed &#34;seeing&#34; his human-ness in this installment. Especially toward young Corrie. The murders in WHITE FIRE are, however, not for the faint of heart and the plot a bit muddled. The Sherlock Holmes twist/connection is unique. But I guessed the baddie’s identity, and I'm sure others will as well. Loved the introduction of the brash and gutsy US Air Force veteran Stacy Bowdree and hope the authors bring her back from time to time. I suspect they will. In my humble opinion, this book didn't quite live up to its pre-release hype, thus my 4-star rating. WHITE FIRE is worth the read, but I'm now donating my copy to our local library. It won't go on my shelf of keepers with RELIC, RELIQUARY, CABINET OF CURIOSITIES and so many others from this fabulous writing duo. That said, I can’t wait for the next installment! Forever the fan . . .
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Tried many versions of Mahjong and like this the best. Clear, resizable tiles varied backgrounds are all very enjoyable.<br /> ,
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Love this game, truly addicting.  Only problem is that it tends to sell out fun for the sake of trying to get people to spend money on cash shop type items.  Of the two games, I prefer the knockoff Dragon city due to graphics being better and the fact that they add additional mini games to make it more engaging
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Really easy to use and convenient for when you're on the go. It looks great on the Android Samsung Galaxy S4.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy playing Diamond Dash so much! It's a great pastime when I'm waiting for my planes, or in the doctor's office with my patients. It's so challenging!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|The game it's self I love, but it takes a long time to load and the graphics are kind of lame. It's also really slow, but it's  a great time waster over all<br /><br />Love bunny
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|This was fun.  It reminded me of Men in Black, but it wasn't an exact copy.  It has a different story line just the same feel.  The acting was good.  I enjoyed it.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|Love Megan Ryan and this is a great movie and I think it was based on a true story. Highly recommend and liked the music as well.
B000M341RI|5.0|This movie was a total surprise to me when it saw it.  I loved the scene where they were in the unemployment line waiting for their money.  The song they were practicing came on the loud speaker and they were each not paying attention to the other and were doing the routine in line.  Very funny.  I laughed and cried and thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I still watch it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, so addictive and waited along time for it my Kindle to get it. Can't stop playing it. Great game
B000FC1LHO|4.0|This book would make an interesting study of the psychology of the duality of our personalities/nature's.  Alongside this book I recommend: Heart of Darkness, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Portrait of Dorian Gray, Victor Frankel's Man's Search for Meaning, etc.<br /><br />This is not a horror story in the traditional sense, but an analysis of the power of man's lower appetites \\"licking its chops\\" to gain control of the whole personality.  We have all, at some point, toyed with fantasies of what would happen if we could give into some lurid temptation without consequence.  This book is a brief but riveting exploration of the insatiable monster waiting to be released should we fail to restrain our darkest addictions and compulsions. Read with a friend and leave time for a late night discussion afterward.
0823016714|4.0|Really handy although I think it would have been better if they used the space that the (uninspiring) artwork took up for more photos instead. It's a good resource for face lines and build that you don't have readily available to you.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Wow! It was amazing. It's like i learned about how the moon was created, but I don't remember how now. The step in the bucket was like knowing the why of everything, but now forgotten. This needs to become a movie. It was so enlightening
B00ERIUO02|2.0|The first and second songs are pretty good, but the rest are pretty mediocre.  My 8 year old daughter (who LOVES Katy Perry) even told me she thought this CD was boring (except for &#34;Roar&#34;).  My advice, just buy &#34;Roar&#34; and not the whole album.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American Horror Story is a great show that keeps you engaged and provides a lot of thrills. There is never a dull moment!
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|This movie was amazing and magical. Its one of my favorites by far. I really loved the characters they were very entertaining. I can't wait for it to come out on dvd. This movie is a must have for any disney collection.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Love this move and so does my daughter, got it for her for Christmas.  We will have ours of fun watching it together.  The price was great. Quick shipping no waiting in line to pay or looking all over for a copy

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have looked and looked for this game and as soon as I found it I FREAKED out I did a dance and starting yelling everyone looked at me and I said CANDY CRUSH ON KINDLE!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm scared to death of them there zombies. I'm so glad they only live in China and parts of Guatemala. Not in the holler where my and my cousin and husband do. He is great. My husband. .. But I think he's gonna turn into a zombie sometimes. That's why we don't go to guatamala. Can't take no chances.<br />But why aren't there any pictures
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn does a great job of keeping your attention in this mystery thriller; I couldn't put it down! Not the happiest of stories but a wonderful, intriguing writing style and page turning book.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have read the series and love each book more than the last. If you enjoy fantasy it's a must read.
B00GN76K4Y|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to arrive on Amazon Appstore,it's a very fun game and I have it on my iPhone with most of the characters.Soooo...The Amazon you are the best. :D
B00FQMZ5M0|5.0|My boys really enjoyed this movie!! The planes are cute. It is very similar to cars the movie. Hope you like it too
B00FLDG52I|2.0|I love the concerts....I HATE the discs!Same complaint as several other reviews....Disc Two suddenly became Disc One right before the Jeff Beck slot. I was anxious to see Jeff Beck and the disc from that point began showing sections that were on Disc One. What The Hell! Manufacturing defect for sure. I thought Rhino was better than this. Where can I send this back for a set of discs that work?
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I didn't hate it but I read through it in one day for the sake of reading it and to get to a different book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this bag. I have been using this bag for sometime now and it holds a ton of equipment and can be organized to adapt to any size item.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I got this game and don't get me wrong it is an amazing game but I did not receive my 250Amazon coins!?I got my 30 but that is it.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a nice match  three game with a story behind it. My kids love that the written text is narrated for them. My only issue is that the  game will kick me back to home page after I am done with a level. It only happens sometimes and everything is saved. Overall I like this game.<br /><br />,
B00FATEJYE|2.0|An ok game, but it isn't anything like the original version. An alright game for free, but I wouldn't go for it.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I loved this book because it told in direct terms the reality of life for a women in Pakistan and clarified in my mind how far people will go to control other people.  Malala was delightful in her enthusiasm and description of her life.  Her passion for learning and to serve others was inspirational.  For me, Pakistan became another country with real people, real problems, and a real desire to better life - not another geographical site.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have an autistic boy and he loves to play this game, it is a fast and fun game to play
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are my go-to cans for board use. Very comfortable and well made. I prolly have 6-7 pairs in-house for others to use. The majority of user comments are favorable, though I've had 1 or 2 say they were lacking in bass. But, when I get in these cat's rides, they have so much boom-boom eq'd in they they evidently do not know what well mixed drums/bass sound like.<br /><br />I've only had 1 cable fail, the cat got up and to walk away without unplugging them.  I let him keep them as an IQ souvenir.  lol<br /><br />Of course, the usual disclaimers apply, blah, blah, blah.....<br /><br />And your mileage may, and will, vary.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I do ,if you watched the movie it makes a lot more cents ,but anyways I think this was a great idea I. like the game and if you do too then agree with me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really struggled with the rating on this review.  I was caught up in the story thru the majority of the book (5-stars) but the ending was so abrupt, so disappointing (1-star) that I refuse to give it a 5-star rating.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />The first part of the book is based on the disappearance of the wife (told from the husband's point of view) and the beginnings of the marriage (told thru diary entries of the wife).  The husband doesn't appear to be suitably sad over his wife's disappearance, and her diary entries paint him as a less-than-loving husband who may have married the wife for her money.  But something is off; you would think these entries would make the wife very sympathetic but they don't.  You can't quite put your finger on it.  And I found myself saying &#34;I hope he didn't kill her&#34; because even though it seems he may have, he is more sympathetic than she is...curious.<br /><br />The second part of the book makes it clear that the wife is a major-major-major manipulator.  She is really an awful person.  But the husband has a nice, young mistress so he's a cheating jerk too.  You start getting a little more insight into this marriage and it is an awful one.  But what should be the punishment for being a horrible husband?  Who gets to dole out that punishment?  No question about it, Nick is a lousy husband.  But I found myself thinking &#34;well, who wouldn't be if they had such a crazy wife?!&#34;  And when Amy starts to suffer a little bit (at the cabin, with Desi), you don't even feel sorry for her because she is such a repulsive person.<br /><br />So now we're at the third and last part of the book.  We know what happened with both Amy and Nick.  And because we've been conditioned to expect everything to get wrapped up neat in a nice bow, I found myself waiting for it...and waiting for it...and waiting for it.  It doesn't come.  To add insult to injury, the story that had been so engaging now becomes ridiculous:  the pregnancy just was not believable; what was the deal with the dad's mutterings?  why was Amy whispering in his ear? Are we sure it's not Desi's child? How to pay for IVF? No husband consent for IVF? What about the guy in the casino?  Casino's have great security and nothing was caught on tape with Amy and Desi?  Desi is loaded but there is no security tapes at his cabin? This ending felt rushed and incomplete and (worst of all) unsatisfying.<br /><br />I totally get why some folks gave this book only 1-star; it's the frustration factor.  I was really into the book and enjoyed it until the end.y just was not believable; what was the deal with the dad's mutterings?  why was Amy whispering in his ear? Are we sure it's not Desi's child?

B00GINENG0|5.0|I think that this is a wonderful app fit for all ages. It teaches u how to take care of something or be responsible for a animal.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|*Contains Spoilers*<br /><br />I have so many mixed feelings toward Allegiant. I was such a huge fan of the first and second book of the series so I sort of feel obligated to love the third to show my devotion. But that's where my loyalty ends. I love it but I've seen the faults:<br /><br />1. The idea of VR writing from both Tris' and Tobias' point of view was exciting, that is until I realized I couldn't tell the difference between them! I was constantly flipping back to the beginning of the chapter to see who was speaking.<br /><br />2. YA series or not, I'm still questing whether or not they consummated their relationship. The sexual tension was so palpable between them even I started to get nervous. They had SO many opportunities to do the damn thing and I was left with such disappointment knowing it would never happen.<br /><br />3. It was interesting to learn what was finally \\"outside the fence\\" but even though I tried to understand where VR was going with this genetics crap, I couldn't. I feel like it was an overload of information and it was very easy to get lost in it.<br /><br />4. Evelyn. I understand why people are upset that she gave in so easily but I have seen the aspects of her motherhood. Yes, she was diabolical and manipulative but a mother nonetheless. When she sat in her office clutching the statue she gave Tobias when he was little, it was clear she missed her son. VR would have saved a lot of confusion if it were established a little more but it did make sense to me.<br /><br />5. This, IMO, is what bothers me most. When they decided to use the memory serum on the Bureau and that someone had to DIE for it, why on Earth was it Caleb? I understand he was viewed as a traitor but so was Peter. Not to mention that Matthew was barely a character anyone cared for. Why not him? It was so easy to see that Tris was as good as dead from that point on. We all know from previous acts that she wouldn't let her brother die. Not for the reasons he wanted to die, anyway.<br /><br />6. The ending. Oh, the ending. I'm ok with Tris dying. I really am. It's different and sort of refreshing when an author isn't afraid to kill off her main character. But I keep asking myself, why? Why did Tris even die? What did it even accomplish? I feel cheated on this and I don't see the point in her death.
B0095G5AFU|3.0|Nice app, but far from great.  I took advantage of the FAOTD.  Extremely short on instruction, definate need for improvement in that area.  The search doesn't work, or I haven't figured it out yet.  It would be advantageous to be able to sort, insert or delete pages (not a simple alphabetic or numeral sort, but one you can do &amp;#34;your way&amp;#34;). Once a &amp;#34;bold/italic&amp;#34; option came up on my screen, have no idea how it got there and have never been able to make it return.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Entertaining if not a bit hard to initially comprehend. One might compare it to a planet laden experience akin to what Sandra Bullock endured in the movie &#34;Gravity,&#34; in outer space. Both heroines finding daunting roadblocks in their fight for survival without contact from Earth.  Entertaining. Worth a look see.
1449433251|5.0|The most whimsical and delightful collection ever! Great for any age. I read this whenever I need to decompress or need a good laugh, and it never fails me.
B00GX598FO|4.0|Tongue in cheek former CIA operatives on a mission to save the world while being hunted down by rogue generals and the CIA. A worthy sequel to the first RED movie.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I love Michael Buble' and his musicality.  This is one of my favorite CD's to play while I am driving my car.
B003KRLKHC|4.0|Denzel Washington shines in this post war movie about saving the last known Bible after all bibles had been destroyed as a lead up to the almost total annihilation of mankind. A rewarding ending. Violent but not overboard.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I love this movie. Watching it again on DVD is great. I'm glad I bought it. This is one of my favorite from the '80's.
B00GNL96H8|4.0|The cinematography in this Chinese productions are worth the look see. In this particular case The Grandmaster is the continuation of the &#34;Ip Man&#34; story, the martial artist that was the inspiration and master for Bruce Lee.  This movie isn't a &#34;spaghetti western&#34; in the sense of mindless fights for the sake of the fights.  There is a solid foundation of a story that is easy to follow and appreciate.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had trouble reading book 1. It was a little hard to read for me. Once I made it thru book 1, book 2 was my favorite!. It was romance all the way. After book 3, I wanted more. I just wasn't ready for it to be over. I'm glad I read them this way, there's no way I could have waited between them.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|I haven't found a bad Connelly book yet! Once again the author comes through with a great story! I loved it!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The writing is decent and I was intrigued by the premise. The author constructs the events to ultimately lead the reader to the secret's \\"resolution\\". This was a nice read until the reader becomes quite aware of this construction. Too neat, a bit too on-the-surface of the big questions. How much more difficult for the author (and certainly more interesting for the reader) t'would it have been if the consequences of the secret were met head on rather than with a tit-for-tat. Can a person suffer enough? What kinds of secrets are deal breakers (as in, where is the line?) in relationships? Can one person ever know another?  But again, for a front-and-center-table-of-the-bookstore-read, it was okay.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Lacked the dynamic of the other Iron Man movies. Main character was weak and overly distracted. Lacked the magic of the others.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I read the first 2 books in the series. I thought the stories entertaining, but personally felt that the stories were very short even for the low prices. It seemed the writer and/or publisher was trying to stretch the series over more books.  I felt this so strongly that I decided not to purchase any more of the series.
0142405787|5.0|Wowwwwwwwwweeeeeeeee! I was so astonished at the cliff hanger at the end of the book!!! Can't wait to read the next one! This has been such a great series so far that I don't want it to end!!!!
B003UESJJC|1.0|This is a great film but there is a general problem with the Blue Ray version of this film. That is they tend not to play.
B00E9E4EC8|4.0|I Love Alan Jackson's singing, but Blue Grass is not my favorite type of music.  It was quite good tho because Alan did it, but I couldn't say I \\"love\\"  the music.  It's really good tho, but I can't say I \\"love\\" it, I just \\"like\\" it !
B0089LOG02|4.0|I never knew about the orphan trains and for this reason the book held my interest.  A good historical fiction story but I couldn't get past the sudden transformation of the sulking &#34;bad girl&#34;.  I didn't ring true for me.  Still, a good story and well written.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Walt Disney's Beauty and the Beast is one of my all-time favorite Disney movies.  I just enjoy the story, and have since childhood.  I think the Walt Disney version is sooooo good, and I enjoy watching it !
1451696191|4.0|I have enjoyed this book very much and think it would be a good read for anyone who struggles with high school. Showing them that high school is tough for a lot of people.
B003V6L94Q|4.0|I like most of Zac Brown Band's music.  The album has a number of good songs on it, and there were a few that I wasn't real thrilled with.  So I gave it an &#34;I liked it&#34; rating.  It is a good album over all.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|The blu ray disc only contains the film with none of the special features it says on the back of blu ray cover or on amazon features page.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Being an elderly person myself, I totally enjoyed the Up movie.  I loved the devotion of the cute &#34;aviation&#34; couple, and enjoyed the humor throughout the movie.  It was a cute story !
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Riveting!  Enjoy the history along with the story!  Once I start, I don't want to put it down.  Highly recommend this book!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a Great Movie.  I totally enjoy the humor in it, and such good stars !  Even tho there is quite a bit of violence, it is still a fun movie and really done well !  I'll definitely be watching it more than once !
B00FB029IU|5.0|To all those who were unimpressed at first listen,  please try again,  and pay special attention to the deep cuts.  I find these songs to be compelling and at times astonishing.  I agree it's not as stylistically cohesive as the first album,  and yes,  the production has removed too many rough edges.  But Rubin has let Bugg's talent shine though with minimal interference.  &#34;Pine Trees&#34;  is as stripped-down and achingly lovely as anything on  &#34;After the Goldrush&#34;  And &#34;Simple Pleasures&#34;,  buried near the end of the album,  is a potent and emotional composition that will bring down the house in a large arena;  there was no equivalent on the debut.  Shangri-la earns joint honors with Kurt Vile as my favorite album of 2013
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I enjoy Lady Antebellum's music and harmony.  Love almost all of their songs !  The Own the Night Album includes a lot of their hits.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is awesome. if you download this you will be happy. so if<br />you can download this right now DO IT!!!!!!
B008JFURII|5.0|I think I like RED 2 even better than the original RED.  Just a lot of fun and I loved the humor in it.  The actors in the movie are so good, and looked like they enjoyed making the movie !
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|Such graphics. So Dragon. Much 180. Wow. Much time consuming. Such great. Much wow. -Doge Nah seriously I like this game. It's pretty cool
B00E688KA4|5.0|It kicked ass!  I'm a big fan of Tyr and it brings symphonic metal a new sound.  I especially loved the covers of Iron Maiden and Pantera since i'm a fan of both bands since the 80's and early 90's.
B00G4I11YQ|5.0|Everyone should know what this documentary and the former trainers tell us.  too many of us are in the dark.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very, very challenging game, makes you think and keeps your brain alert. Love this game and so do my 10 year old granddaughter. Can't wait for more updated floors.
B00GLX1MG6|1.0|This could have been a better movie if it would have been a little cleaner. Language was AWFUL,, and I am suprised that Aniston would play this part.
B00D6C5Y28|5.0|Prophetic movie about what the world would be with complete government control, funny and disturbing.  A must see for the millennial generation.  Movie made in mid 1980's.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you get stuck, hang in there you pass the level eventually! I usually get bored with games quickly, but I've stuck with this one, keeps my hands and mind busy! :)
B00742BVW8|4.0|Cinematically beautiful. Loved the use of colors in the stories. The ending was too dramatic, but that's typical of many Chinese movies...sigh.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Can't put it down. Lots of threads and unexpected twists. Nearly everything ties up in the end.<br />Surprised to read about Fermat's last theorem.
B00EV6T6DQ|1.0|This is not based on the content whatsoever, only meant to provide a warning to Kindle users that it is very difficult to read in the Kindle format.  I have begun reading it on my computer in &#34;the cloud&#34; due to the inability to read the font of each cartoon block(sorry, don't know the correct terminology for comics) without zooming in, then out to go to the next, zoom in, out, for each page.  Maybe I'm lazy but it really did interrupt the flow of what I have heard is a beautiful story.  The artwork is beautiful and I'm looking forward to reading it on my my computer.
B006GKHE6G|4.0|Graphics are crisp (they can be lowered or raised for quality), controls are good and responsive, and delivery is great as well.<br /><br />Not many levels, achievements, or options ( abilities, etc), lowering replay value (stunts are a nice feature, though).<br /><br />Overall, nice game. An improved version would be worthy of a perfect rating.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|The hail fire is THE MOST INCREDIBLE GUN I HAVE!!! It is small, never jams, shoots 75-100 feet max, and has a incredible amount of bullets!! The only bad thing is you have to buy the refill pack to get all the bullets and cartridges. I am 9 years old and i LOVE THIS GUN
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Not very versatile and allows limited streaming from iPad. Read up on this device and know it's limitations before buying.  There are many great reviews of this device, but I just don't get it.  The very limited streaming capability from mobile devices is a big letdown. It would be a nice companion to a chromebook, for some, but I much prefer my Roku. If Google gives it considerably more capability in the future, I will consider again.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham continues to make life in Ford County entertaining and compelling. Continuing to explore the life of lawyer Jake (from &#34;A Time To Kill&#34;) is brilliant. Grisham also confronts deep-South racial intolerance themes and holds them up for all to see. I didn't give this book 5 stars, because some of his events seem contrived and not easily believable.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|There were no diverse character interactions. Some sections were boring and tedious. The plot was unique but it took a long time to unfold.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Didn't think this game was going to be thankful is good.  But it was more than I expected. Enough said!
1476747016|5.0|super cute just as i expected (plus I'm a fan of Pusheen so that helps!) It contains many of the same comics you've seen online with a few never before seen ones. It's a great coffee table book to skim through & laugh at this cute, adorable kitty's adventures!
0689505698|5.0|This is a tounge in cheek reversal of The Three Little Pigs.  Young children find this book quite amusing.  A delightful birthday present.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read!!! I can't eat and I can't sleep. I have to keep on reading!  My heart and mind are in turmoil. I can't wait to read the second book in a few hours after I digest what just happened...
B00631HASU|5.0|This game is so much fun.  It is easy to understand and quickly becomes addictive.  While this is an awful lot like an older PC game, it is perfect for the Kindle and has a wonderful story line that makes it a bit of an adventure on top of the fast-paced logic game.<br />The goal is to match up a series of colored balls and gain special gems in the process.  You are trying to keep any of them from falling into the black hole which signals the end of your game.<br />This is great fun overall!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fascinating!<br />Kept wanting to read and I love Peeta !<br />I am going to start book 2asap! I really think<br />This could happen.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|What a clever game!  The goal of this is to pour the right amount of sugar into certain containers, but you must draw lines to get the sugar to the right path.  This involves quick thinking and strategy and each level has a bit of a different twist.  So much fun and a challenge every time!
B002MFX0RQ|1.0|All the captions are in Chinese. Don't think much of it!! Ordered another one. What a waste!! Not worth the money!
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|The  album is awesome I know their is a lot of controversary  surrounding her lately and some stuff is taking it a little to far. But she's trying to come out on her own, but that happens when you have a squeaky clean image as a child sometimes they go overboard and it all comes out at  once. She wanted to do it on her own and not her fathers coat tails. You have to admire her for that. I would definitely recemmonded this cd to anyone who asks!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Me Before You was one of those books that had been on my “to read” list forever. I kept hearing people loved it, but every time I read Amazon’s plot summary, I would decide not to buy it. I want to shake myself – my lesson learned (yet again!!) is that if people keep talking about a book with an unappealing title or plot summary, there is probably a reason (a la The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, The Language of Flowers, and The Fault in our Stars)!!<br /><br />I could not put this book down! I usually stop reading to take notes along the way and I was halfway through the book before I realized I had not taken a single note (oops!). Me Before You is very easy to read and, despite dealing with a very serious topic, it reads like chick lit in a good way.<br /><br />Will and Louisa, the main characters, are both witty and appealing. Louisa is a bit nerdy and nervous, but underneath has a strong sense of herself and a cheeky personality. Will is the more conventional sarcastic type wit. While he is understandably cantankerous about the fact that his previous “big life” has given way to a solitary existence where he depends on others for everything, some of the great moments in the book are when Louisa manages to draw him out of that shell. And their banter brings a lot of lightheartedness to what is ultimately a heartbreakingly sad story.<br /><br />This book was so sad, but so good – I was enthralled the entire way through and completely see why people have been talking about it for a year now! Me Before You is one of my favorite books of the year and would be a great Book Club selection.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
B00GX50ZC4|4.0|I enjoyed the story of history that occurred in my lifetime. The movie covered the key experiences very well. It stopped short of some later years accomplishments.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|i probably should have given this app 5 stars but any app can always be improved so for right now you only get 4 stars
B00631HASU|1.0|Lousy game, uninstalled it, controls wouldn't work<br />No matter what I did, couldn't get it to do anything.<br />No go, not worth installing
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great during any down time.  I move things along faster when I can pass time if I'm waiting for something to happen!
B00GH4R95C|4.0|I am not a Superman purist, so I have no idea if this will be panned as not being standard, and I have a feeling that it wasn't based upon some other stuff I have watched with hubby, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and the many special effects.  I don't care if they are old-school or CGI, I enjoy this kind of flick.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|It arrived at my house and didn't even work. It only worked when plugged into the charger, when I tried that then it was great but this is supposed to be a portable unit.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|John Grisham is a great storyteller.  You can't wait to get back to the story.  This book is pretty predictable from the start ,but still keeps you into it until the end.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Really enjoying this condensed version of castleville. Like the Facebook version better. However this has done well so far. Would recommend it to others
B00C81LYH2|5.0|The expected beautiful Barbie came through once again. As ever she is beautiful again this year. I'm really impressed with how this product keeps reinventing  such fine looks.
B00280LYHS|4.0|Good book  no problems with iPad & kindle , I give it a 4 because I could not get the 5 to work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of the most best games I have ever played.  It stays caught up with the movies and is always fun!  You should totally get thus game!!:)
140053271X|1.0|The devise worked for 30 minutes or less and quit.  I took it to Barnes and Noble to see if they could help, thinking it was my fault.  No luck.  Then I called the Nook Help Line!!  OMG  They speak broken English.  I spoke to about 6 different people.  If you question is not on their script.... forget.  Like &#34; can you told me what Nook you got?&#34;  Buy a Kindle.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|awsome game.need to be able to earn money faster and easier.but other than that  love it.  kidos love it to.
1442337966|3.0|This should be required listening to every person on the earth.  I also own the Secret, which is fabulous.  I love the Power.  My main complaint is there are too many fillers and the information given is the same as the Secret.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I have allways like this movie espacally because of Liam Neeson, and Ewan McGregor but the real reason I got this movie is because of the disc 2, special features make the movie extra cool and special to the fan that wants to connect and see the awesome behind the scenes stuff
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|It was difficult to read this and not think how how amazing it would be as a movie or much my son would love it. It really does have everything you want. A flawed hero. An enemy that can not be defeated. Superpowers. Strange technology. Love.... It's... It's a wonderful first novel and one that I am eager to explore in the coming years.  Kudos!
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|This CPU is amazing. I bought the &#34;customers also bought&#34; motherboard and had a hard time getting them to work with each other. The GFX ability of this cpu is excellent. I had an Nvidia 9800gt and I just unplugged it and am using this now solo.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I was just mesmerized by the whole story and just could not put it down!  It's amazing that this young lad could face so many controversial issues.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Was definitely worth the read.  I can definitely see this being made into a movie.  A easy read and easy to envision the story
006202406X|1.0|Divergent and Insurgent were hard to put down so I was very excited to read Allegiant. Sadly, as many other readers found, the series concluded, leaving me completely disappointed and dissatisfied. I feel as though I wasted a great deal of time reading these books and wish that I could have that time, and money (cost of each book), back. The only positive is that the final book came out before the Divergent movie so now I know not to waste money at the theaters. After all, why would I pay to be emotionally tortured via film when I am regretting the torture via print? Terrible conclusion- not worth reading, watching, or even thinking about another second.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A fun missile command style game! Good stuff
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I lost myself in this book, like the first time I read Dickens, savoring each plot turn and wishing it would last, sad to be finished when I reached the satisfying conclusion.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|It really hits the nail on the head and it's really comforting to finally hear someone express that there is nothing wrong with the way I live and function.
B000T433CO|1.0|Wow.  Terrible.  I cringe at Cameron Diaz's horrible acting in this film.  She completely phoned it in.  Other characters are likable but the plotting and pace of this movie are horribly amateur.  Boo.
B00BAXFACO|4.0|Connelly wrote another great crime mystery. Could not put it down. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good read.
B001SKB1Y0|5.0|good woody allen movie about white people problems (love, what to do w/your life, ennui, self-fulfillment). not as good as older stuff.
B000002GYN|5.0|Great price, delivery and quality! Enjoying the music and heard some songs for the first time. Rekindles memories from vacation to Arizona.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Bubble Blaze is blazing fun. Scoring high with power ups is extremely exciting and mind blowing.Lots of time wasting entertainment!
B007XIO9TU|4.0|Johnny is reaching the end... still has skill but he is missing too many notes now.  His backup bad really cooks and the backup guitar player should have more time to show his stuff.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great when I have a little time to kill.  Love the little minions!  Once you start playing, it's really hard to stop.
B007QXWV1U|5.0|One of the easiest photo apps to use. Well worth the low price...family and friends love what I do with the pics.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Lots of fun to watch.  Bruce is great but John Malcovich was just funnier! Mary Louise is just getting better and better.  She's great in this!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This trilogy is fun, fast paced and leaves you on the edge of your seat. After seeing the movie, I think I'm gonna read them again.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love how u can connect this game with the console version.<br />I have gotten a ton of stuff from this with no cost.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|Because the movie is really good. I liked the way the movie starts and how Luda Chris is introduced. I also like the way Roman is introduced and the fight they had and how Roman got over it. Very good movie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a fun game. And I have a lot of fun playing it it's pretty addictive as well but I still enjoy playing it
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Best movie in the series. The team did really good. The return of letty i loved it i also loved that dom and letty get back together. I love the ending it takes you back to the first one and it shows what family is really about
B00GTCECVG|5.0|This game is the best Android version of Clash of Clans! I had Clash of Clans on my iPod, but this is better! Smoother design, better graphics, just great game. Definitely worth your time! I highly reccomend this app!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Brilliant!  It's quite proper to watch the unfolding dramas at Downton.<br />masterpiece theater does it again.  Be sure to watch this one from season 1.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|505 Games did a wonderful job on the mobile version. It has all of the pre-hard mode features that the Xbox/PS versions have. The multiplayer is great plus I got it for two bucks on sale! It is super fun and you can spend a lot of hours with it. Definitely worth five bucks.
B00GX50ZC4|4.0|I thought Aston Kutcher did an outstanding portrayal of Steve Jobs. The script seemed to gloss over several major points in Job's life and career. Overall I think that it is a great movie about one of the most interesting characters of our generation.
B004498KPU|4.0|If your looking for Hi Def or 5.1 surround sound your not going to find it in Michael Jackson's Vision.<br />But if you want a complete collection of Michaels music videos this is it.
B00G32OMF8|4.0|This is a 3-star film but I enjoyed it more for how well it tied together the trilogy. Ethan Hawke is at his natural best here and you can tell he and Julie Delpry helped write the script. Hers is a less appealing character but the complications are real enough to give the couple a personality of its own.
B00G922EA2|5.0|This is my kind of game. I only hope that there is a sequel to it. I am having so much fun playing it until I don't want to stop. The only<br />reason I am is because I have to charge my Kindle. Keep games like this one coming. Great job!
B00GIXY4M8|1.0|Well i didn't want the crappy 800 B.C. version of the movie i wanted the HD. But i have to go off and get the HD version ( which in this day and age is the normal version) but i didn't read the entire screen to see that the rental version is crap or you could just buy it. Why isn't the HD version beside the buy option. And there nothing on there to get my money back right after clicking to buy it. Obviously i didn't watch it in 3 seconds and would still be buying the HD rental.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Excellent way to log onto facebook. App is easy to use and navigate for any age...whether computer literate or not!
B00632HWOG|2.0|It do not work well with my Kindle. Difficult to delete mail after reading. It have to a. better. way.
B00E8S2JZ4|1.0|Blu ray drive does not recognize the DVD.  What a waste of money!  Perhaps it is a vast conspiracy to make Apple lots of money.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book is way more exciting than the show.  It goes way into details about the characters.  I love it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|He can spin a tale like no other. My only problem with this book was its length. I just read it in chunks. But the concept of changing one big event in the time line is a great subject.  My favorite King novel is still The Stand. And that was one of his longest and greatest books. Read the  book, don't watch that dreadful movie!!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I'm not sure how I missed this book when I wad young, but I'm happy I did because I enjoyed the first read so well as a mature adult.<br /><br />Those from 8 to will surely be inspired to create more joy for themselves, no matter their circumstance.
B003CBVU30|3.0|Filled with comedy and a twist of W.T.H humor. One of those &#34; I can't believe they made this&#34; movies.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|fantastic story. John is a great writer, does keep you interested in the story until the end...I collected this author for years....
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The book was good, not all everyone's making it out to be but will definilty trap you in the story. It's a very quick read.
B00FATEJYE|2.0|This game has pretty good graphics for a phone and tablet but I've seen better. What sucks about this game is that it doesn't have the campaign that it does on the console. Also you have to use energy bars but no-one wants to wait. At least they should make the time shorter. Also you have  to do this battles. Why can't they have two game modes. Other than then that the game is good.
B0062IQNG4|4.0|The music is amazing with various artist telling a great love story. Every song takes u to &#34;That Moment&#34;. Great combination.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I felt the book lacked a vital conviction and I felt the story was boring. If you want a good dystopian book read hunger games or way of shadows
1401938906|5.0|One great book, I'm on my second read and will probably read again. I learn so much with each reading. But it is a &#34;working&#34; book so it's only as good as doing the experiments. The first 2 have worked successfully for me…still working on the others, seems I need to work on my beliefs some. GREAT READ! Wish everyone would read and apply. Enjoyed her funny side, Pam would be a awesome friend to hang out with.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Loved  this game  so so much cant stop playing it its so fun great game for all ages does get to be very very difficult
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Excellent, Love Bruno Mars and this CD did not disappoint. I love almost all the songs. I hope Locked out of Heaven gets lots of awards!
B00GKS2HN4|1.0|I hate this game it wont even let me pass the first level and it took me like 10 min to download this game don't waste your time to download it
B000FC2KL0|4.0|Takes you to the dark side that some of us will never experience except through someone else's stories. Definitely the title fits the book well. Your heart breaks for him and u find yourself wanting to save him the pain, but he came out the other side of it all.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm so tempted to give this freaking game a 1 star...just because it's so addictive!!  I held off for as long as I could while all my friends were playing it and then one day I gave in.  BIG mistake.  Now I'm hooked!  I'd give it 5 stars for the fun and challenge of the game, but I'm a bit disappointed in their way of making money off the game...far more money than the game SHOULD be worth.  After a number of games, you can go to the next level if you meet 3 challenge games, but you have to wait 24 hours between winning one and the next one.  OR you can fork out $1 to move to the next level.  There are also ways to purchase more lives when you run out (you automatically get a new life every 30 minutes, up to 5) and more special candies to help you win.<br /><br />Now, I really probably shouldn't complain at all, since it is a CHOICE to pay for these extra items. You aren't forced to, and if you're patient, you can just play the challenges until you win and then move the next level and you can play with the lives you have and the candies you're handed.  But you have to be willing to do so.  I would suggest that, if you're someone impatient, who has issues with spending money you shouldn't, don't get Candy Crush, as I imagine your bank account can be severely diminished by it if you allow it.<br /><br />Otherwise, definitely fun and entertaining.
B005H2IAM6|5.0|Love it because I used to watch &#34;Starblazers&#34; as a kid....the Japanese Anime series. The film version was obviously a VERY condensed version, but it reminded me of my childhood and how much I loved that series. Very well done!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Ooh, really interesting and challenging game!  It's like a giant puzzle that's also beautiful to look at.  There are hints to keep you going if you get stuck, but once you've played a few levels, you start to notice patterns in what you might look for and where to go next...not because it's predictable, but because it forces you to think analytically about how to solve each puzzle.  I played this on my Kindle Fire.
B00BATG18K|3.0|Meh.  I'm a big fan of Ms. Tan's and I was thrilled about this new book and disappointed half-way through.  I lost interest.  I wasn't able to dredge up much care for the characters after that.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Last month, the BBC series Doctor Who celebrated its 50th anniversary with the television special/movie The Day of the Doctor starring Matt Smith, David Tennant, Jenna Coleman, John Hurt and Billie Piper, which aired simultaneously in 94 countries across 6 continents and set a Guinness World Record for the largest simulcast of a television drama. The Doctor Who special broke rating records on Twitter and Tumblr, even causing more buzz than the Super Bowl and the MTV's Video Music Awards. Additionally, the special appeared on the big screen in 11 theatrical markets on the same night. BBC America and NCM Fathom Events presented the anniversary special in RealD 3D in over 660 select movie theaters across the country, becoming No. 2 at the box office on November 25th!<br /><br />Doctor Who: The Day Of The Doctor is arriving in stores tomorrow, December 10, 2013, on a two-disc Blu-ray 3D Combo Pack and a single-disc DVD, which is just in time for the holiday season.<br /><br />The bonus features included are:<br /><br />Doctor Who Explained - A 50-minute special covering the entire Doctor Who 50 year history.<br /><br />Behind the Scenes Featurette - Behind the scenes access of Doctor Who: The Day Of The Doctor, featuring interviews with the Matt Smith, Jenna Coleman, David Tennant, Billie Piper and John Hurt.<br /><br />San Diego Comic Con trailer of Doctor Who: The Day Of The Doctor<br /><br />Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Tribute Teaser Trailer<br /><br />Two Mini-Episodes - \\"The Last Day\\" & \\"The Night Of The Doctor<br /><br />The Doctor had to jump into his own timeline to save Clara Oswald at the end of \\"The Name Of The Doctor,\\" resulting in the Doctor meeting another incarnation the viewers have never seen or heard about before, played by John Hurt. In The Day Of The Doctor, we finally get to see the great Time War that will destroy his home world, Gallifrey. During this era, he has done terrible things to stop the Dalek invasion and no longer deserves to be called the Doctor, but instead he is known as the Warrior or the War Doctor. To the stop the Dalek from destroying the universe, he steals the ancient weapon called \\"The Moment,\\" a galaxy eater, which would destroy both the Time Lords and the Dalek race, but the weapon has a conscience in the form of Rose Tyler/Bad Wolf. The Moment tries to show him another option than killing his own people and opens up a portal linking to the Elizabethan England and 2013.<br /><br />The 11th Doctor summons Clara Oswald, who just finished her first day of teaching, but almost as soon as she enters the TARDIS, they are forcefully taken by the UNIT, where the Doctor is given a letter written by his previous wife, Elizabeth I of England. She leaves a message stating he is now the curator of Under-Gallery, which happens to have a 3D Time Lord painting of the final day of the Time War. The paintings title is either No More or Gallifrey Falls.<br /><br />The 10th Doctor is in the Elizabethan England romancing Elizabeth I, as he believes she is really a Zygon and proposing marriage may be the only way to find out if she is one of the creatures, but it turns out he is completely wrong, except for the fact that the  Zygons are planning an invasion.<br /><br />The portal The Moment created brings the 11th, 10th and War Doctor together to stop the Zygons invasion through time and possibly prevent Gallifrey from being destroyed during the Time War.<br /><br />I missed out on the original airing, but I did get to watch Doctor Who: The Day Of The Doctor 3D Blu-ray over the weekend. With all the hype surrounding the 50th Anniversary Special, my expectations where mighty high, but I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed by the end result. Lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat did a wonderful job paying homage to the last fifty years and finally bridging the gap between the 8th and 9th Doctors. It's nice to have David Tennant returning one last time as the Doctor, which he blended in great with the 11th Doctor (Matt Smith). John Hurt does a wonderful work as the War Doctor. I actually thought he would play the villain in the special, but I was completely wrong. Being a fan of Billie Piper, I thought it was great to have her back, even though she wasn't playing Rose again. It would have been wonderful if Christopher Eccleston could have came back, but at least the producers added the 9th Doctor using archive footage along with the first eight Doctors. Speaking of the past Doctors, I enjoyed watching the mini-episode Night Of The Doctor with the return of Paul McGann as the 8th Doctor, but I do wish it was a bit longer. The back of the Blu-ray states the movie is 75 minutes, but the display time on my player had it at almost 80 minutes. There is a new Doctor Who documentary similar to the ones on the Doctors Revisited sets, but this one is 50 minutes. Overall, Doctor Who: The Day Of The Doctor is a great way to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the series. I enjoyed watching every minute of it and I'm looking forward to the new direction the series will have thanks to the clever ending.<br /><br />*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review and for the giveaway.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love the game, but would rather pay for it and get to play unlimited times.  Do not like paying for extra moves.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Awesome series. Very well written. Couldn't put it down. Suggest reading Ender's World first to put this one in better context.
015206057X|5.0|This is my go to book for new born baby gifts.  I love Mem Fox, but this one is my favorite.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Timeless. One of our family's favorites. This was one of our library we had to upgrade to Blu-Ray.  DVD arrived quickly and was packed well.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I like how you can have primary and secondary weapons.  In most hunting games you can't do that.  But what I find pretty dumb is assault rifles. Other than that it's pretty good.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|It's a cute game. Tough with the drawback of the bow and I like that additional challenge. I play it every so often.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it so much that I couldn't put the book down! Read it in only 2 days! So excited to read 'Catching Fire' and 'Mockingjay' now!
B000Q9IR0A|3.0|God for those in college that are looking to enter business or be a leader in a business in the future.
031623480X|5.0|Excellent book, provides a lot of helpful information concerning the brain and how to keep your wits. This book has a lot of technical information backed up by thorough research and well documented analysis
B00475AYJQ|3.0|He rambled a lot  in this book. It seemed disjointed  and repetitive in spots. I still enjoyed it because of his fine writing skills but I wish the story would have progressed further in this novel. He is leaving a lot of loose ends to be tied up in the last novel and I hope it doesn't read rushed to the climax. I guess I'll see, as I am too much invested in the story at this point not to read the last one.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Got this set for our adult son & wife.  They Loved it and is a great conversation piece and fun movie for them to watch with their company.  Appeals to all ages!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is awesome dressed differed hgfcvgf hgfcvgf hgfcvgf flight to the clans Kindle YouTube and white fited the galaxy's and glory of clans Kindle
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is an amazing mini series set!  We loved it! The history was so interesting, with really great acting.  We watched it every night after dinner until it was finished THEN we were really sad it was all done.  Thank goodness for the boxed set, we can re watch whenever we like
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham  and Jake Brigance return in a big way. I loved this book. If you read &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; , then you know the lawyer who kicked butt for Mr Haley. He's back and better than ever. Take the time to read and enjoy this newest book. You will not be sorry.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a great game. I think it would stay in the forefront longer than  Angry Birds if not for the irritating out of time feature.  Get rid of that  and it's perfect.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Excellent book - it makes perfect sense. if you need inspiration to stop eating wheat - this will do it.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|The other reviewers were right, it got boring.  It was passable to waste time, not that funny.  Then at 20 minutes to end I was wanting it to finish already and was hoping it would have something new, but it started reminding me of Ghostbusters, and  it did not have any surprises.<br /><br />But the movie did get me thinking.  I was wondering in the first parts why two out of the first three Deado bad guys they gave names to had Polish surnames (Nawicki and Pulaski).  I then watched credits to see who wrote this and why would they do that?  Then I started waiting for the next Deados and wanted to know if they'd be named and if so what name.  That took me out of the story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the Hunger Games books.  Love story but with some great action and moral thought.  I had this sent to my Kindle along with the others and got it immediately without any down load problems or any other issues.  Thanks Kindle!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a beautiful, beautiful book. It's tremendously complex and simple, and lovely and practical.<br /><br />Characterizing it is difficult. It has an excellent structure; I don't want to discuss the structure here, as it would be spoilers, but it was very poetical. The characters were well-drawn and complex. The imagery of the circus almost overwhelms the story sometimes, like a tremendously ornate framework for a painting that in the end is an artwork in itself.<br /><br />I liked it very much.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Who doesn't love these books?  Men and women alike love the story and they are exciting to read.  Love the way the books make you think about things long after you have read them.  I downloaded these books to my Kindle without any problems or issues.  Thanks Kindle
B000JIHP88|5.0|Colorful, musical, action mobile.  The figures face the baby instead of the colorful part facing upward toward the adults. Very pleased with the price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this on the advice of my daughter and fell in love with all the characters and especially the story.  I couldn't wait to read the rest.  This is a book both men and women can relate to and enjoy for men it is the action and for women it is the love story.  At least that is how my husband sees it and he has read all 3 books as well.  Really exciting to read and easy to follow.  Well worth the download to my Kindle.  I have not had any problems with downloads or anything.  Thanks Kindle!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|We love every song on the album and can't wait for the next one to come out.  Adam is such a great entertainer, loved him on american idol and more now that he is on his own!
B00133KHCY|5.0|My husband and I caught part of this movie while at a friends house and had to buy it to see the rest.  Love the music, characters and end.  Great family viewing and the ideas that it presents.  A must see if only for the pure enjoyment of music.
B00FE0LQ8G|4.0|I'm not finished reading it, but so far it's a little heavy on history of old brew houses and light on recipe formulation.  I'm guessing that will come, but right now I'm not chomping at the bit to continue reading.  It's good, just not great.
1455525839|4.0|As I expected, the writing in this book was well done. The characters are likable and there is considerable action. However, the believability quotient is really tested in some of the actions of Corrie and of Pendergast, in my opinion.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|I have been waiting for injustice ever since it came out on ios, and finally has. Amazing game. Great gameplay.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|this is one of the best series ever presented on television;  writing, directing, acting,  costumes, location, graphic effects.  everything about it left us wanting more.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Works very well.  Really needed for tropical waters.  It comes with a lanyard so you don't lose it underwater, but the lanyard sometimes drifts into the picture.  The filter snaps on pretty securely, so if you are careful loss shouldn't be a problem.  Remember to take it off when down less than ten feet, or it will turn your photos red.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I chose three stars because it was interesting but not great. Ive waiting to read this for a long time and I think I was slightly disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really good app, but, the kindle fire updates are taking tool long. I've been waiting forever for the new update where i here three is red stone and mine carts.
B00B5AAW52|5.0|This is a Great show, and it's a better price to buy the whole set, so this is the option you should go with to get the entire collection.
B00631HASU|5.0|Other than King Oddball and its glitches with saving and no way to exit. I love all the games they produce. This is no exception and is fun to play. Good permissions too,although I would like no network.
159562015X|5.0|I used this book to find my top five strengths.  The analysis was right on.  Even my wife said it described me completely. I liked the process so much I shared it with my CEO group.
0374531943|5.0|THIS IS A WELL WRITTEN BOOK CONCERNING THE 1960'S SPACE PROGRAM.  THE AUTHOR HAS A VERY NICE SENSE OF HUMOR AND IT SHOWS IN HIS WRITING. THIS BOOK READ LIKE A FICTION, BUT OF COURSE IT IS NOT.  IT DOES HAVE SOME TECHNICAL DETAILS BUT THEY ARE EXPLAINED QUITE NICELY.  A MUST READ FOR INQUIRING MINDS.......
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This does not disappoint!  Love love love!  Can't wait to read the next one, and the next one, and the next one...
0345803485|1.0|So... how did everyone like that tampon scene? You know. When Christian and Ana are in the bathroom and Christian pulls out her tampon and... yeah. You should know, the original scene had Edward just dropping the bloody tampon onto the floor.<br /><br />I'm really just curious.
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|I would enjoy the game more if I wasn't kicked out of it every time I zoomed in on the gates after the car crash.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Over well written and gives a new insight into to the prison system. Definitely recommend reading this book, you won't be disappointed.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|beautiful graphics...puzzles were fun and challenging.. this was the first of this type of app/game I have downloaded and I'm so glad I did !!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Had a blast playing this game, kids love it too. Lags a little on my Kindle Fire HD but not often.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I couldn't finish the last book. I was within 100 pages of finishing and I couldn't do it.<br /><br />I bought the book based on the similarities to the Hunger Games, but there is no comparison. This is bad science fiction for 13 year old girls.<br /><br />Continuing the comparison with the hunger games which was also science fiction for 13 year old girls; the difference is in the plot and the prose. The hunger games had a straight forward plot with well written prose. The plot in this series was back and forth emotionally driven garbage. The prose was weak and the detail in creating scenes was very poor.<br /><br />I always finish what I start. I continued thru 3 books out of curiosity about how it ends.<br />The silly twists and turns of the personal relationships taking control of the overall plot jut turned me off to the point that didn't care how it ended. I stopped 100 paged from the end. Should have been a single book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Still too choked up to think or write clearly; certainly not as wittily as Hazel or Augustus could have done. All I know is cancer sucks, life is a gift, and we are all just...temporary.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Sound is good. Installed it into a helmet for moto vlogging with a GoPro Hero 3 camera. 20ft cable is good for regular intended use but, wish there was a version of this with a shorter cable for my intended use. Managed to stuff the excess cable in the helmet. Can lose the wind sock easily so, I ordered a 6 pack of replacements for lavalier mics that fit well.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is an outstanding series. I really enjoy how the family's and the staffs' outlook and attitudes are examined through their discussions and how that brings about changes in their lives.  It shows a very human element to this &#34;proper&#34; British household. Very well done!
0399161287|5.0|A raw behind-the-scenes look at the life of Mike Tyson told in a refreshingly honest and entertaining way that only the former champ could.  I'm a little over halfway through and it's hard to put down.  I typically read more business oriented books but this is a well-written book that I would highly recommend!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is an easy alternative to the console version. It has great graphics and cool characters. It takes some work, but it can be fully enjoyed without spending real money.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My favorite, I have to hide it from my children- favorite Disney Movie of All times- I was glad I was able to purchase it before it returns to the vault
B008MWBY6W|3.0|This is a nice bag for camera & one lens. Terrible choice for Amazon to bundle it with the Canon T3 and two lenses. This case was not designed for two lenses. They DO fit but not very comfortably. Will probably find another that will fit all three pieces.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I was hoping to buy the CD, I love this group especially the Christmas songs! I have a long commute to work and I listen to CDs,  This is very disappointing that there are no CDs as an option :-(
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Needed to play mov files on Kindle fire. Easy & fast install. Worked perfectly.<br />Much easier than doing file conversion.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|What's not to love about this series!  I have all of them and this one is no exception, best series on TV!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun game that does not require too much thinking although I have not tried the more difficult games. I find the colors very pleasing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much. I cant stop playing it. I don't want to stop. This game is so so entertaining
B00DBO1YMK|4.0|The cd itself is absolutely great.  Arrived damaged and cannot listen to songs past #7.  Returning is rough with Amazon.  Asked for a replacement -- could not compute and could not reach customer service.  Hopefully got my refund instead of replacement.  Drove to Target, got one.  Will do that next time.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Perfect game for any kid! This app ended up being the savior for those long road trips. My little cousin had no problem navigating the app without my help (big plus!), and he definitely enjoyed it. The game itself has a wonderful intuitive design, definitely kid friendly. This kept him busy and he was learning something!<br /><br />5/5
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This is a good time killer, with a fun little story line. Nothing complicated or really intense to figure out, just pop the bubbles.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|This is not my sort of game, but as Free Game of the Day, the price was right. I'm still coping with the adrenaline rush of trying to steer these boats, I tend to tilt the kindle the wrong way, but whew this SIM is fast and very smooth, even as I pushed up the quality of the graphics. I am very impressed. And the sound as you go through tunnels and under overpasses is awesome. I unlocked the third course, but I get confused where the course jumps over itself.<br /><br />WARNING: This game is potentially addictive. Unless you've used and mastered other sims of this sort you will consume HUGE amounts of time while trying to improve your control and mastery.<br /><br />The interface is nicely designed. The tilt and touch versions (two of them) are both easy to understand and use. I don't have a came controller, so I cannot attest to that interface, though I would hazard a guess and say it's just as good.<br /><br />Tomorrow the price returns to $2. I've paid more for less fun and this runs very smoothly. I see the second set of boats and courses is available for $3 and damn if I am not tempted.<br /><br />The next day: after spending more time with the game I am finding that turning the sensitivity back up as you start going faster is quite helpfully, but I am glad I saw a review hinting to turn it down. To set game options, choose and start a course then immediately press the tab for the kindle controls. Press the back-end and you get a horizontally scrolling menu.
B00E7RZEI0|3.0|It's okay but some of the levels can be annoying to try to beat. I got this game as the free app of the day.
0143038095|5.0|This book is a masterpiece of immigrant literature. Tan is a marvelous story teller, and each story could stand on its own as a gem.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I honestly don't know if this app really helps train your mind, but it's a good time waster to play with. I wish they would add online boards to make it more competitive, but it's nice to play when you're bored.
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|This is as good as any work by the standards trio.  That is not something I would have taken for granted, because in my view, Keith Jarrett's solo work of recent years is a considerable step down from his past masterpieces.  But, this album shows he is at the top of his game when it comes to the trio.  And that goes for Gary Peacock and Jack DeJohnette as well.
B00902AKK4|4.0|Great puzzle game with pretty good variety. Only about 50 levels, but many different concepts to keep you entertained. Highly recommended.
B005D63ICI|5.0|The characters, storyline pace, and excellent cast is always top notch. The storyline always keeps me coming back to see what's next!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Candy Crush Saga<br /><br />I don't like the limited plays. When I play a game I like to continue until I want to quit.......Not run out of lives.  And have to wait 1/2 hr or more before I can play again.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very fun, enjoy this game very much. Can't. Stop playing, have to check in on the game daily. Easy to catch on.
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|Disney has taken this movie to a whole new level. ***no spoilers****<br /><br />The visual effects, the music, the adventure, the love, the comedy. This is by far the best Disney has made. This is by far a movie that will live through the ages as an amazing story that captures the true essences of being different and being good. That no matter how different you are, and no matter how bizarre things can get, you always have a way out, and that is always with the power of love.<br /><br />The music captures the complex, and deep layers of the soul by exploiting the very fabric of what makes them and why they do the things that they do. From the first scene it tells you a story of how rooted you are in your ways, but no matter how deep you are, love can always make you do things differently for the better.<br /><br />The power, the romance and the music give this a front seat to the very meaning of being you, and to shy from it, will only make you miserable and disconnected. The message is clear. Love and you will be free.<br /><br />Bob Marley had a thought once &#34;he believed he could cure racism and hate, literally cure it by injecting music and love into people's lives&#34;<br /><br />Disney has captured this into this movie. Love for one another is the most powerful force in the Universe and we have concurred everything good in this world by loving one another.<br /><br />Just like Beauty and the Beast caught my magical interest of love for your soul mate, Frozen, has captured my magical interest into loving one another.<br /><br />By far, to me, the best movie Disney has made, and would highly recommend for a Best Movie award at the Oscars.
B003U6BE8I|3.0|There are some well-known actors in the film but the movie is not one that I will watch many times.
B00E7PQVHK|5.0|I recently completed this game in under 40 hours (not counting lost time from saving before getting my butt kicked) and enjoyed it from start to finish<br /><br />You need to set up your units vertically (to attack) or horizontally (for defense) in sets of three. Special units can take more set up but reward you with higher attacks (and dazzling animations). There is a bit of luck associated with this game as your troops are randomly placed on the field but skill/knowledge of the game can make up for poor positioning<br /><br />You get to play as every race and there is a battle mode to play outside of the storyline. You can &quot;hot seat&quot; and play with a friend. These items give the app replayability.<br /><br />The only bug I ran into was saving on the spot of a side battle character caused it to bug out and not let me battle him. So save on spots that don't have anything associated with them to avoid this<br /><br />Overall is a great game and a good distraction. Nice graphics and an amusing time sink
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Such a fun family movie. We saw it first at the theater when my kids were young, came back the next day with Dad to see again. Remains one of our all time family favorites!!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Dr. sleep<br />An excellent book by King.  A wonderful story by a masterful writer and he kept it almost monster free.  Have read most of his books and this is a good one.<br />Olive
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Very useful and easy to operate program. I used it years ago when I had a Palm PDA. They've updated it successfully for the<br />tablet technology.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Very fun game- almost a hybrid of bubble world and candy crush(the life system)... addictive and challenging enough yet not too tough to where you want to throw your kindle out of the window !
B003JUGQ38|5.0|One of the better seasons. Gotta love the Dr. It was a pretty wild ride, and it left me broken hearted but hopeful.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so amazing! Read the entire book in about five hours. Could not put it down. Very good read. Very sad,but very good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book realizes the complexity of choices. It reveals humanities flaws and strengths. It questions ideologies and allows the characters to stumble through the hard choices they need to make. I had a hard time putting my ipad to sleep.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|RED 2 brings back retired C.I.A. agent Frank Moses (Willis) who reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device.<br /><br />For those like me that enjoyed the first installment of RED, you will get more of the same and enjoy this movie as well.  With this band of characters, especially Malkovich, who mix a good balance of humor with the action sequences that the movie is known for.  Malkovich's nutty character kept me laughing all the way through with his antics.  The action is fun and fast paced and the story, although not terribly original and pretty straightforward and transparent with no hidden secrets really, is entertaining all the way through.<br /><br />Hopkins also does a great job as the crazy mad scientist and has always done well in those type of roles bringing an almost comedic craziness to the character.<br /><br />I think this a good one to watch and enjoyable. Like I said if you liked the first, you will like the sequel.
B000002KBU|5.0|Love the music, had this as an LP many years ago. Also love that it is on Amazon Cloud too.
B007MDB71O|5.0|One of the best adaptations of the Books I have seen yet. Really loved the Green Martians and I thought they handled the makeup for the Red Martians (Humans) very well. Be interesting to see how they handle the other specie of Barsoomian people.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I am giving this as a gift!  I bought it when it was on sale during black Friday... I couldn't pass it up at the price it was at!  Now my husband and I can catch up on previous episodes soon :)
B00F91H15W|3.0|I thought I'd like this purely because Emma Watson Harry Potter Alum was in it, but her version of a Valley Girl was hard to watch.I generally like Sophia Coppola's films but I think I liked the Lifetime Movie of this better.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I am giving this as a gift!  I bought it when it was on sale during black Friday... I couldn't pass it up at the price it was at!  Now my husband and I can catch up on previous episodes soon :)  I love this series!
B006GKHE6G|1.0|We liked it but we really want is a Good zombies game like world at war zombies but for playable on kindle fire HD all maps are the same if not vary close to looking the same o 1 star it was lame
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I am giving this as a gift!  I bought it when it was on sale during black Friday... I couldn't pass it up at the price it was at!  Now my husband and I can catch up on previous episodes soon :)
B0013F1D02|4.0|I loved this movie, great fantasy film, unique in its storyline, and fun. DeNiro is great outside his typical tough-guy mobster persona.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The BBC series never disappoints. No glamour shots, just regular life with all ups and downs. I hope they continue the series!
B00FLDG52I|5.0|I have all of these and this one stands out. Clapton is still a great great artist. The performances were outstanding. Even John Mayer(whoa). This new kid Gary Clark Jr. is outstanding. From my standpoint Eric having jazz players like Earl Klugh and Kurt Rosenwinkel where wonderful. Both of whom are incredible players. It's great to see mutual respect amongst the players regardless of their chosen genre. There were a couple of people here that shall remain nameless that just where a waste of time. Beck was magical. Lambeth is a total original and has  incredible energy. Of course what's the world without Keith Richards but a really really boring place. Erics opening performances where wonderful. This is definitely a keeper. Love the interviews. How do you not love BB and Taj Mahal. Enjoy!!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Very touching story and it is beautifully written. I am very interested to see the book come alive in the movie theatre...
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Great game, but not  enough to unlock....too expensive<br />Intro too short, great graphics as usual. Play whole game if cheaper or better yet FREE.
0441013597|3.0|The story is magnificent!  But the paperback is printed literally margin-to-margin and in a small font.  You have to break the spine of the paperback to be able to read the print that goes all of the way to the inside margin.  Very annoying, and it definitely shortens the life of a book that I hope to re-read several more times in my lifetime and to loan out to friends.  Reviews sound like the Kindle edition wasn't edited very well either, so I would advise buyers to purchase the hard cover.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|This is a great app for people to learn a language! As long as you practice every day you will learn your new language! The only thing I do not like about the app is the microphone because it doesn't read your voice even if you say it correctly.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Truly one of the best soundtracks of the decade. It makes you dance and sing along with Christina and Cher! The music and the musical numbers were the highlights of the movies so whoever watched the movie, should definitely buy the soundtrack. It worth the money and it will become a classic musical for the years to come. The movie and the soundtrack were nominated for awards at Grammys and Golden Globes.<br />Christina's vocals are massive and Cher did a great comeback. I am obsessed with Welcome to Burlesque, Express, Show Me How You Burlesque, Bound to You. I wish Cher and Christina had recorded a duet for the movie. I wish they had included the Jungle Bells instrumental song.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addictive game. There are so many levels that you'll never get bored. The levels get more challenging as you advance. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play games with friends.
1455525839|4.0|Another excellent book in the Pendergast series!  We keep learning about this puzzling man named Pendergast...he is brilliant! This story is a real page turner!
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|A truly remarkable range of music genres for all tastes. Easy to use and to save favorites. Reasonable help explains how to mix, skip, and ban individual artists.<br />Free registration is required for advanced features, but I haven't been deluged with spam yet.<br /><br />Sound quality won't match an expensive sound system, but is as good as other audio on the Kindle Fire, which makes it more than acceptable.
B008FC4WA4|1.0|I love Nick Hornby but this was seriously disappointing. Another reviewer said the ending was weak. I agree- it wasn't just a weak ending, the story simply stopped.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|If you are looking for a book about gods, or about a man among gods, this is not for you. This is a novel about one author's perspective on the blended, thinned out culture of America. It is a well spun narrative about a nation's identity crisis. The land is old, the people are new, and a balance will be found. But unlike Gaiman, I do not hold our nation or its people in disdain (it seems that way to me). I embrace America's growing pains as we leave the infancy, and grade school innocence behind. This tumultuous adolescence will make or break the empire. The nation moved from one of production to one of consumption. Can we grow in that direction responsibly or will we parish at our own folly? Gods only know.
B000P0J09W|5.0|my grandson wanted it ,I have a copy which he has almost wore out,now he has his own great family movie
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|signed a petition to request a sequel, and I never do that kind of stuff. That's how amazing it is!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Awesome!!! I have several 3D movies but this one had the best true to life 3D.Clever special effects and good story line. I would definitely recommend this movie.So buy this movie if you don`t have 3D, the special effects are still great!!!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I read the books first and think that the movies could of gone a whole different direction than what they did. They left me feeling like something was missing. Not at all as descriptive as the books and there could of been so much more made with this movie. Especially with today's technology! An ok movie but wouldn't watch again.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I had high hopes for this game and I was not disappointed. I cannot wait for the next chapter. Thank you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|quick play game for when I am waiting for my kids to come out of practices etc.Just a way to keep my mind active while passing the time.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|A game to relax and have fun with while being challenged. Just started so I look forward to playing more.
B006O6F932|5.0|loved it and arrived on time and in good shape and was easy to set up made granddaughter very happy very easy to set up and take down very happy.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is an amazing app. If u love to edit photos this is a good thing for u. If you have pimples on your face you can remove them and make ur teeth whiter and your face softer.i love this app i suggest you get this now.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|I am giving five stars to the final season, as I will give to all prior seasons of Dexter.  I have watched Dexter since it first aired on Showtime and have been faithful throughout the years.  Michael C. Hall's portrayal is superb.  I do not agree with most of reviews of Season 8 as being as bad as some people thought.  Yes, there are many holes in the plot line and I feel Masuka's daughter's storyline was not needed and did not really go anywhere.  I thought the &#34;brain surgeon&#34; storyline was interesting.  I found the scene with Dexter taking Deb off life support very sad.  The final ending was definitely not expected.  I am sad to see the series end, but I think they have taken the series as far as it will go.  I definitely will miss Dexter.  If you are a fan of the series as I am, you will still enjoy the final season.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Love this app. Works great. However, one of my stories will not be read by the &#34;read-to&#34; part of the app.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|My sister and I love this show! Just wish my sister would buy her own seasons so she can stop borrowing mine ;)
B007SOQBCM|4.0|I love it. It's really nice to watch live streams. But for the kindle. You can't see or interact with the chat like you can for an I pad so if you want to enter in a giveaway you can't cause you need the chat. Also the streams a lot of times is really slow or just stops the stream so you have to reload it. So it does need some work for kindle
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|nice subtle improvements and extra details, the changes do not overshadow the most important part of the film- the story.
B007ZSE1M8|5.0|Like so many Scorsese projects this doc is a little too long, but what great stuff.  There are so many cheesy documentaries about rock stars.  This isn't one of them.  It's rich with music, interviews, new (for me at least) video and gorgeous still photographs.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have never had any trouble with this app. I sometimes use it for work and it has never let me down.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Exciting, fast paced and with a surprising ending... Pretty logical and brainy, and although obviously a fantasy, i would've have liked loose ends to have been even tighter.  All in all a nice entertaining movie.
B000QCQ9O8|5.0|An extraordinary tale ver well told. The author's insight of the characters' psyche are marvelous, and the ending is, perhaps, one of the best that I have ever read.<br /><br />A rare case of a first rate book that was made into a first rate movie. I had seen the movie and knew the plot, but could not stop reading!
B00574P9EQ|3.0|Way better than the books, in my opinion.  The acting is good and the storylines are clean & fun.  We had a nice afternoon watching with young family.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|PTXmas makes a great gift for anyone.  Pentatonix is unquestionably talented and as a singing group they bring together a synergy that hasn't been seen in decades.  Their style of music is refreshing, profound, and counter to what the giants of the music industry supply to the markets.  With the advent of the internet you now have the ability to support the types of music you wish to see burgeon, Pentatonix didn't go through the industry's music filter, they went around it.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|I have never reviewed a book before and won't go into great detail, but I felt compelled to say that this book was amazing. I have read  almost all of Connelly's books and think he is a fantastic author, but this is the first time I have ever had a real emotional connection to the characters. This is by far his best.If you are new to Connelly go back and read the series in order. Also, don't be afraid to try out the Harry Bosch series.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Good plot though some of the characters didn't seem critical to the story. Can't help but wonder if this could really happen (frightening thought) today.  Good thing it's just a movie.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Things you should add:<br /><br />-More sharks in top secret area (Ex: Teleporter Shark)<br />-Allow players to be able to exchange coins for gems (Ex: 1,000 coins for 1 gem, 1 gem for 1,000 coins)<br />-Larger map (like in the original hungry shark games)<br />-More animals/people (Ex: Surfer, seal, squid)<br />-More bosses (Ex: Giant octopus)<br /> This is all I could think of so far, when I think of something else, I will add it to this list!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I LIKED THE CONCEPT BUT DID NOT LIKE THE ENDING AT ALL.  WAS DISAPPOINTED IT DIDN'T COME TO A BETTER CONCLUSION.  WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM AND/OR HER.
B00DH4BL4U|5.0|Amazing read that offers personal insight into the crazy life of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Absolutely loved it, as it made you feel as if you almost part of the crowd during many of Zlatan's important matches highlighted throughout the book.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Dumbest game ever. I can't figure out why it's so popular.  I heard so much about it so I thought I would try it out.  I can't recommend this to anyone.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As a lifelong Catholic who went to parochial grammar school and a Catholic college, I know Jesus’ message, but lack understanding of the political and cultural times Jesus lived in. After slogging through Crossan’s Historical Jesus and being offended by Crossan’s Biblical fact cherry-picking and his discrediting of Jesus’ miracles and resurrection, I found Zealot to be a highly readable look at the historical Jesus. I did appreciate that Aslan did not downplay or discredit Jesus’ miracles, and stated that the witnesses to his resurrection preferred to die rather than recant that fact. Having established those facts, IMO to say that Jesus was crucified for sedition does not take away anything from Him. His popularity was threatening to the status quo but he was a man of peace. The Jesus as zealot angle seemed more like a way to “pitch” or “market” the book and not a real convincing argument that Jesus exhibited the personality characteristics we think of when we hear the word zealot.<br /><br /> That being said, I learned a lot from Zealot. Jesus had a brother named James the Just who was carrying out his message after Jesus’ death? Saul/Paul was a lone wolf who went rogue on the Apostles and coined the name Jesus Christ? The Jews of Jerusalem were extinguished by the Romans several decades after Jesus’ died? I didn’t know that. Some of Paul’s letters are raging against James--that is kind of an important detail when one hears them read from the pulpit. I felt Aslan was not out to prove how smart he was and did a great job of presenting his material, even the considerable endnotes.  When you read the bible, and listen to some of Jesus’ parables and stories, it can be confusing, but when you understand the political turmoil of the times Jesus lived in, it enhances his overall message.
0525478817|5.0|This is officially the fourth book that has ever made me cry.  But as sad as it was, it was so well written and I adored every minute of it.  I loved Hazel's voice and her intelligence.  There were so many clever and touching moments.  My favorite scene was Gus and Hazel's dinner in Amsterdam and I couldn't keep myself from smiling as they sipped champagne on the canal.<br /><br />There were two quotes that were especially profound and captured the atmosphere of the book.  \\"...Mom sobbed something into Dad's chest that I wish I hadn't heard, and that I hope she never finds out that I did hear.  She said, `I won't be a mom anymore.' It gutted me pretty badly.\\" \\"[Dad] was waving back, and crying.  It occurred to me that he was probably thinking he might never see me again, which he probably thought every single morning of his entire weekday life as he left for work, which probably sucked.\\"  The sad subject of children with cancer was delivered with such honesty and sincerity and I felt honored to read about Hazel's experiences.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it was a great game to play. it is really fun and worth getting. I hope people enjoy this version of the game.
B007IX383I|5.0|I’m a huge fan of progressive rock and have always adored albums that feel like one continuous track. From Jeff Wayne’s Musical Version of War of the Worlds all the way to The Who’s Tommy and, what is in my personal opinion the greatest concept album to date, Dream Theater’s Scenes from a Memory comes an amazing contender to just few of the fascinating albums mentioned in this paragraph – Weather Systems by Anathema.<br /><br />This is an ambient album that is both powerful, emotional and beautiful. The balanced use of vocalists Vincent Cavanagh and his brother Daniel is matched equally with the inclusion of female vocalist Lee Douglas who plays a slightly more prominent role in this album when compared to the previous 4 albums in which she features.<br />If you’re new to Anathema, then this album sums their sound entirely. As a band who has gone from Doom/Death Metal all the way to an ambient symphonic rock – this is certainly an experimental group who have paved the way for themselves rigorously in their 20+ year career<br />.<br />Each and every song stands out on this album with Untouchable Part 1 & 2 bringing you into one of the greatest records of our age.<br />It’s an emotional journey that cannot be given justice with words alone. For some, it may be difficult to get into and it may require some growing time but this is certainly a masterpiece in every sense of the term.<br /><br />Almost like a religious congregation’s worship recording; there are parts of this album that will cause the hair on your neck to stand. I cannot fault the release and I am incredibly excited for the follow-up album. You’ll get just under an hour of great songs and interesting melodies with Weather Systems and trust me, you won’t be able to skip any of the tracks.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It was really HD, and the quality was better than I imagined. I use the Roku, and that could have enhanced the clarity of the picture. I don't know, but all in all, it was a very clear picture.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Harder to access info compared to previous release. The advantage is you access. Much more detail. I am sure the format will become more intuitive with time.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Like the titles says too many clicks but fun game so I will still play it all the time  so I hope to play against all of u Hunters
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great action, gritty, and sad.  This movie has it all.  It was especially sad at the end as one of the major stars was taken out of future movies by being killed off.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I heard bad things about it, but I don't know why I heard negative reviews.  I enjoy both zombie and Brad Pitt movies, so I'll give this movie 4 1/2 stars if I could.
1440503257|5.0|Very cool book for the Harry Potter fan who has everything. Written in a fun font and with loads of actual recipes, many that are recognizable from the books.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|A very depressing movie about a very sad disease, alcoholism.  Everyone should view this movie and show it to their teenage children.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Great series.a lot went into making this series. History is important and yes life was really like that! It is very violent, but that is the point. It is not just random violence thrown in so it sells.
B00C74SHRK|5.0|I found this book totally engaging, hard to put down. Great story, beautifully written, insightful and dramatic. Her best book. When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it.
0307454886|2.0|This just did not have a plot that interested me.  It might interest others, but I just found it dark and boring.  I didn't feel in suspense or dying to read the next chapter.  Just not my taste.
B009EELBIS|5.0|This  is truly a classical family movie.  You will never get tired of watching it. It stirred up all the good emotions in me.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|IT was ok but hard to figure out how to exit it and so I just deleted it .. I am sure others will enjoy but not for me
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The item doesn't work as advertised. The only thing I can get to cast is youtube. Netflix just stays on the loading screen and hbo go loads for a few seconds, stays on a blank screen for a minute, then resets to the chromecast default screen. I tried emailing google support but they were completely useless and barely even tried to help. I'm exchanging this for a roku box.<br /><br />Edit:<br />I got someone on the phone who was extremely helpful. As it turns out you can only cast from your phone or tablet because the websites use silverlight which is not supported on the chromecast. I'm leaving it at the 1 star because it is completely ridiculous that I cannot cast from google's browser when they are the ones that made the damn thing. It took a 30 minute phone call for the rep to even figure that out because no where in the troubleshooting does it mention that.
0446699616|5.0|Nelson DeMille has no equal when it comes to novels that you cannot put down until the very end, and this is another example of his extensive research and many hours of hard work to achieve another winner. His John Corey is one of the most interesting of all his main characters with his wit, but he is also a very sly detective with excellent vision and the ability to push the envelope to the end result. Corey is joined in this novel with Paul Brenner, another of his main characters in several books, including another favorite of mine &#34;Up Country&#34;. This combination was a pleasant surprise and DeMille seamlessly brought the two together for a interesting pairing and satisifing conclusion. I've just finished this novel and already looking forward to the next DeMille knowing it will also be a keeper in my library.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|What a WONDERFUL book, you are there, living the life along with Nelson, if this book doesn't grab you..nothing will.  Get a big container of fluid, a comfortable chair and read<br />this book..
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Got this game on the free app of the day.  What a cute game!  Haven't played it very much but it was simple to figure out and I could easily get addicted to it!  Funny concept!!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I want to see Anthony and Nikita story before you end the series!!!!!! I am now in love with kalab. Hawke and Dorian will always be number ones in my heart though.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Excellent follow up to bared to you. I really enjoyed the depths of the characters and their lives. If u love 50 shades u will absolutely love this series!
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|long and boring for the most part, has some entertaining effect of magician work and chase, but story is weak and overall I would give it a 1 1/2 to 2
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Although this book is somewhat difficult to get into once you have been hooked, it is quite remarkable.  The viewpoint is different from any I have ever read on the subject.  I think The Book Thief will become a classic.  It makes one think and feel and brought me to tears.
B002GHHHKG|5.0|Seductive yet romantic as a dream; However deep reminder how we must appreciate one we love for anything can take place with the one we love any moment - any time; we all are running out of time; be appreciative
1400031001|5.0|Very Talented Author and wonderful story Line which takes you through the years as though you are there in his shoes!
B00821OX98|4.0|Started off a bit slow for me personally but I just gave it a minute to pick up and by the second episode I was all in.
B00B04KVMC|4.0|If you liked the documentary you'll likely want this album. I bought the vinyl record version.  Nice loud POP! right at the first where he says \\"Sound City..POP!.. That's where it's at\\".  Good ol' vinyl hasn't changed a bit!  A little bit of static at the beginning of all 4 sides, but tolerable. Too much hassle to return for another that would probably have defects elsewhere. I have 40+ year-old records that are much quieter.
B003GQM52Q|5.0|This was a very entertaining movie. First one that I have watched on my TV since I got my micro HDMI cable.
0399255370|5.0|The book is absolutely adorable and a funny read. My only small complaint is that the black crayon in his letter uses the word hate. I do not believe the word hate should be used in a child's book.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|A classic well worth revisiting! The formatting is a little suspect in places but I guess we should expect that with a free edition. Good to get back in touch with the original stories to compare with the style of the current BBC programme Sherlock.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|or pay money to get more levels. only got to play for 1 day now I can't unlock anymore levels
B005LLXB9K|5.0|Top 3 music DVD/Documentary ever.  This is ridiculously good.  If you're a PJ fan, buy it.  Can't say enough good about this one.
1609611543|4.0|I have not read the whole book, but what I have read was very helpful. I been loosing way just but the few pages I read.
B00B19GKI0|2.0|Originally submitted by a 14-year-old as a script for an episode of The A-Team, \\"The Great President Escape\\" was re-tooled in a single weekend by John Carpenter as a mid-budget action flick.<br /><br />But seriously:<br />I wanted something purely ridiculous, and while the script outdid my expectations in respect of sheer ridiculousness, the film was a little too flat to be the wad-of-cheese fun I had hoped for.  It was oddly not very action-packed.  If suspense-less action is your personal idea of campy cheese, then this is your film.  For my part, the next time I want the kind of cheese-ified action I had hoped for from this film, I will just go straight for American Ninja.  Or watch some old episodes of Airwolf.<br /><br />(Speaking of which, if you watch this and wonder, \\"Where else have I seen that one sidekick being a sidekick?\\" The answer is, \\"Airwolf\\").
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I was not a huge fan of &#34;Eat, Pray, Love&#34;, but this novel  was engaging, intelligent and enchanting.  Thank you, Elizabeth Gilbert!
B00A2H9PLG|3.0|I bought this movie with the digital copy.  The movie was okay but the digital copy code was invalid.  Second time in a month that movies I bought (other one was from a local store) where the codes were listed as invalid!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|You need to buy it to download wow don't get it ,,, it vacuums<br />Don't I'm telling  you won't like it if you don't like spending money
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|I've been waiting for Tom Clancy's next book for some time.  Knowing it was his last one was a little bit of a bummer but the book is fine.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|An essay to describe life and circumstance in Afganistan could have served just as well. The story line just seems to ramble with hardly any plot to speak of. The book ended without a climax or a very weak one at that. There are also far too many characters in the book. The book is not up to the standard of the author's two previous works.
1401225756|5.0|) xoxoxoxoxoxxoxoxoxoxooxoxoxoxo<br />Has stuck. Crazy mad love :Has stThis isn't just a sett of stories.. It engraves right Into you. If it fits it sticks and it
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|kind of predictable, but i enjoyed the story. the actress from house was great. I recommend it. emotional, suspendful, inspiring
B00631HASU|1.0|Data mining is not ethical in an app that costs $1.99. I have to point out that even for a faotd, the sensitive information on your gadget doesn't belong in the hands of10tons Ltd. All week we're offered the Flurry Analytics apps. uuugggghhh
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|EPIC!!!!!  The most fun Angry Birds game yet.  This app has more perks than Angry Birds Star Wars.  The telepods really help.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|An all-star cast adds to the great romance story of unconventional characters. Brad Pitt is in it and acting like he invented the Pineapple Express! Truly an awesome movie!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is a really awesome Angry Birds game.  It has tons of different categories and levels.  I can spend hours playing this game.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Finally, a return to the original style of 007. The tech is more in line with current possibilities and the writing is reminincent of the early Bond films. I loved it and can't wait for more!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most addicting game in the world.  There are fun missions, a huge map, and awesome power-ups. It makes me hungry whenever I play it.
1451688091|4.0|Great read, very interesting, and very dense. If you are interested in how Lincoln came to be the man behind the presidency then this book will help answer that question.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Only problem is that the players need a Facebook account to play tournaments.  My 9 year old does not (and will not) have a FB account at this time.  The power up practice is pretty cool though.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I read all her books and have really liked them up to now. In my opinion, this one was too much about the inside of the mind and feelings that seemed no one else could possibly know. A pretty good read otherwise.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I am really liking this game now! I didn't want to connect to fb, but seeing as though you almost have to, unless you want to keep buying crowns to complete levels.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|There were a number of problems with this item.  First you have to download the software and unfortunately you have to download google chrome to install the software.  I followed the instructions and when I did everything I was told the damn thing would not work.  I had it hooked up to my wifi, it could not find a connection even though my internet connection was fine.  I worked on it for almost two hours and finally said to hell with it.  I have some experience with computers and this was very frustrating.  This was my first google item purchase and it will be my last google purchase.  I immediately returned the item to where I purchased it.  I also have a problem with google requiring to download their browser and I believe requesting too much information.  I will now avoid them like the plague.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It'll bring you tens and/or hundreds of hours of fun. A little hard but rewarding in the end after a tough battle. Though it is easy at first it becomes harder and harder. TWSS.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A good read from start to finish.  I found it difficult to put down and now looking forward to starting the next Nicholas Sparks novel.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love this game very entertaining n fun love all the graphics n design very cute n colorfully colored my lil guy keeps saying you got it you got it
B000002KIK|5.0|I am a true Sabbath fan since the early Eighties. This is a great album and a must have for any fan of heavy duty rock and roll. Great jazz influence on this album but also haunting hard rock songs that will get in your head. The album shows how amazing each member of the band was. The different styles of music they were individually trained in is displayed here. This one will stay in your rotation for months to come for sure.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Looked crystal clear and not a lot of buffering which was a great thing because I can't stand having to wait for a movie to load.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|this film is based on an unfinished jane austen novel and i have to say that the filmmakers did a fantastic interpretation of the source material....so very romantic, i developed a major crush on cirian hinds which lingers to this day.....i mean watch this then &#34;rome&#34; where he embodies julius ceaser and you'll understand what i'm saying....
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|The best book King has written; funny, imaginative and oh so easy to read and understand. King's words flow in a smooth rhythm, and there are few adverbs.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Love it! I am a huge fan of Downton Abbey and I friend suggested I watch this until the new season begins. I can't believe it's taken me so long to discover this, but I am to be envied for watching it for the very first time. Nail-biting awesome!
B00631HASU|5.0|I used to play this game when I was little. The point of the game so to shot these colored ball to others to get a match. But it's not that easy the other ball will be moving towards a black hole.If you take to long to match the other ball they will go down the black hole and you will lose.I hope you have fun and a little tip shot from the middle. And there's  power ups to help you play. GOOD LUCK
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Read on the recommendation of a friend; the book pulls you in from the first pages.  A young irish immigrant finds herself alone and indentured, living with slaves, taken in and loved as family.  The book is told by her and her slave sister/mother, a wonderful story of both family and the horrors of slavery.  Highly recommend!
0062255657|5.0|I cracked this book open on a cold and rainy night and fell into it creepy world so completely that I had to read through to the end before attempting to go to sleep. This is the creepy bedtime story for your inner child, one filled with wondrous and fearsome things in the vein of Coraline and The Graveyard Book. Gaiman’s imagery is, as usual, unforgettable – the pond that’s really an endless ocean, the cleaners, the seamless sewing of time and memory. But I have to hand it to him on the food. I so badly wanted some warm fresh milk, real thick toast with honey. I want to visit the Hempstock farm and be tucked in by Lettie!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I really like the concept behind this. It works perfectly with netflix, and you tube, but it's horrible with hulu. It's always stopping to load which makes trying to watch a show a headache.
B005QUQP76|5.0|Pros:<br />- The mouse fits my hand well and doesn't feel like cheap plastic<br />- Can adjust the sensitivity / resolution on the mouse with the buttons behind the scroll wheel<br />- 'Sniper' button on the side lets you temporarily lower resolution to make fine tune adjustments to cursor position (for aiming or photo editing)<br />- Management software from Corsair lets you adjust button tasks with ease<br />- Cord doesn't tangle easily<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Gunk can collect along the outside edge of the underside of the mouse<br />- Occasionally a stray hair can get in the laser housing and confuse it, easily fixed though<br /><br />Overall, it's a great mouse from Corsair, in line with their other peripheral products. I would buy it again!
B003UBTX6S|2.0|Beautiful Creatures was great, but as you read on in the series it becomes the same ol', same 'ol and just begins to drag on.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is one of the great Christmas movie.  Not only for the comedic value but because it reminds me of my parents and family.
B000HL09MG|2.0|Story line just too weird. Looks like the director just tried to make this movie look like a suspense by giving it an unusual title and throw in a bunch topless women there. That is not suspenseful at all. Play it again sam!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Skip it! I only downloaded because EVERYONE kept talking about it. I'm puzzled why? If erotica is what you're into, there is better material available. I was bored with all the inner goddess talk, repetitive long thin fingers references, the back and forth of the dialogue, the overuse of Mr. Grey/ Miss Steele. I had to skip around to the actual sex acts to finish reading the book.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book, from very early on, was such a bummer. I had some expectations from the first 2 books - I thought it was going to be at least a 4 star read. This book is no more than 1 star: it was disappointing, it did not make sense, it was boring, not plausible, and a huge let down.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This Cd has a lot of very good songs that I had seen at the motley cruefest concert. highly recommend this cd.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I've used this app for a while now and absolutely love it! The weather is always accurate and helps me plan ahead for what to expect all week long! I also ask enjoying the mpoints system they have going to earn gift cards!
B002QBS9KE|2.0|Goes into the ear a little better than what came with the unit, but it is simply round and does not fit the shape of the ear, making it difficult to hear through the Bluetooth device.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|took the Jake small time lawyer into what can be a good sequel when ever he decides to do another story had lots of great twists and the ending was really a curve ball.  Got so I couldn't put it down.  I'll have to read it over real soon
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. Great plot, and you have a little bit of everything, meaning a bit of Star Wars, Jason Bourne, Mr. and Mrs Smith, I Robot, The Fifth Element.  It's like a mixture of all of these.  You have to watch it.
0765334798|4.0|Imagine checking your spaceship's food synthesizer on deck six, when suddenly a violent explosion rips apart the hull sucking out your frozen visage onto the void of space. <br /><br />Not the most glamourous way to go, for an ensign.<br /><br />Every work of sci-fi needs a space battle, or a needlessly complex and dangerous away mission in which some poor—usually nameless—ensign dies. Horribly. Pointlessly. But what if all those low-ranked lives were real and actually meaningful? <br /><br />In Red Shirts they are.<br /><br />If you ever watched cable TV sci-fi, you'll probably admit that a lot of the narrative seems to be quite implausible, sometimes even downright silly. Quirky technology, unscientific science, and a lot of messy skirmishes by supposed advanced civilizations. It's all super entertaining. But in Red Shirts this wacky cable sci-fi narrative is imposed onto actual beings. The result: hyper-reality doused in hilarity. <br /><br />The writing is simple and crisp. Brief paragraphs. Fast sentences. Simple language. Mr. Scalzi's screen-writing prose really shows in pacing and scene development. The novel has that hook and pull quality of an episodic TV show. Although it's much more grimy and sexual than a weekly TV show. It's very much like reading a strangely familiar episode of the original Star Trek series.
098357670X|5.0|It's really great book for you who really want draw some caricatures.<br /><br />I really like the caricatures style that author has.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|5 stars all the way...Such an amazing game!!! I could play this game all day!!! So additive and so much fun for one game!!!
B000OHZL1C|5.0|I liked the theme and material, and I think it was done quite well.  A bit longer than normal but very engaging.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Blooms TD 5 is a great game. It has many challenges and easy parts. The only thing I don't like about this game is if you get a lot of big balloons on the screen. The game starts to slow dawn but that's only because of the flash player. Other than that it is a great game
B00003CX9E|5.0|Simply the greatest film of all time. Welles' style continues to influence filmmakers. The cinematography, editing, music are without peer.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is so awesome! Hint: make an account to get free green lantern character. This game is a must have.
006202406X|4.0|After reading so many negative reviews, I was not excited to read this. However, I read this quickly over a few days and I enjoyed this book for what it is: the final book in this series that explains the world outside and concludes the story. I enjoyed the ending and the conclusion.
B00E3I3KDE|4.0|I really like Ellie Goulding, but she needs to not sing through her nose all the time. It bothers me. I do not know if I could sit through an entire concert of hers....
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a very handy device for those who need to stream to non smart TV's.<br />It also finally brings Hulu and Hulu Plus compatibility to the Google family although at this time the chrome cast app is still not compatible with Google TV.<br /><br />Hopefully they will continue to develop apps for it and it will be come even more useful instead of being more of a niche item.<br /><br />In my opinion that's what will make or break the success of this device.<br /><br />Still, for 35 bucks it's both a good workaround for the Hulu/Google TV issue and for older non smart TV's with HDMI inputs.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast works very well, but I thought it would be useful with more apps. That was a little disappointing. Hopefully, they will add apps in the future. I use it with an iPad and iPhone.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this is great calculator. I love how the numbers are so bold and bright. I wish this could be on my cell phone.<br />I am truly glad to have down loaded this app. great job.<br />I would recommend this app.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is an awesome and affordable product comparing to other similar products in the market.<br />It not only delivers HD quality video from Netflix and HBO GO, but also plays any MP4 file from your local hard disk.<br />You can simply type file:///C: in Chrome URL field to browse your C drive of your computer and double click on any MP4 file to play & cast it to your TV.
B00FLDG5BE|4.0|I have to agree with so many other reviewers, this is my least favorite of any of the Crossroads Concerts. The reason for it, I think has alot to do with the venue. It is in NYC and is the most serious of the Crossroads concerts. There are some great performances, too many too many to list and some stinkers such as Citizen Kope again sings his depressing music and Robbie Robertson proved he cannot sing and struggled with his guitar playing (likely out of practice, at least I hope he is not sick). This Bluray is worth owning, but all the other Crossroads Festivals are more joyfull. On this one you can see that musicians were padded with NYC union players that were not part of the group. I say buy it and enjoy it, but if you lack any of the other crossroad festival Dvds or bluray, buy them first and this one last.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|FBI-guy with a natural and professional ability to read people's body language. Scratch your nose, look down to the left, move your legs while in the interrogation chair. It all reveals something. Heaven forbid, I don't want this guy asking me questions.
0399165274|4.0|The Kill List a Frederick Forsyth thriller has brought a harsh reality into our reading lives. If you’re one who is concerned about the war on terror or think it’s over look at  this book. The author in this book explains in detail about the secret government organization whose job is to find and eliminate terrorists on “the kill list,” and how easy it is to infiltrate a computer system anywhere in the world. The Kill List shows how governments use all means available to win the war on terrorism and hunt down the Jihadist.  Frederick Forsyth is able to give details of the processes, organizations, and equipment needed to find the terrorist with the help off peoples in and out of the military or government.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Matt Smith is the best Dr ever. Of course I thought that about David Tennent too. All I can say is this season is great, and Amy and Rory and RIVER SONG(!!!) are the best companions so far.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a good free game for the kindle fire.<br />I enjoyed it.  What more can you say?  Really<br />'..................
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I love Matt Smith's Dr! He's so much fun!  David Tennent was a hard act to follow, as he was fantastic, and I doubted Smith could win me over, but he has and more. HE is the best doctor.
B00AL6T0N6|5.0|This third story in this folk tale collection does not disappoint.<br /><br />Continuing the adventures of Alex and Katie whilst they spend the summer with their aunt, this tale takes them back into a fantasy world where they step into a picture.<br /><br />Here the children learn about the seasons and the importance of being patient and not greedy.<br /><br />This story, like the others by this author are familiar in their style yet modern in their appeal to a 21st century audience. This is another which is suitable for adults and children as the reader enjoys the adventure with these children.
B008JFURKG|5.0|This was a fantastic sequel! I absolutely loved the first one and some negative reviews had me worried for the second, but I took a chance and bought the blu-ray. I was not disappointed. My son and I were still talking about scenes two days later. When you can review numerous scenes and lines days later from a movie and discuss it at length, it was done well. Also the trailer barely touched the hilarious scenes throughout the movie and just how bad-ass Helen Mirren's character really is!
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|Works exactly as advertised. Easy to pair w/ other bluetooth devices and sound quality is outstanding.  Very pleased with this device.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Clever, funny.  Who doesn't love Shaun the sheep? Get this - you will not be disappointed by your purchase. Enjoy
B005GFPZYK|3.0|A bit more graphic than I had anticipated, but still a good read. The life of this Sniper was probably typical of all of them.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Works fantastically on my Kindles.  Have used on Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Fire HDX.  Offers great connections to all Google services with one program as a web browser.  Although this is a great program, I really do prefer Silk.  But, both are on my Kindle and it depends on mood as to which I use.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a fun game. You have a bit of wait time with a few things, but if you didn't, you would never put it down!!! :) :) :)
B00C1040TO|4.0|Works and does what it is supposed to do.  It was free and works well for the price.  As someone who sings occasionally, this is a great tool
B003O86FMW|3.0|Even though the book was an interesting read, personally as a Christian I felt it was not a story that I would recommend to others since it was about people trapped and trying to survive while others hunted them.  To me this is about the world of sin and how our minds can become so entangled in the lusts of sins that will devour humankind...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the type of story that occupies the mind...the kind that makes you hurry through your other responsibilities, do you can make time to read more.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Had to finish the series  even though I didn't like the story.  It was an interesting read, but did not like the game of hunting trapped people until only one survived.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|there needs to be free offers for gems pls!!!!!!!!!! would complete the package on this game not everyone wants to spend a butload of cash
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Interesting read - didn't like the story.  Don't like the idea of hunting people for survival.  Not my kind of enjoyment.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This book is SO GOOD!! I'm fangirling just thinking about it. :) This book is a bit confusing at first because you're like, &#34;What?! How can she just take her foot off?!&#34; But then it begins to make more sense. It kept me up until about 1:00 in the morning reading it, thank goodness it was a Saturday. The ending is so well written and amazing. As soon as I finished it, I couldn't wait to get the next book. Trust me, you'll love this book! :D
B0051MKMNC|4.0|Liked the movie although as always why don't they use there super powers for societys adavance, good price shipping was on time and product was great.
B00GT1TANM|5.0|Phenomenal album!!!!!! &#34;16 Tons&#34;, &#34;If I Only Had A Brain&#34; and &#34;Dream A Little Dream&#34; are, well, dreamy. Not sure why he never caught on here in the  US, but you need to hear this album!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|You have to buy the full version. Not a lot of features for me to buy it for the kids.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I stopped reading this series several books back but since this is the last one I decided to read it and see how it all panned out. After I read it I am incredibly happy that I rented it from the library and dint waste my money on it. I really can't describe how disappointing I found this book to be. The entire Eric situation was just wrong on so many levels that it leaves one feeling nauseated. I can't picture Eric, who to me was a strong alpha type, basicly becoming some twisted freaks slave/ husband. That just is not the Eric I came to know while reading this series. It is unrealistic and pointless to dramatically change a characters personality at the end of a series. So what he's just going to go and be miserable for two years? After all the crap Eic and Ookie fought against and came out winning your going to just end it with Eric bieng screwed over and the bad guys basicly putting a leash on him? Sorry but no I don't see Eric becoming the pathetic weakling that this book turns him into. It would have been better to kill him off than to end his story so terribly bad. It's such a waste of what was once a good character. Very poorly done and really just pointless way to get him out of Sookies pathetic life. And te one Sookie finally ends up with well that's just....eww gross. It gave me the unpleasant cold chills one goes after seeing something really gross or painful. I honestly think I got a little sick there for a moment. It's just gross. They were just so wrong for each other that it is nearly painful to read. In all honesty this series should have ended soon after Sookie and Eric married. They were fun together and made this series fun. When breaking them up this series just floundered through and became boring..actually beyond boring. After reading through this painful mess of a story the only feelings I came up with is that I justno longer cared what happened. They all could go up in flames or not and it wouldn't matter to me since these characters feel more like strangers than the ones we loved from the beginning of the series.  I consider this book to be one of the worst endings to a series and am glad it s coming to  end.
B00631HASU|5.0|Good tutorial, installed to my micro SD and has limited permissions.<br /><br />Very fun game. The graphics are nice too. The game play is just tough enough to make it challenging and fun. Great job with creating this game
1616550414|5.0|My daughter loves this book. The pictures are very good. My daughter likes to draw the pictures from the book.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|I'm a reader, not a writer...I don't think I can do this book justice with a review. I'll just cut to the chase and say I loved it!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|REAL AWESOMENESS!!! I just got this app and I LOVE IT!!! I am so impressed with it. IT IS JUST LIKE THE MOVIE!!! I would definitely recommend this to a friend. YOU CAN PLAY AS EVERY ROBOT FROM ATOM TO ZEUS!!! For extra fun, might I recommend wearing a pair of headphones while playing the app?
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play the game all the time on my kindle fire hd and on Facebook. The app is sometime really slow to update when new rooms come out but great game other than that.
B00FY2UJAU|5.0|My son and i love FAST FURIOUS MOVES we watch these moves over and over . top ratings go to them
B006SAR6P8|3.0|I'm a little hard of hearing, so sometimes I watch with the captions on. I was very surprised to see that the captioning didn't match the audio. For some reason the CC they're using is a toned-down version without any of the more adult language. It's kind of unfair, and puzzling, that the deaf community doesn't get to see the actual dialogue.
B000FC146C|5.0|It was a great book.  I had seen the mini series back in the 70's and it followed it well with added details.  They changed the story a little when they made it into a mini series but not enough to ruin it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A beautiful masterpiece. Painful and poetic.  It stirred me to the core and as the pages moved me to what I knew would be the end I slowed, dreading the final profound words.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|Couldn't get into the movie and ended up turning it off.  Maybe if I had stayed, my mind would have changed.  But what I saw, it was boring.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it is so much fun and I always want to check it whenever I can. get this!!!!!!!!! so good for kids
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|For a reader who grew up in the Mississippi delta with a career and history in the law, Grisham never fails to disappoint with his detailed knowledge of arcane laws, the area and its history. Though I enjoyed the first half, I thought I had figured out the final twist and skipped to the end. I was wrong though the conclusion was along the lines of my expectation.<br /><br />It was fun to revisit the Jake Brigance character and some of the others familiar from A Time to Kill. Grisham's best work (I couldn't help picturing Matthew McConaughey throughout).<br /><br />As usual, Grisham creates a complicated can't win situation involving black and white characters (talking good v evil btw also racially) and the good people triumph at the end. That's the problem too - with Grisham, you know by now that good will win and the suspense isn't really ever there. He draws it out, throwing in some uh oh surprises but there is never any real doubt--even as he develops a no-win scenario for the good guys up to the last few pages. Once he gets there, it all gets wrapped up swiftly and neatly with a heart warming hug to how far the south (at least for good folk) has come.<br /><br />Not good enough to read throughout for me but a good enough concept and touches on authentic setting and feelings for those who know the area well and are very aware of its fraught and shameful history.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show never disappoints. Every episode has a twist so there's never a dull moment. One of the best shows on tv, hands down!
1401937519|5.0|Amazing book, really inspirational and lifechanging. I absolutely recommend it for any interested in spirituality in general. Get this book now!
0399215921|1.0|Yes, now that I look closely I see that the product dimensions tell me this is a tiny version of this book.  I did not think to look at the dimensions when ordering the book.  It would have been nice if the title referenced the word &#34;miniature&#34; in parentheses, so that it would be very clear that the buyer is not ordering a normal sized book.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|For so many people who are or have been touched by an alcoholic this movie brings home the pain, lying and hope one has for the situation. The under current of faith and fate was something I missed the first time I watched this so it was even more powerful the second time I saw it.
B005KP7EK4|4.0|I though it was a well done follow up to the popular story that we all know. I think everyone would like to think it didn't end in Bolivia in a final blaze of glory.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|OMG I am addicted to this and have passed it on to my whole family, including my 2 year old Grandson (inappropriate I know, but he giggles so). It is so simple to learn but not so simple to master so it's fun. It is interesting that some of us have strengths in certain tasks.  some  can zip through a screen , but get hung up  on the next. Love it.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|An awesome thriller! Wonderful story! I was unable to put this book down. Read the entire series. Suspenseful. U will not forget the characters in this story.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Saw this concert live twice in Miami and Ottawa. This DVD is an excellent reproduction of that performance. A must for any Supertramp fan and a great music/ rock n roll DVD for anyone else.
0451197879|5.0|Once again, Stephen King keeps me on the edge of my seat, I can not seem to get enough of his books
B004S5C91Q|5.0|Very moving book.  Would recommend everyone to read it.  Haunting and emotionally charged.  Give it a go you will be surprised
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I don't know what to even say. I don't know when I've been this moved by a book. I had to stop a few times because it was too much. If this is not required reading in every school in the next few years, there is no hope for human kind. Make sure you have kleenex and wine handy.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Stop telling me to update the game. Your kindle edition isn't even kindle copatable. I liked the game but now the timers dont run out so i cant even open the chest i do get.
0525478817|4.0|Everyone enjoyed reading this book.  We are looking forward to reading more John Green books.  Great for the kids in their early teens.
B00E8S2GJI|4.0|Great offers in the package, extra interesting details of the production of the Hobbit.  Great price too, everywhere I checked, it was much more expensive.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I looked at this product and it does the basics for the MS Office products. After using the full function products on the PC, it is different due to the touch screen Android functions. Maybe I need a little help with the Android, but cannot find all the functions in Excel and PowerPoint, I am use to with full function products.'m
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's supposed to be  &#34;free&#34;but they continually try to get you to purchase from them to continue with the game.  I refuse!  I have been stuck on level 20 because I can't get &#34;tickets&#34; to get across.  It's fun to play but very frustrating when you can't just play without having to bug your friends for help or buying your way out.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|Fun hearing 4 guys with real instruments play & sing with energy and great humor.  Damn little of that goes on now.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|it is so fun whoever made it is a total genies so fun get it get it love it please get it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this book it's amazing. Not just sexual but surprisingly suspenseful with a great story line that fallows the first two books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its fun for the kids and the overgrown kids. all ages can enjoy this game. minions are funny, and cute
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What I think of this game is like when you get bored and want something fun to do just go subway surfers.thank u
B005V5WBFG|5.0|Does an adequate job of security. Not the best that I have seen, nor the worst, but for the limited use it is being applied to, it is decent.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  I loved the way Markus Zusak writes and presents his chapters....very unique and he grabs your attention throughout the book.  The characters are 3 dimensional and stand on their own as fantastically interesting participants in the story. I highly recommend this book!
B009LDD22U|5.0|My son purchased the first five seasons from Amazon for me for Christmas last year and I thoroughly enjoyed them. This season was just as great.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|It's fast baby!!!! But I loved the graphics and programing. I had a lot of trouble with the control's, but my hands are e numb, which makes gaming a real drag on fast paced games.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|best game ever can not get enough of playing it I have yet to find another game to ever come close
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. The only thing that I would caution anyone about is that it is highly addictive. Fun game to keep your mind off of every day worries, at least it works for me.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|Its kind of a pain to pull the card back out, but it does work.  So if your the type that must have every digital tool on your keychain this may be for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This games awsome love it! I helped my mom pass a bunch of levels and now i have to pass them for myself
B00GT67UUM|4.0|I like it. The difficulty is great, and never is too easy or hard.<br />This can also be a bit interesting when trying to get the 100 %.<br />The game looks great, although I am a sucker for steampunk.
B0034BW9CO|5.0|A new star in the constellation of music. His voice is smooth, tender, passionate, and beautiful. It is like he is singing just for me. Love it!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's a great app to keep up with latest postings on Facebook. Takes a little time to learn to use it.
B000002J1M|4.0|Nice to have this on CD, my cassette wore out. A couple of really good songs on here, but even the not so good ones take me back
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|liked the game till it makes you buy the game after only 12 rounds... I did get the free version though so 12 free rounds are better than none
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun game, I definitely have some skills to hone.  Fun for passing time.  Uses special techniques and requires accurate shooting.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I can print from my Kindle to my HP & Epson Wirless printers that is either in another room, or on another floor, and it's very satisfying.  I don't have to send documents to my laptop in order to print them anymore...It's great!!!!!  I don't have an iPhone or iPad, so I can't rate this software for these items.....sorry.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive.  I started playing this after a friend at work introduced me to it, and now I'm farther then she is.  It is one of my favorites.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This is an epic historical novel by a master if the genre. Loved the experience of reading it and would have loved a follow up.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Long time magic player, and I love the app. Only a few issues: the computer is pretty dumb but plays better than some I have seen. The game crashes once in ten games, losing your progress. Also, there is not a ton of customization in the decks, but I gave it four of five.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Easy read-hard to put down till it's done! Loved all 3  books. And unsure of the ending until the last two pages. Fantastic.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a well thought out game that makes you think a bit before answering.  Basically you need to decide which squares are part of the puzzle and which are not when given the correct number of squares vertically and diagonally to place.  By the same developers as hexlogic games, which I am wild about,but not as difficult. Great tutorial provided.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just finished Fifty Shades Freed. I absolutely loved the trilogy.  I bonded with Christian and Anastasia.  I cared for them, understood them and often cried as I read about Christian's heart wrenching childhood. I eventually skipped the sex scenes because I was anxious to learn how this troubled relationship evolved. I look forward to reading more from E.L. James
B00E9A656K|1.0|This game sucks I tried to do what it said to do but it wouldn't let me and to think i got rid of 5 of my other apps so I could keep this one.  Don't get this game and if you do don't get rid of any of your other apps it's not worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app but there is always a problem it sometimes glitches and you cant platmultiplayer but its good without that
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good book<br />Lots of action and suspense<br />Fun to read<br />Won't stop reading<br />So freakin good it's insane. Yep
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Free....challenging.... fun.....dislike the ads. I like this game.  Fun to play. Challenging in timed mode or relaxing in adventure mode.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun game as all of the rest of the angry bird games. Really like the Star Wars characters. Will have to get the next one.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|good example of addiction and how hard it is to overcome it.  The pilot's faults  overshadowed his skills as a pilot.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Fun, Fun ,Fun,just like all of the angry birds games. This has some different skills to master, but that's the fun of it. Must have for anyone.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Bought this so that the wife and I could watch it on our LG 3D HDTV. Thoroughly enjoyed this from the storyline thru the graphics. You won't be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, Fun ,Fun love this infuriating game.It makes me mad but I cant help but like the little dude.If you like the movie you must have this .
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|Welcome back to middle earth!  The extended Edition of the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey doesn't have the enormous amount of extra movie time that the LOTR trilogy had but it is still plenty to satisfy.  The movie is great and looks amazing on Blu ray.  The special features on this are amazing.  More than 9 hours of features take you through every aspect of the film from beginning to end.  Watching the features really takes you into the movie and what it takes to create such and amazing world.  The features alone and worth getting this Blu ray.  If anyone purchased the LOTR extended editions with the statues will love the Bilbo and Gollum figure that comes with this.  The piece is great!  Be sure to pick this up today!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Super fun game, very addicting though,Great way to kill an afternoon. My wife even plays it and she is not a gamer.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This story grips you from beginning to end.  Making you feel every bit of Liesels happiness, hurt, and pain throughout
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is so amazing and its so adicting. I just finished the game I finished region six but now I'm bored. so please hurry up with the update for region 7 I hope its a cool region.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|A bit to gory for us, but probably..for the day, it was pretty accurate.  Good acting though, with Daniel Day.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Complex intertwining of the deep connection between brothers and sisters, mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, with the backdrop of an ever changing landscape of war, betrayal and poverty. An act of desperation kicks off the book which slowly reveals the spider web of relationships that led to the decision and its fallout. Time and distance takes its toll but the author reveals that nothing diminishes the search for family and belonging. I loved the Kite-Runner which is a simpler story with similar themes but Hosseini has developed as a teller of tales. And the Mountains Echoed set in Afghanistan and America is more complex than his other books. The author proves in the interweaving of story lines how our lives , our hurts, our longing and our hopes are truly universal. A moving read!
B00004TWZG|5.0|Wow.  This was the best.  Luc was great, but so were all the stars that showed up in this movie.  Just a fine movie with superb direction and production effects too.  WOW !
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is fun but you have to watch a car commercial every time you start a new game. You can pay a little extra if you don't want ads.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|WHEN THE MOVIE CAME OUT 2 YRS AGO I SAW IT 6 TIMES.  THEN I BOUGHT THE DVD.  THE MUSIC IS WONDERFUL AND CHRISTINA IS MAGNIFICENT.  WHAT A VOICE!! ONE OF THE BEST EVER.!
033046406X|5.0|Fascinating tale of what lengths man takes to improve his lot in life. Jeffrey Archer is a master of the pen. His books take the reader right into the story.
B0047TB09K|5.0|easily to follow narrative; really interesting threads about food production and how it impacts individuals / communities / the planet
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|When I read Outliers I didn't think Gladwell could do something that special again. Well, he did. Amazing, amazing thoughtful person and writer.
B00E9ZATJO|3.0|I was expecting more from this movie. I thought it was a bit boring. didn't seem to keep kids interested either.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Awesomely addictive!  A must have for any puzzle game player!!  Free game that is worth the wait for energy refills.
