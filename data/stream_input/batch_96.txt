B000E4VGT6|5|Fit is perfect, the black looks good with my dark green Land Cruiser so no need to paint.
B00LMXUE2S|1|cheap imitation
B000C846VE|5|Worked
B00B1TNQCS|4|Very satisfied.  Heavy gauge rubber provides non-slip surface.  Don't recommend if you have a plastic Berliner as it won't fit properly
B00SG8NOTM|4|Filter works great.  Just took over a month to get it to me.
B0139MUNWK|5|Carbon fiber always looks good, even more so when it's actual carbon fiber. These are actual carbon fiber. They fit perfectly on my '99 Kawi Ninja ZX-7R. If you want to spice up the look of your instrument panel, get these. It'll make it look a lot more modern and add a cool factor to it as well! :D
B00GUF74HQ|5|Easy install. Works great.
B00N3446NC|2|Got these back in May haven't had but three months and one of them is already tore up. It wouldn't quiet attach very securely to begin with to our existing side rails and now it won't attach at all.
B000BOKO4W|5|Great product and provided a great foundation for my car's finish
B001H1PBLY|5|Ford genuine part and fast delivery.
B00W8LQPPS|4|Over all good product. Is not made perfectly for car. Used clear caulk to fill gaps.  Would buy again. Shipped quickly.
B0010JT1AA|5|Bought these awesome pewter charms as a memorial for our family dogs that have died over the years. Highly recommended
B008SEBQ2G|3|Product fits great, looks great, however reception will be reduced on the lesser signals.Thats the only reason for the three stars.
B007XX8CIO|1|It's junk don't buy it raddled like no other
B00MJZKCUW|5|WILL ORDER IT AGINE !!!
B009TAU2XW|5|FAST shipping!! Fit perfectly!
B000KAZXHU|1|Says on packaging it will fit a 2014 GMC Yukon but does not.
B000CO7QLK|4|good price
B00PGCD8WY|5|My son love his step side iBoard running Board on his dodge truck and ir look good to
B00KI1MCAW|2|these bulbs cause huge electrical interference! installed in the outdoor lights in my toyhauler. when turned on all radio reception is gone, nothing but static!
B000H2DLMA|2|Just your basic run of the mill sealed beam headlights. Nothing special
B001GJ3FIS|2|I've had this nozzle for three full years in September. I had to disassemble it to see what was causing the internal valve not to close when released. I found it's innards had rusted enough to cause the trigger to stick. I got my trusty lithium grease spray out to see how that would help. Parts intentionally exposed to water should not rust, period. Hence, the two stars. It's working for now. But people should not need to take apart nozzles to maintain them. They should be built with rust proof parts. I'm not buying this again.
B006ZVKHN8|1|Fitting for the low side pressure switch is different and installed it before I realized that so I bypassed the switch!  To much of a Hassel to take it back off and wait for another one ford's spring locks are a pain in the rear
B005JZD6KM|5|The only problem it didn't fit the buckle in rental car 😕
B010H0QV7S|5|This is a very handy tool to have in your car, preferably in the driver's door storage compartment. I accepted the offer of a free sample for reviewing purposes and it proved to be not only useful, but potentially life-saving as well.<br /><br />TIRE PRESSURE MEASURING: Easy to use, accurate and able to present the tire air pressure in PSI, BAR, KPA or KGF/CM2. The measurement is projected in back-lit large digits which are easy to read.<br />FLASHLIGHT: A medium-strength white-light LED flashlight that may come in handy to find something dropped or to walk safely to your car in an underground parking. The beam is quite narrow at its strongest but it will work for most purposes.<br />EMERGENCY LIGHT: A red LED you can use to signal or warn incoming traffic.<br />SEAT-BELT CUTTER: Pray that you never have to use it but it gives you a peace of mind to know that you have it availaible.<br />EMERGENCY GLASS BREAKER: I did not test this but it feels sturdy and capable enough to be effective. A great thing to have at an easy reach.<br /><br />It requires 2 AAA batteries that are not included.<br /><br />All in all, this DBPOWER 5-in-1 Multitool is a must have in your car.
B007KAZRKQ|4|These seat covers have worked out very well. My grandson helped me put them on, there was some under the seat work. For the price I find that they are doing their job. Staying pretty snug, but there were a few gauzy stretchy areas that are stressed. Still doing fine. I would recommend if not too much activity.
B00BVR75QI|5|Nice
B00692TZ54|4|Wasn't a direct fit for my Audi S5z in fact it was to long, but I made it fit. I give it 4 stars because of this issue. Past that, the product is of great quality!
B000C543BU|5|Great stuff especially moog !
B00LNOK4E4|2|it is very easy broken and didn't last long
B001LHVOVK|4|Works just like its shown on You Tube.
B000CPJLV2|5|Great
B0009V1WS4|5|works.
B00PQ7Z0BQ|5|So far, loving it. Has a range of about 60' inside the house. Works WAY better than the Trackr Bravo (which sucks). Beep is not too loud, but if you quiet everything down you can find it 2 rooms away. Pretty small (Trackr Bravo much smaller, but it doesn't work, so that's a moot point). Got 4 fobs for $25 with the controller unit. (Less than half the price of the Trackr Bravo).<br /><br />So far, the best &#34;key finder&#34; I've purchased  (And I have purchased MANY.)
B00HUG0JB2|1|I bought this cargo containment system to use with my Weather Tech cargo mat. It will not work unless it is used on a carpeted surface. It is worthless if you are using it on a plastic liner such as the one shown in this picture. All your items slide around along with the the four blocks. What a waste of money. I ended up using them in another vehicle with carpet.
B001AY2WLU|5|Solid. Locks on to key ring.
B002N070DU|1|total rip off,this is a roll off chrome door edge guard molding.i will be returning it .you can buy a roll at walmart or advance auto.
B000COBCF6|2|it didn't fit on the driver seat, the socket is a slightly different shape than the original handle.
B00RW7WF0W|5|Just better than the Bosch Icons and the Rain-X L attitude, both of which I've used before. These have more contact across the entire beam, are just as well constructed, and are cheaper for a pair than the others are each.
B000E2CVI8|5|THE BEST FILTER FOR YOUR 2012 R1 AS LONG AS YOU DONT OVER TORQUE IT, THEN ITS A BITCH TO GET OFF ,OTHERWISE ITS GREAT.
B00U7FR20O|3|Really dark blue and bright.  Had to remove since they are illegal in my state.
B00WNBE352|5|Love the sticker but unfortunately I cannot put it on my car, because up in the sticks and these people would probably do something to my car because they want another Republican president, you know like the last one Bush who got us into all the crap and problems we have now.  All of them.  i'm from New York and there on 9/11 lost two good friends and we gave Osama 4 months and told him so too, that we were at war and would be there by February. What the not--funny part of this is he was Pakistan, supposedly our &#34;ally&#34; and he was there for a long time and it took us 9 years to find out.  Then our President and our Dept of Defense lol decide Hey lets invade Iraq, why?  I don't know why either.  Except all those IED'S maimed and killed of our military in Iraq.  I have friends who have served and they say i can't talk about Iraq. I understand why because WE SHOULD NOT HAVE invaded their country.  Period.  Sorry getting off course here.  Just hope Hillary wins and that will change many things in a good way not a bad way.  just my opinion.  thank you.
B003XC9FRQ|5|The seller was incredibly helpful and I love my sticker! Thanks!
B004DMVIDE|5|So far so great ;) Has held up on my car and was delivered promptly.
B00504RLHG|5|Nothing like having this on my car...this is adorable and so true, my Beagle pup just is learning to bay and this sticker is perfect!!! All Beagle Mom's need one!!!
B008MC7OOS|5|Does not fit the car it specifies and fretting a return was a horror show
B00L888TVA|4|Met our expectations.  Nice tight fit
B00G620ZVU|5|Even though they're cheap, they're a good buy. Defianlty worth it! Good lights for wheeling, and the road
B006YGFF4K|5|Worked great!
B000NGP0XI|5|all parts work as advertised! ;-)
B001TH6ET4|5|Wife ordered these for her 2008 Harley Nightster 1200N. Bike has the solo seat and these are the perfect size for the bike and look great. Quality of bags is good for the price. She loves them so everyone is happy! :)
B0028MN46U|5|Bought this for my 2007 Mazda 3 2.3L. Check engine code P0131. Direct replacement for o2 sensor bank 1. Worked like a charm!
B002IPQ5IG|5|Inexpensive, easy to install.
B00N6ZVQVI|5|Problem solved. Easy to read instructions. Be sure to read the directions specific to your model.
B000BQYH6Q|5|Works well. No problems with it.
B00WVJRM5E|5|Installation for high beam location to compliment HIDs on '09 Triumph Sprint ST.  I love my OPT7 HIDs for performance and price, but for those just starting to do a headlight conversion this might be the kit.  It does cost a little bit extra, but installation really is plug-n-play with instant light turn on and a brilliant white light.<br /><br />Installation difficulties were the same as if I was replacing the halogen with another halogen bulb, which requires removal of the instrument cluster.  Modifications where limited to the rubber cover for access to the bulb.  Due to the LED fan requirement for fresh air, OPT7 recommends leaving this cover off.  I preferred a more finished look, and opted to cut a hole big enough for the fan to fit through.  Nothing anybody would see anyway.  The fan is water resistant, but its location on this bike is shielded from water one would expect during rain or washing the bike.<br /><br />The performance of being able to SEE at night is not as dramatic as I would have thought.  The low beam HIDs are already doing a great job, so visibility is just slightly enhanced.  I'd imagine that those using these to replace low beam halogens would be very impressed though.<br /><br />As for being SEEN, I think the HIDs and LED dramatically increase safety.  My old halogen was useless in doing a flash-to-pass with HIDs installed.  This LED has the power to cut through and flash oncoming traffic or signal those ahead trying to change lanes.<br /><br />From my own personal experience, if I were doing my light upgrade again I would probably buy these for my low beam as well.  The ease of installation and the pure white light can't be beat.
B00WFIK208|1|TRASH
B00AJPOA5C|5|Great jacket! Coast guard approved and comfortable.
B00HXHGIU4|5|Loved my sticker ! It's big and looks amazing . And everyone gets a kick out of it when they see it
B006YZEMLS|5|Slim and compact. Fit and finish great. Excellent trail side tool.
B0031I9KUY|5|I have 3000 miles on these discs and they are performing flawlessly.  Good product at a good price.
B00681BE2S|5|very easy to program
B00K6KE2JY|5|The covers fit my 2011 Hyundai Sonata Perfectly. I would highly recommend this covers to anyone that is looking for a good seat cover at a  affordable price
B004W5UGHG|5|Fit Perfect on my 93 ford Ranger
B00ONHFN1C|5|works great. great product fair price thank you
B0090UN116|3|Not bad
B006GJL3NW|1|Product was sold as fits Jeep TJ does not.
B000CSNK8E|5|Fits well, and easy to install. 2006 tundra xs-p
B0002Q80GS|4|I purchased this for an install of a tow package on my wife's 2011 Chevy Traverse. There really isn't any place to securely mount this on a 2011 Traverse. I had to fashion a 1/2 inch thick metal spacer to be able to use it. I don't recommend buying this for a Chevy Traverse as it won't work unless you have the ability to cut, drill and install a .5&#34; thick piece of metal stock. It was a PITA but only took 20 minutes because my neighbor had a drill press and metal cutter. The product it's self is well built and works. The supplied bracket is not overly sturdy and you must use caution when plugging in a trailer as it could easily be bent.
B002N5W8Q4|1|TERRIBLE ITEM! NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO SEE IF IT EVEN WORKED SINCE IT REQUIRES (2) D CELL BATTERIES THAT DOES NOT FIT IN THE CAVITY WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSE TO GO? SAVE YOUR MONEY. SENT IT BACK!!!
B003UVCY00|5|Works great must have if you own a boat
B0002MABGE|5|Excellent  no need for holes,,,resist big dogs
B00JOB57R2|1|the blade is the wrong size. took it to three locksmiths. it was cut perfectly (no noise when run through the grinder) but it does not fit the ignition. the lengthwise grooves are a different width. If you're unable to use the original blade (mine was damaged  trying to remove it from original fob) this is an absolute waste of money and time.
B002EBSLA4|4|I bought this filter because of its good reviews and it is working just fine. I do wish the body was painted white instead of black because I mark oil filters so I know how much I have tightened them. It is much harder to mark black.
B000L9HAJE|5|Great product as both a sealer and adhesive.,
B003LNJWTI|1|They were they worst lights I have ever bought in my life you can not see 10 feet in front of you I would not recommend these lights to anyone do yourself a favor and don't waste your money very unsatisfied costumer
B000NE7TJ8|5|Good fit. no more door rattle.
B004UHF7GG|5|So glad I seen this battery,worked perfectly.Saved me a bunch of money.
B000O80B5M|5|Used for many projects, works great. &#34;Raytek is a Fluke company&#34; - very worth it.  UPDATE: June 2016 and still works great. The extra cost was definitely worth it over the cheap ones. Use it all over the place - garage, kitchen, electronics, etc. Haven't changed the battery yet.
B00A14OZMY|5|Exceeds expectations
B0068D9L6W|5|keeps the hitch tight and no wiggle
B00B2YHFO2|5|Love them
B00NB48TLE|1|Not worth it
B000CNJ4A2|5|Excellent best seals on the market!
B00DJBQ1SW|5|These are excellent ramps.  The build quality was much higher than I expected at this price point.
B00OY7QTV4|4|Well made
B001RNOHBC|5|Worked perfect for my sleep number bed when I'm dry camping.
B00JCTTM7C|5|I love, thank you for everything. ..
B00291CJFW|5|Great price and works great.
B00KL2MQMW|5|Easy install worked great on my 1400 mile trip
B008KV4JOE|5|No problems.
B000KB97T4|5|Great smell!
B000C9F9WI|4|factory replacement and it works
B0006IX87S|3|The manufacturer description says you can use the product to reduce mineral deposits when washing your car, but it's really inadequate for this purpose.  I purchased the item and used it on my car, and it made no difference whatsoever with water spots.  I guess I kind of knew it was too good to be true, since you really need a water softener to reduce water spots, but I thought I'd give it a try based on the item description.  Luckily, Amazon is giving me a refund.<br /><br />I'm sure this is a great filter for sediment, taste, and odor, but don't get this for washing your car.
B00BFDGROO|5|Worked fine in the Honda Odyessey. Had them installed at the tire shop no problem.
B010UA5UHW|4|Install wasn't bad. Did it in under 2 hours. I'll update later when I see how bright it is.  I rode in WV this past weekend and this light was very bright for the the $$ and worked great so far!
B004I10WDC|5|great product fast shipping
B00GGXER8G|5|Excellent product and recommend it Aadhan Excellent seller recommend it
B00TACQ6L6|5|Easy to install! well built and a heavy duty bracket had no issues with mounting light bar fits a 50in cured light a glove very happy
B00J6DQNVC|1|I'm disappointed that they are a mixed batch of new and obsolete part numbers with a couple minor rust spots.  It definitely leads me to believe that these are cleaned up used spark plugs with the fact there was no individual box and ac-delco does not mix part numbers like this.
B00T9I2FKC|3|I am sure that these are fine but would not work in 1999 Toyota Tacoma - Believe it has something to do with the connectors being oval rather than round.
B008B5X5GC|5|Awsome
B0040CTTH4|5|just perfecT!
B0072W2WVO|5|Exact OE replacement.
B000WJX6IM|5|Really works!
B0010DW5ZO|3|ok
B001DN1L6K|5|This antenna  works great.
B00546F77G|4|I've only used it 3 times now, and can only hope it works as advertised.<br />Only an engine tear-down would confirm it's true effectiveness. If I don't find any salt build-up around outside of the engine's head in the next few years, then I'll be completely sold on this product and will gladly give it 5 stars.<br />The CRC products have always worked well for me in the past, so I hope this one works out as well.
B000BUOSGG|5|Great for narrow sinks!!
B00AGKS8RQ|4|It's finish is of an accptable standard. Could use a couple more adhesion points. It does the job for which I purchssed it which was to provide dash protection from the sun.
B00JLE7GLM|2|This is not the same as the new longer Mini version to help with the death rattle issue.  This is the same as the old style Mini version.<br /><br />A genuine increased length Mini one is only $28 from your local Mini dealer and made much better than this Taiwanese version.
B00XO9E6HC|4|Good
B00563JGZQ|5|I must admit I was hesitate about this product but to my surprise it works great, absolutely no problems with programming either. Very pleased.
B001KSCSQU|5|Just what I needed to get my truck back in order.....no more check engine light to annoy me!!
B00VK4H7E2|4|They look great. Easy install. But they don't tighten and hold there position in place like they should.
B000C59V9Y|5|High quality better than OEM
B00NCPSSK4|5|Fit perfect and came on time
B002KASQ7W|5|This product is very well-made. It stays in place in the back of my SUV without sliding around.
B003VCBDG4|5|Works awesome. No mess
B00BYOJ35E|2|The logo did not last long , I just have a plain light showing from the doors now
B006H34AE6|5|I bought this because other reviews said they purchased it in lieu of the expensive Norwex brush so I thought I would give it a try. I'm glad I did. I use  this to clean my norwex dust mop and it does the job perfectly. It also does a great job at removing car hair from upholstery. I'm glad that I decided to listen to the other reviewers and give this product a try.
B00I3LM71S|5|One wipe and clear clear!!!
B0035UDHZ2|5|I thought this was really helpful for solo tire changes.
B0009IQZH0|5|Love them
B00O4LCTV4|3|the cover was not what i expected.  it was much too light weight for the climate in NM. It would problably be fine for a cooler climate. I expected it to be 3 times havier as it was rated.<br />thanks for a quick refund and Hope to find something heavier, soon. I do like shopping with Amazon.
B00W31VMYC|4|good product value and good delivery time.
B000E28EOS|5|With the help of an adapter, this works great on our Ford Focus! Our backseat has been lost to the kid's car seats, so we need this and a roof bag when we go camping. Works great. Really like that it folds up - we don't need to remove it from the car after it's unloaded when we are on a trip. I wouldn't want to leave it laying around our campsite. I recommend a bungee cord net to secure your load, as well as a blue tarp to cover it. We like to lay the tarp over the carrier, load everything, and then wrap the tarp around the top and secure with the bungee net. It adds security and protects our stuff from road dirt and weather from the top and bottom.<br /><br />I recommend adding a flag to it so other cars can see it.
B00C305TII|5|Great product unfortunately did not fit my bike
B00002N57X|5|Fit my broken attic fan, works great.
B00C7S9K8Q|5|Dont pay hundreds for the same product from some big name manufacturer.  These things all come out of the same factories overseas and some people are just slapping a higher price tag on these.  This light bar works perfect and is very bright.  And I could buy 10 of these for what it would cost for a light from some other companies.
B008LUT6XS|5|We have used this before and had run out. It doesn't replace basic cleaning, but it truly helps in difficult odor situations. A dog pee scented car, a stale camp, a Volvo  too many college kids partied in...
B00J8PHQPK|5|Works like a champ
B00NH49NL8|5|Stuff it with napkins from restaurants after you run out or simply refill with some puffs with lotion lol
B000LDDXV4|5|An exact battery for my old step 2 music in motion roller coaster. I fully charged it when I received it, and after three weeks and used about 3-4 times a week for about 15-20 minutes a day, it is still going.
B0091OE6K6|5|My wife loves these..keeps the stap from around her neck .
B007R4GMTU|5|Got this as a gift for a friend, she loves it!  Really liked the colors and design, different and unique and the little rhinestones around the bill of the cap, give it that little extra bling.  The cap does seem to run a little big.
B004Z1J6DC|4|Great price...  good quality...
B00EKTIYNC|5|Fast turn around, easy to install, looks great
B00LT41ZR8|5|Its so fun! It doesn't sound like a turbo until you put a drop of oil or some WD-40 in where it spins.
B0013RIOPC|5|Just what we expected and works great.
B00B7WZ3NO|5|muy bueno
B004R3DPEY|3|like the low profile.  really noisy on the X5 without cargo box on
B000HACYNY|5|Works perfectly
B00MV9QNMW|5|Look great, easy to install. Great shipping.
B00WA4ARO8|5|Fits perfectly!
B000BPUTJG|5|Fits no problem. Easy install about 5 minutes
B00877SL2M|1|These lights worked good and looked good for about a month, I installed 5 of them in my vehicle and gradually one by one the started to flicker and within 2 months they were all useless. Had to go around and replace them all with name brand higher quality more expensive sylvania
B00370ZV04|5|A+
B002Y0756Q|5|Very easy to use
B000CSEWJA|5|Great
B006HZIURM|1|Broke after about 30 hours of use.
B00U5IHG1S|1|i dont like it, it looks very cheezy. and they dont fit right its alot of gaps and i was expecting a lil more for 40 dollars. i just ended up painting it myself and it looks more natural
B0025PA5J4|5|Best struts I've ever had on my car.
B00JH24WAQ|4|I got it fast in the mail it was fully charged,it holds a charge good and never dies on me when im having a hard start problem.I would recomend this battery for others.
B00BV0C8TE|4|My favorite hand soap for dirty jobs!
B00GJ1HUB6|5|Way cheaper on Amazon than from NAPA, and WAY cheaper than from the dealer. Dorman compressor went in super easy, and I installed it myself in less than 30 minutes. Most of that time was spent removing the old one that was stuck to the frame.
B004J0YKQC|1|WOW..THE FIRST GUY WAS RIGHT!  THESE COME FROM CANADA AND WAIT TIME IS LONGER THAN MOST[CLEAR CUSTOMS ETC]..YOU WILL HAVE TO BE PRESENT TO SIGN FOR IT[NO EXCEPTIONS]..PACKAGED IN A SINGLE NON PADDED BOX AND WILL ALWAYS ARRIVE DAMAGED.MINE WAS PRETTY BAD,BUT COULDNT WAIT TO GET ANOTHER.I STRAIGHTENED IT AND INSTALLED IT..ALSO IT DOSNT COME WITH NEW CLIPS LIKE A REAL ONE DOES..I GAVE IT ONE STAR FOR THE GOOD PRICE,BUT WOULDNT BUY AGAIN.
B00KTIR1V4|5|This key worked great for my van as I got it as a second set of keys. Now my husband and I both have a set of keys for the van so we cannot get locked out!
B001RJN56Y|5|Great item and service
B009B7A4MW|5|excellent goop for tire mounting at home.
B0023VKWLQ|5|Works as intended. Nice and new.  :)
B0052SF0LO|4|This security light replaced one that had a halogen bulb, so I was expecting that the new one would not be nearly as bright.  But, I was very wrong!  This model, with 60 LED's is surprisingly bright, and it works every bit as well as the older one that finally ceased to take any more useful charges after more than three years.  The new one works well, and is more than adequate to replace the older one in every respect.<br /><br />My only complaint is the base for the mounting bracket for the solar panel, which is very much inferior in versatility to my old one.  Fortunately, I kept that older solar panel mounting bracket, and it is a perfect fit for the new one.  The old mounting bracket has folding arms, that can easily be mounted on wooden supports, like a 2&#34; X 4&#34; or something like that.  The new solar panel mounting bracket is just a short, flat piece of plastic with two holes for screws.
B007VR9PGK|5|Good quality I live in new England and iv had this on my truck for a few months and it still hasn't rusted
B00BEZOSAI|5|I'v had humming birds fly up 3 times now and hover less than an inch from the glasses while working outside. Good price and very comfortable.
B004GE11R2|5|Fit with minor hole adjustments, but was expected.<br />Welded on nuts came loose; although still managed to install!
B004LF90QK|5|Much better than the standard plastic toilet and only a little more expensive.  Mounting it was easy.
B000KYXDVO|4|had to buy this just for the outside plastic cover...overpriced but worth not hearing my wife complain about her original being broke anymore...
B006JRLIVS|5|This arrived quickly and was identical to what was on my 2007 Rockwood.  Not sure aboout quality complaints but it the same cover that the manufacturer used.  Went on easy using caulking tape.
B00PB25CK0|1|This product does not work on right drive tuguan's I will be sending it back.
B000C19DGY|5|Installation took about five minutes, good design. Extra security to help keep out the honest people.
B004XG3KT0|5|Fricken massive!!
B00GYE3ZM6|5|good
B004C0U2SE|5|Great product. It was shipped fast and arrived by the time promised. Mounting holes lined up with previous solenoid making installation easy. I installed this on an industrial piece of equipment that is started and stopped frequently every day, it it performing excellent.
B003G9G4FM|3|Didn't come with a frame
B00E9HWS9G|1|This did not fit my Rav 4 2014 it was too big in the top snd too short on the sides.I would have sent it back but the company does not pay for postage even though it said it would fit my car.
B000MDB6EY|5|Got this for my husband's Ridick (sp) costume. PERFECT!!!
B00SS15RHO|5|Nice piece. Just plug and play.
B007MVNR8M|5|As others have stated, this hitch is VERY easy to install; 4 bolts and completed in about 20 minutes without elevating the vehicle. I used an empty icecream bucket to hold one side up while I fastened the other. Now we have a hitch to mount our bike rack!
B003K5S4NW|3|I used it once... and I'm not sure if it is me or the tool.  Yes.. the angled head makes it possible to better clean my sloped front windshield interior. The cloth may not be the best choice... or I may no be using a good window cleaning fluid.  I'll keep trying... I hope it improves.
B0009H519Y|5|Great stuff.  Very little does wonders.
B00KTHVBW0|4|Fits pretty well.  I purchased this for an old Honda Accord 2001.  Just popped open the old ones and put the circuit board into the new plastic housing I got two (one for every day and one for the spare set).  The buttons feel very similar to the old ones and they are not all scratched up.
B009G5ERVS|5|Ordered wheel bearing assemblies as a set. Better price. Free post and package. They both look exactly like the ones on the 02 Century, to be replaced due to intermittent ABS and traction control issues from the original wires leads or harness assemblies.  150810: Installed wheel bearings without issue. Solved ABS and traction control problem. No longer have  intermittent issues with brake pulse, ABS or &#34;trac off&#34; issues. Minor hum or whine at first after install but soon disappeared after driving to and from work.  160603 UPDATE problem came back. Found bad ABS controller harness. Repaired. OK.  Road noise went away. Wheel bearings work perfectly. 170302 Update. Driver side wheel bearing sensor failed. Ordered 2 new wheel bearing assemblies for better price and will have a spare if the other one fails. These have a 1 year warranty, so I have to purchase new ones.
B00LW6O52K|5|Outstanding product! Gorgeous, fits perfectly and fast shipping. Will be purchasing more for our other vehicles. Thank you!!
B005M226VW|5|Worked perfect on our 1999 Jeep TJ 2.5L
B008QXZ5MQ|5|Don't let the dealership charge you $60+ to replace this filter. I know basically nothing about cars, but after watching a short 'how-to' video online, I was easily able to change the filter in my car by myself. It saved me a lot of money and the hassle of having to take my car to the dealership. The process of changing the filter only took me about 10 minutes.
B011SPPSMA|5|Us seller!Fast shipping!! I am very satisfied with this air freshener.<br />Organic natural slicon looks very unique design and made for 100% essential oil healty for my kids. and good smell too. I just saw there is refillable, which is awesome.<br />I am great to found finally good air freshener in amazon. Thanks
B00684TAYY|2|its not working on gulf. middle east area cars.
B0006305RY|5|I get 40 mpg in my toyota when I use this compared to 34mpg. great stuff
B00KJ189EE|5|Great light
B00ICSOZ8K|5|Real easy to install, Gave my saddle bags a fuller look, love them, and every body sees them, loves the way they look too.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Survived 3 summer trips to NC, and no issues at all.  Easy to store, easy to install, and the straps are heavy duty and easy to use. Works great on my Honda Odyssey.
B00HHGSDHC|5|good part
B00RR247BM|5|Looks great on back window, bought two for my truck but my husband saw it and he wanted one. Very high quality sticker
B00FA9OMGY|5|Very easy to install and remove, and along with the windshield sunshade, they really help keep the car cool.
B00KTI09FE|5|If i could award 6 stars i would. The keys arrived promptly and programming them took seconds. My original 2 keys had split and cracked and had started to unlock the doors only intermittently. I called my local Jeep dealership who wanted $200 for the key and $75 to program, that's each! I could not be happier with this product it saved me so much money, but more importantly for me I beat the dealership! 😊
B00898LAJ0|5|Install was easy-the product was good for my Polaris 800s-2012.  I ran my 800 hard for about 30 miles hard and adjusted the mirror one time. I would recommend this.
B009K7CXX6|5|easy to identify the keys with this on there.
B00K0T94LC|4|Try it and see for your self.  I'll be trying another can, because I just had a tune-up and other work done.
B001QN7ED6|5|made the letters pop
B000C57YQQ|5|I was happy with the improvement on my steering.  It feels more solid.
B009ELOCKU|5|Exactly as described. Work great.
B00OO2HCM4|2|4 stars
B004T76QSA|2|has faded drastically in sun
B001CEG9BC|4|Okay I will try to clear up some confusion about this filter.  It does NOT fit a 2005 Ford focus.  I have watched the online tutorials about installing it and they must be using a different year focus because it is a metal box with a mesh metal screen rather then a plastic one like in the tutorial.  That said this filter is the correct length just not the correct width.  It is about 3 inches too wide.  I decided I was going to use it anyways.  I popped the mesh screen out by simply pushing in on it and breaking the glue holding it in place.  I then used the mesh screen as a template and cut the  filter to the correct width on my table saw.<br />note: Wear safety glasses and go slowly as the fibers on the filter will grab the blade and particles will definitely fly off it while cutting.<br />I then put the filter back in and put the mesh screen on top of it.  I did not try to glue the mesh back in place.  I suppose you could but i wanted to be able to pull it out and shake it off easily.<br />The fan runs strong still and there is  a much better smell in my car now.  So is this a direct fit, no.  Can it be made to work, yes.<br />Good luck :o)
B00D38PFGU|3|didn't fit properly in Infinit G37
B00PT18QAQ|5|Its worth the money
B00FJFD6K2|5|This is a high quality filter, for a great price. It has the socket fitting on the end for easy removal. I use this for my Kawasaki Concours14. Its better quality and cheaper than the &#34; made in china&#34; factory filter. Need I say more?
B00FAVWCDW|5|Very high quality product that fit my Honda Fury perfect and made my seating position much more comfortable. This product also arrived ahead of schedule.
B0027VFZE6|1|jack was broken and missing parts
B0051WS108|2|Did not mention it tracks on speed 10 miles per hour and up not motion.  It loses signal a lot would not purchase it again.  I wish it would track constant motion at slow speeds.  Very disappointed.
B004RCR6TU|1|New burner pops while in use I don't think that the design is correct checked everything that could cause this and nothing helps except restricting air. Not happy with the new design
B00CST9ZJS|5|Perfect works great
B00AOG9PQA|4|very good
B004GC8TW4|5|fits well
B00UZXMPGE|3|Fits my CBR1000 perfect except my bike light stays lit.
B0094XSPME|4|Build quality looks good.  No problems with installation.  Seems to work fine.
B00P1ZQOCC|5|Real eye catcher. Dropped my motorcycle and covered the scratches with the bandade
B00002243Y|4|Haven't had a chance (thankfully) to use them, but they seem like good quality.
B002E387EM|5|Perfect fit! But it does not come with upper spring keeper bolt or new horseshoe clip for brake hose , which would have been nice.
B00PUSPIHM|5|It's a genuine Polaris product, made for the cockpit of the Slingshot. Fits like a glove.
B00SCYYCR8|5|Easy to install and hookup more then enough wiring on the harness had no issues with being to short its literally as simple as 1 2 3!! took me less then 10 to install
B00TOW0NIY|5|Excellent, well made product.
B002X9NX6Y|5|cool decal, looks good
B000N9XFUK|5|Worked great 1990 Bayliner Capri 2050 CX
B00TWLIXU2|5|I purchase this product for a couple of month fishing primary. I dont have to charge it in like three weeks, the lights included in the battery is very usefull.
B00UFERZKO|4|It worked as expected
B00RISWPA0|1|first, I received only 1 emblem, thought it was a pair, my mistake I guess.<br />second, quality is terrible. the letter  &#34;n&#34;  is stretched out and seems to be bent upwards, like it was pulled or stretched out from a heater or something.  i'm not going to put this on my  $30,000 car !
B0053HPFDW|3|Have only used it 3 times, and although it works, it would be a better design if it had a bypass setting.<br />It's either on or off, and I like to warm up my engine before running the salt terminator through it for best results.
B00HJTC9YA|2|I installed these plugs in my 05 Suburban and it ran fine both BEFORE and AFTER the installation EXCEPT for some starting difficulty AFTER.  I know this is strange but after changing just the plugs the car almost never starts up on the first crank. Usually it requires a second crank and occasionally a third. No other changes were made. I just completed a 7500 mile road trip and it still behaves the same. Mileage was good before (close to 20 mpg) and on this trip was 19 mpg. It has about 110,000 miles on it.
B00VGL86SU|5|WOW $7 SHIPPED WITH AMAZON PRIME. THING IS NICE TOO VERY HAPPY
B0068ERNNE|3|heavy rainsuit that is not breathable
B00CCZ15Q4|5|EXTREMELY BRIGHT!!!! I used them for interior lights for my 1980 El Camino. PERFECT. I had to hard wire one. It was easy to install.
B0055AW0N0|4|What can I say? It does the job and is worth having to store the crap you want accessible when driving.
B00A3CL9NC|1|Not a good product. I purchase 2 rolls and had a lost of problems. Could not use the first 8 inches do to very hard chris In the material, it couldn't be taking out. Will not recommend wasting your money.
B004LQCIR2|5|These headlamps work great on my 01 jeep xj, with a set of h4 bulbs and a upgraded wiring harness from dpgoff-road.com you can't go wrong light up the night really good
B000ICNR78|5|Works well. As describe in listing. Arrived very quickly.
B0126GJ69G|4|Looks to be a very nice quality seal
B0047VS5IW|4|Good product would buy again
B0013916XW|5|Peal and stick application, gives a nice finished look.  I am sure the guards will help to protect the paint and does not interfere with door closure.
B00062YNNC|5|filter was just as described,Works perfectly
B000ET525K|5|Peace of mind knowing you can fix a flat tire (caused by a puncture) in less than 10 minutes, anytime, anywhere without removing the tire from the wheel.  My husband originally purchased this to fix flats on his work equipment but we have had occasion to fix tires for ourselves and a few stranded motorists no fuss, no muss. (We also have a VIAIR 90P Portable Compressor in the car to fill the tires with air)
B001AWLTX4|1|Nice looking good design easy breathing only at the back not cover through the neck like in the demo pix still get cold from the wind!
B0049J9IN8|5|as expected
B001F7GJMK|5|WORKS GREAT
B001GBHYTM|1|Installed per instructions, turn signal lights do not work. Waste of time and money.
B00YHEIIQ8|5|I like this much better than the O2 sockets or crow foot. I still need to warm up the engine a little bit to remove the sensor easier. I'm giving my o2 socket to my neighbor, I don't need it any more.
B00DGY88CE|3|Shipping took 3 days longer than stated. But the lights all work and are bright bright blue.
B002WBQC5M|4|Bought this lid a few months ago on my 02 z28 camaro. With a k&n filter, long tube headers, 3&#34; y pipe and slp loudmouth 2 catback, it seems to let the engine breath better. Paired with all these mods car is deff faster, and louder. Overall good purchase. Fit was excellent besides having to heat the maf fitting with a heat gun in order for it to mate together.
B007QSASWE|5|This is a very well made lock for a Rhino-Rack. Just make sure you buy the correct lock for the rack that you have. All of the locks are not the same and will not work on very rack Rhino makes (not sure why they do that). These locks are a bit of trouble to put on (need a socket and ratchet - the tool provided takes forever) but once in place they secure the rack better than anything I've used. It's great not to have to worry about your rack as you drift down the river
B00BXPX8TG|5|Awesome keychain! Focus logo font is up to date. Very satisfied!
B00R8O5F4C|1|Was not able to prime it with oil and was not able to use it, had to put the old one back in.
B00I1KC4PK|5|I'm 5 10&#34; 240 lbs  40 &#34; waist and 48&#34; chest, I have a stocky build got a size 48 and fit was great.
B001U8MPMM|3|it was for my honda crv 2011 and it fit nice except for the arm resters but it wasn't that bad it fit nice
B00358POL4|5|This was exactly what I was looking for and was very easy to apply.
B00BU7UU02|5|Much like everyone else with a 1st Gen Sport Trac, the body mount bushings on my 2004 Sport Trac had disintegrated to practically nothing, causing loud and constant cracking and creaking sounds as I drove around. Decided to buy these based on some good reviews I had read on various forums and I'm glad I did. These fit perfectly, were easy to install, and completely eliminated all of the annoying sounds coming from my truck.
B000C2SCGK|5|Very Nice Gates keep up good work 😀
B00KWWSCJC|4|the solar controller works for a basic need well, if you want more service from a controller, you have to spend more money.
B004TUDIEW|5|Nice finish, fit perfectly. Fair price.
B0066S7FHG|5|I put in myself, works great!
B000N2TK3I|5|perfect
B004NJ8DVW|5|Got here really fast. Pretty spendy for something I can make myself for about 2 cents but it looks pretty good just needs to be a little bigger..
B007GR60V8|1|This is not the kit you will get, the picture is wrong. I was hoping for a kit that actually changed the suspension mounting points (as the one pictured would do) but the kit isn't it. I paid more thinking this is what I was getting. A similar kit to the one sent can bed had elsewhere, cheaper.  I've seen other kits that do what I want so hopefully I'll be able able to get one of those. I'm sure the seller will change the picture to the correct one but that won't help me.  The one photo is what they advertise the second is what I received.
B0078OZTX4|5|Excellent!!! Love that I can access the brightest setting as well as strobe. Can't access the other functions with this buy who cares, not too many pressure switches allow access to strobe!
B008FCD8LI|3|Product is not very functional but is as shown and fast shipping.
B00WH473BQ|5|Great product and very many great uses and lots more
B005H7DARG|4|as advertised
B0027DUPQ2|5|bolt right on to my 2001 Yamaha warrior
B00BCH51ZO|5|great wheel brush! doesn't scratch bbs wheels =)
B00EDQ19EI|5|So far so good. Quick install, worked like the OEM part. Dealer wanted $462 per shock just for the part. Less than 1/2 the price from Amazon. If anyone buys these and not Arnott shocks - you can sell your old shocks to Arnott for $25 each assuming they are the ones Arnott is looking for. Awesome deal overall.
B002E53RN6|5|If you're reading this, you might be familiar with the &#34;turn key, car starts, then shuts off immediately&#34; problem.  Here's the solution.  Feel free to replace the EFI Main Relay and get any other business done while you're under there, but if you're still rolling with the original and now ancient ignition switch, you primarily need this.  Actually, if you can afford it and you have a 6th gen Accord (or compatible) with unserviced ignition switch, you should just buy this anyways because after 16 years, it's going bad.<br /><br />So let's get to the installation part.  You're not gonna take this to the mechanic and make him do it are you?  Of course not.  You're gonna take off the bottom driver side dashboard panel and the steering column cover.  You'll see a black plastic cover which covers the original ignition switch.  It looks like two somewhat difficult to reach screws.  It's actually three.  There's a third one behind the steering wheel, basically.  When it comes to that third screw, you can either cramp your entire hand with a mini screw driver, try to jam a driver ratchet in there, or just break off the plastic cover.  Can't say I'm opposed to the latter most option.  Finally, run the wire and all that jazz.  Might as well bust out some zip ties and make it look clean under there before you put everything back together.
B000KITSMI|1|Wouldn't work with my vehicle<br />Valve too big to pass through.called company, and was basically told me I was sol.i had tried to use it and was therefore used. No refund no ecchange. No good reprobates, in my humble opinion
B00EVY2SKG|5|Lint free, soft
B002DMZA2G|5|What can I say?  It sucks.
B00BQMJV4M|5|it really work, thank you
B0063GT8J4|5|Great product and looks awesome!
B007RW3KJM|4|As advertised. Fits Sonata 2011 SE .
B007JSQ4Q0|5|This suit fits exactly as  described and the material around the inside of the color makes the neck quite comfortable there's plenty of room  so it fits over your riding clothes the Velcro that covers the zipper is wide and grabs very well elastic around the waist helps keep the  suit from ballooning as you're riding and so far I have not gotten wet at all 100% dry highly recommend
B00NL63NB8|3|These are ok. They're not quite worth the money.
B00SNQ5G6Q|2|returned. Description stated it would fit the vehicle but it didn't even come close.
B00BDEO6CK|5|Keeps my toilet running!
B004XJMTNK|5|Bought this originally as a joke against my friend's H1 Hummer<br />Now My Jeep is living up to this tag.
B00J5SP6VG|5|Outstanding...
B000E28N7G|5|Great filter for a great price. Never  problem with any K&N filters. Definitely recommend.
B007GR4LIC|2|I have a 2015 ranger crew and this cover fit perfect elastic around the bottom would sinch up on the tires and hold in place. The biggest problem is this only lasted 3 months out in the sun before it started tearing and was completely faded out. I would have thought I could at least get a year out of it
B001AJH1HK|5|These mirrors are well worth the money. After towing a 23 foot camper with out any extra mirrors, and then attaching these to my Ford Explorer the difference is outstanding. There is a little shake to them but it's not bad.
B000IZAUO8|3|Curt makes a great product and I expect to be happy with it now that it is installed. My 2009 Toyota Tacoma did not have the two bolt holes in the bumper so I had to have a professional drill the two holes needed and install the hitch for me. Curt needs to check this out and warn owners like me.
B005FQTNQG|5|Looks great, works well, and fits the cup holder of my wife's E350. A little pricey but it appears to be high quality and she loves it. Holds 14oz.
B004SNJPV0|5|It is easy to put in!w
B00429NKWK|5|This stuff works incredibly well. Took about 20 mins restoring each headlight and they look brand new. I'll definitely buy it again to use on ny other car.
B006N9E1IO|5|Installed this on my Toyota Prius 2007, and it replaced my 200k mile oem ones which to say the least, were completely shot. They worked great, and fit well. Will update review if I ever change them out or if they fail.
B00CAKILAO|5|Great for the price
B010N7RW2S|5|Well designed, compact size. If you have ever needed to charge your battery/jump start your vehicle, this is a very functional item. It can also charge/power your phone, tablet or Ipod for hours and hours when no other source of power is available.
B00P9OF04I|5|The results look very good! The headlights are clear and transparent, light output at night seems better. That's why I give the product five stars.<br />Here are some additional thoughts:<br />It confused me and almost kept me from buying it that it is described as &#34;cleaning&#34; the lens. There was no dirt on my lenses, current plastic headlights become dull and opaque over time. It is the acrylic itself that is damaged, not some type of debris or dirt that accumulated and sits on the surface.<br />My lights were most affected on the upper half of the light. I think commercial automatic car washing plays a role in that. I could see the scratches in the acrylic. That's why I was sceptical about this product. There was nothing too clean off.<br />I followed instructions and realized step one is an abrasive pad and an abrasive liquid agent. It does remove surface layers of the acrylic. I used both my hand and a 3&#34; drill plate. I prefer the manual, drill can be easier on round lenses, you have to avoid overheating or running dry and keep the pressure low to medium.<br />My advice is to use a lot of time on this first step. I also washed with water (water hose) and dried several times.<br />I was not able to get a real good even frosted surface just with this product. I cheated and used a cheaper 3M restoration kit and the abrasive discs and buffer with it. I had used it and results with it had been ok, but not excellent. Once my lights lookened evenly frosted and smooth I washed the polishing compound with lots of water and dried everything off. You need to remove any &#34;cleaner&#34;  and smudge from the lights. I used microfiber towels and paper towels. I taped the surrounding areas of my lights and kept my hood oped. Be careful you don't want any smudge or hair fuzz on the lenses, rubbing with a towel can create static  Anything that may be left will be caught by the sealer and you cannot wipe it off.<br />The last step makes this product shine (pun intended). You spray a sealer on the surface of the light. Immediately you see the final result. Apply a thin layer. It is kind of like a clearcoat and fills in the smaller surface imperfections. By the (toxic) smell of it I suspect it actually chemically bonds to the acrylic of the headlights . I applied two to three layers. After 3-5 minutes you can carefully touch and I let it then &#34;cure&#34; overnight.  I would not drive the car within the first 6-12 hours. A little rain after 5-10 minutes of spraying should be fine.<br />Bottom line my results look very good. This does what it's supposed to do. If you get hazy lights I suspect you either didn't remove all surface scratches or left some slurry on the lens before sealing.<br />I ordered a 2nd kit for our truck. The special thing about this kit is the sealer spray. You can achieve step one with any kind of abrasive disc or slurry.<br />The kit does not come with masking tape. I believe the sealer bonds chemically to acrylic and you may not have to tape, I chose not to take a chance an used masking tape.
B000BQSIWK|5|Product was simple and easy to use. Worked well on charging car battery. No issues so far.
B00GI77I86|5|We have purchased both Green and Blue Pilot 194 LEDs, and are totally satisfied. They are plenty bright for what I used them for. I'm sure there are some brighter, and am positive there are many that don't work as well.
B005FI5J5I|5|Only 2 screw holes, but should be enough.  My car has 4 screws, though.  Whatever.  They look like diamonds!  A+!  They make my masculine looking car a little more feminine!
B004W6N57S|5|Look great.
B000C5YD42|5|very good price but after I purchased it I found out I had to pay tax on it and ended up paying $4 too much.
B0002JMHY6|5|Perfect manual if you own an older jeep and want to do it yourself
B007TG7IJY|3|I installed two sets last year at the start of the rainy season (September 2014). A 26&#34; and 19&#34; each onto a 2013 Honda and 2011 Subaru. Both cars garaged full-time. The wiper blades on both cars started making an annoying squeak within a month. It would go away with the windshield washer but would come back within minutes. I keep one of the cars especially clean and it will squeak regardless of how clean or dirty the windshield is. I keep the blades clean and wipe them down with each wash. They still remove rain just fine, but I will be replacing them soon as I can't stand the noise for another rainy season.
B000AMBOX0|5|Well there are better products, but you will find they are half the size and twice the price! You will not get a better product for the money. The shine on the car is excellent. Note, check photo. It mentions wax in the product. It may add some protection between hand waxing. Have a good look around for this Turtle Wax. You may find it at different prices, depending on where you look!
B00335HFX4|1|They are not &#34;sure fit&#34; at all.  Without the provided Velcro this would slide all over and even with the Velcro these slide. Not worth the money spent, I should have just bought Weather Tech's.
B005PYHYK0|1|Really cheap quality. Zippers are constantly coming apart. Quite a pain to install.
B005DUNK2W|5|excellent product!  great lights which live up to and exceed the pictures, would buy again if needed but now will look into headlight bulbs.
B00D6H6XU0|5|It's nice
B00JIJ4LWW|5|Researched the rest and bought this one.<br />Couch  looks like new.. That's a white couch!
B000BXKYYI|5|WORKED GOOD FOR FILLING MY TRACTOR WITH FUEL., NO SPILL.
B00VGIAX66|4|Nice and bright, easy to install, waterproof and perfect for a long trailer
B003V3RVWI|5|Great single application cleaning system
B00II5YADC|5|Moves lots of water away very quickly.  We have been using this &#34;squeegee&#34; for many years in our shower. Great quality.
B00V1OIOXY|4|Great
B00YHILLCW|4|Installed these on my Jeep Wrangler to get rid of the blind spot that makes smaller cars disappear as they drive beside me. Does the job decently - I can see the car, but due to the convex shape there is no depth perception. One of mine came with a small crack in the edge of the mirror but not big enough to return it. I think these look much nicer than generic black-rimmed plastic blind spot mirrors and are less noticeable because of the silver rim. If you need blind spot mirrors for your vehicle, I'd recommend these.
B002XM50LW|2|For the price, they should hold up better.  I bought 3 and after less than 2 summers of use, they are shot already.
B0002Z9R52|5|Ignore the negative reviews for not fitting the vehicle. It's your job to check the size and you can easily cross reference with the PIAA site(2016-PIAA-Wiper-Application-Guide.pdf).<br /><br />These are amazing. I was worried they wouldn't fit properly due to the thickness on refills. These are driver 6mm. They go to 8mm on the driver side and 6mm on the rear.<br /><br />They fit the 2015 Sorento perfectly on the OEM. Clean amazing. If these even last a year they are worth it.
B0009OR906|3|Meh....
B000UD0CTQ|5|good
B0040CZ79S|5|good quality and fast shipping very good
B0040DVL6U|5|Amazing I can see my quarter glass windows
B00BCRMAAS|1|It ripped and did not fit my 2007 Grand Prix, when it said it would fit
B000C59WHA|4|The price was very good on Amazon, but parts store Moog is usually a very heavy premium and simply not worth it. They're holding up fine but do require some breaking in before steering functions properly. I recommend matching the original tie rod length as precise as possible and making a few sharp turns both ways before you take it to get aligned. Only issue with the part is that they were not as greased as I like them out of the box, thankfully these include a grease fitting.
B00062ZS6S|5|Wife's car just hit 80K miles & was running sluggish when accelerating. Used this one time and noticed a difference within a week. Much smoother and less &#34;stuttering&#34; when accelerating. Will definitely use again.
B009W3Q4RO|5|Best price out there.  Perfect.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Easy to use, very simple. Worth the price. May not offer a lot of detailed information like more expensive scanners, but reads and clears codes, and gives you a place to start troubleshooting.
B00DQ1RV70|5|as described
B000UOFBQO|5|Did the trick and a snap to install.
B00TXW33DW|5|Plug in and go. Can't get much simpler then that. Was having issues with the servo motor throwing error codes every time I started it. Removed the while servo motor, plugged in the viz-tech and haven't had a problem since
B000OAG2DK|5|Awesome shower head, don't get a blast of cold water when you turn it back on like you do with most of the shower heads that come in RV's!!!
B00O3X93WQ|1|Buyer beware not real Cree led's
B00199N4G8|4|works great so far (1 day in use). Received in a timely fashion.
B00OUPLCAI|4|Works as expected!
B007KPTKD6|4|didn't fit with the tweeter bar I have, but they were made very nice and looked of very good quality
B000AMBHG4|5|Used in my RV traveler trailer.  Works well.  It has a test alarm also..
B00JMUETYC|5|Nice quality, as advertised. Fits key blank tight. Does not have RFID but mine went right in with some epoxy. Great solution to cracked cases.
B005CLP980|5|it is nice to have a door handle that works again.  Price was great, much lower than dealership.
B00DYTD9NO|5|Very light weight and good quality and is difficult to kink.  It should last a long time.
B003UO1IV8|4|Slightly sloppy fit, & thin otherwise O.K. ordered specifically for 2004 Sprinter.
B0049LAOYS|5|Same as the OE hardware, they worked out great. They were USA made and at a great price.
B0016HYTBM|5|AS ADVERTISED, WORKS GOOD. THANKS
B007ZSZAKK|2|All the velcro tabs melted off the first day.
B00F2OK39M|2|Pros: it fits; it looks like the stock mirror. Cons: it is of generally lesser build-quality than the stock mirror; fold-in is stiff and yet the hinge is loose -- it vibrates when driving (easy to contrast the one I replaced with the other which is stock).
B009S2V4MY|2|Didn't fit at all.  I was attempting to install this and when I went to put in the ball joint nut the control arm wasn't sitting down like it was supposed to.  The cup for the cone just wasn't deep enough.  I've used dorman parts in the past and will again in the future but they need to step up their QC game.
B00BJF0CK8|5|Good quality! Fast Ship!
B001Y8NDM4|5|Wouldn't leave home on a camping trip without it. I love the tan color and the fact that it drains well after a rain storm.
B0032HC04W|4|I put this on my 2005 Nissan titan..... it looks nice, it came quickly, and it was easy to install.<br />Only problem is, it partially covers the truck bed holes so the chrome strap inserts I had,(and used), needed to be removed. In other words, if you had a ladder rack on your truck, this cover wouldn't work for you.... they send a catalog with the cover that shows that they have a ladder rack that has a cover like this, I'm interested in it but I don't see how they get around not cover up the holes on the bed rail.<br />Also, I had a different brand on my f150, it was a little heavier material and it locked differently than this cover so I'm not sure how long it will hold up. The other one was an access roll up cover...... time will tell
B00YI3KHGM|5|Sound is great! Definetly louder than stock yet not too loud. The spark arrester screen burned out within a half hour of riding.
B0116ANF40|1|Poor quality dated scratched and rusted with dents
B00KQCMCQM|2|Quickly disintegrated in the heat.
B000CQHUYG|5|Fit tight, no leaks.  I bought cheaper ones before and had leaks and loose pipes.  These are worth the extra cost (what little there is)
B00Q7G54RA|5|Price is very affordable and fits good
B00IMNEE5E|5|Fantastic! The Pink horns helped identify my Lyft vehicle for my riders, caused a Portland Police Officer to follow my new Subaru Legacy either out of jealousy or suffering from a moment of chronic cranial anal inversion until recognizing they are not illegal like aftermarket lighting would be, have had many positive comments from others on the road, and if I were gay would have gotten lucky at least three times by now! lol Highly recommend his product in a variety of wonderful colors. Also the owner is very responsive when contacted!
B000AS3D3I|5|Fit perfectly
B001T0SYV2|5|It replaces the same battery and it works
B00K1IH0U4|5|Awesome decal
B00ZE3WFCE|5|Works great and fit grest
B0052SF0LO|2|Install was easy and the length of the cord connecting the solar panel is long enough to allow for a lot of placement options. The light was bright enough to light up my entry way at night and the distance the motion sensor works was fantastic. This light was everything I wanted it to be, until it stopped working after about 6 months. Tried manually charging the included battery and checked all connections and verified there were no breaks in the cable but for whatever reason, the unit just stopped working. Looks like others have had better luck but I'm not sure that I'd try this product again.
B004UL5V40|5|cute as a key can be!  the light comeson very easily and I don't know how long it'll keep an edge but for the price it sure is handy
B001L9KJ50|5|i love it. i added a patch to the back.
B00CODRQ6C|5|This hitch performed just a expected as per previous reviews also testified. Easier to install than other hitches I've installed over the years. dealership was out of their minds asking $500...hides nicely behind panel of my 2015 Santa fe Ultimate / AWD.
B00Z7KIZPA|4|I was offered a pouch in exchange for an honest review, and though it is called a &#34;purse pouch&#34; I have found it to be quite nifty in keeping things close and preventing them from rolling around while I'm driving.<br /><br />I think as far as car accessories go it works well, and I can say the only thing that kept me from giving it the full 5 stars was the fact that it wasn't quite as snug as I would like it to be, but for what I have been using it for in the car it works.<br /><br />Something nifty that women and men will find a use for, I have to say I would suggest this product to others for sure.
B008PJ8WEO|5|Nice product. Installed in minutes in my 1981 Caprice and fit perfectly. Clips a little different than the originals but work. Nice upgrade to my old rodent ridden original insulation. Good product overall.
B00UUCPJ3Q|5|Good price and great waffle weave for glass with no streaks.
B00NGOYD7I|5|Easy to install
B009IK94JQ|1|Only received 1 1/2 of 2 complete key chains. Then, it broke in 3 days.
B00NLMD6L4|5|Great cover for the price. I've has it for about a month now with daily use, no rips and fits my 2015 Camry very well.
B00WDSVEE8|4|Product arrived as promised.  I would suggest including the siz of the lens.
B00E0IK93Q|5|Hell of a lot cheaper than buying it at a motorcycle store and it's high end quality. Yes the sprocket is steel which weighs significantly more than aluminum, but if you are just riding around town, do you really need the weight reduction? I'll rather have the incredibly longer lifetime than a pound or two shaved off.
B00BK85KO2|1|Worst installation method ever. Plus the slots do not align with all the holes in the hood. I got 5 out of 6 screws in - not fastened tight - and try as I might, the last one would not go in. Upon closer examination, I realized that it wouldn't go in because the slot was an eighth of an inch off. If I could return this thing I would, but it's been longer than 30 days, so I'll have to try and modify it to fit. What a pain.
B00UT6206C|5|Love this lanyard, a little expensive but it was worth it
B000CSGX1U|5|they worked
B003RX2QQ8|5|Bought this for my mom's car. Took all of 5 minutes to set up for her. Looks exactly like the original did before it basically disintegrated from years of use.<br /><br />Mom loves it!
B000CSEUPG|5|These work great, so well in fact on a rusty tank I have one attached and the fuel entering is a nice orange color the othef side is a nice clear color as the way it should be.
B000B8I61G|2|Does not fit in most newer model trucks. The interior part of the doors are so thick that it will not reach the window to slide and hang.
B004KEKAY8|1|Plastic garbage
B006IV6CAW|4|ok
B00CC04E1C|5|These are a great set of decals. Perfect for windows. Also as cut outs work amazing as stencils for a wall.
B00F8NUASQ|4|Met our expectations, but we found an easier installation method than what was provided.  Only took us about 20 minutes.
B00UJAC8VA|4|yes it work fine thank you
B00BSKTUXO|5|Excelent
B00EECLCNO|5|Bought these for my 2004 VW Touareg. Dealership wanted $168 per bulb + labor! It took less than 20 minutes to swap out both front bulbs.<br /><br />Makes me want to find others in the same situation and help them out!
B002NAMJHC|5|Nice as described
B004AHDBLE|5|worked for my car. worked at the first fill, won't leak anymore, I'm about to sell this car and I was very afraid I'd have to do re-do my steering rack and spend half the price of my car. This has worked ever since.
B00I4SR1SO|5|Nice helmet.  I bought it through 303 cycle via Amazon.  I looked at the LS2 sizing chart, and it told me to get a large, as my head measured around 23.5&#34;, which is really big.  I bought it and it was way way too small.  I sent it back and got an XXL.  This fits really well.  With the cheek pads in, its still a bit too tight, without them maybe a bit too loose.  I'd like to compress them or shave them back a bit.<br /><br />Overall the quality and look of the helmet are top notch.  My two friends who have held it and tried it on immediately commented on how light it is.  I also bought the blue reflective visor for it - looks great.
B000EDUUJ4|5|Very nice fit on our RV ladder and carries our Chairs perfectly...
B00387DX0G|3|ok product
B004MXGXIY|3|Should work as expected.
B00MEVPQLG|5|I am blown away by the fact that this little thing really can do all of the things it boasts to be capable of. I mean I used it to charge everything I own!!! My smartphone, Kindle Fire, my laptop and even my 8 cylinder, Lincoln Aviator. Jump starting my truck was what I had to see to believe!!! But sure enough it actually did start my truck while sitting in the palm of my hand. I don't think there's an electronic device out there that the mini jump starter can't handle. I love it.
B00J00X3NW|5|the best one for 2012 focus, even better than silver bottle mobil 5w-30.
B000CSIODA|5|perfict fit
B00843V6KI|5|Pretty good
B00LW6O8X6|5|I really like these seat covers.  Very durable.  Dog hair does not stick to them.  I have a Prius V and the fit well for a universal fit. (A few wrinkles)  I would purchase them again and would recommend them to any one.
B0068OBVN2|1|Does not fit the year specified
B00DCNPSU4|1|Please do not buy this product.  Had the product installed and within six weeks noticed a poping noise - the joint broke and company refused to refund our monty.
B00R26RCVK|5|Works exactly as described!  I use it after working out and it is quick and easy to put on and take off. The cover fits over my leather car seat and stays put. When not needed, I can fold it up and store it in my car door.  Very satisfied wth my purchase!
B000O0FCCC|5|Looks awesome.  In fact, it's so cool looking that I'm upgrading my tank bib to match.
B001JT5QNW|5|This antenna has large brackets and was very easy to install on my tractor.  I get a great signal and am able to talk to the folks I need to.  Nice packaging.
B00OD43NMQ|5|Bought this item for a 2015 Ram 1500 Big Horn Crew Cab, fits perfectly and looks great. I asked Dave at Car Console Covers via email for a different color and he was glad to accommodate me. Great customer service.
B00SOH7VCQ|5|Awesome product tons of light from these little things ! This is only 2 lights per wheel well on my vehicle in the photos
B00CDWSFW8|5|Prefect
B000GQ6LF6|5|Good deal.
B007V2VJ2I|5|Great intake. I installed this on my 2006 330i, e90 chassis, and it took only about 45 minutes to do...I even had it same day delivered. Funny how fast we can get stuff now. Anyway the change in the sounds at and above 3000rpm are a great improvement. I would even say the car is slightly more powerful however I have nothing to measure that with great buy, fair price.
B003AN1UA8|5|Great Product! Excellent for my 5th Wheel Trailer.
B004N7TFO8|5|looks good good pice
B005UGF9E6|5|My husband loved his mask! Wore it to work all of the time and we had no problems minus it scaring our son! Fit well and washed fairly well, I didn't put it in the dryer though.
B0008D6O5E|1|Cheap junk, don't buy  This is made out the same stuff the reusable food bags are made from. Thin will carry no wait and slides around in my jeep.
B0075KB3W2|5|It came right on time, it had a few bubbles but that's because I goofed when putting it on. And they were easy to smooth over with a card
B00K0TPNGM|4|I have a love, hate relationship with this set, I love to fabricate parts and tools that nobody else makes, but I hate that I look at something and say to myself that would look good with a few dimpled holes in it... And yes they are home made...
B0068M8NNU|5|Just what my M103 needed.
B00Y1RDJP6|1|First, hardware included is not fully correct. It comes with longer bolts, but you need to provide your own spacers. Second, after spacing, I had the support on the left side contact my belt guard. Upon trying to bend the left support out to provide adequate clearance for the belt guard, the WELD broke. Very poor quality weld, was not ground before welding, and looked like it was ready to break even before I tried to bend it.
B010JRGD86|5|Great product, an got here fast. Looks beautiful on the car.
B0073IY1FW|5|Nice product
B0010DZZQA|5|great people can be smoking cigarettes outside and I cant even smell it but before I could smell it. Thanks
B001Y93RKQ|1|Very cheaply made, too small and I am being forced to pay $7.90 to return this item when it doesn't fit!  Not happy!
B0081SGENK|5|Everything exactly as described.
B00MC72Q1K|5|Look GREAT on the rear of my RV for good visibility to other drivers
B00464GOPG|1|Ordered this for my 2012 Prius V: it didn't fit.<br />Decided it was too much effort to try to ship back, but waste of money.
B00P9EZH0A|5|Great part for the price
B00KCT6NGE|5|Purchased for my husband to hold the key to his 'new' used Mazda Miata-he loves it!
B000C9QEF4|5|first oil change at 742 miles. perfect,it was on gorilla tight tho. took some muscle..
B00GSAUHB8|5|It works great, easy to use.
B00SF3U9W8|4|Fit a lil tight on my 2011 GMC Sierra Z71<br />But works great super bright white very needed I have black interior
B00KSP8N7O|5|I really like these I was confused on how many actually came with the order I placed.  For some reason I thought I was getting 10?  That would have been the sweetest deal ever.  Thanks.
B001NI7KE2|5|Great
B00OYM74GS|5|good lights good price
B00032KC30|5|Just what I needed for the license plate frame.
B00309YWH0|5|I have an Infinity hot tub and had replaced this gasket once before with a different brand which wasn't thick enough. This gasket is a perfect fit.
B0015Y5848|4|Worked great, very happy with the product.
B00335HQBU|1|They are not &#34;sure fit&#34; at all.  Without the provided Velcro this would slide all over and even with the Velcro these slide. Not worth the money spent, I should have just bought Weather Tech's.
B00D0C2A12|2|Fit really well, look very nice and not difficult to install. Good choice for covering my old torn seats. Changing my review as the covers did not last very long at all. Got about a year out of them and the driver seat which is the only one that ever gets used is worn through on one side. Not sufficient longevity for the price.
B000CITK8S|5|Works great for a c6 corvette when not using it and you need the battery to be topped off.
B00K1O2JO0|5|worked perfectly.
B000M8NZ70|1|doesn't work
B00SWTN94U|1|I gave it one star but it doesn't even deserve one star. It doesn't  fit with suzuki gsxr 750 and when you realized that doesn't fit well and wanted to return it company asked you to ship it chine and once they received item they are willing to refund  your money. By the way you have to pay shipping cost. It doesn't worth to waist the time and money.
B0020J866Y|5|Perfect fit and looks great
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great sunshade.
B00FDGVMVW|1|Don't waste your money....apparently universal doesn't include 2013 Wrangler JKU and can't get any information on returning it so I guess I just threw my money in the trash.
B00EIIP9EM|5|Excellent Quality Product
B00I1KMO14|5|Done the job on my 1999 4x4 Polaris, full charge and holding.
B000CGFY30|5|Exact fit
B00079FOK0|5|I used this while sanding and sealing a hardwood floor. It worked GREAT. Not only is it comfortable to wear, it's easy to breathe in, it kept the fumes and dust out. The price is reasonable too.  I am planning on ordering another one for my next home project.
B004HJAS7K|1|Hated hated hated this thing.  It was ruff and hurt my hands to hold on to it for very long.  I trashed it after a week.
B002OPD9Q6|5|Needs jetting but sweet
B00NGWCWQE|4|Nice product, but some of the hot glue holding the LED's in place didn't bond well and I had to re-glue otherwise would've been 5 stars. .
B00J46EF7K|5|Thanks!
B005CLL4WK|5|nice
B00F8LF77W|5|Perfect
B000BNOIB8|5|The cover arrived on time and in good condition. I took it out of the box and looked over the instructions. I had it installed in about 20 minutes. I've do a lot of traveling in the summer so it's seen a couple of thousand miles. I've been through some torrential downpours and it hasn't leaked one drop of rain. My father-in-law has the same cover on his truck, which is why I went with Lund. He's more critical than I, and he thinks it's great. I agree. It's priced right and does a good job.
B004HPSI6M|5|works as expected. no concerns
B003BNHKBK|5|Great budget mirror.  Served my needs perfectly because of the low profile bar clamp.  It fit between the roof of my Teryx and the cage bars easily.  Doesn't move around.
B00L6FWK0G|3|Too a long time to receive & won't fit the caps we have now .
B00LFQ3BQS|2|The front rotors DO NOT fit a 2001 Legacy GT Limited even thought it says it does.
B00E9MDF9S|5|Perfect fit, I bought the one for sensor first from another place and didn't fit right, this one is perfect
B004U7N7YA|5|worked well
B00QFZUVH6|4|For the price is a good cover, easy to handle,fits my Jetta just fine. I don't know how it will hold the rain but in my city it hardly ever rains. For what used it , to keep my car clean, dust free, bird droppings and to keep it cool , this is a good cover.
B002PQU76O|4|nice fit, look like OEM, but shake a little when driving
B0002NYBC8|1|Did NOT Work !!!
B00R6TNFQY|5|as expected
B00HJ1592C|1|Junk!  Not worthy of Amazon.  Installed it and the very first time the tailgate was closed, the black heel &#34;insert&#34; popped off onto the ground.  Real nice!  I picked up the piece and am now faced with finding a way to glue it back on?  If I wanted an arts and crafts project I would take up knitting.  Very disapointing because the wife loved it and was looking forward to it's arrival.  Now it's just sitting on the workbench waiting for me to decied what glue works best on cheap junk.  2 thumbs down here.
B00GSAUHB8|5|It stays up when in use with your visors down. It helps keep your car cooler in the sun. It folds and stores easily. It does not take much storage space and would even fit in larger glove boxes. I love mine.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Perfect! Easy on and easy off.
B0002U268M|5|Stuff works great! I used rubbing compound first since my lights were very foggy and rubbing compound is very aggressive. After the 3M cleared them up even more to a high gloss. Then I sealed them with Blue magic. The lights looked new again.
B006ZBO9WI|4|Looks sexy on my Road king, but I get a lot of of wind and rain on the face, specially going 120 Km`s , 70 miles/ hour, so more beauty than practicality, I still miss my 19 inch wind deflector :(
B00414G8ZM|3|Though i am impressed with the handle, I am not so with the entire unit. The Nylon strap is thinner than I thought and the 1 inch wide strap is just too narrow. A 1.5 inch strap would be better as it will not cut into the item you are strapping down.  I would use these for strapping the motor bike down....NOT a large bike, but one that is about 750 cc or less. As time goes by, ALL straps get worn and their strength goes with age or sun worn  For tying down equipment that has right angle corners or odd angles. I am afraid that the thinner strap will wear through and eventually break.  They are 200% better than those orange paper thin strap from Harbor Freight ( Which is a accident waiting to snap), but not as good as Costco's red color straps that sell for about 2/3 the price.
B00HD50BEK|4|i like it  not to bad
B000E4N1YY|1|plastic junk and lock wont stay in had to buy another one from local shop
B0091OE6K6|4|I get a pain in my left shoulder from seat belts so decided to try this.  It does redirect the pressure because it allows me to adjust where the seatbelt will cross my shoulder.  I definitely like it better than other kinds of seatbelt stops I have tried.  This one clips onto the seatbelt in the area of your lap and is out of the way of you don't want to use it.  If you do want to use it, you just slide the seatbelt into the clip, very easy to do.  The only drawback is that it does pull the lap belt up a little bit so it does not sit as snug.
B0097EJRSQ|5|I just installed this in a 2016 WRX, which means it will also fit in the 2015 and almost certainly the STI. Instead of plugging into the hazards, it plugs right into the cubby light. One white connector to the light, and the other white connector to the car's wiring harness that previously plugged into the light. The two black wires are for each light on each side, and they're very easy to run around the panels. Plug and play, lights right up, and looks awesome. Not too bright; nice and subtle red.
B0081SD0B4|5|Exact OE replacement.
B007I9Y2QY|3|ok
B00VXNK490|5|This an excellent extender I will recommended to any one who need one
B003L31RK0|5|so good about this oil filter, thanks.
B00BF0BK44|1|Is a cool product but it can not get wet . I have replace it twice and this last time I cealed all the cracks and the rear sticky paper cause it gets wet and it ruins it.
B001DJI1QW|4|A little bulky but works well and seems to be fairly well built
B00LP7RJ4W|1|thumbs down! anti-theft screws? really? i couldn't take them off at all and they striped the original nut on the mercedes license plate bracket. i had to pay another 60 bucks for a new bracket and for mercedes to take off the screws... i wanted them off because the rattle and turn even if they are tightly on.
B00NSCT90Y|5|Worked great and matches the existing
B00L97QOMG|5|super easy to program, opened the mail and was using in within 2 minutes. all buttons work great. will be buying another one.
B0023VKVV2|5|BEST PRICE MIRRORS... BEST PRICES!!! Awesome product, SAFE shipping, and out of this world customer service. I cant say enough!
B003RCFFTE|5|Bought direct from company. Customized plate and mounting frame was exactly as described, very reasonably priced, and easy to install on my 99 Golf. Considering another for my 90 420SEL.
B007IBIREA|5|Laser engraved and sturdy metal feel and look
B0081KZJAM|5|My car sits in the sun most days, and although I have a great AC, the steering wheel gets mighty toasty!<br /><br />This sunshade does the job, and I would recommend it.<br /><br />I have a 2012 Toyota Corolla,
B00NFSICV8|5|Works great! Picks up dust well and makes cleaning so much easier. It makes it easier to dust figurines too since i can grab it with this mitt and wipe around it using my fingers inside the mitt.
B007CLNIZY|5|Just like original
B003O0YO0U|5|Very easy to install.
B0085SSIY4|4|this w/shield will make a big difference in your comfort,I know  ,, great product,, It will however knock your milage back some,,,  I really like mine on a vulcan 500 ltd,
B00TDOGY04|3|The scents are nice and the leather smells like leather and smells good, but they don't last very long. I spray these and after a few minutes the smells is gone. Even when I leave the room or car and come back a bit later you can't smell it anymore. It's only good for a quick blast of scent just because you want to smell it at that moment.
B002OUQI3W|4|It's plastic with a lock on it, but seems to work ok.
B006P0XCP4|5|All as stated.
B0002Q7BZ4|5|Fit perfectly and fast shipping
B00I3F38OY|3|Good choice but ocassionally sticks when trying to disengage the belt.
B006X8AVY8|5|VERY NICE QUALITY PRODUCT,EASY TO INSTALL,GOOD DEAL
B000TK9FE8|5|I have 7 vehicles and this worked good om all 7 vehicles.
B001MP2RRG|5|Item not listed as OEM, but it might as well be! It looks the same, the colors are the same (if not 100%, then unnoticeable), and it came in perfect condition. ALSO, it is an extremely reasonable price.
B001IWLCXI|1|Doesn't fit my 2015 Volkswagen GTI even though it states on Amazon and the Valeo website that it does. Waste of money.
B0000CBIK5|5|Excellent quality for the price!
B000GU5IH4|4|Priced right.  Covers my 97 BMW with saddlebags and windscreen competently.  I have not owned it long enough to speak to it's durability.
B00GXHUXV0|5|A true Whovian should grin with pride like the Doctor (either Tom Baker or David Tennant) after installing this fantastic license plate on their vehicle (mine is an F-250 diesel!)  It's as well made as my state-issued plate and came sealed in clear plastic which I left on to help it stay clean a bit longer.
B0087QZBHQ|4|I like the way it fits the handle bars and the color acsents my bike
B00REU0JJQ|5|Works as advertised
B000BQR100|5|I live in the desert and it really helps to keep the car cooler. Also with the direct sun, touching anything metal inside the car can be painful so it is a necessity.  It is very flexible and is easy to set it on the windshield.  I find it much easier to use than the cardboard accordion sun shade.
B004LFAASC|5|Identical to the original part.  Steps now work like they're supposed to.
B002MQCY7C|1|I guess I am in the minority, but this was the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon!  I give it one star, because it was what I ordered, BUT I didn't know how difficult it would be to use!!  Maybe my fingers are too big, but I could not find the slot to make the clip work!  Then, when I finally did find it, it was almost impossible to open it up!!  There was a time I thought I would have to cut off my chin strap to get my helmet off!!  It was way too difficult to find the place to squeeze on the clip.  Then you really had to squeeze it hard to undo the clip.  It took my more time to use this device than it took to use my D rings!!!  So I'm back to my  D rings.  I also found out that once you put the receiving end of that clip on your helmet, YOU CAN'T GET IT OFF!!!  I tried squeezing the metal prongs together, but that didn't work.  I had to use a cutting wheel to cut off the plastic portion of the clip, and take it off my helmet.  I know I am in the minority, but I thought you should get both sides of the story.
B000M5X0IM|5|works better than a paint brush when lubing up a tire to mount.
B00SYTB2WE|5|I love this product. It works extremely well and makes my tires GLISTEN. I used to use Armor All, but this will definitely be replacing that!
B00B2AFT9O|4|Installation of Spacers went pretty straight forward, the installation of the shift adapter was another story.  Removing the old one and installing the new one looks so easy by the instructions but in my rig it was a different story.  I did manage to get it installed and it is working fine, no cutting of the shift boot or floor console as others have talked about.  The bumper relocation brackets didn’t fit quite as you would want but it’s a plastic bumper so you could make them fit.<br /><br />All in all the lift looks good and solid, tranny shifts normally and stays in gear, and I getting a recovery back bumper so the factory one doesn’t matter.  I do not see the space as a big issue, a little flat back paint and it all looks good.<br /><br />The shift adapter was the biggest challenge but it worked out.<br /><br />I was disappointed with no Rough Country decals in the kit,  oh well.

B000GOJW9K|4|My grand daughter has a 2004 Honda Odyssey and she began to have trouble with the front fan that mounts just under the glove box.  The fan would stop and then if it would restart it would make a dying noise.  Well went to the Amazon site and searched for a replacement fan and try to save the girl a few bucks.  Looked at some YouTube videos and found several that show how to remove and replace the unit.  Very easy and had the right tools.  The original fan cage was just a bit different then the one I bought but I dry fitted it and it was a perfect fit. Put screws back in and connected it to the power plug and works great.  Been a month now and still keeping her and my great grand kids cool.
B00WF05E6S|5|Great Item my friend is going to love them.  Keeps him from loosing his lighter.
B00UNTU3VO|5|No complaints at all about the duster itself. The bag-case you store it in splits down the side seam quite easily; if they'd beef that up this duster would be perfect.
B005VKLGUW|5|Just what I needed -- the original case cracked around the screw after the dealership replaced the battery for me.  They wanted $150 for a new key.  Purchased this shell, moved the electronics (and the little bar magnet in the slot next to the electronics) into the shell.  Went to my local hardware store and they cut the key in 5 minutes.  Works like a champ!
B00N4GZ8NQ|5|Awesome Product
B007KTIO02|5|I've been using Turtle Wax ICE Detailer (and Spray Wax) exclusively for years. They are easy to apply and offer a superior shine to my (now) retired BMW 330i (Jet Black) to my current Infiniti Q50S (Hagane Blue). With a microfiber cloth the entire car (including the wheels, door jambs, engine bay) can be done in about 45 minutes. I do this, each time, immediately after a bi-weekly car wash.
B00Y1O2MIE|4|2nd set I've purchased.  They provide clean bright white light for my BMW Angel Eyes.  Great improvement over the stock yellowish ones.  My only issue is that they don't last long.  One burned out after about 18 months and we don't drive the car that much.
B0024E6V30|4|Water in the holding tanks is much more palatable.  The hose from the spigot is the biggest contributor to poor taste. If you can't put your own hose on, keep the water pressure to half; seemed to help.
B0018C85VK|5|Fit perfect!
B00LFL75GA|1|wrong bearing completely,for my application
B008G21WWO|5|Makes the car look like new again.
B00032KBFE|3|Nothing special, pretty high priced.<br />My local Ace hardware has equivalent stuff for a fraction of the price.
B001N80918|5|Bought this to fix some old tape that started leaking on a seam on the roof of my trailer.  After removing the old tape, I put this down and it worked perfectly!
B002CWYVHW|4|Fit good look good
B0041U2SUK|5|perfect fit!
B00Z7KIZPA|4|The purse pouch is a great idea, my husband ordered it to keep my purse from under his feet and off the console.  It fits my car great, but not his car so good.  The adjustable straps are not long enough for the new cars.
B00GSAUHB8|5|i bought two of them and i'm very very pleased with them. they cover the entire windshield and are easily held in place by dropping down the visors.  just fold them up and put them back in the bag..i used to hate having a huge sun protector flapping around in the back seat , this is so much easier!
B000276B2C|5|five stars thank you
B004SEXOFM|5|worked great
B0076ECIRQ|5|Took about 10 minutes to replace the bad one.  All you need is a phillips-head screwdriver.  Super easy to replace, and works perfectly.  (2001 Toyota 4Runner).
B00168EO2A|5|My razo brand mirror came in today and it's awesome! I off set it to the right a little cuz it's useless to see my forehead I can see when my kids are fighting or tearing up the car and headlights from behind aren't as blinding money well spent glad I didn't go to the casino!
B0022ZRGCQ|4|Seeings as how it's a very vague description, these include all the left side transmission seals (Quad seal, main seal, 5th gear seal, shifter seal and the primary-motor O ring seal as well and I may have forgotten one) for the twin cam. In my case, I'm using them on a 2001 Dyna Defender.  Seals are top build quality. I've got a stubborn leak on my Dyna that I think is related to a bad transmission spacer. I've actually had to replace this main seal twice and it's instantly went out twice on me so I know there is something else wrong.  Will buy these again when I change out that spacer this fall.
B003VZLJFG|5|Worked very well on 94 jeep with headlights in horrible condition
B003O0YP7M|5|Easy to install and perfect fit!
B00XAL2FTU|5|Stays in place. Does as expected
B000C11JJ8|5|Works great and good fit
B003CJ927I|5|Works great without having to hook up the tender to the battery on a c6 corvette. Perfect for winter storage.
B000BGHYE8|5|I have used this a few times to clean black water holding tank. It has worked each time with no problems. It would be nice if they would make one a few feet longer to reach all the way to discharge end of tank.
B00GI5YQ88|4|They don't completely cover the windows when they are cracked....they need to be a bit longer to be fully operational.
B003CXA138|5|Thanks, fits like a glove and so far the outside cats haven't destroyed it!
B00NT770HM|5|Works like a charm
B004BE7WN4|5|this is a direct replacement for the trailer lights hook up on my Toyota Tundra, 2008, with towing kit.  It is truly plug and play.
B00KAWRL3M|5|Good
B0002V9IFK|5|Seems to protect leather that is exposed to sunlight.  It is not greasy or oily, but leaves a nice appearance.
B005SUUQK6|4|The stand was received as described, Ktm Orange but a &#34;bit flimsy&#34; with more play than I anticipated when the bike is elevated. Other than that matches my bike and serves its purpose.
B004RPL8ZU|5|Love them
B004ME1A04|5|gift she is happy with them
B00WVZV074|5|Highly recommended especially for those who have smoked tail lights.
B005JU5TUM|5|Best in class, at least in the tropics (Dominican Republic).
B00H5F2DJY|5|Excellent!!! Looks awesome
B010VUZL0M|4|loved it
B00XRPFZB4|1|I wish I could give this less than 1 star but there is no option. Worst product, this don't even have that metal part where the battery supposed to sit. Without that it's useless. I will never recommend this to anyone.
B001HC48D0|5|great fit
B000EVYH7W|5|It was exactly what we ordered and it works like it's supposed to.
B0051GXT3S|3|Worked and fit great
B00HUB0LGU|4|Great stuff and my teenagers even like them
B0016KFW06|1|So after 2 hours trying unsuccessfully to install my Reese 44581 trailer hitch on my 2005 Subaru Outback wagon…I realized that the welder reversed the side brackets (left side on right, and vice versa) and it does not fit. There is interference with an existing bolt, as the rear part of bracket should have bolt hole adjacent to edge of bracket. The half moon cutouts were facing frontward instead of rearward, as in product photo. Amazon could not verify that an exchange would be correct. Waste of most of my Saturday.
B00E6A7E0E|4|nice and perfect on my car
B002OILR4O|5|I put these on my Charger it looks dope!!!
B00SIBI8IO|4|Wasent to sure about these at first.. Pretty nice look holding up pretty good
B00BM9LP48|5|Order arrived timely and in good condition.  They fit perfect and have saved our arms from getting pinched by the cracks in the leather. Great product! I would order again.
B00S5L6TUG|2|COST TO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU GET. IN THERE AD IT SAID ( COMES WITH BRACKETS)  THEY WERE STICK PLASTIC, ONCE THERE ON ITS PERMANENT, NOT AS HIGH AS THE STOCK ONE.
B00A66GYDA|1|Does not work, very disappointed!
B00BJ7Z8GY|5|Great and thanks - All American Pressure Cleaning is Savannah, Georgia's first choice for exterior cleaning.
B001HATY36|4|Just what I was looking for my cargo trailer I pull behind my motorcycle.
B009DJRT0I|1|Item does not match description. Was refunded
B005LVTQPS|4|It was a little smaller than what I was expecting, but very nicely made and fit my Aprilia Shiver perfectly.
B00I83H1S0|1|Does not fit the 2006-2007 cbr1000rr. The lower part of the header touches the left side fairing and makes it really hot. Useless waste of 350$ just makes me wonder how well the rest of their carbon fiber products fit...
B00GYDBPL0|5|This looks great on my black lincoln mkz. Classy and stylish. Like others had to turn the rear one upside down bow wouldn't get but it looks great that way considered turn front one upside down too.
B008GT18M6|5|Yes it was great
B001XOVIQM|5|Great to keep things on the shelves!!
B000QUXYXE|5|Better than the original factory equipment
B006QH54WU|5|Received batteries in less than 24 hrs manufacturer date was previous month and saved 235.00 nice
B005GYDBNS|5|great item.
B0083H5JAS|5|It was easy to install. Already a week and it is holding fine so far.
B006XCJKJG|5|Works wonderful
B006R0DPVI|5|Great
B0009V8DXG|5|great fit great price would highly recommend
B00ANJA77O|5|A must do mod for any 94-96 Impala SS or 9C1 with disc brakes.  If your car is from the rust belt like mine, plan on replacing the rear brake lines though as the change in pressure can cause them to give out like mine did.  Not a fault of the product though.
B00LHUI4XM|5|Great quality and quick delivery
B009NL093U|4|The item was bigger than expected (tho that was my fault for not reading through the specifications). The rings were not closed completely. Other than that works as intended.
B0054YCW62|3|Not as strong as it should be.
B009F7QB3O|5|great peice
B0038BBHNM|5|Brighter and cleaned than the factory lights ever were! Fit was perfect. Fantastic upgrade in lighting and appearance.
B003D3PP6K|5|Very practical and just the rigt size
B005SEJTUA|5|love the 5 gallon container
B005N53AM2|5|Had to heat soak it on the dashboard for a couple of hours, but did get it installed and glad to have it.
B000C59WQ6|5|High quality better than OEM
B00X7H3RRQ|5|great jdm billet screws.
B009DIX6Y2|4|Fits better than other aftermarket air filters,  looks great and the quality appears to be great as well.  For the price it's worth it over other aftermarket paper type filters available at quick lube and auto store locations. Quality appears similar to K&N and at $20 or so,  you can decide to simply replace it,  or buy the cleaning kit for under $15 and reuse it!  Just be sure to use the appropriate cleaner and to dry and reoil it before reusing it.
B009PJJDX2|5|good for keep in garage,thanks.
B009FFXAFI|5|Good quality!!
B00Y5FR130|1|It doesn't fit on mazda rx8 and it's saying for mazda rx8. I'm returning it
B000C1OX00|5|The last pad change I did used autozone gold (or whatever they're called). I had noticeable rotor wear and noise problems. These pads were silent from the start. They also have a great brake pedal feel. Very linear response. Also my new rotors are glass smooth (8000 miles currently). I haven't checked the wear but.I'm very pleased so far.
B00JAN4P3Q|5|Great Product fast shipping
B00B5ZYY38|2|I don't like these. They fit okay for the top holes but not the bottom. The bottom holes on my Florida tag is embossed and the writing sticks up. Since the writing is raised the black snap caps won't snap on. Need to have a better way for states with plates like this.
B007TG7IJY|5|Perfect in every way
B003L2XPBK|5|installed on my 91 jeep cherokee, fit perfect
B000C7TST0|4|This is a nice unit that installs easily once you get to the 30 odd screws that hold down the fiberglass panel and screens that need to be removed to gain heater core access in my 1981 Caprice. (If things don't loosen easily you've likely overlooked a screw or two). I found that the top of this unit is a bit different from the factory original, so you'll have to improvise to get the hold down bracket at the top of the unit (with ground strap) to work. I used a plastic zip tie to snug things up which appears to work fine. Otherwise 5 stars. Overall, a nice unit at a fair price. Ready for cold weather.
B0075VGTUW|5|Great product for the price!
B006921KXY|5|Well pleased with this product
B00JID6RXY|5|Excellent quality! Only 4 stars because I would have really loved to have it in a 2&#34;x4&#34; or bumper sticker size though.
B00X52CAUS|5|Part worked. Enough said.
B0012NGE1I|5|If you need to make loops in wire, these are what you need!
B001O0TO5C|5|Helpful Hints:<br /><br />To take the plastic caps off off the rack, I use the screwdriver in the wide slot on the inside of the cap near the BACK of the cap, popped it up a little, held the cap up, and then popped around it like opening a can off paint.  Very easy.<br /><br />If you do not have someone to help you slide the crossbar on:  I put it on, stood on the back bumper and wiggled it forward as far as I could.  I then opened up the sunroof, stood on the storage area between the two front seats, and wiggled it towards me.  Easy...<br /><br />Good Luck All !
B0081S95FE|5|This starter met all of my expectations
B005VOLKEA|5|Assembled with bulbs and perfect fit right out the box. Took me longer to get it unpacked and take outside to the van, than it took me to install it. Packaging was also excellent.
B008G2306U|5|I can see again. great product at a great price.
B00VYX2I7A|4|Ships from China, so don't expect it overnight... takes about 2 weeks to arrive - which is fine - I wasn't misled, or disappointed - just be aware that it'll take a while. The &#34;mesh&#34; is not &#34;mesh&#34; at all... it's an all-in-one molded piece that doesn't look like most of the images used to advertise this grill. Back up and it's not too noticeable. Get right up close and it's kind of disappointing. Wish I would have read the reviews more carefully, as I would have picked another one w/out the &#34;mesh&#34; and left it at that, or put in my own actual real mesh in. Thought about cutting this plastic &#34;mesh&#34; out but it'd likely ruin the grill too - so just living with it until it needs to be replaced, as I am not holding my breath that'll it last longer than a few years out in the elements - but we'll see.
B000GTV7JI|5|Worked great on my 2014 Street Glide on a 10 day trip to Sturgis. Covers the fairing, electronics, seat, and tour pack and folds up into a very small pouch. Everything was dry after a big thunderstorm.
B0024E71BQ|4|Great price and works well.
B007QI8JCU|5|This is a very nice sticker
B003LTEC0G|5|Didn't get a chance to install it but hey, I'll give it 5 stars :)
B00873J0YY|4|Met expectations and arrived on time as promised.
B007Y86XQQ|5|2000 montero sport. Works great. Is new not refurbished! The paper that came with said was tested an puts out 117 amps!
B002P8CMCY|5|Product was a perfect fit
B011A758NU|5|Work as stated. The blue is awesome and a great accent. Fast shipping and got 2 pairs. Will order from them again.<br />Go blue.
B00G620ZVU|5|Mounted them on the front of my F-350 and love them!
B00C33NWIO|5|Excellent quality! Looks great on my FJ!
B00GWFKUE8|5|The Husky liners fit very well.
B000E28C7M|5|They fit and they are easy to install.
B00LFL8OPG|5|Worked great
B003YJLAIK|2|Works for awhile then gauge stop registering.  I've had the same thing happen to 2 different gauges.  I set the pressure at between 50 & 55 psi and they work great for about 6 months then the gauge fails.  Now I have no idea what the pressure is.  Changing the setting does nothing.
B00E1JONJK|5|worked perfect bypass the old power window switch . make sure to google how to wire it thoug for power window worked great thogh
B00W0H2FL8|1|No fit with honda crv 2012 , dont buy that product
B00B8ADHS8|4|solid. but no instructions :[
B008L15WJ4|5|My husband likes it! Great hat!
B009WQ3JFQ|5|These fit perfectly! I chose these mats because they don't have a hole where the floor retainer connects.<br />The only derogatory thing I could say is that they're a bit slippery under my boots but that's something that should diminish over time.<br />I'll be buying a set for the wife's vehicle before snow winter.
B0118V28MM|5|Super fast delivery,  great helmets for my students. ...thank you.
B000C9C2AK|1|A waste of time and money. Could not get a refund because it lasted a little over a month and a half.
B00J0UZWYU|1|as stated plug didn't fit perfectly, but filing down fixed that problem.  Jeep was starting hard so tried to replace this.  With new part, Jeep would not start at all.  Put old plug in and it started up again.
B00BEIMTEM|3|Works but will bend studs almost every time
B008KQ51DW|3|Update 4/18/16= went to OPT-7 Aura Led RGB Interior Kit($44.95)this year and removed these because they only lasted 4 months after i bought them....just hooked them up again to test them and they still work (50-50 if they will still work for another 3 months) Will install and use them for inside my trunk...  (Original Review) Bright and fun to use...BUT USE THEM ONLY WHEN YOUR PARKED NOT WHILE DRIVING
B00OH13Y9M|1|S*** product. Began to flicker within two weeks.
B00132CG4M|5|Great product.  Everything was delivered on time and no problem with the install.  The lift is really a \\"gorilla\\" lift.  I believe it will lift the heaviest of trailer tail gates.  I have a modest weight gate and only needed one spring otherwise I couldn't keep the gate in a down position. Would purchase again, wish I had done so earlier.  $200 is about 2 minutes in an ER for treating a back injury, cheap insurance.
B00XZ9OMAC|5|I took it into the dealership and they were able to quickly connect it to the car!
B007UMCHXE|4|Goes great with my gear and bike
B00G620ZVU|3|Pretty good lights, like the design and they seem to be made pretty strong...but not super bright. But for the price I'd say they're worth it.
B003110NWK|5|Love the fact this is ready to use right out of the pack and even has gloves. Depending on conditions we change filters quite a bit and this cuts down things to take to the track. Push I hate oiling a filter by hand.
B006ZS28X8|4|I've tried almost everything out there, even similar name brand products, but I keep coming back to &#34;Jet Black Tire Shine Aerosol Can&#34; basically because it goes on exactly as the boxed illustration pictures it ... Please factor in proper application, and air quality for better results.<br />What a &#34;SUPER WET HIGH DEFINITION&#34; high gloss shine that lasts for several weeks with periodic care.  I use very little for my between touch ups if any curbing occurs ect. The one thing that I like about this product is that it doesn't sling all over my car's quarter panel like those slick gel silicones while I'm driving. It doesn't drip nor run. Dust and grass clippings repell easily and won't become embedded like some of those other tacky products which a lot of them do. Does not rub off and stain clothing. Other products do really shine but lack that long lasting protection and durability. Jet Black holds up to normal weather and will still continues to shine. Goes on wet and dries quickly. Usually within 30 minutes after applying each coat, but I recommend using a garage or area that is traffic free, wind free, dust free. Doing this will assist you much further in not having your aerosol spray to being blown onto the exterior of your vehicle moldings, glass, and paint surface.<br />Prior to dressing your tires remove &#34;ALL&#34; contaminates/silicones from tires (Try using Goo Gone Automotive hand sprayer bottle) or use your favorite tire cleaner. I then applied a  *VERY*VERY*LIGHT*  first coat of Jet Black going around all 4 tires, I then  immediately repeated a second coat to bring it to a superior shine. I used a spare tire rim and traced it out on a piece of cardboard and cut it out to a exact fit to protect my chrome rims from any over spray. I then use the cardboard as a template over a  piece of plywood and placed a  handle on it. Works great.<br />I'm a detailed automobile enthusiast and I can tell when a product is appreciated.  &#34;WHEN YOU SEE  PEOPLE'S HEADS TURN&#34;...<br />Yep just follow the instructions partner and maintenance periodically!<br />*NOTE* This product may not be for  everyone since we all have different likes and flavors.<br />THIS is not a &#34;PERFECT DRESSING&#34; but for my needs it will require a little labor on my end which I DON'T mind doing and enjoy. Therefore I fine it 4star acceptable...<br />If buildup occurs from layering  over time  spray Goo Gone liberally with a good stiff tire brush or use a mild paint remover.<br />If you fine another Tire Shine better, please Buy It .. but leave a FYI about any new unfamiliar product as the tire industries's are constantly changing daily.

B00L2P4GBQ|5|Exact fit for my 2014 KIA. OEM If you have a 2014 Kia soul this is it. My Dealership wanted $75 to change this. It took less than 5 minutes. No screws to remove. Just open glove box, pull down on handle that's at the top of glove box. Open cabin air filter compartment by squeezing the two clips and pull off door. Pull out old filter and replace with new. Put back on door to cabin air filter by lining up the two notches on the top and push closed. Replace panel and close the glove box abs your done.
B00CPN0BB8|5|Love it highly recommend!
B00JGJGLL8|5|As advertised
B003YVWVO0|5|Happy with these seat covers easy to install. Good quality. Reasonable price
B000CMIG3E|5|would have worked great if it fit... no problem though because it was returned without any issue.. Thank you Amazon... I like your style!!!
B00OOJFWU6|5|they look great on my car
B002L9NZUU|5|It is for one piece. I thought it was two for the price. Returned
B007TY7XJ6|5|Fast delivery.  All as expected.
B00511T45K|5|Perfect.
B00YE86BV6|5|I have used this 4 wheeling in Colorado and paired it with a different brand headset.  It work very well.  Also have paired it with my phone for music and has work well.  Worth the money.
B0124DKVXG|1|They are stickers and not magnets... I was SO disappointed. ...
B00FRHOMNM|2|It does not fit the Honda CRV as advertised.  I had to forcefully bend it, and it still does not fit to the windshield properly.
B004SF3PX2|5|worked great
B00W4XDXTQ|5|Very proud to display it.
B00GB8614E|5|This light is great on a boat. Really lights up the night.
B002P3LLR6|5|My husband uses them under his mask for senior softball.  Works well.
B000TYE16G|5|What a life saver. I'm from the old school where we would have someone sit in the car and pump/hold the brakes when doing a bleed. I bought this adapter to use my Motive bleeder on my '00 Chevy Silverado and it works brilliantly. Not only does it make this a one man job, but it really speeds it up.
B001Y8L8D0|5|This patio mat is great.  It is easy to clean and also it folds up nice so it doesn't take up a lot of room  in our camper.
B000VKOD9S|5|Does the job and priced right. Works great in my 2009 Honda Pilot.
B007P74C0K|1|Would give it a negative star if I could. I just needed a quick fix to get me across the state to home. I would normally go Felpro but just needed a bandaid to limp home. I even used a little copper spray to help and with in 3hrs of driving the HG gave out. Needles to say finally got home....Tore the head off again and checked to make sure I didn't warp the deck or head was all within limits. Installed a Felpro gasket and its been more than a year and still running good. I guess my grandfather's advice holds true &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; lol
B00IO0QHM8|2|I used these as replacement bulbs for a third brake light/truck bed light (substitute for a 912 bulb) on a Ford F150. Disgusting blue-white color that doesn't provide better light output and one of them burned out in about 8 months.<br />Not recommended. I went back to tungsten bulbs.
B001FAK4B4|5|Sturdy handles, look great especially with my black and red GraBars installed in the front. The description says these are for the 4-door Unlimited  models of Wranglers only but I bought this for my 2-door and it installed fine at the rear roll bar for passenger use. Extremely easy install, didn't even need the included washers for the location I installed these.
B00ANZHG7C|5|awesome
B007TYQ56S|5|Worked great.
B00G620ZVU|4|Only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is I've only had them a couple months but so far they are fantastic. Very bright & I love the price.
B000CSPD0M|5|Worked fine
B00167TYHQ|5|great addition for anyone who is a ATV enthusiast. Been a life saver! Great for the price!!
B00HZSNV4C|5|worked as promised, good product, very happy with it
B009F5DFM6|4|Easy install not hard at all but you do need some help worked out great
B000BUQOCC|5|Very good product, highly recommended if you plan on using your black tank.<br />It gets rid of all the debris that collects on the sensor that tells you if your tank is full or not.
B005MZV1NI|5|Have this one at work i work at a vet school and everyone complments me on it
B00AUFOC36|5|Very easy to install, great product.
B009Q76TVW|5|quick and priced right
B001KQD7TY|5|Easy replacement, works as good as the orginal equipment.
B00X0KIH84|4|Very well made, heavy construction, I would recommend to resurface them with paint or bed liner. They start to rust in the corners. The packaging was not the best and they have no instructions. Easy to install with mechanical skills.
B00SCXCQV8|5|Perfect
B0049ELS54|5|Perfect replacement!
B007ZDIJFS|5|Very Pleased with these brakes. Major upgrade from OEM pads.Noticeable braking difference.<br /><br />Great value.
B00823FSRC|5|nothing fancy....but worksgood on hard surface and semi-soft sand...priced right and free shipping...good as it gets
B00NAQUJ34|5|great product fast shipping
B00KLKC20K|5|Worked great!
B00VOC66AG|5|Just what I need.
B00029X0XS|5|As advertised. Perfect protection for my truck rear bumper.
B00NJRGD70|4|I like my new sunshade the only thing is that its hard to fold back into the pouch
B00651CLCS|5|Easy install. Good look, easier ti clean windshield with out getting tangled in the factory antenna.
B00VPHZ2U0|5|Easy to install and of a reasonable quality I can consider myself satisfied for the amount of money I paid
B0068FXEC2|3|you will need a longer bolt in order to install the bracket. I ended up removing the thread on my frame by trying to install the shorter bolt. on the other hand the bracket looks good, and strong.<br />I would buy this product again, maybe from another seller only.<br />I know this is a product not a seller review but the item was opened as I received it.
B001JT1IPM|5|I needed a larger shaving kit for traveling. I bought this and its a good buy. Plenty of room for everything I need when traveling. The 4 extra<br />pockets keep additional items separated. Easy to carry, and easy to strap down on top of a suitcase.
B0046YMYCS|5|This light is fantastic.  If I ever get another bike the first thing  I'll get is one of these lights.  I feel so much safer knowing that drivers can see me better now.  This light is super bright.
B00MY6IP2I|5|Great product, have loved Calvin and Hobbes since the first cartoon.  Thank you!
B0052YDXRQ|4|Nice product. Easy to install!!!
B002E58100|5|So far no problems. Fit like factory radiator. Keeps engine cool. Well worth the money.
B00KIV6NR0|5|Check engine light finally came off after changing this piece, took the mechanics only 30 minutes
B00EP3PX6O|5|Excellent product, good delivery time and good packaging. Well satisfied.
B00IW33T5A|5|Good
B00KWMI5KS|5|Just what I needed!!
B004K25IC4|1|The product was awful! It's not derable and the straps absolutely suck! They did not last one day! I am disappointed with this product and recommend that you do not but this top.
B0009NWQWI|5|Worked great for the trip, exactly as described. I didn't have any issues.
B00BZVYM98|5|This works great. Took me 60 seconds to program both of them for a 2010 Yukon. Would highly recommend.
B004RNR9QY|4|Nice nose, but the end &#34;grips&#34; are loose right from the fit go...
B00N08WC6Y|4|Pretty nice for the price.<br />Mine arrived in good shape with finish still in good shape.<br />Useable mirror size would be nice if it was larger, but decent size being it's a specialty mirror.
B00AQSPG1Y|2|Not impressed rubber started peeling from sticker on second day giving two stars because got full refund right away. Kind of hit and miss a friend has the same one and has had it for a long time with no problems
B00RM327NG|5|Works fine!
B00BVL80LI|5|I received what I expected in a timely manner
B00LGKN5AA|2|The only place that does not get sprayed is the windshield
B00S4HHVLW|4|This works very well on my  boat trailer.  I have very little clearance between the trailer and the boat, but the curved neck gives me enough clearance.  I wish it had &#34;lug bolt&#34; bolts so I didn't have to carry another wrench to take the tire off of the bracket.  Also, the little press on washer was miserable to try and deal with.  I think I would just forget it except it did help hold the bracket in place while I mounted the spare tire.
B003NI1H6W|5|Excellent, took about 15 minutes to install, work better than the originals
B00C48TJ58|5|Great camera very easy to install takes awesome video
B00S50LPJW|4|Very good lights.
B000BQO22U|3|Okay, but not great. One already fell off somewhere between Ohio and New York. Oh well.....
B00W2XFY0Y|5|well pleased with order.
B009GIUB2Y|5|awesome
B000KKHOGS|5|Fit great and looks good.  Welds seem nicely done.  Two thumbs up.
B00C9GA742|5|This tool worked perfectly for my 06 wax wagon. It was difficult to get in the top line due to the bracket that it is attached to but the tool had enough flexibility to get the job done.
B00BTKWQ3O|4|Had one that was defective (flickers), the other 23 functioning properly.
B001ABOSWO|5|This is my second AFE product to purchase. I have a cold air box dry filter for my 2011 Tundra. I have had it for 3 years. The high quality and function is what lead me to buy this dry replacement filter for my 2005 Taco. Good stuff you will not be dissipointed.
B0042XI3D2|3|Used one and it snapped in 2...used this on a addon circut so i didn't need to get the car to the dealer to remove it...i have the remaining fuses in the box for spares (probably not)
B00HVEFCLK|5|Excellent!
B000OAG2DK|5|We replaced the one in our RV.This one works GREAT
B005E1L04U|4|The edges could have been more refined, pretty rough.  The letters catch cloth when I dry her.
B00NTW53EY|5|Great prices for quality spark plugs.<br />Very fast shipping.
B000JFJLP6|5|My truck would not start recently about 6 weeks ago so I had to have it towed from my garage to the repair shop.  Turn out it was a 2 year old batters that when I bought a guaranteed 84 month battery that went bad after only 24 months.  Being 71 years old I can't physically handle vehicle problems such as bad battery so i bought this.  While reading the instructions I find that in addition to jumping starting a vehicle this can be used to recharge cellular phone, play a 12VDC radio in the case of an city, county, state, or national emergency, and is easy to use to jump start a vehicle.  Completely satisfied with this product.
B00JTACH4Y|5|Great clean look and awesome white light.
B0036E9VB6|1|Used once and never worked again.
B00WX5LIU6|3|Arrived quickly. Is narrower than I had hoped. It smelled funny for the first few days.  That being said, it functions well and is a great value for the price.
B004A67S64|5|They have been on car about a month now and seem to be doing great even though Wagner made them in China. Except for where they are made at I have no complaints, they seem to be doing honestly better than the OE shoes, also at 1/2 the cost through Amazon compared to Auto Zone, Advance Auto Parts, and O'Reilly which priced them at around $44.
B004IJBV20|5|No issues with the product.  Fit as expected.
B00W4GTIWE|3|I bought this for my fiancé. He has a 2008 Honda Civic 2 door. It came much faster then anticipated, since it was coming from overseas. So that was a plus. We did instal it ourselves only to end up spending a whole day trying to get it on properly. After finally getting it finished up only 3 days latter it was worn down. We live were it is very hot down in the south. So the black backing shrunk up in one corner and the silver piece is losing its paint in places. For the money it's a great product but do not expect it to last to long. - Kate Snow
B00CPJB00I|3|I got a pair of these to go with my Roland Sands Ronin jacket in tobacco.  First impressions were that they were pretty flimsy.  The manufacturing was spotty at best with discoloration in the leather and one index finger being too long.<br /><br />After a month, the red lining tore at the seam on one glove.  After a year, the pleather/vinyl is peeling off the piping on one of the wrist straps.<br /><br />Roland Sands has had hit or miss problems with manufacturing over the past few years, so your results may vary.  But, while the style is great, you could get a pair of better gloves for less.  You're definitely paying for the name with these, which is a shame because I love my Ronin jacket.
B00D6RR2OQ|5|These make my life so easy. No more tying and untying knots when I vend at outdoor markets and festivals. I use two sets of these in conjunction with four spring clamp tie-downs with s-hooks to anchor cinderblocks to the tent legs. It takes 30-45 seconds to setup and take down each leg, which saves me so much time and hassle at ever show. Because they're nylon, they don't scratch the tent legs or damage the canopy and curtains. In general, these are very convenient and I find myself using them every time I need to make a loop. So much easier than messing around with knots and ropes.
B004LF77VU|5|Great product. very well built with multiple options for installation. I would recommend this to anyone looking to disconnect your RV or boat battery to prevent parasitic draw resulting in a dead battery.
B00BITKRDM|5|Product is perfect fit; very simple installation.  Looks just like factory unit. Best part, it was delivered exactly as advertised. .. hard to believe!!
B008V4624A|5|It works and good quality
B000X221VQ|5|Quality product that lives up to it's advertisement!
B004ZTA6AG|5|Great replacement hood emblem
B00AQZB0V2|5|Was a great fix :)
B00KTLRNF0|5|Nice quality. Would recommend.
B000GU5IH4|4|I've had this product for less than 2 months and fading has occurred. No signs of product prematurely deteriorating. Still repels water and dirt from bike, so I cant complain.
B00H3LMDO0|3|What can I say? They are heavy duty mud flaps, and definitely look it. Not the best fit, but you really can't expect for what amounts to nothing  more than a thick piece of rubber belting to be a perfect fit. Were they hard to put on? Nope. Will they do the job intended? No doubt, but don't look too close if you want &#34;Purty&#34;. They're mud flaps, but they do have that really super cool, absolutely major awesome looking Ram's Head, with RAM, spelled out underneath it for those who can read, that lets everyone who can't see that huge Ram's head emblem on your tailgate, know,  that that's what &#34;Yur&#34; driving..
B00Y7CDF8Q|5|Great product. Got what I paid for
B009X8ID7M|5|Works great.
B00IOBSXQ0|5|I bought this wax for my wife's car and it was outstanding. It filled in all of the scratches  around the locks on the doors.
B0031R61DO|4|Not JDM yellow, bit It's  a nice yellow color that offsets xenon and white led drls. I can't comment on longevity yet.
B00CF5Q2HI|5|Loved them. Bought some for Xmas for other elders who loose their keys, ID wallet., etc.
B00WXTO15G|4|Good.
B00I9JC2FK|5|GOOD QUAILTY ! BUT HAD TO SEND IT BACK . DID NOT FIT MY 99 HD SPORTSTER . MY FALT ORDERD IT WRONG ! BUT I LIKED IT ??
B007N9K7YA|5|Arrived on time and was easy to install to replace the existing handle.  Things wear out so quickly in AZ because of the heat.  This replacement went on quickly and easily.
B004LEJ606|5|Great
B0053GU2IG|5|Works like the original part and easy to install--saved over $400.
B00BCIHV88|5|These goggles are stylish and comfortable.  I wear corrective spectacles and as a result I don't wear these very often. (but that isn't a flaw in the product nor is it a negative.  Just a statement of fact).  If you wear glasses, these goggles probably aren't going to do the trick for you.  Get a pair of contact lenses and you'll be golden and I believe, love these.
B000CMFSXU|4|THEY FIT MY RAV 4 PRETTY WELL LENGTH WISE.  I WOULD PREFER MORE ON THE SIDES, THOUGH.  THEY'RE HEAVY AND WELL RIDGED FOR WET, DIRTY TRAFFIC.
B005KLBVZW|5|It has a great feel but i haven't tested it at higher temps yet
B005LDBU0U|5|My husband purchased the Airhawk seat pad for the ride to the Sturgis Rally in South Dakota. This was the best purchase he made for the entire trip. No discomfort after hours and hours of riding. He left his seat unattached so it could put it away easily when we were off the bike. He highly recommends this seat pad.
B003OK40W2|5|I don't use this dye for leather but instead for restoring/refurbishing briar tobacco pipes.  It can be diluted with alcohol and it goes on fast and evenly, giving good coverage.  Little or no odor, but use in a well ventilated area.  Dries fast.  I usually buff the pipe's surface with 0000 steel wool between coats to help bring out the grain of the briar.
B00OQTF3UI|5|Awesome product !! Great quality
B00FXIHPNE|5|Nice license plate.
B000EQ80NE|5|good ride
B00R8O5DEO|4|This side worked well...so far.
B000VF7PNY|5|wonderfull
B000C9GZUS|5|Very nice quiet unit that installs easily and fits snugly. Old unit was tired. Big upgrade with a fresh fan. Note that you'll need the ground connection for the second wire that is bolted to the top of the unit - salvaged from my old fan motor. Overall a nice item.
B00030CUI2|5|can't find this in any store, good buy
B00JBPT2VI|5|I'm trying to get rid of all the amber lights and reflectors on my 325ci 2001. Going with a stealth black look I purchased these. Nothing but what I hoped for! Fit perfectly into the slot and looks great with the look what I was going for!
B00EF3P63O|5|Got this to hold a soft bag I had gotten last year, and it was well worth it. It fit on our '14 Outback perfectly, and stayed secure throughout the entire trip and have us plenty of secure mounting points for the bag.
B002927LZY|5|Excellent product and a perfect fit. Shipped on time and received before expected.
B0073ME8YC|1|bought this because i thought i finally found a radiator that fits my truck, i needed a 34 inch, the details are very vague, it says 43 inch product dimensions, which i knew i was taking a risk, but the other detail said 34 inch, so hopefully it still fits, otherwise i will try to send it back and hope to get my money back
B00T0TYXGY|3|Great sticker, just a lot smaller than I thought. I put it on my back window. So far, lots of compliments.
B00HQZNOQO|5|Fit perfect on my 05 VW Jetta
B000C913KA|1|Actually my bad, I ordered for the wrong size brake drum.  Had to return.  The quality seemed o.k., not great but descent.
B00I0SH9CG|4|Not a bad kit for the price.<br />Abit worried aboutnthe filter being so low<br />We will see how it holds up<br />I would suggest getting a aem or other brand dry filter amd a bypass just in case<br />So u dont suck up water
B0060A7JTY|5|I broke my mirror and instead of paying an exorbitant amount at the dealership I bought this one and replaced it myself.  Problem solved for a fraction of the amount.  Make sure you clean off any left over adhesive from the previous mirror so this one can stick well.  It comes with 6 double sided adhesive circles and I only needed 4 to fit in my mirror casing.  You can't tell the difference between this mirror and the factory installed one!
B00TK23MZY|5|Amazing
B00KTHT4ZQ|5|Worked well, easy to program and much less expensive than the $300 my Infiniti dealer was charging!
B005NJ2SHG|5|nice hanky for the price. always good to have a cloth tissue or a tourniquet (in an emergency) in ur back pocket. Only matches with certain outfits due to its unique color and pattern
B003YJNXJE|4|This is a replacement for the same model. The sides are extremely thin and light weight. It will only last two years maximum. It has three straps that go underneath the trailer to hold it securely in place during heavy winds. Very nice for the money
B000JFN9WW|5|I bought this in February 2012 from Amazon. Used it now for over 3 years. Changed the oil and fluids in my Mercedes Benz S600, Nissan Altima, Honda Accord and Civic, Generator, Lawn Mower and Snow Blower. I have saved a lot of money by doing the work myself and keeping all the equipment in top running order.<br />Mercedes oil changes can get very expensive. After all the extra stuff I used to spend between $800 to $1000. I have not been to the dealer or indy shop in over 3 years. Guy called me thinking I sold the car. They were not too happy to hear that I do the work myself with this Mityvac. Now I also do all the other work myself including brakes, AC and the little stuff.<br />Note that this has to be hooked to a compressor. Should have bought this years ago.
B00AERMVYC|5|works great
B001T99XCC|5|perfect
B00P3IATAA|5|does what i needed and its very stretchy
B00XWCSHE4|5|great
B000KPSA0W|5|It works every time.
B006H34AE6|5|Really handy dandy.
B00O7TXHBO|5|Bought these for my 2015 Jeep Wrangler as the new wheels/tires I bought didn't include the TPMS sensors. Had them installed by a local tire shop and have worked perfectly ever since. If you need TPMS sensors for stock-sized tires (32&#34; in my case), these are a great price and do the job. However, if your tires are larger (34&#34;-35&#34; or larger) I would consider buying a ProCal module to adjust for the speedometer differences.
B00TKO0J6C|3|Light output is whiter but not brighter than the fixture with incandescent light bulbs they replace. and the cost was about the same if I had purchased two LED bulb for the old fixture.
B00BQVF8J0|5|WORK GREAT
B00QRHDIPY|1|Does not work at all.
B00S2YWWT8|5|This also fits the 04 TC
B004K9COP6|5|Dang, this is a sweet accessory. Fits nicely and looks just like the bike in the movie &#34;Easy Rider&#34;. Well almost, maybe!  ...I did have the same problem with the short bolt which was mentioned in other reviews, but a trip to the hardware store took care of that. Biggest bummer was I couldn't ride my bike to the store cause at that point it was kinda torn apart.<br />  This sissy bar and rack are really well made, strong and fit my 2009 v star 250 like a glove.  Forget that my wife likes having a backrest or that I now get to shop for a sissy bar bag. It just looks great!
B0002MAB82|5|99 Chevy 3500 7.4. Can't get no better for the price. I put 4 on and they looked so good,<br />I just ordered another set for the other two holes.
B00I59XBEK|1|Not at all how it is pictures. Really disappointed. No contact from seller.
B006B2XI96|5|Perfect fit on my 2014 Citadel. Great quality and i Love it!
B004GZ6SOW|5|thanks
B00AFBXQNC|5|Great item car looks good  produces great foam when useing power washer.
B000TDT8KG|1|My package arrived and I went to install my rear view mirror, and the glue in this package was dried up and unusable. I would not recommend this product.
B00T7IVLGS|4|Great addition to work truck.
B000C5I2YO|5|This pedal cover fit my 2000 F150 brake pedal perfectly and looks identical to the original.
B000CC9CRS|5|Good looking product
B000CF1XO0|5|These are the same as OEM and work great on my VW Touareg
B009WYJ90C|5|It is what I was looking for.  I bought an ipod touch 6th generation, in pink.  I wanted a cover light enough but that provided protection from scratches.  This one is design for 5th generation, but it fits mine fine.  The cover is transparent, little bit &#34;frosted&#34; and the border is pink.  The back is hard, the border is softer and a little bit raise.  The photo shows a cord, mine came without a cord.  The only thing, I have a screen protector on it and had to press it on a corner so it would not come off.
B0073G2N40|5|This is my second set that I got from Kensun, both installed easily and performed as expected, my high beam looks like a candle compared with the lows now. Very pleased, will recommend to anyone. Will buy for my other vehicles.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|This product worked better than I could have possibly imagined. I should have taken before and after pictures. I used it on a leather jacket from the 80's that I thought was beyond rescuing. The jacket looks better than it did originally. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to restore any leather products.
B000CF6I40|2|both front shades feel down in heat
B000C9LARQ|5|Works great. Good buy.
B003U8ZZKY|5|Exact replacement. Fairly easy to install (you have to remove the entire inside door panel).
B001HJR9XE|5|Is good little button and wire is long enough to make most runs.
B000SOIRCG|4|will work well
B00832OKF8|4|Not exactly the &#34;same&#34; as OEM, as the markings differed a bit, but build quality seemed to be exactly as OEM.
B00L9A38GS|5|Perfect
B0019HWTMA|5|as expected
B00KXO80PK|5|Did what I needed
B00KPX49O0|5|Good
B00BG3GFEU|5|Just what I needed and the piece was delivered faster than expected.
B00VGOKA54|5|Love them!!! Goes with my car decor. They are carpet not vinyl. I prefer them that way. Make my 4 yr old happy as well me.
B00MMXHUAG|3|It is very well made and easy to install but needs to be a bit longer. Too much of the bumper is uncovered.
B00Y17SU6O|4|Well built besides o-ring that was cut. Make sure you put plastic end cap on wire BEFORE you crimp ring terminals to wires
B00028FB6S|1|It is a cheap tool that is made in China. Did not work! Piece of junk.<br />AMAZON- BUY AMERICAN
B000CMIYE0|4|So, I read the reviews and since I was too lazy to do the add-on thing for plastic caps, I got these (am I the only one who can't figure out how to &#34;add-on&#34;?)<br /><br />High quality little fellows, you can tell right off the bat.  Peeking down the barrel, there's a small red gasket at the top which says &#34;good buy, my friend, good buy&#34;.<br /><br />BUT - and this is kind of serious ... I put these guys on all four tires of my 2013 Tundra - hand-tightening, mind you.  I heard a &#34;hiss&#34; from one of the front tires.  Now: I allow this might be some kind of problem with my valve stem - but this thing was letting the AIR OUT OF MY TIRE.  Easy fix, I suppose, when you back it off a turn, but not awesome.  May need a design tweak.  I'll report later whether my other tires go flat.  All that said, four stars assuming this is an oddball one-off.  The caps are also quite cool looking, to the extent anyone's looking.
B00LVHU0KG|5|perfect fit looks good would buy from again
B00SIQE6TY|4|Strong light. Did not need the wiring harness. Needed instructions for the wiring harness if you use it.
B00GLLW3AM|4|Housing is well made and sturdy.  Lights are crazy bright.  Enclosed hardware is of good Stainless Steel metallurgy.  Only one small issue encountered: When attaching the light housing to the mounting bracket, the nuts drop into a small chamber that is slim enough to capture the nut so it does not spin when inserting the small machine screw.  However on one side of one of my lights, this small chamber did not keep the nut from spinning, but wedging a small flat blade screwdriver along side the nut solved that quickly.  Other than this one small issue, I would have given a 5 start rating.
B006IIO4ZA|5|Awesome Product, works as per description.
B00W41E54U|5|Is great on the leather, can.t go wrong with this product, for protection.
B006FZRDE0|2|Gap after install that needed to be caulked with silicone due to high wind noise.  Recommend you check out something else, although price was right.
B00Q1F7OGQ|4|Awesome and it arrived on a sunday
B00473V668|5|Works as expected
B000K00DSO|5|Fits and was a GM product.  Very happy.
B000O3U2UQ|4|I've used it a couple times to check a few batteries in the garage and in our cars and it seems to work well.  I really like OTC tools and this being my first battery tester, I think this is a good tool to have.
B001KS7G7Q|5|worked great, super fast to start.
B001EOV46K|5|Fit as expected another quality product by Curt.
B00KUBKUQ8|5|I used this under the hood of my 2001 Subaru. Cold air intake, all the fluid caps, battery hold down. Went on smooth, looks great. Vibrant blue color that matches my spark plug wires. I love it.
B00GSAUHB8|5|This is the best.  I had covered the windshield after I went back to the car the front seats,wow, it's perfectly cool, feel so good.
B00JXNK1Z4|1|To small
B011SPQ5WW|5|I bought this for my mini van and my kids. Before i bought this cutty,  i looked air freshener everywhere research online, there is lots of bad chemical air freshener. But<br />since i ve got this polafamily,Omg !!sooooo cute!!!!very love it and great smell too. Last 90days long!! essential oil. safe, natural, healthy air freshener.<br />My kids are love it too, so i will buy another one soon for my collection.<br />Highly recommend~~
B000EEU0IO|5|Io purchased it for my husband. He loves it
B000XBBISO|4|works as it should. only draw back is it is just a little thinner then the old one so the screws that came with it were to long, so I just reused the old ones. was very happy to find this valve for my 35 year old trailer
B00GJVIKYW|2|Not impressed, really.  Good quality vinyl I suppose, but it looks distorted/not proportional or something.  Just doesn't work for me, but thanks.
B00NPKEOZY|4|Fits fine.Used them a lot.
B00RPVKCZA|5|Does exactly what it's supposed to for a really cheap price! Literally the fastest I have ever gotten any Amazon package ever!
B003FBV8ZW|3|Five star price with 2/3 star quality
B0046KNO26|3|Quick delivery. Easy to install (after you realize that the locks also tighten and loosen the grips when you turn them). They sagged under the weight of 3 surfboards so I question their strength over time, but they worked.
B000CGV7UE|5|did not install yet, looks high quality and fast shipping.<br /><br />Update: installed, works great!
B00HTQNU6Y|5|Very nice, worked perfect on a TDI fuel filter for WMO.
B0037N33SS|2|The plastic is a bit thin.
B00MAG6RMM|5|Bought these to replace the interior lights of my 2015 Chevy Colorado.<br /><br />These leds are nice and bright.  They look very well built, have a great white color and all arrived working (tested each bulb before I finished my install)<br /><br />The packing is a nice touch, a nicer presentation than just getting a bag with leds stuffed in it like other led purchases I have received from different brands.<br /><br />I have only had them in my truck for 2 months so far, but they are working great.  No flickering or different colored bulbs.
B00DJ5KEF4|4|Works
B003XGYDE2|5|Awesome little pump.  Comes with just about every accessory that you will need.  Not super fast, but for the size, it gets the job done.
B000KE96VU|5|I bought a pair as a part of the set (front and rear brakes). Reliable brakes, they work great.I had noise coming from the brakes, but after changing my rotors and brakes it went away. I have been using these for over a year. I like the way they look on my car.<br />I will be getting a new pair(or set with both front and rear) when the current ones wear out.
B008OOPAE0|5|Used them on a trip to Arkansas and they worked very well.  My feet did not get overly hot when the temps go into the 90's.  Have not had them in the rain so cannot say anything about feet getting wet.
B00493WZPC|5|Official Trunk switch for 2008 Malibu. Replaced the one that wasn't working with this, and it works perfectly.
B00Y5LK3UW|5|Happy...
B005FL5O9Q|4|Super fast shipping!  Easy installation.  However, it would be nice if there were instructions for installing the rear rotors.  It took me some time and research to figure out how to adjust the parking brake so the rotors could be removed.
B006U3RA0O|4|I received the new taillight quick & packed very well. I plugged it in to make sure all of the lights will light up & the main parking light was not working. By the way, the light came complete with a new harness with 4 new bulbs. I played around with the bulb & it flickered. I pulledl the bulb out & found that one of the prongs inside the socket was down in the base. The little Chinese child that assembled it didn't push it in until it snapped into place. I couldn't pull it up where it should be so I used my old wire harness. It works fine. The quality of the taillight is exact factory match. A+<br />Harness was missed by quality control.
B00T0WPHNY|3|I'm not sure if it is real 35% or not, if looks darker than 35%.
B000KL1ED6|1|Fits just barely.  I am 6'2&#34; so with my seat pushed far back it tends to not slide under the seat and crunch up.  The front ones crunch up if you are too short.  I really dont like this product!
B00RVFOR4W|5|Excellent
B00D5SXCX6|4|It came in a package for two & one had been removed. The base of these bulbs make it difficult to fit a solid connection in the socket. But I forced it in and I'm just hoping it will stay put & not start on fire. I got blue for my black on blue Ram. I have 4 other blue lights for stereo gadgets so this color seems right. The base could be slimmer to fit into the socket better but otherwise its got alot of glow & bright, but not too much like the white led. Got the white, the blue is nice but not bright enough. Still a good product, slow shipping.
B00JMD4AAW|4|Bought for the longer rides. Mechanically this helmet is freaking awesome as demonstrated. Admittedly the sound is tinny thus the deduct of one star. Still I would buy one for the wife if she braves up for a ride.
B0058IMW9Q|5|works as advertised, solved my starting problem
B00CEXK9TS|4|I really like the look and quality of these vent shade and would have provided a 5 star rating, the reason for the 4 stars is that the instructions were not good at all.  It would be helpful if there were images provided along with details on how far (measurements) the vent should be mounted above the actual opening of the windows as a guide.
B005S2BKDQ|5|I'm getting 2-3 mores miles per gallon with 6 OZ to 5 gallons of 91 octane  in my motorcycle , It runs better but but would have to run dyno to confirm HP increase .
B00ELR3XM0|5|works perfect and the emailed video was very helpful
B000CSSBOC|5|Great
B0051NNHAG|5|Simple installation,  retains use of all tie-downs on bed,  and trunk still opens most of the way.  What more could you ask for.  Oh it looks good too.  Well worth the price.
B00RXVDUZG|5|These are great! They're so cute.  Took about 2-3 weeks to get here from China, but they're worth the wait.
B00EAOIR8O|4|Fits a 14GC perfectly.
B000JFL8UM|5|Best uv light you can buy for automotive ac leaks.
B006EGAIJ2|2|They aren't wide enough, my cars 315 Hoosiers don't fit atw on, its sturdy etc...just not for any tire probably over a 275
B0073WEZU4|5|Don't waste your time with the cheaper stubby antennas. This one fits. This one works. Made in USA.
B013NMXIWS|2|Bought a 4300K 9006 kit. Installed today, but not satisfied with hue. Seems like 6000K to me, not 4300K like OEM.<br />I could get the 6000K everywhere, but wanted the 4300K specifically, so it looks OEM.<br />Have yet do drive at night to see if light output is ok.<br />Installation was not difficult.
B005FKWZXK|5|Great Quality, easy install
B001GMX918|4|The installation took 3 hours.  The instructions that came with the harness were very poor.  They stated that the white ground wire needs to be screwed to the vehicle body but there was no loose white wire.  The design and wiring of the converter has been updated but the instructions are outdated.  In the end, the white wire is integrated into the harness and so there is no need to screw any wire to the vehicle body.  I found a great video on youtube.com that provided step by step instructions on how to install the harness and I followed that.  I saved myself several $100's by installing it on my own.  Overall, the installation was quite straightforward.
B000760FWU|5|They are stromg and light
B0045K2Q9Y|4|While I feel the plastic MIGHT break  if I ever have to pull one to replace it after some time, there's no reason they won't work just fine while in place.<br />And removing them to test using a proper fuse tool is no problem as new.<br />Worth the try at this price, happy with my purchase
B002NETMZU|5|Bought these for my Taco which still had the factory original shocks and struts and now she rides like a Cadillac.
B0040CTYAQ|5|Product was great.  A little slow on delivery. Nothing to cry about.
B001Y8NEX2|3|worked pretty well
B005UH1M28|5|Fits well; very comfortable.
B003U4RVW8|1|i like the product however it was leaking when delivered and I only got half the product
B00LR5T9P4|4|Good look hard to get straight
B00G6UIUE6|5|Very nice
B00UY8B7VY|5|Love these! Easy to install and look great too! Wish you had them for the headrests in my JKU too!
B00SVG9U6U|5|A++
B00ERXG7DK|5|The piece of equipment I got for my bike. Easy to carry cell, wallet, and change without using your pants or vest pockets. Love it.
B00DOL39F0|4|Great radiator, just had to trim the shroud a bit but the directions tell you that you might need to. The only reason I didn't go 5 stars was the lower tabs didn't fit snugly but this could be because Nissan made different tabs and Stillen was trying to fit them all. Overall I'd strongly suggest this over stock
B00PMA3MG2|5|Arrived in two days, excellent fit and finish. (Better than my previous N-102). Should have bought sooner!
B00LTCL0H0|5|these work great.
B007772I54|1|Tank slips out and falls over!
B0012BL8LG|5|Excellent quality
B001G4Z5J0|5|Great product
B005EHPB2G|3|So so but I'm comfortable with them
B004KKNOYU|4|The cables are quite long (too long) but the sensor seems ok for the price.
B00NF1TL1A|5|Easy installation and perfect fit.<br />GM should have had these as standard equipment in their trucks.  Since they didn't, this is the next best thing.<br />Do yourself a favor and get one.  Your AC coil will stay cleaner and you won't have dust blowing all over the cab of your truck.
B0002SA0BO|5|Great cover! Works great very durable
B000HBNTX2|5|Love this stuff for cleaning up all kinds of messes -- from the garden, greasy dirt, etc.  Gentle on hands, but cuts right through the dirt.
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Looks great.. Just had my car detailed.. 11 year old car, with 11 year old cheap mats, just like these...  These look like they'll last another 11 years and my car inside looks brand new again...
B00T6HHIEO|5|So far so good.
B0007TF766|4|ok
B0027XEJT6|4|Worked great for my Scamp trailers Jenson Astro Vent escape hatch.
B008EEYTRE|4|Great  products, everything  fit perfectly  and runs good. Saved me lots of money...
B0001L0DFA|4|excellent.
B00EZAZNPS|5|Cute
B006EGAIII|5|nice
B0023VFMYI|5|got true and correct on time<br /><br />thank you seller<br />Good Part for honest bucks<br />Great job keep it up<br /><br />thank you<br />Michael B
B000FGJXL6|2|It would probably be fine in a van. Too big for my car. I gave it away.
B0031XULF2|3|It's a bit chinsy. the Pic looks like this huge awesome wheel lock, but it's pretty small.  I always say if a thief wants it, he'll get it.  I suppose this will keep an honest guy honest...
B003R7BZR0|1|2 big issues that wasted a lot of time: there is a plastic clip that holds in the vertical rigid door latch wire - you push the end of the wire into the hole on the handle then rotate the clip to secure the wire. The clip on mine was in backwards AND was the wrong one - it was for the other door, which is the mirror opposite. I spent an hour trying to get it to work before I realized it was the wrong clip and backwards. I used the clip from the original handle and it worked first try. Compare your new handle to the old one very carefully to make sure the clips are the same.<br /><br />2nd issue: There are 3 10mm bolts used in mounting. One bolts the lock mechanism to the handle and is really hard to get to. I could not for the life of me get this in. (Have a magnet on a stick and a long skinny screwdriver/rod handy when you drop the bolt in the door 20 times. I finally took the jandle out and realized there was plastic from the body of the handle obstructing the bolt hole. No way it will go in with that there. I cut it off and it worked just fine. After I figured out these two issues, which took 2 hours, the handle works fine and looks good.
B00HS5JH6S|5|Awesome brake package. Finally brakes done right. No pulsating, No rust. Looks greats. Thank you!!!
B000JYDIOC|5|Excellent product
B00RY2IQH6|5|Perfect fitment and easy installation.  Comes with thin 3M double sided tape.  I recommend a sharp blade like an Xacto knife to peel the wrapper off when installing on the steering wheel.  There's enough 3M to do the install twice.  Rexpeed packaged the cover very well and arrived in 14 days from Taiwan.  I'll be buying more carbon fiber items from Rexpeed!
B0016KG72I|5|Mounted this up to my wife's 2011 Chevy Traverse. It took about 15 minutes to drop the exhaust. Just spray down the rubber hangers with WD40 and give it a few minutes to soak in and then pry them off by hand. I removed both inside and outside hangars with ease, installed the new hitch and wired it up all in under an hour. It's nice to have an extra hand to hold it in place while inserting the bolts but not necessary if you drop the exhaust. There are you tube videos of how to install if your not mechanically inclined :-)
B00CZPR0UG|4|didnt fit securely for the bottom part  i understand this is a semi custom fit. still works
B00JXW0S5S|3|ok
B0014BCQHE|5|perfict fit.
B000C54068|5|High quality better than OEM
B00EPDLRKA|1|Doesn't fit the hitch on my truck 04 Ford Explorer
B00DBEO1KW|5|Not very bright but still are good
B004LWVEKS|4|Ok, so the first thing you'll notice is how well designed this unit is --feels solid in your hand. We have a sailboat with two size 24M deep cycle batteries; one for starting and one for the house.  The house gets used typically 6-8 hours a day running instruments, VHF, chart plotter, etc., about 30Ahr/day. On a recent 12-day excursion, we used the charger three times, powered in a slip, to refresh what the alternator couldn't recharge. Each time took about three hours and seemed to bring the house battery back to full charge.  The indicator lights work nicely to show progress and when you've moved into trickle charge mode. Our plan is to instal solar panels but until then, this is a nice tool to have. It'll also be a a good way to keep the batteries charged in the winter.
B00G620ZVU|5|I put these on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler for additional lighting. They look and work great. I was replacing an older set so the wiring was a breeze.
B00M78820I|4|Just received our sun shad 3 days ago,  So far it seems to keep the vehicle cool.  It is much easier to install than some shades
B00JYX5WFW|5|Went on family reunion camping trip and family member forgot a portable tank for his gas grill.  This item saved that nights dinner.  Have used this item on an over sized fire ring.  Have not yet used with the stake, but the grill worked wonderfully and was easy to clean up.
B009L3C9TM|5|loveit
B000EGAM0I|5|This stuff is amazing!!!! I had heard about Motorkote on the radio and several people from work had told me how good it is.  I watched a video online and decided to give it a try.  I put it in my transmission and added to my last oil change.  I noticed a difference immediately  My car is smoother and quieter.  I have used it around the house and am planning to use it alot more often,  This is great stuff!
B00BEZYUNS|5|Great breaks, easy installation and wonderful product. Customer for life now!!
B00NP61VDQ|5|These scrapers are very nice. Perfect size to store in the car, without taking up too much room or sliding under seats. The plastic material is very durable and the foam handles are strong enough to prevent the scraper from sliding out of your hand. The two pack is an amazing deal too! Keep one in your car and give another to a friend!
B00132CG4M|3|I bought these for my trailer this spring. I have already had to replace the nylon rollers, most of them had worn through the nylon and the metal pin. The replacement parts aren't real cheap either,  wish I had picked something else. Other than that, it works like you'd expect.
B0000AXRH5|4|will work on my bike
B0087NB1IW|5|Unexpected superior performance at a great value!
B00KY5ML26|5|Got it in and it's running great no problems.
B00FBKS8ZI|4|there ok passenger side doesnt stay on i have to turn lights off and back on a few times and it goes on
B00HVHVLDU|5|Hard to lose & keeps your key protected in case you drop it.
B00LPMMO2E|5|Arrived super fast. Excellent light weight helmet. Gloves r great. Little diassapointed that the yellow on goggles are not a matching shade of what's on the helmet.
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;Initially it may be awkward folding it up, but once you get the hang of it you'll love it. When I return to my car I can now easily touch and hold the steering wheel. Best sun shade I've ever used.&#34;
B001TR2F9M|5|I use it for auto detailing. Be careful with water-damaged carpeting. It will rip the hairs clean off. Get a softer brush if you suspect your interior carpet is very old or, water damaged.
B0087FLURW|4|Great bike rack made by Yakima for Subaru, but my Deore disc brakes would slightly hit the rack. Not that bad and has not caused any, other than cosmetic, damage from what I can tell. I will be getting a 15mm thru-axle so the adapter will be raising it past and fix the issue.
B00062W5TG|5|can't drive without it!
B0002JEZ1O|5|I think this is pretty great-----so easy to put on the window, and accurate.  I have no problems at all with it.
B000C59XGU|5|I was happy with the improvement on my steering.  It feels more solid.
B00BOU76RA|5|Great vest for the price, lm 5'10 and 180 and the large is a little big with only a t-shirt on but gives enough room for a jacket or hoodie underneath. The only thing that would make this perfect is zippers on the inside pockets and clasps on the outside ones.
B00FY81BUQ|5|Perfect in my 07 Accord.  Remove the lenses with a small flat head screwdriver. Remove the 4 screws (2 behind the plastic lenses you just took out and 2 in the eyeglass holder.  Pull down the entire part.  Unplug the two wire clips.  Pop out the part with the light switch,.  Pull out the old switch and put in the new one or both as needed.
B0009JKGJC|5|Works well on chrome. Seems to have the right amount of abrasives that don't dull or scratch the chrome but does an good job of cleaning the chrome. Inexpensive.
B0031HEIDY|4|Exactly what I needed and quick delivery.
B010OU8W14|5|great quality, easy to apply. their customer service was wonderful to work with when I had to contact them after my package was lost in transit. will definately use them again!
B00QXC36U0|5|Awesome
B007Y85UDI|1|Very disappointed!!! I received the starter a couple days after I received it which I was surprised about that...  when I installed the starter the starter ended up being defective no wonder it's so cheap of a price...never again sad how they actually send you out a piece of paper saying that it was tested and it passed but when I took it to get it tested it failed...
B00H0HG73K|5|Cheap and works great!
B000LV7XN0|4|Works well, the last ones lasted about 3 years.
B000FFY8VC|4|Works very well so far. Will have to see how the suction cups hold out over time. A good purchase for sure.
B004EPUAEI|5|Perfect
B005HMUHIQ|5|Great socks. Good for winter riding
B00TUNSV2W|5|This like all 303 products is a cut above the competitor IMO. Yes most degreasers out there have a nice citrusy fragrance but many are overpowering when used in a confined place. This one is very lightly scented and refreshing, we all still like it even after having to clean the vinyl flooring and seats in our pick up truck then hopping in the truck (with the windows rolled up) to drive 45 minutes to a meeting.It also is more viscus and doesn't rundown vertical surfaces like the more watery degreasers do. My husband uses most all of 303's line on his collector cars, this isn't just for marine use. It's good for all water-safe surfaces like plastic, fiberglass, chrome & even paint!
B0029XLN1Q|5|Just as promised
B00D1YP8FE|5|2nd order of lights for sailboat.....great lights
B002ZTOASW|5|Works great!
B004JBXJEK|5|Love this item wasn't for me because I got this sticker as a gift in my car. Love the bad girls club logo!
B00B9F2WC4|5|Great product. Fast delivery.
B007NQ3KBK|5|Great
B00286501S|5|Needed for a water filled tractor tire.  Worked out perfect.
B00AJVLHIE|5|Nice, they work well .
B000X1YUZC|5|The straps were easy to use and cinched down tightly (and held).
B004HO7U1W|1|Not the correct part for my car. Photo SHOWED ribbed belt but that was not what I received in the mail. Had to return the part and did not feel comfortable ordering another.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Great product for the price.
B0000AY50X|5|Great product
B00U0UWNK0|5|These are super cool! Sometimes it's the little things that really make the big things awesome. These are some of those little things.
B00X5FJXXC|5|i ordered a key COVER for chrysler  it appears to  look proper  but when i tried to put the guts out of the old one it did not fit. all i needed was the cover.
B0056OFGJA|5|These work well for me.
B002UD0GGS|4|This scratch remover took care of a lot of the scratches on our golf cart's acrylic windshield that had been made by my husband using a paper towel to clean the windshield.  It also removed a lot of the film on the headlights of our automobile which gets a lot of sun here in Florida.
B00PHWA0OW|3|Return them did not fit
B000FQBWCY|5|Works like a charm!
B00EKW1NEG|2|Very small - thought it would be larger - but will give it to Ant Man as a gift...
B000FW2NU8|5|I bought this for a car I no longer have. Of course, it worked great.
B004BCJAQS|5|Great Saab 2006 9-3 replacement headlight. I can finally see again at night!
B000TCTD3Y|5|I didn't have any problems with the original battery in my van but I was running a lot of high power radio equipment and wanted a deep cycle battery. Not only did I get a deep cycle battery but now my engine starts noticeably easier. Highly recommend this battery.
B00L7TL8CW|5|work as advertised, truck stops quickly even with heavy 22&#34; wheels on it
B00MWJHLVI|4|I received grill inserts and headlamp rings.  The grill inserts were not the same as the ones pictured.  However I was only after the headlamp rings.  These will do for a while. Now I am looking for real chrome not plastic.  And not stick on either.  Pricey for silver plastic.
B011GY1T6W|5|Wow just got them today and there great they where shipped super fast way faster then they told me so it was a great surprise to have them show up at the door today. And they look so good could ask for more would have paid much more for them!!!!
B00HNKYD0I|1|DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE of crap. I put this on my brand new cadillac so that I don't bang into other people's car. A few days later the glue from this thing started to leak and it ruined the back of my cars paint. I tried everything to remove the glue but if won't come out. THe sad part is that the glue won't come from my car but this piece of crap always comes off the door edge.<br /><br />Seriously DO NOT waste your money
B009DK1YZ8|1|No problems fit prefected
B00T94V1QK|3|Nice product , STRONG smell to the adhesive side which could stay in your car for a while as well. Adhesive has come off a little on one of them and can no longer stick on my car ..other than that no complaints
B00NJK9O3C|5|This is everything you want in a complete wiper blade -- proper fit, strong hold and a good, clear wipe, each time. It is straightforward to perform the installation, and with Amazon's Garage feature, you know when a product will fit your vehicle -- no guesswork or reading tiny codes in a book in a store or having to deal with surly employees.
B0018MITR0|5|Great product
B001FRR67C|5|It replaced my MBZ fuel cap perfectly.
B007JSGR9Y|1|Buyer beware not good worked only one time don't buy
B00C2BXM5U|5|Great kit easy installation.  Still holding up today!
B000BR6UII|5|Perfect replacement part.
B00K1N43R2|1|It took me two hours to assemble. Then when it was in the car, the force of air blowing through the seat was almost nonexistent. I returned it.
B0002SR4PY|4|Seem to do the job
B00PT18QAQ|5|In order to verify accuracy, I had a technician at Discount Tire compare the gauge's pressure reading to that of their own automated pressurizing equipment. The TireTek gauge was spot on: the reading was exactly the same as with Discount Tire's own equipment. I was impressed, as my older Slime gauge was always off by several pounds.
B002XM5G70|5|Easy to mount, worked well.
B00UHD4HJA|4|These are nice quality stickers but I was disappointed that two of the stickers were cigarette brands.
B009TVX6IE|5|Very nice.  Professionally designed, printed, and cut.  Adheres nicely, even to curved surfaces like my bike helmet.  A few extra stickers were included as an unexpected bonus.  Made in, and shipped from, Greece in nice packaging with expeditious delivery.  Just what I wanted.<br /><br />Jim
B00ZG6JKUO|3|maybe 50 decent stickers
B004ZF39ZY|1|Only one would turn on for a while and I had to keep turning them off and on for both to come on. As of today, after having them for 3 months or so it no longer works at all. Don't buy. Waste of money.
B00FSQQ1QS|2|No so great for heavy equipment work, was disappointed.
B00CHCPT32|5|Good! and Bought 2 pairs for my Quads.
B0027992BA|5|Same drum rotor as the rotors autozone sells but for much less.<br />Fits as oem on 2006 Suzuki forenza.
B0058LS3HI|3|To hard to install on my charger.  thin strips just didn't seem to go on straight
B004BTKVAA|5|Installed in a 2002 Expedition 5.4....same as OEM
B00683ZLHA|5|good product
B00DCNKAH0|5|Fit perfect.  Nice,quality part.
B0085XFIKG|1|Piece of garbage,please don't buy listen to me please
B00CXQ0B7Q|2|The shape was not as expected, I guess I did not like it.
B00RVUGJES|1|Horrible product not OEM or even close to being OEM the size is smaller than original and it's made of cheap Chinese plastic as well as the double sided tape that comes with it which won't stick on that well, I was nice to the seller and asked for a refund which they have been ignoring all of my emails. This product was unsatisfactory to mine and I'm sure most quality standards. Really poor craftsmanship and sloppy design just goes to show how deceiving the photos are for this product. I suppose this is what one gets for trying to save a couple dollars. Not worth purchasing, it's better to pay a bit more for a higher quality long lasting product instead of this cheap imitation.
B0095YB0V0|1|This does not match my paint color. Initially it looked like it did. Now several weeks later it doesn't. So now those dings that weren't so noticeable...are really freaking noticeable!
B00X7HS5LY|4|So, I got this for my car even though I have a Toyota Corolla (not Jumbo...). However, it still fits without a problem. I like this sun shade because it's really flexible and can fit multiple car shapes and sizes. The flexible material in between the two stiffer circles ensures this. There are even little flaps on the corners to ensure you get the whole window covered, although these are just the fabric, so they don't always stay against the window. It stores away nicely in this little bag; you just have to fold the shade in half once and then twist. Getting them into the bag takes a little squishing, but it's not hard. When put in the bag, it's flat and about 8 inches by 6 inches. It really makes a difference in the temperature of my car.<br /><br />I received this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review.
B003FKNAGS|5|Fits good, I have not rode with them yet
B0085IJNNY|5|Bought this to replace scissor jacks that came with my travel trailer. The back ones hang low and when I'm in the mountains tend to get bent. Also they never were very good at stabilizing.<br /><br />So I got these. Put one in each of the front corners of my trailer and have it a try. The trailer was more stable than with all 4 scissor jacks down.<br /><br />Sadly they were too tall for the back of my trailer so i bought the Camco square aluminum jacks (set of 4) so I have jacks for any situation. For fun I set up all 6. Lost all lateral shake.<br /><br />In any case, now I don't have those useless scissor jacks hanging underneath my trailer and I have some actual stability.
B000W0RQ8C|5|perfect and keeps my hitch from being stolen. also provides a tight fit to help with wiggle on the hitch
