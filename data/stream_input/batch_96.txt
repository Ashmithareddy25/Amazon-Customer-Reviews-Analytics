B00D62642W|4|There is hem line on bottom of skirt,hence the 4 stars,other than that fits great,my husband loves it.
B000E7RHY6|4|Okay. So i ordered this dress last week thursday for a formal I have in a few weeks. I was a little skeptical as anyone would be when purchasing things online, you can't try it on so you are always scared about whether it would fit or not. I received my dress within a week and I live in Canada, so that was pretty good. I found the dress fit very well for the most part. I found it was a little roomy in the bust area, which was easily altered. It fit very nicely on the waist and hips. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would purchase from them again. Also, the colour chart on the website is pretty on target. I bought the teal and it look exactly as displayed on the website. You can't go wrong with this purchase.
B000VK41X6|2|I am very large busted and it is always hard for me to find bras that fit.  Normally they are too small.  I ordered the size I normally wear and the band width fit well but the cup size is a bit big.  It does not have much support either.  My advice, this bra is great for a small busted woman but for someone larger (I am a DD) I would not recommend it.
B008BDZ8BE|4|It's a beautiful blue colour and I absolutely love the fit of it!  The fabric on the top is not as pretty as I had expected but it looks good.
B008PD918G|5|Wife loved the socks!!!
B00194S9BI|5|Great fit and color love this hat.
B00NTYCJIA|4|Nice dresses , CK is too small for my baby
B0006M4L3E|5|he liked very much, of course it could have been the money i put in i ???/ dopp has been a favorite brand of mines for years
B000VE24ZO|5|Very cute. As sexy as Victoria's only cheaper.
B001KFV5KI|2|They fit nice and are comfortable, but after washing the elastic in the waist twists. You can not untwist so that makes the pants uncomfortable.
B0083SCB6M|3|It was my first online purchase of bras.  I had to return a recent purchase from a local store just last month because cups were too small.  So, I was very surprised to find this one had cups way too small.  There is no way I can wear it, but too much hassle to return.  It is nicely made and I will keep them just in case I shrink in coming years, hehe.
B007BF9MQK|5|I Loved It
B00KRYMG5Q|4|Very good for Summer time
B0018OU138|1|I have purchased the exact size before with no problem. I am actually wearing the old pair right now. The new ones feel more like 32s instead of 34.
B00HHT7VFO|5|Love love these jeans - fits perfectly . Perfect length and tight with just enough elasticity . Beautiful color with small areas of distress but no actual holes. ( 5&#34;4 inches / 105pounds)
B000MX0EQ0|4|This is now the only bra I buy. Great support, shoulder straps don't slip. My range of motion is limited so I need a front closing bra and this one fits well.
B005FGLVQG|1|Before they broke, they caused horrible irritation on the sock end. I wore them a couple of times and the stitching came apart on one of them and it broke. My previous set is still useable after about 3 years of heavy use and its a shame that this brand new set broke after a couple of uses.
B00HYVSZK0|4|This is a perfect denim skirt.  If you are tall (I'm 5'8) then it may not cover your knee so beware if that's what you are looking for.  Other than that it came on time, looks great and looks like very good quality.
B00CBSZB7G|5|Love it! Leaves a little room to grow, which is great!
B00KAHTXE2|3|OK, but it is too small for me and the fabric is rather thin.
B005A0LQJO|5|Great shirt. We get lots of comments on the shirt and my 12 year old Hetalia manic thought it was the best thing she got for Christmas! Gee, I could have saved a lot of money if I had know that was really all she wanted. LOL The shirt is well made and washes great. I would buy another one.
B00PA7VGWE|5|there great colors
B003TLN1OE|5|I'm 5'5\\" as well, but I'm 154lbs and a 34DD (ick), so I ordered the Large. I LOVE IT!! It is extremely comfortable. The pocket zipper IS kind of harsh, but I expected that after reading the review. I don't feel as bulky as I normally do in jackets, even though it flattens my chest a bit. That I'm not so concerned about since I plan on losing some weight before needing to wear this in Winter! It is overall pretty form-fitted and flattering! :)
B009RETMSG|5|Order by bust size as directed! I am 5'10&#34; and 150lb. My usual dress size is an 8 or medium. But I wear a 34DD, so I ordered a large as the directions say. It fits perfect. The fabric is soft but I have no issue with it being too sheer. I ordered the red dress.
B000XS9UZU|3|Briefs ok. Except for the waistband which is not a very good quality. Not as soft as the Hanes.
B005L56U1W|5|My husband loved it!  Nice material and writing seems like it will last.  Sizing also is right on.  That's it not any more to write. It was as expected!
B009ESZFGI|5|Great shirt but still a little small for me.
B00I5KCGZY|5|Love, love, love!  At first I thought the elastic around the hip and thigh would be too tight; it is not if you take your correct size.  They are oh-so-comfortable.  The patterns are pretty, they wash nicely, and the elastic doesn't show under your clothes.  I will certainly be buying more of these for value and comfort!
B00NGTO61Q|5|This color was ideal to wear as a nude cami under the sheer white tops so popular today. The adjustable straps are greatly appreciated. I've previously worn WinterSilks' products for winter layers. Now, this silk fabric is perfect for wearing in the Texas summer heat! I don't find silk as easy care as polyester, but it's SILK...mmmmmm! I will definitely purchase this again.
B000IZCET2|5|Loves it.
B003COZCIQ|5|These jeans are awesome! 2nd pair I've owned... soft and strechy material, love the button fly. Price on Amazon much better than retail price of $100.
B00D420E6Q|5|Quality is excellent; beautiful color.
B000J3TVPI|5|Bought this for my wife she looks like goddess really turned me on. Anybody looking to spice up their relationship I say go for it.
B00MCHYQWC|4|If you want to take the time and effort, (which I did),  to remove the &#34;glitter&#34; from the sleeves, this is a beautiful blouse.  Well worth purchasing.
B0048H48JA|5|Works good with the over belt from Safariland. You need to order the same size under belt as the belt.
B007H0WGNA|5|I'm really fussy about fabric, since I have sensitive skin.  That applies to the fabric my daughter wears, too, since I am always having to dress & undress her and pick her up.  These PJs are made of soft, smooth cotton and they're very cute. They are the only PJs my daughter wears right now and we have three pairs.  I bought the first pair more than 6 months ago and it still looks and feels new.
B00JE4VH3C|2|It's pretty but just too small on my chest...
B0010ZFN06|5|Wife loves it
B000P61V2K|2|This hat was a great disappointment, it is nowhere near as warm as other comments made it seem.
B00FBD2G2Q|4|They don't seem as sturdy as my old pairs of socks, but considering how cheap it is, I'm not complaining.
B00FYEY4YA|5|I love these scrubs! The fit and feel is good and the scrubs look great too. I hope I never have to go back to drawstring only scrubs. The button and zipper are a must have from now on.To avoid issues matching the tops and pants order the same color for both and make sure the fabric blend (55% cotton/45% polyester) is the same. The model number for the top I bought is 81906.
B0019XV1FU|5|I bought this in a size 2X. I normally wear a 20 or 22. This fits perfectly, and is the most flattering outfit I have ever had!
B00N1LSX2C|5|Ordered two sleep sacks from Vaenait - Cotton Blue Owl and Micro Fleece Pink Flower.  I was a little hesitant with a newer company, sizing, quality, etc.  But after receiving the sleep sacks I couldn't be happier.  What caught my eye first off were the unique designs.  So cute and different from the rest of the pack.  I like that.  Although shipping was expected to take several weeks, the package arrived with both sleep sacks in about a week to my west coast home.  Very little shrinkage after washing. Ordered the medium size for my two year old granddaughter (who is above average in height) and it fits fine, with a room to grow. Quality of the sleep sacks is excellent from the appliques & material to zipper and general construction. I am very pleased.  Cost of the products, including shipping, is in line with or less than other manufacturers.  After the order was placed I received an email from the seller with a photo of the items being shipped and the mailing label with shipping number included.  Nice touch in case something goes missing or there is a question.<br />If you are looking for warm, cuddly sleep sacks for the winter and want cute and unique items, give these Vaenait products a try. I couldn't be happier.
B00HK1J7O2|3|I was lil big for me
B001A40BL8|5|Nice  looking  couple of  pairs of  heavy duty  socks. Comfort  fit, as  expected, sized appropriately. easy  to  care  for  product.
B00RQTIJCY|5|My husband was THRILLED when I found this shirt, a *must* for the absolute Drunk History fan. Soft feel, wears well.
B00QOXYBP2|5|Excellent product.
B00AF6BG3E|2|The PACT Women's Racerback tank is true to size, a great length and the colors are accurately represented, not to mention the company's philosphy is a great selling point, too.<br /><br />However, the cost of the tank top is a bit exhorbitant considering it's not an item you can really \\"pull out of the dryer and go\\", it's definitely wrinkled, the trim edges get twisted (perhaps it's the bamboo...though I've had other bamboo items that didn't get so screwy). For $36.00 and a Summertime knit item, it should be ready to wear out of dryer and not require a light pressing in order for it to be presentable.<br /><br />You may want to keep looking if you're interested in wash and wear.
B00FVYYK06|4|I had to return this as it was extremely small. I am normally a small or xsmall in most bottoms but with this line I am a medium so order up a size or 2 from what you normally might be. But the color was still great, wish it fit :(
B00F929KS2|5|My wife is very excited about finding cuddle duds.  She says they are extremely comfortable,  fit her well, and make a perfect undergarment.
B008LR0KOU|5|My son and my wife really likes the look on him. He wears it all the time, and also has published several photos of him in it on Facebook. My wife purchased this item for one of his body combat demonstrations, which he teaches professionally.
B00M8BECWG|5|Great hat. Very soft and cozy. Happy with the purchase
B00KF6ABEE|5|Lovely fit, will recommend it!
B00EYXZ4UK|4|is a very stylish and awesome feel but was too small for me, just didn't expect the body size to be so different.
B007IXAENU|5|I don't think my son has taken this belt off since the day it came in the mail!!! He LOVES it that much!!! Its a fantastic belt, great quality...its lasted through the abuse that my son has taken it through...And it succeeds in its function as a belt ;)
B0047F5NHO|3|A gift
B00IPOA4YU|5|I got these because since I started working in the nursing department but I would recommend these to anyone who spends hours on their feet!
B008N2X74S|5|I am 5'7&#34; and a size 4 and I ordered this in a small - it fits perfectly and is very cute.  I get compliments each time I wear it.  Dress it up with heels, or wear it casual with leggings and boots.
B000T38ZSC|5|This is not my first wacoal and definitely will not be my last.  I recommend this brand to all my friends.
B005YXYVEY|5|Roomy, well-made, looks attractive. Fabric looks as though it will be durable.<br /><br />Gift for husband. He loves it.
B0068R7YNK|5|All 6 were super cute. I have to disagree that there are 3 girly and 3 neutral. They are more like 5 girly and one boy-ish (but I'd not put my boy in any of them). They all washed up just fine and the packaging was great. And the price can't be beat. BabyLegs brand are $12-$13 a piece and $16 for 6 pair is excellent.
B00MMMJFEQ|5|Right size
B00ETK4T2C|3|It's comfortable, but shorter than I was expecting.  Needs to be worn with jeans or something underneath.
B00H0HQBFO|4|This is a Christmas Present.  Other than that, I can't be of any help
B00E1YRI56|1|its terrible! its not the size that it said it would be and it just is flat out terrible! do not buy!
B007K9A1F8|5|Very comfortable. Can't even feel them on.
B004Z8PYCW|5|Super cute and snug. Nice to find girls sleepwear that is not pink.
B00PLU9UIM|5|I a size 2T for my 22 month old. Right now she is wearing 2T in most brands of clothes. I love it! The material is soft and breathable. It is a little on the thin side, but it still seems like a well-made shirt. It is perfect for spring layering and summer. The colors are true to the picture.
B00OV9CYMI|1|Fabric and fit are great but this robe has threads hanging from nearly every seam! Its shocking! My son loves it but it's very poorly made. I hope it holds up :(
B00O6EY0GG|5|Like it
B005MZ10SY|4|It fits well on top but the waist and hips are a bit large.  Looks good with lavender scrub pants.
B006WFFTTO|5|I'm 5'7 and 160 (yea, I need to lose weight), ordered a US-L. Only improvement is the shipping prices. It's very nice though!  It's thin, so if you wear this and a colored shirt, people will notice. Especially if it has words on it. Overall, it's lovely.
B00B81I4IU|4|Good shirt, it came in the right size and made of high quality materials.
B001OE0HKE|5|great, awesome, gnarly, radical, fantastic, superb, amazing, majestic, mind-blowing, impressive, magnificent, exalted, breath-taking, beautiful, awe- inspiring, wondrous, grand, astonishing, overwhelming
B00IRBUZH2|5|I was not sure what to expect due to some of the reviews and the price, but I am so pleased with this bathing suit. It fits great I just had a baby 2 months ago and wanted something that was cute and still hiding some left over belly and this suit is great! I weigh 125 5'1 and the medium fit perfectly. I can't wait to wear to my cruise next week!
B002P5J7OS|2|Was more likely to be used as a night shirt than a summer dress. Material was inferior grade.
B001WPCVQI|5|Fits well and is really warm after swimming lessons.  Perfect gift for any swimmer.  My granddaughter really loved both the pants and jacket.
B00IDVLPHA|5|nice
B00PHKM0R4|5|These were beautiful, and everyone loved them!  We got a ton of compliments!
B0088H14PW|4|Does dry fast, but it also gets snags pretty easily. Won't buy another one.
B00L4POBVE|3|These socks are fun but not the best. My boyfriend got them for me after finding them in our amazon wish list. I love the patriotic designs, and they fit nicely, but the quality is just average. The stars on the flag ones are very stringy, almost can't tell they are stars unless you're at a distance. The designs also do not line up all the way around the sock, so you can see a disconnect all the way down the back on both pair. When pulled up all the way, the white sock design gets distorted and stretched. However, I have received many compliments on the socks and would say they are comfortable. I would recommend these if you're not too picky about quality, they are just socks anyway! Overall I have to say I like them very much.
B00KT1GEKK|5|It came pretty early. I really like it, it fits really well I usually wear M and I got m/l and is fine.
B00GFAKFR2|4|I bought this for my flower girl.  She loves it.  Fit was as expected.  Was shipped out in a timely manner.
B00KU06CXO|5|Looks well made. Don't think it's made for too rough of play, but well enough for light play! Would recommend for the price!
B009YSS7GI|5|very cute and light, fits her perfectly she is 3 months, colors are just right! great buy, i recommend this!
B0085TVN4K|5|This was super comfortable, flattering, modest, and maternity friendly. I tried on dresses in the DB store first. And, I fit the same size consistently in all their dresses, so I felt comfortable ordering online.
B00K8LWE1E|5|ERERYTHING WAS FINE
B00EUWML9C|5|I like my tops to be fitted, but not skin tight...I like to be comfortable. I am an adult women who typically bounces between a small and medium (more medium then small). Since I could not find this top in women's I took a gamble with the girls department. I am pleased with my purchased.
B004COFPHS|4|Smaller than I expected, however I am getting used to the smaller space. At first I thought I would have trouble fitting my credit cards into the slots, but with use, the slots seem to widen a little. The leather feels nice. I like the wallet.
B00E786B90|5|My new Thanksgiving T-shirt.
B00C9CRJAG|5|I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter.  She had requested it on her wish list.  She loved it.  It fit her perfectly and since then, I have seen her wear it several times.  I am very happy with this purchase.
B00J43YACS|4|The belt wore well. The material was pliable, comfortable
B005HDYRLI|5|I love my scarfs, they are really comfortable and affordable.
B0035A5B42|5|The color of this tie is incredibly vivid, the detail exquisite. It arrived in time and the packaging was excellent. My husband loves it.
B007GC8C0U|4|Fit Perfectly
B00028B5GS|3|LITTLE TO BIG AND LONG BUT GOOD QUALITY AND EXTRA FAST SHIPPING
B0034BOWP6|5|I liked the quality of the product and the color. The size was good!. It met very much my expectation.
B006582VZS|4|But wait!...go 2 or 3 sizes up, I'm a jacket/sweater large, a Street Moda rep suggested I go 2 sizes up so I bought a XXL and it fits like a medium from any other name, so watch it. That said, this isn't a Spring jacket it's a Fall/Winter one. So far so good, materials appear solid enough, the zipper is smooth and the pockets feel strong. A-LOT of pockets on this, color looks exactly like the image. Stylish and versatile for a bargain basement price. I suspect the oddball sizing is the reason for the deep discount because the jacket seems to be worth much more.
B00JIFNJDS|2|I returned them. Waaaaay too small.
B00I1LK4IS|4|This is a nice shirt. It is good quality. It is a little big but it shrinks a little in the dryer after the first couple of washes.
B00KCMKFQU|5|Great fit, and nice quality, good price, would highly recommend.
B00NGGPUSW|5|Great deal!  My son loves these moisture wicking shirts!
B00F5UGN5Q|4|Nice for the money
B00JA074C8|4|Good
B00GVGES5U|5|A wonderful, well-made scarf perfect for a cold day! It is very soft, and perfect for any dachshund owner or dog lover! Price is very reasonable and delivery was as well. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive and high quality scarf. Definitely worth the $10.
B00GA84BFG|3|It's more of a long shrug--just covers the arms, can't even dream of closing it in the front.  I like the pockets.  Also, it's a very light-weight t-shirt material.  Not what I was expecting, but it is very cute, and wouldn't mind buying more in other colors, now that I know what to expect.
B00CZ2CYHS|4|This too is thin but color is good and looks sharp with many colors . I use it with my yellow jacket also several other tops and purple coat
B008E96R5G|5|Look good and sturdy but I was advertised that runs small. I ordered the (8-12yrs) to my 6 years son and it fits perfectly.He loves it.
B000SP6UWE|3|I am making this review for my husband.  he loves gold toe brand because they usually seem like a nice brand of socks but these are really thin and seem very cheap.  He wearas a sz 12 or 13 shoe & these stretch out so easy they slide off
B004QJLIBG|5|Excellent Socks. I Wear Them Everyday & Has No Signs Of Wear. Been About 7 Months Now & Still Going Strong.<br />If I Ever Need To Replace These Socks I Will Definitely Be Buying More Of These Without Any Hesitation. A Little Pricey<br />But You Definitely Get What You Pay For. My Foot Size Is 12&#34; & X-Large Fit Perfectly Like a Glove.
B0080C70K8|5|Robeez baby socks are awesome.  Most socks made for babies wriggle off or just plain fall off at some point during the day.  Not Robeez-- they stay on until you (or your baby) take them off.  In addition, they come in fun patterns, have grips on the bottom, and are rugged enough to last.  When my son started crawling, we did start noticing additional wear, but that was minor, given the amount of use they endure.<br /><br />I like these socks so much that they are one of my go-to baby gifts for new parents.
B00J4II3HQ|2|The color is different from picture (is a brighter blue) and the sowing is poorly done ...
B00CI44BG0|5|Thanks to Amazon for easy access to the site and request him and speed of response and quality of the goods
B00CXQ8KLU|5|I just got my order in today and I have to say I'm very impressed! I knew it was coming from China so I expected it to take longer to come in but surprisingly it came in the mail in under 2 weeks. As for the product, I'm also pleased. I ordered a medium and its very true to size. The top fit perfectly and I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a removable halter strap. The bottoms are also very ideal, you can resize the ties on the side to properly fit yourself. All in all, I love it! I would definitely reccomend and use this buyer again. Thank you!
B00EI8TQCI|3|I knew the sleeves would be a little long and is why I bought it, but I have to roll it up twice to get it to look right and it just feels funny.  Wouldn't buy this particular shirt again but at the price, still a good deal.
B00BJX0EYE|5|perfect fit. I had just lost 50 lbs and needed new underwear, these were great.
B00LF4BDHO|3|My daughter is 4 years old and she is very thin, and the jacket fit a little bit small.
B00BY30TLM|5|Great pants - love the fit!!
B00D470J2U|1|Awful, awful, awful. I waited two weeks for this? I'll take it to my next baby shower. It is teeny! It just doesn't fit like a bolero sweater, it fits like a regular sweater shrunken in the wash. Folded it up for GoodWill.
B003IBYJU0|2|Cheaply made would order the full head costume , not impressed for 91 bucks , had to have it for a live mannequin event in our store window
B00K0KFBCC|5|Excellent
B00CSUPCLC|5|Perfect fit. I'm happy with my experience. I was hoping the tee would run true to size and it does.
B00GRZGKPG|5|Great helmet a good price. I couldnt believe how inexpensive helmets have become. This should be a fun summer of riding
B00CMGB68K|4|Love  it
B005LLNIIY|4|I love the look of the claws. I modified them to fit on my hands, using wire, without the hand backs. They fit great and look awesome on my wall.
B00DHM8CTE|5|Highly recommend this shirt. I got it because of it's quick dry properties but it's actually a very comfortable shirt and being a big guy, I really appreciated it's slimming qualities when I looked at photos someone took. Couldn't be more pleased with it.
B00PH8Q36U|5|Fits welll love it
B00BIMIG6O|5|I love them
B004IYIMSG|5|Always a good fit and feels like wearing little to nothing.  Best fit in low rise trunk underwear I've ever worn!
B0056B0QBQ|2|Remember to check your own measurements to compare! It came in yesterday and fit rather well :) I'm excited to finally have a replaced pencil skirt and it looks pretty sturdy for it to be able to stretch well. Adjusting the length will be easy, if you want it to be shorter. Will probably buy again Also, don't bother with the belt, it's pretty cheap. Don't know why they bother to give it to you.  UPDATE: I WORE IT ONCE AND THE ZIPPER BROKE(IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY CHEAP), WTH NOW I HAVE TO GO REPLACE IT
B0077DYTVY|5|I purchased these for a costume.  I am tall with long arms and long fingers.  With the gloves' stretch, they were long enough and the fingers weren't too short.  They were perfect.  I hope to use them again.  They are comfortable, look great, were very reasonably priced and should be pretty durable.  I give them an A+!!
B00A2GWKMS|5|So very pretty and big , I really love it.
B008VPS7EM|5|Got this for my cousin ad his gift he loved it put Them on as soon as he saw it They looked nice fabric was nice
B000WB051G|5|Any problem with the product, but when its arrived to my address (i use a courier), I make a mistake and don't put my number of mailbox. I has been written emails to you and never anwsers about the tracking # by Envelope, so...my patch are in EEUU right now :D...
B00AMQC780|5|Surprised my boyfriend with these little hotties and he was excited to say the least. They fit great...I'm about 120 lbs and 5'5'' for those looking to get an idea of body type and fit (that info always helps me out) Have fun with these ladies and your partners!!! ;)
B004VJ2EG4|1|this backpack tear off piece by piece overall metal mulisha products are good, i have many jersey and tanks all very good but this backpack dissapointed me
B003JX8GV0|5|The workmanship and attention to detail of this wallet is simply amazing.
B0081NOX7O|5|nice fabric, color, shape, price, this rule to insist on so many words is enough to make me not do these for you anymore. Like the very next one!!!
B001HQP62S|4|I bought this for my son and am planning to give it to him for Christmas. He has said he wants an old fashioned hat like those my uncles used to wear. Well, this is a very nice hat, but it does not resemle the retro fedoras of the 40's and 50's. However, for the price, I do like it and am satisfied he will like it too and wear it. I am doing my Christmas shopping early this year and am actually done.
B00EORQFLS|5|The outfit is cuter than the picture. It is a little loose on my 18 lbs 7 month old boy, but that is fine, it will last him longer. It is so comfortable for summer, and he can both wear at home while playing/napping, or wear it outside while visiting the park etc. as it looks nice enough.
B00DQVTLKA|5|I'm 5'8&#34; and 145 pounds - These fit like a glove. Perfect length. The best part - they don't pick up dog hair. Dress up or down, the perfect pants for anything. VERY comfy.
B00M746Y98|5|These thingies really work!! They felt like they were falling off--they weren't!<br />I'm going to try the lacy ones!
B00F3DY2PI|4|There's always something with the sizes, but in general i like it a lot
B00AHNBXKG|5|excellent
B006091PPY|5|This mask is small, but that is what we needed.  The high school prom theme was masquerade and they would only allow mask that covered the eye area, making this one perfect.  The colors are very true to photos and matched perfect.  My son loves music so the small addition of print music really made it fit his personality.  The quality was nice and the price was reasonable.  It was packed well in the box with plenty of protection for shipping.  Looks great as a decorator piece.
B008KY85BE|5|My grand daughter loved the feel of it inside that she didn't want to take it off. Really nice sweater.
B00846OUTY|5|Fits perfect, very well constructed, will definitely order again. I highly recommend this product and company.
B000TFSO8G|5|Delivered as expected, but a little to big
B005441LSC|4|Genius idea for a hat.  The face part can be uncomfortable if you have a beard, my husband was complaining a little bit about that but he still loves it.  Carhartt products always seem to be made well and last long.  My husband prefers this hat to his many other winter hats.
B00X0CXO1M|5|Beautifully made tank top. Great quality and it fits perfectly!
B00592V5C6|3|I bought the 3T for a 30lb toddler who is growing out of 2T but is not quite at 3T, hoping to get 2 seasons out of the raincoat. The hood fits quite snug already, so not much room to grow in to this. The length hangs just below the mid thigh, so there is very little cover for the legs.<br /><br /> it should work, but I live in Southern California and have not had an opportunity to use the coat as there has not been any rain to speak. I bought this for the 2014 rainy season and hoped to have it for the 2015 rainy season.
B00AF7D5O6|5|love these pants and the expandable waist
B00C93T9OY|2|Wish I had read all the reviews before ordering.  This doesn't look like an octopus once on because it only has six legs and not eight... Honestly hard to tell what it is supposed to be on my toddler. On the plus side, quality is good and the large perfectly fit a 36 inch/29 lb toddler. Also warm and comfy which are the other positives. Still sending it back because of the innacurate description.
B00O7UI0Z6|5|Great gift
B00AEVIS4A|2|It looks cute, but doesn't fit quite well. I got a larger size than a normally wear, based on the other people's reviews, and I should have just gone with my original size. I am 5' 4&#34;, and usually wear Medium. Based on the size chart, I should have gone with a small, but the reviews said buy a size larger. Big Mistake! A Large fit more like an XL on me. The bra part has no support whatsoever, and I imagine if one went swimming in it, everything would just fall out. I didn't even try the bottom, so no comment on that part.
B00AY7XK92|5|nice , i like
B008HA8J1W|1|This wig arrived tangled and feels plasticky.
B00D7SVEKC|5|I am an adult with a small head.  I have been searching for a beach hat that fits my small melon.  This is great.  High quality and fits fantastically.  I love it!
B003IBW1CS|3|Bought a couple of these for my son's 3rd birthday party...only one got used, and another parent did the application. It ended up looking kinda cool, but several places on the tattoo had gotten messed up in the application process, so it wasn't nearly as awesome as we had imagined it would be, but still turned out to be pretty neat and a neat alternative to having to wear a mask.
B00CPUSQO0|5|Good fit!
B002QC64SW|5|I do not use this for its intended purpose. I am a leg amputee and when it is colder at night my stump hurts. This keeps it warm and comfortable. The softness is so nice on the scar area. No pain using this
B00CHQWXL4|2|The best way to describe this robe is it has the same feel as a terry cloth towel, and not a very soft one.  This robe was not the thickness I expected for the price, shedding from the time I removed it from it's box.  I am not at all impressed, except I do like the length and the fact it has a hood.  Other than that, disappointed to say the least.
B00KJBIOQM|4|I'm like a small/medium and it fit me perfectly.
B00B1PCKAG|5|perfecto
B00G2DLCZG|4|cute tights for the price. very thin material so they can tear easily, but i suppose that's the nature of pantyhose.
B00O9GUVW8|5|Comfy, I love it!
B00169OAKK|5|My daughter absolutely LOVES this costume!  It is comfortable enough for her to wear as clothing, and not even spaghetti stains it (just hand wash).
B00915OAH4|4|Fit just as I anticipated, and was the perfect wait and comfort level.  I would highly recommend.  It was reasonably priced as well.
B009T3SEH0|3|As I said above great pain of pants but they fitted much larger then a 32 at the waist. Felt like someone already wore them and stretched them out to a 34. Hopefully after washing them it will corrected its self becasue I have several other pairs that are 32 that fit fine.
B000TFIRVU|5|I bought this dress for my LPN nursing graduation and loved it! I ordered it first in an extra small because of what other customers said about the sizes, and that didn't work, so I ordered it in a small and got the right fit. The sizing chart is way of, so if you're measurement falls in the medium category order small, and you'll get a medium fit. The dress has a puff sleeve, so keep in mind the bigger the size, the bigger the puff of the sleeve.<br /> The material is really heavy, like canvas, but not so stiff, its durable. It has a straight skirt fit at the bottom, so don't choose if you're body shape doesn't go well in straight skirts, or if you have a small shoulders. This dress have gotten great customer reviews for a reason, once you've gotten over the sizing issues, you'll love it.<br />A great dress for those who want to look like a nurse when graduating.<br /><br />As for shoes, I paired this with Skechers Women's Bikers-Epic Fashion Sneaker, gorgeous!
B00JGHNIT8|3|Good quality. Nice graphics. Seemed a little short
B00CFU2XVC|3|Fell in love with this sweatshirt immediately & bought it for my best friends birthday. I was somewhat disappointed by the quality - the orange appears almost red and the strings for the hoodie are not the best quality for the price. It is a nice sweatshirt but not great. Also my friend is tall yet slim and the XL is snug on him.
B00HU250Z6|5|Very cute!  These were for our granddaughter, and her parents loved them!  Nice variety of color.
B004NPD5DW|5|Great fit and very comfortable. Fabric is soft and washes well. Good value for the money. I will order again.
B003CMMLZK|3|I have paid for two of this item(Purchased on 05/29/2011) and have not received one of them what is going on?<br />It's now one month, if you can't complete this order please return my payment ASAP.
B00GXSUEKE|4|My baby girl's name is Daenerys so I found this and I had no doubt for buying this. Love it too much
B00BEKYTL6|5|I'm hilarious and this shirt helped me prove that to my friends! I love how soft the shirt is and I love the color!
B00KLXYU70|5|My daughter loves these jeans so much that I bought a second pair in the next size.  They are cute and comfortable for her.  I love the adjustable waist too.
B005ABG2CY|3|This Under Armour shirt was discounted quite a bit, so I guess you get what you pay for.  The neck-line is very loose.  It's a mesh material.  I wouldn't pay much for this.
B0000A166H|5|Great belt I wear this everyday still looks good - nice quality
B00MUKZHU6|4|very happy with the fit.
B00135IDQY|2|the mens large size is much too small for me so don't expect them to be typical size matches of shoe sizes
B004L00QYU|5|Great shirt,super fast shipping
B000AEUX4O|2|I was expecting something the size of a standard man's wallet, but this is way longer than that.  I ended up buying another wallet at a local (not online) merchant in order to avoid repeating this mistake.
B00422MCW6|3|Meh
B00EI8GGIU|1|It's grey & long sleeve that's about all that matches the description. Looks nothing like the picture.
B00LAYAM3K|5|This hoodie is great, so soft and light material, very comfortable. I bought S, as I normally do, but it is not as fitted as I expected, anyhow I'll keep it and buy another one in XS. The hoodie fit great in my head, with no adjustable strings to pull, is just perfect. The sleeves are long, long enough to cover part of my hand but I like it. The color is very nice (bought Cypress) but in the picture look more gray and is really a light green. Like I said before, I don't care about the size or color issue, is so nice and well made that I love it and buy another one.
B008DJ28TQ|5|Dr. Who fans are a fairly geekish group, but this lets you show your geeky side with style and flair.  A few friends have even started watching the show!
B00MI5KY8S|4|I love this, as I have a heart condition that causes arrhythmias, and I find humor is the best medicine!  I just wish it was larger in the gut area, as not all of us women are tiny, and I prefer large, flowing Tshirts!
B00ACIGNMY|1|These are a terrible design.  Guys who choose briefs over boxers do so because they want support down there.  Because the crotch on these is too narrow and the leg openings are WAY TOO BIG these are only slightly better than no underwear.<br /><br />These would be overpriced at free!
B0040ZFFSI|2|The material used for this product is far too thin. While it may serve your purpose I would recommend a first aid bag with better quality materials and padding.
B00JR3IX78|5|My only wish is that there were more &#34;common&#34; letters like &#34;E&#34; for name spelling.<br />These letters were used on my store apron.
B00BBS420E|5|The fit is easily adjustable because it is after all, a snapback.
B00T9WFYIS|5|Very nice and cool. Good quality.
B00A5JI66G|4|The girlfriend loved it. She looked awesome in it.
B00G2T0Y5E|5|Very nice. Makes a great gift
B00F77M44Q|5|pretty dress, fit great..
B007W4KJVM|5|Friend I got it for loved it. He's a mens small and it fit just fine. The art on it looks bigger than thought and its well made.
B00DAHG2T8|5|Love it!
B00IM3FLVA|4|Material is not awesome quality.  You get what you pay for.  Cute swim suit though.  Bottoms fit normally, top seemed big...
B00DM280UK|4|Very cute but I found the size (9 months) larger compared to other brands. Will be returning which is unfortunate because it would have kept her super warm.
B004BG1TXG|5|It's very nice.  I got an XL so I can wear sweatshirts under.  It's well made and attractive.
B00IWJ57AY|5|Just as pictured. Very cute.
B00PR8T06K|5|Love it and ordered the black as well as tan. Now, I own 3 shirts and simply love it. Even my son gave shirts thumbs up.
B00028B3EM|4|The pants were sized properly. The 38 inch waist I ordered was accurately size. Don't go with the size you're used to in your closet. Other companies undersize their pants to beef up the male ego. I forgot this basic rule and ordered what I thought was my proper fit. For these pants, measure your waist line. Another way to do it is to go to a mens store and have them properly measure your pants and go with this measurement.  The pants are of a high durability. I did order a pair of 40's and they are a better fit. i defenitely am pleased with the ruggedness of this product.
B00AK41AT6|4|fits well, sits well.<br />comfortable and stylish, what more could u want!!<br />cool colors and designs of all Hurley clothing
B009Y48H5I|5|Again, I bought it off a registry because I thought it was very cute.  It will be adorable on the baby!
B0052T8PLK|5|I picked this costume for my wife (I was wearing Neo Costume).  We were a hit in the party and afterwards I shared it with family.  Great costume, great price and it worked for several uses.  I recommend this if you are on a low budget or if you tend to loose your stuff.  You'll look great and if you lend it and it does not come back, you won't be so heartbroken.
B00H4XFX1C|3|As an Anne Klein addict I could not pass up buying 'basic black pants&#34; for a bargain price in my size.  They are OK - not my favorite Anne Klein pants though.  Potential buyers should know that they are a somewhat heavy knit that fits more closely to the body than other Anne Klein pants the same size.  If that drives you crazy then maybe these are not for you.  I think they are too heavy for the summer but would work OK when the weather is colder. The pressed crease in front of the legs is &#34;sewn in&#34;, in case you like that or not.
B003IX192Y|2|The vest that I received in the mail looks nothing like the one in the product photo.  It makes me wonder why they would even use that, especially if it's not the exact product they are trying to sell.  The estimated delivery time was over 3 weeks, but I received the item within the week I ordered it. So I can't complain about the service; they were very quick.  But I can, and will, complain about the actual product.  The vest I got is like a really cheap fishing vest.  I am 20 years old, 6'4\\" and 170 lbs.  I got the large, hoping it would fit tightly (One review mentioned that he was the same weight as me, so he got the XL. I would have looked absurd in an XL.), but it is still loose and square looking when I wear it.  The zipper is very cheap, and the logo on the back is a lot smaller than I thought it would have been.<br /><br />I really don't understand why the product photo is one thing, but whenever I review my order a completely different photo comes up, which looks more like the one I got.<br /><br />All in all, great service, but poor product.  I would not recommend paying this much for something that is so light, thin, and cheaply made.  I wish I could return it, but honestly, even though it's not amazing, it's the best looking Kakashi vest out there (well at least the product photo was).  I, however, am going to look like the Leaf Village fisherman on Halloween. :(
B00K7F10F2|4|Good color selection and fit well.
B00L62PY7A|4|Great spring shirt perfect for evening
B009N5NOQ0|5|Great quality!
B00946GU3M|3|There was not a good variety as expected. We did the color run in Las Vegas and we were dissappointed that we dismd not receive some of the socks shown
B00AKDOWCY|5|Ok
B00V3X4EL4|4|too big we returned it and ordered a smaller one
B007LAENJ6|5|This is a great trinket and has an affordable price.  It does have a design flaw, though.  If it is twisted too much, the screw holding the pieces together will fall out. But it is easily fixed.  I am satisfied with the product and the seller.
B002HJ2SWU|5|Cumplió con las expectativas de la prenda, la descripción es perfecta se ajusta a la realidad, la tabla de tallas es adecuada
B00CPQG39E|5|I bought this backpack for my son who turned 5 years old.  He absolutely loves it!! Backpack is bigger than i expected so enough space for my son to carry all his toys in there.  will recommend to all TMNT fans!!
B005DTCCDQ|5|Im very happy with this purchase. I buy my son Nautica uniform shirtsm but was unable to get them with long sleeves for colder months. I was skeptical about the quality for a long sleeved shirt priced just over five dollars.  I ordered two and have since ordered more of them. I ordered them in a size seven for my 5 yr old who weighs 55 lbs and is about 49 inches tall and they fit perfect, not snug and not oversized. Good on shrinkage as well.
B009940V5W|5|100 % silk smooth and soft silk scarf love the color's on this product and the company that sell's it is outstanding and look forward to more business with them!!!
B00AF947ZU|5|Great socks! Elastic enough and of just the right height on the ankle.
B003XKO7LW|5|It's hard to find jeans that go up to your actual waist. I ordered by the size chart. They turned out to be too big. They do stretch out some. I have to return them for a smaller size. I still really like this style of jeans.
B0050UP92Y|5|Good quality shorts. I'm a size 30 and the SMALL fits fine. I wear them for crossfit and they do the job.
B00C6M5HLM|4|This costume was just perfect for the monster party my 8 year old daughter was invited to. It is not the best quality outfit but for the money represents great value and my daughter absolutely loved it. The reason I did not give it five stars is because it was actually very small - my daughter has only just turned 8 and is the smallest child in her class at school and the 8 to 10 size barely fit her and the skirt was very short. Also beware - the feathery parts and glitter come off it really easily - my house was a glittery disaster zone in no time!
B006IOLP9W|3|They were way too large sent them back.  The pants seemed okay I just didn't like the way the fit, other than being quite large.
B009SP0MBK|4|Grandson likes the fabric and fit of these pants.  Doesn't itch sensitive skin and feels soft.
B00HB97FWE|4|Was very pleased with the way they fit the girls.most of the newbotn clothes ,are really to big for them right now,maby in 5 or 6 months they will be readdy for nb clothrs.
B0008EORLG|5|Fine quality goods.<br />Very fast delivery.<br />Length slightly longer than expected, but not significantly.<br /><br />No complaints, except that the promised gift had not arrived, but it is not essential
B005CSOHKO|4|Soft. good weight and softer after washing. Did I mention soft? Probably going to get  a second pair for husband.
B002HWS47U|5|arrived nicely and in good shape. they fit very comfortably and cover my whole ear. i have to use them from the back of my head, instead of from the top of my head down, but they are still snug and cover the ears. seem to stay in place, so far. i am pleased with my purchase.
B00URSV9DC|4|First off, I received this item much earlier than I had expected and earlier than Amazon estimated and that's always a good thing. The shirt looks absolutely wonderful, very happy with its workmanship and feel.<br />Sizing is a tad on the small size but that's normal when ordering from the UK. I would encourage people to order a size bigger than they normally wear.
B0043BWP0K|3|I bought this for my boyfriend who's 6'2, 180lbs and has a slim body frame.  The outfit ends about 2-3 inches above his knees (the length of where his boxers end -- so he has to pull up his boxers just a bit so they won't show).  The price is unbeatable, but my only concern was the belt.<br /><br />The belt given to us was dark brown, very thin, and frayed at the ends -- it honestly looked like someone just cut up some material and threw it into the package (the costume bundle was open, so I think the original belt was missing and the seller just added some random one).  My boyfriend can't wear the belt because too much material is coming off of it, I wish we had gotten the nice thick, golden belt featured in the picture.
B002459SMA|5|I deliver MMJ and now I look like a medical pro... lol
B002SDE0PS|5|Adorable costume. I love it. It is warm and fits him great and the tail is so cute! Good purchase :)
B00KAH4LA8|5|My daughter loves these
B00AIXUAXG|5|Great shirt
B0083H3R84|5|I love these sleep shorts! They are comfortable and look good. What more could a guy ask for? I may have to have another pair soon ... one to wear, one to wash.
B00M51OD46|5|excelent
B00QF31UMI|5|Nice material, fits well and looks cool.
B00KG3BSQQ|5|Get fit.  Material is very soft .
B001OGRGFG|5|My boyfriend actually ordered this for his church attire.  He looks great in it, and many parishioners have told him so.  Our clergy also approve, and his confidence has soared as a result.
B00DEP1W5U|5|Nice
B000NZW3IY|5|I only regret that I have so few stars to give.  I'm cunning and agile by nature, so I was immediately drawn to the shirt, and having worn it for a few weeks now, having communed with it, I know I've found my home.  I can only hope the company doesn't set about trying to make improvements on it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
B0050AFYQ0|5|Contents as described. As I liked them bofore, therefore did not try any other brand so cannot compare the product.
B004MW3XGU|5|Light weight and keeps the sun off the kids.  When the hat is wet it dries fairly quickly! Nice little hat.
B00330N7EA|2|I am a very, er, \\"well-endowed\\" lady (HH+ depending on brand), but I'm used to playing the game of, \\"buy a band size or two larger than you want, so the ladies squeeze in.\\" You absolutely cannot do that with these bras, though! They stretch out quickly in the elastic parts, but the fabric parts are tight enough as to provide zero \\"cup\\" room, and ended up making me sore.<br /><br />Perhaps these work well enough for smaller gals, or women who are used to being crushed (and yet have their breasts folded against where the band ought to be), but it just didn't work for me.<br /><br />Two stars because that fabric sure did hold firm! Just not the elastic portion, so useless as a sports bra if you've weight to support!
B00B916HGU|5|Better than I anticipated. This pulls together the costume and the price just couldn't be beat. Awesome deal!
B00TF1RZ1C|4|Great fit. Very soft, comfortable fabric. Great for everyday wear.
B00M3NKBG0|5|It was what i expected (size,style and quality) but the shipping time was awful
B00008LUTK|3|Too bad after the second wear, they dont stay uo!
B004K2ZPS6|5|If a yellow shirt with a smiley face isn't happy enough, try John's Gospel message that GOD loves you !  Everywhere I go, people stop, look  and read ; it's my favorite shirt.  If you love the color yellow and drawing attention to God's message, this is for you !
B00EXJDCT0|2|product was ok - a little large but just not very impressive product.  Am going to be returning.  If you want a casual t-shirt type dress that doesn't have much shape to it - then this would be perfect
B00AYQE3KS|4|I have been very like tommy clothing, nothing but with poor quality of the production in India is good, design is very novel, wearing comfortable, the price is right.
B00IO90SBK|5|Great!
B00Q2FPESU|4|Fits well and very comfortable but stretch out really quickly!
B001XP02K4|3|It's a beautiful headband, but not worth $7. The flower's material is not greatest quality, and it came with a few tears.
B004A7XYCU|1|Can't respond as I never got this product.  I will however<br />say I do like fruit of the loom products if cotton.  Sorry<br />I can't add more to this.
B00KNMMMUG|4|Super comfy
B00J8EIS1W|5|excelente
B00DYRGCZS|4|Outfit is cute, and quality is fine. The shirt is lightweight with 3/4 sleeves, good for Spring/ Summer weather. The sizing, as well as the reviews on sizing, kind of threw me. So here's what I encountered after ordering: Grandson is 4 and 1/2, on the thin side and small waisted. A longer waist though, so I ordered size 6.  Top will fit,  but isnt overly wide. Long enough though, which is good. Pants are too wide at waist and too long. On a heavier child this might be more of a slim jean. My Daughter will shelve them until he can wear them. Huh...a hard sizing call on this outfit. For us it was the top fit ok, and pants too big. But it is really cute, and my Grandson liked it! Price for this outfit was incredible. Worth buying for sure.
B002G9UEHC|3|You can not beat the quality of Carhartt. This is well made but very tight on my husbands head. He is a very large man, so beware of the small fit upon ordering.
7890001657|4|Gave seller my boyfriends measurements and this fit great, quality is good for the price as well and the seller ships quickly. However the product is not as pictured. The style is correct but the brown is much lighter and the inside lining of the hood is a darker color. Still a good product overall.
B00JWO5W26|3|Just as expected
B00MY5UEZU|5|Good socks. I've always been happy with any carhartt products. You get what you pay for.
B00KRK2VGO|5|this dress is pretty and classic! the material is stretchy and breathable.  It was put together nicely and great to wear on a cool summer day.  Fits great and look good!
B00Y04LA3S|5|I got this dress because I have a couple of beach vacations on the horizon. I thought it was a fresh design with the gold buttons on the shoulders. It's a very flattering fit for someone whose tummy is not perfectly flat anymore and I think it will work well with heels or flats.
B00BJDLWHC|3|Runs large by one size, super cute though!
B00LMXKNCE|4|I gave this to a doctor as a retirement gift. He loved it. He has hair again..
B003G2Z5LI|4|I wasn't looking for great pants, and I find these fit what I was looking for.  Good bang for the buck.
B0054QHP0S|4|it was great. no one else had the same outfit as her and it was nice and soft.  was running a little small and my child is on the smaller side,  but other than that it was great.  oh so cute.
B00JF56FBE|5|Many of my friends have said they would never think to wear a suit like this.  They like bikinis; however, when they tried it on, they fell in love with it and ordered one for themselves in different colors.<br /><br />The whole suit is superior and high quality.
B00E3BDNW4|5|Daughter loves them.
B0081GDIZY|5|Love these! Too cute!!
B00BMNP1QC|5|Awesome shirt.. fits my husband perfectly. No problems and can't beat the price. nice fabric and clean cut, no loose strings.
B0047N1708|2|I was looking for basic khakis with a hook and loop closure and settled on these pants. Some of the other reviews have it right; these run really small in every dimension. I dont think that getting a size bigger would compensate really, it's a symptom of the design. not very comfortable, and no room in the seat.
B00NNA3POC|1|Very pretty but sizing way off!!
B004LWZ990|5|my favorite sleeping underwear.. recommended! thank you guys from C-in2<br />fits perfect, great material, after months still nice colors, really recommended.
B00QMTGAI4|5|Really cute!  Good quality!
B00C7J8Y6O|2|SLEEVES ONLY HALF LENGTH NOT LIKE PHOTO
B001P7BHQ8|5|I purchased this set (umbrella, raincoat, boots) for my daughter and she loves it! Good quality and fit. I would definitely recommend Western Chief rain gear!
B00HQ92ODO|5|Very good
B00C9T2VAW|2|Nothing stating that they are pretty much &#34;swimming&#34; shorts!! Mesh pockets and all!! Not what I had expected to get...
B000NRWVHA|5|My favorite hat ever!
B008A4W50Q|4|These Jeans appear to be very nice and well made, but they run a little large in size.  They're also a bit bulky around the waist.
B00GG07N1W|4|Great replacement lenses. Does scratch easy though.
B00HS3IHLQ|5|Love tractors and this is a great shirt.
B0068EDHBQ|4|It was on time, just as the email notice said and Its exactly what I expected.  I think I need a bigger one.
B009NY2TJO|5|cheap, functional.. don't know what else to ask for.  Took a bit longer (one month) to receive...  but given that price point.. I am satisfied.
B00P18R3YC|5|This camisole not only looks great but feels great as well. I have already washed it a couple of times and know that this piece will be part of my wardrobe for years to come! Love it!
B000SKLT5M|4|I didn't give them five stars because they are just socks and I don't really think I have tooo much of an opinion on cheap black socks. I bought them and would do so again. great shipping
B0058DCX0O|4|These are nice pants.  However, they do run a little large for a size 4 and I would like them to have been a bit longer.
B00FACNHPI|2|Very deceiving. ..plus size apparently is the same as the one size fits most. This costume is ok if your under 230 and under 6'....also this thing SHEDS bad!!!! I had to vacuum after I took it out of its package.
B004NSAJRE|5|Had been buying spanks for a much higher price. Liked the spanks but they ALWAYS ran after only one or two wears.  This product out performs spanks for much lower cost, will definitely be buying these instead.
B002U68MDY|5|kijuhygt
B0086RPNQU|5|This was a great fit and looks just as pictured. Great fit and quality of material will definitely purchase from this seller again. Another great experience.  Definitely will recommend this halter.
B00995TFMQ|5|For the price, I liked the outfit. Fit well, color was very deep purple, hope it washes well. Well made, sew well and warm material. It was worth the the price. Updated look in a velor warm up suit. Nice low wasit pants. and cute little jacket, wear with or without shirt.
B00INCBSVC|4|As a 5'10&#34; male, I chose to buy the large. At first, I was on their official website checking their measurement system and it summed me up to a large. When I got it, I tried it on. It's a little baggy in the buttock area. Overall it's quite warm and fashionable.
B00E6O0Y98|5|This jacket is gorgeous and very well made however the size I ordered was huge on me.  I had to return it, but will likely reorder in a smaller size.
B00298ATQ6|4|All together, a great deal.   However, the coat is built for a fat person, not so much a large person. It's bigger in the gut but not the shoulders. The liner is also very thin.  Great quality leather, plenty of pocket room, I'm very happy with it.
B00Q2J5D5A|1|didnt fit i am not that big of a girl but it said it runs small so i order a 2X and still was to small wont be ordering stuff like this again waist of money
B000JGD7W8|5|This is a lovely night gown, flowing and soft.  It fits perfect and is very comfortable... makes you feel like a princess.
B00JB3AV4M|2|The shirt is at least 2 sizes smaller than the actual size.  I had to return it even after purchasing an XL and I usually wear a M.
B00284B5R8|5|Great fit. The only issues is that you can see the seams thru your garment if it's a single layer.
B00JQRQR3C|4|My wife likes them to sleep in. Soft & stretchy.
B005GYGEWS|4|For this price these work out well.  I use them for yoga and find them not too tight, but stretchable.
B00A01AVN0|5|Size runs small--buy the next size up.  Fits my 7 3/8 head, keeps my ears warm, and looks very nice.
B0079AI3I0|5|Thank you
B00J9AH1VS|2|Beautiful color & looks just like the picture but unfortunately it didn't fit. I'm 5'7 & 160lbs & its not long enough my arms couldn't go in. The amount of fabric is meant for someone who is no taller than 5'2.
B001KAMEZ8|4|these undies are soft and true to size. I wish they had come with a &#34;hello kitty&#34; or &#34;princess&#34; or &#34;frozen&#34; design, but the colors are vivid and pretty. would buy again (probably will soon).
B001JT3P9E|5|Fits great and great quality. They are very warm too. Shipped fast and received with in a few days. ;)
B00Q0GK7Z6|3|The gloves were to big so I returned them for a refund. I was told they are just one size.
B00CYAXXXU|5|Fits even with large calves.
B0076R6OG4|5|Fits great. Great look
B00H97I78O|2|The corset is very pretty and it arrived faster than I expected. But it fits terribly!! I am 5'4'' 170 lbs 40 D. The corset gives me a very weird shape when I put it on. Not flattering at all. I'm not going to be able to use it.
B003GIS96U|5|I am a small framed man and the staight fit,flat front Dockers pant fit me the best. I am a golfer and play in New England in the summer, Florida in the winter, therefore I need a comfortable,casual and neet looking pant when it is cooler weather on the golf course. These pants fit the bill, cost wise and I checked many website's before I purchased three pair's of different color's. I'm very pleased with this purchase and would do it again.
B00CE1VEOY|5|I searched erywhere for a popeye shirt for a gift for my husband and this was the only one i found that involved the gym with popeye! My husband loved loved it out of all the gifts i got him this was the one that by far stuck out to him that he was in shock and love with! Thank you so much for this product. I may have to buy another one bc of how much he wears this one lol
B00ISLWYOI|5|Well tailored, sturdy and good quality denim. Excellent fit for my body shape. Colour a little patchy rather than uniform, as depicted in the advertising information.  Overall, great pair of jeans.
B00BCWHQXY|4|Nice jeans but run small. Had to return for a size 8 petite.
B00I5C295O|4|like it very much...thank you
B00GBVPUO8|5|Great fit Great look I would buy again!
B00AW7ZW9U|4|As another reviewer said, the material is a waffle knit exterior with fleece lining. It took a few weeks to arrive from over seas, but it did make it. There's a strange almost petroleum/gasoline smell to it that I'm hoping will go away with my first wash. It's a great tunic for tall to wear with a cute tank top under.
B00284B5GO|2|Product was for my wife and based on her experience (she's 5'2&#34; and about 125 lbs - bought a Small):  This product does not perform any additional function for the abdominal region then well fitting control-top hose do.  Well, they may keep you warmer.  It does have an overlapped slit for urinary functions though never tried it.  Also it's made of nice, silky fabric but not useful enough to keep.
B00D96HBCW|5|Comfortable
B00PAI8SLA|1|Too expensive and received the wrong size.
B00KNT8HU8|5|I like how this fits. I ordered the size I normally wear and turns out it was the same size as at like a store.  It's so soft and not cheap looking. Good puchase.
B00BQNRMOC|5|Love the shirt.  The car is the same color as ours and that is why we bought it.
B005G5XE3E|5|My husband loves his jacket. It looks good on him and it can be worn fall, spring and mild winter days.
B0007CKMFO|5|I've always liked the fit of Wranglers.  I thought that I had ordered a little too large, turned out to be perfect for me.
B000FBYYF6|4|But a XXL is what I normally buy for extra room. This XXl fits like a XXXXL
B00EOHUGFY|3|I'm a size 7 and these are a bit small.
B008HF8NJK|3|The sizing is similar Levis 510, I'm 5'11&#34;, 163 lbs and I ordered a 31/32 and they fit well. The pockets are too deep and are extremely stiff. They might break in well but for now they aren't very comfortable pants. They also really aren't very suitable beyond t shirts and very casual wear. Still need to remove the logo on the leg. For $20 they're ok, but I would't buy them again.
B00DX7S2PM|2|I wear only XL shirts and sweat shirts and I could not even get this over my shoulders.  Very surprised it could run so small.  Pre-shrunk slim fit means two sizes off from the norm.
B00209CZKM|3|This item came real tight or to small .  It hardly even stretches when I tried putting it on.  I am washing over and over until it get softer and looser to wear.  All the body briefers I have bought in the past never felt this tight and I never had any problem putting it on.  Thank You, Ilene Gonzales, Elko, NV 89801
B00M3AO3A8|5|husband loves them
B004BIT1UC|5|I love these pantyhose.  One reviewer mentioned that these do not stretch.  This is true, they have little or no stretch, so sometimes you have to work out a wrinkle around the ankles.  BUT, they are so sheer you can't hardly see them, yet they make your legs look nicer by blending out little imperfections.  If someone is looking closely you can see them a little around your toes, but even there they are not that noticeable.  Your pedi will still be seen!
B000KNN2GQ|5|The John Deere hat fits and looks great. If you want the old school trucker look, this hat is right for you.
B007JFEI1Q|5|One of my favorite albums ever made, and this shirt is perfect in every way.  Fits great, slim, but not too slim.  Would buy from seller again, thanks!!!!
B0081ST61C|1|Vary bummed! It just sits here! I can't wear it. Needs to be clearly labeled JUNIOR.
B00K76MN9S|2|cute shirt but the fit was made for a tween, not for an adult. I wear a Medium and would of had to purchase this in a XL to fit I think. I gave it to my niece
B0002TORVM|5|The socks are a great fit and are nice and warm. They are mostly cotton which I prefer for socks.
B007O3SI2I|4|My son, who is a huge Jeff Gordon fan, loved it!
B0052B71XG|3|Tge quality is decent and it's heavier than I thought would be.  The corset on the other sucked.  It had 2 slits in the bottom of it so it puffed out instead of laying flat.  I got it and tried on and packed it back up for return.  It was not flattering on me either.  It made me look bigger.  The dress was fluffier on tge hips than in the picture.  Also did not like they do not show a back view of dress.
B00F9RJLTU|5|i love this jacket
B003O86MLQ|5|This is a superb quality costume. The material has stretch to it and the whole thing is just well made. One of my favorite costumes.
B008JY1IKU|5|Just as expected, warm and stylish. What else can I say?  It's a great coat and just in time for this cold winter.
B00GRYXHUS|1|OMG!!!!!  The material is really bad, and its structure is very badly designed.  As soon I opened it and tried on, I screamed because it is so ugly.  The liner doesn't come all the way as the outside jacket, thus it looks really funny.  i contacted the seller to return it as soon as I got it.  This should not be sold in the market!!!
B00MAX3PIO|5|Like the item
B003ZYE0ZE|4|needs rear seam to avoid uni-butt
B00C60101A|4|Nice looking t-shirt from Quiksilver. They still have some catching up to do if they want to be anywhere near Hurley, Volcom, or Element.
B00G28IV4G|2|These do not have any rubber on the bottom for traction. They are plain black toe socks. I don't recommend these for yoga use unless you don't need the extra grip.
B004QOWQAI|5|Good quality, hard find pant
B00JC2TRH4|5|Well, it is a fun item?! Enjoyed by gift giver and recipient~ ;)
B003V4AL5G|5|I've had this for several months now and it seems to be holding up to my every day wear-and-tea. Would consider buying another if necessary.
B0085J907W|5|Very nice
B00GNBCNBO|5|Bought this hat over at Zumies and loved it. Took a trip to Six Flags and lost it on a ride. Got it thru amazon and was very pleased
B004NNBZ5Y|3|need more length
B00EYZRG5E|1|It is smallest
B0036OS6LC|2|The shorts themselves were ok. The problems started to happen when you go to use the draw string. Talk about cheap. I broke the string on both pair of shorts. Just from tying them. I replaced it with paracord. Im not sure that I would buy again.
B007WPNNH8|5|Just what I wanted.  Fit is good.  Height is right.  Very comfortable.
B00FAGHO1C|5|My 12 year old cousin requested this as a Christmas present, but I let him have it early so he could go as a Roman demi-god for Halloween.  The kid is a huge Rick Riordan fan and loves the shirt.
B00BN58THM|5|The dresd its very beatiful, but its very large, the picture its beatiful and the frabric its very soft, the dress its very confortable
B00GGB1GC8|5|I wear these almost daily, because they're that comfortable. However, they pill pretty badly due to the frequent washing. They've stretched out a little bit (also due to daily wear), but they don't cut me off at the waist like a lot of leggings, and they are so warm and cozy. Highly recommend.
B00HS4UCLI|5|got lots of stuff for the price--like the look of it all
B000HAPK2Q|1|I ordered this and the Smiffy's Women's Spooky Witch Costume to do a comparison. I had read the review(s) of both and wanted to see which one had a better fit to it. Rubie's is possibly the most unflattering witch costume *ever*. Yes, it's intentionally roomier, but this thing has no notion of what size your neck is relative to your body. Moreover, it's like a potato sack when you put it on - there is no shape or form to it at all.<br /><br />Here's my review from the Smiffy's costume page, noting the negatives to Rubie's costume ...<br /><br />&#34;Smiffy's not only fits a million times better (and you have size choices, ladies!), the sleeves are more stylish and the neckline actually fits (Rubie's is like an oversized boat-neck, and it's not flattering at.all). [Smitty's] fits pretty true to size and slightly more form fitting (it seems to understand where your waist is relative to where your hips and bust are on your body), whereas Rubie's is like one big-sized sack). All in all, I would say go for this one.&#34;<br /><br />Oh, yes, the hats in both costumes *do suck*, so I would say order a totally different witches' hat off of amazon.
B00ARCZ7JK|5|Great Shirts! very comfortable and looks good too.
B005CB6OM0|4|After a fiasco with the delivery (the seller more than went out of their way to rectify the situation) I finally received my clogs. After wearing Dansko's for two years my feet need to adjust to the different shape. Glad I have a good pair of wooden clogs again.
B00MA0P4YU|5|Perfect size for a toddler. Very cute.
B0018P06LE|5|Fit as expected... Quality is great and the price unbeatable.
B00TKENLHG|1|Too too small! Love the dress but too small.
B006L3V85Q|1|Within minutes of putting on, socks slipped of heels. Waste of money.
B00FHK4I2E|4|I❤️It fit perfect is just the shoulder part lil bit loose not a big deal
B00PIM2706|5|I was excited to see a shirt dress in a larger size.  I need a 2x to accommodate my chest and hoped this would work out for me.  I absolutely love this!  Not only is it made nicely with quality material and stitching, but it fits well.  It is a bit smaller and definitely clingy, but it isn't undersized a lot.  I consider it rather true to size but totally fitted. Don't expect this to be loose and flowy, it is definitely a super fitted style.<br /><br />After one wash and wear, I love the fabric.  It is soft, thick and just what I need.  The button front is perfect for staying covered or showing a little cleavage.  The sleeves were a bit long, but easy to cuff or push up my arms as needed.  It was a bit short for my personal comfort to wear alone, but went greatly over a pair of slim fit leggings.  I can see wearing this a lot this winter and hope to grab in a few colors.<br /><br />This is a great quality - not cheaply made shirtdress.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B00DBOJ1JS|4|Decent design, nice colors and the price I payed at the time was reasonable. Quality is a little weak and sizing is off. I'm a medium in most shirts, but with Electric Visual I always have to get a large and even then the shirt just fits. I miss their old electric volt design, I hope they bring it back some time. I think it has a more classic look.
B00GH9WT8E|4|Very pretty and comfortable.
B00EZDMJS4|5|I love this top.  I ordered medium because reviews says it's oversized and they were right on.  It's very sheer (see thru) so unless you wear white underneath, green color doesn't pop as the photo.  I'm happy with this purchase.  I've order several tops from Allegra K and they have never failed me.  I love Allegra K!! &#60;3
B0040DD96A|5|Love this product, it this the best fit of all the vendors and the price is the best I have found.
B00M0FW6PA|3|Lovely material, easy to get on and off.  I would say true to size.  However!!!  This pant stretches out as soon as as you start walking.  Bunches up at the knees, very long.  Not sure if I&#34;m keeping it or not, trying to figure out how or if it can be adjusted somehow.   Ok update, decided to send these back.   So unless you have got really long legs, then go right ahead and buy them.  Even folding the bottom doesn't help.     But they are a lovely color and great fabric.
B00CJYK4HE|4|Well made, cute nightshirt. It's very comfortable. I haven't washed it yet so I don't know how it'll hold up.
B0033HU2CI|5|This t-shirt wicks, it is light weight and is perfect for summer. The pocket is an added convenience. The price is reasonable.
B00CUMOM0A|5|I first ordered an XXL hat because I had a hat from a different company that fit at that size.  This one turned out to be a bit too big, so I returned it and the company sent an XL size that I requested, it fit great, and I like the hat very much.  I got the Khaki color, but I might also consider a green one in the future.
B00XBI61FQ|4|I can't figure out how to get the light to work. Battery must be dead and impossible to open and replace.<br /><br />Great mask though and comes in a cool box.
B00FDQBXCK|5|greate~!! I love it~~
B00EQ797OS|2|The bodysuit looks great and garnered plenty of smiles and laughs.  However, my child was only able to wear it once.  After two changes, the snaps at the bottom began to fall apart.<br /><br />Aside from snapping a few photos, this item was a waste.
B003JSRUB2|5|Exactly what we wanted! Thanks!
B00GS51E1U|4|These are perfect. We needed them to cover a swim diaper for swim class.  They are not bulky or scratchy like ordinary plastic diaper covers.
B000MDIPXE|2|The dress is really pretty, but it's too long for it's size.  By the time my niece is tall enough for it, it won't fit, and she is not a chubby girl.
B00A3UUGMO|5|So if you look at the picture you'd think it's about knee length ...and it probably is if you're a tall girl ... but I'm not ... so it's mid-calf length. It has a bit of stretch ... so it fits. I was quite shocked!
B001A3Y8AE|3|Good looking quality sock, but does not deliver as the Drymax which comes in the same price.<br />As far as looks and fit they are great. But for walking around the house without shoes. For serious joggers, these do not deliver.<br />I suggest get the Drymax brand
B005HTB5L2|2|Too hard to put on bra with clips on straps
B00TRW038G|5|Absolutely love it! Well worth it glad i ordered it very satisfied and would definitely recommend.
B00HH5FDHG|5|great
B003AIKOWS|5|Cute cap - bought this to go with the long-sleeved overall.  Very cute and made of soft knit material.
B00FZR1FRK|3|Same Hanes you get at the local big box store.  They are not as well made as they used to be.  The elastic started to shred after a couple of cycles thru the washer/dryer.  They do shrink a little during the first wash.  Wish they were made like they used to be.  I can tell they will not last like the ones made five or six years ago.  Bummer!
B00K5LPAZO|5|Awesome dress. Just make sure you look at the measurements provided by the seller and NOT the ones Amazon gives you. It's very well made and looks very cute on. Would love to have one in every color.
B00FWVFVGU|5|Great item.
B00FEX1OFI|4|this was a great kit loved it and so did everyone at the party only prob is that you sweat like a pig in it and gets hot
B00DD0BCBA|5|Very comfortable, however, I'd suggest ordering it a size or two up. It will stretch (if ordered at your belt size) but it's a little tight.<br />Works fine and looks nice, though.
B00PR2UIOY|5|This dress is adorable!!! Even cuter than the picture! Looks good on me and that never happens!! Great fit!
B007KFZCSS|5|I got this for using my rebounder.  The description said no bounce and it is true.<br />It's also pretty comfortable.
B00G0AVO1I|5|I was unsure about buying one of these. I'm glad I did and I'm glad I got this brand. It is very well made strong hold and comfortable as any waist cincher could be. I hope it works over time. I recommend buying a size larger than you think you need. I am 5,6,, and 140 a size large is perfect. My seller is a good one.
B008AYFGOI|5|Pants run big but the costume is very good quality and looks great. A perfect costume for a theme party.
B00MO9PRYO|5|Great product with good price. Fast shipping. Highly recommended.AAA+++
B00CZ7QJUG|5|This shirt feels soft and it´s recommended to use in hot weather or sunny conditions, chains pictures looks nice , it have a black line over shoulders that llooks like i´m wearing no correct side of shirt...it´s a good deal.
B00ED7O95I|5|The advertising of the Look 10 Pounds Slimmer is true! I didn't end up looking like the model, but pretty close. It's comfortable and looks great too. Easy to swim in and even better to lounge by pool. The polka dotss are not at subtle as they are pictured but that's why I like it so much. Polka dots are great!
B00G0Q0GOI|1|This bathinsuit is made for a petite individual<br /> Not if you have curves or anything of that nature.
B003N36DDO|5|Very Pleased
B00TUC9Q7C|5|I was so excited to get this super cute suit for my little man. He looked so adorable!
B00AYPULRI|5|I'm a 36D, a 65 year old 36D not a young silicone D, but wanted to cover an unsightly scar from a medical port on my chest and continue wearing all my blouses without the scar showing.  There is very little support here but great coverage.  My solution is to wear a strapless bra underneath the racer-back.  The racer supports the strapless and the strapless supports the girls!  Great support and  scar coverage for a fun, youthful, BoHo look.  Love it and will buy more colors this summer wherever I find them on sale.
B00C3F1NPQ|4|They fit a tad smaller than I expected
B008F55KMK|3|comfottable fit for kids.
B0026P45ZI|5|I've worn this several tims since purchased and it's very comfortable. No pain or scratchiness around the ribcage or shoulders. I've bought 5 bra's in the past month and this is the only one not being returned! Thanks! :)
B00KWF8YJM|5|I love this!!! It goes great over sleeveless dresses or over a tank paired with slacks. I want one in every color. It does not cling but flows nicely against the body and is VERY flattering.
B00A17K0DY|5|perfect size and fit the quality is solid i run and ride daily and  these hold time and time again
B00CE3J3PE|4|I love this outfit! It fits my 10 month old now, so not sure if it will fit at 12 months, but dress is very well made and tights are warm and well elasticized. Adorable!
B009Q3WBH2|5|This shirt is Nar Braj. Just got it in the mail and put it on and now I'm bouts to vape out with the crew. Drinking and drag-ons Fo life
B00GOG5V6W|4|Classy looking and more compact than traditional wallets. Compartment configuration is much better than the others I have had. The price was a little steep for a wallet, but it is a quality piece and very functional.
B003F84NUC|5|fantastic!
B001IPAPT2|2|My friend had this case when we were traveling together last winter. When she opened her camera case on the bus, the SD cards stashed inside fell out and she nearly lost them. Look for a camera case with separate compartments for both batteries and SD cards.
B00CZ50FOO|3|Really cute hat but so huge it could fit me. My 5 month old can't fit it.
B00KQB3AUK|5|Beautiful color for me at least.  This material is different from the teal color one.<br />This was more thicker and it was silky.  It looked really big when I first got it out<br />but it fit just right.  I am 5' 4&#34;  150.
B00FM7PMGS|2|I bought a large and its very tight
B0018KV91A|5|Awesome shirt, I was excited for this to come because Im a huge black sabbath fan. T-shirt is beautiful, fits great, looks great.
B00A2F0ZH6|5|warmth feeling :)<br />they are so soft inside
B00VKVFTAO|5|Very long, the back was almost touching the floor in flats. (I'm 5'4&#34;)  I had to shorten it about 3&#34; and plan to wear it with heels.  BTW, there is a silver metal centerpiece at the neckline and no need  to wear a necklace, just nice silver earrings.
B00SZH4EFW|5|Perfect for the occasion, did not block my vision, and the satin tie made it easy to wear.  Highly recommend this seller and product.
B00553XL7Q|4|I tried one of these and decided it is now my favorite.  The price from Amazon<br />was half what I paid at the department store.  So I bought two.  My only<br />complaint with Amazon is that they ship somewhat slow.  Other than<br />that I buy a lot from the site.
B000JFCH48|5|this is a great t-shirt. it was a christmas gift for one of my sons.  it also washes very well and stay true to size even when drying in the dryer.
B00QNEOBC0|3|Does not look like a stack of money on shirt. You really have to look at it to realize it's not just a black shirt with wacky white lines on it. Slow bucks is a fly brand and this shirt was deeply discounted. I guess that's why
B0078614Z4|5|The item came in quick! I really like how it shines and its a good size. The only complaint I have is that it was a little dirty in the inside, but not too noticeable. I still like it, I thinks its cute!
B00TOVMAAY|5|Good
B007SWSQRC|5|We got our shirt and love it. We are having a Plants vs Zombies birthday party and we all wanted to wear shirts and this fit the bill.  Washed well and seems to be holding up well.
B00742XDOM|5|Very good product.  They are thicker and more absorbent than others I have.  Cute designs.  Would recommend.  Very good product.
B00ID3R4DM|5|My nephew wore this to my wedding so he could be the ring bearer. Fit great and were very kid friendly in terms of lengths and ability to adjust both tie and suspenders.
B00FN2JI08|1|these socks are ment for people with chicken legs. there nice but do not fit. they look long and cool but once u attempt to put them on ( which was hard) they barley go past your ankels, this product is no good and will never buy nor recemend this product to anyone!!!!
B00IOB84MI|1|It wasn't the color that i ask for
B0029F26EC|2|I have other Scala hats but with a smaller brim.  I didn't realize this one has a huge brim on it.<br />Description could have been better on line since there seem to be different brimmed scala hats.<br />It will be fine for gardening but no good for golf which is what I bought it for.
B00IVWXSI0|4|Returned the light weight sweatshirt.
B00501ANLK|3|Is too big
B00FFBN4HK|5|Loved the colors and the holiday feel.  Looks good with a white shirt and red sweater vest.  Fastener took a bit getting used to but worked fine.
B004KJETPO|5|Beautiful sport coat!
B00DNO3LW4|1|These leggings fit, but they slide down as you wear them.  I am constantly pulling them up!
B0007YR9MG|3|It fits OK in the cup size, but doesn't fit snugly under the arms.  It sort of sags open, almost like it had been pre-stretched.  Otherwise, it OK.  Color & pattern are very attractive.
B006OUNP8O|3|These briefs are quite large for a 6yr old boy. I mean, they can use it besides that<br />Quality 3 stars, you don't need more for a boy brief.
B00IVLPTJM|2|Kind of like an over sized scarf just saggy fabric.  To the sellers defense it is exactly as pictured, I guess I just thought it would feel nicer.  Kind of scratchy fabric.
B0038JOQMS|1|Will never buy from here again these socks are crap and will maybe make it threw one load or cycle of washing
B00HDA3DD6|4|very nice and goob quality
B00P0X9TMW|2|Really short! In the pic it looks kinda short so I ordered bigger but still so short would use as a tunic or pjs. Also in the pic her arm/hands cover wierd poofy sides.
B003HND8SI|4|I have two of these shirts.  I need long sleeve shirts for working in the forest during the hot summer months.  The long shirt sleeves protect my arms in the forest.  I encounter a lot of berry briars.  This shirt does a fantastic job of protecting me, while keeping me reasonably cool.  The construction and fit are excellent.<br /><br />There are two reasons I didn't give it five stars.  First, the shirt does not have a button down collar.  Second, I would like a better color selection.  I wear large long.  For that reason, I am not able to order the dark red shirt. In fact, of the color choices there are, I am severely restricted, because I am a large long.  I like shirts that are more colorful.  I have a rust and a moss colored shirt.  I can no longer get the rust colored shirt. For some unknown, reason men's color choices are usually of the drab variety: navy blue, black, brown, gray, tan, etc.  I would like to see a bright red, kelly green, yellow, and royal blue among the bright colors in this type of shirt.  All these brighter colors needn't be offered at the same time, but having at least one colorful shirt in the selection for a period of time would make for a fine addition.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I now have four of these shirts:  Moss, Dark Red, Stone, and Rust.  Three of them have held up well under heavy use and abuse.  I will soon find out about the fourth one, the Stone,  I wore the Stone for a day in the late fall, would not recommend it for that season, much too thin. I just wanted to know that it fit properly, it does.<br /><br />I still would like to get this shirt with a button down collar.  My heavier canvas shirts have button down collars.  These may be work shirts, but I still want them to look good.  Button down collars in my opinion make for a better looking shirt.<br /><br />As to the thinness of the material.  I look for this weight in material.  This is a canvas shirt that is ideal for summer wear. When the temperature is in the 70'sI wear it with a tee shirt.  When the temperature hits the 80's and above I wear it alone. When the temperature is below 70, I wear heavier canvas shirts.<br /><br />I need protection from two things: briars and the sun.  The latest purchase (Stone) was bought specifically for 90+ days with a full sun. I can only imagine wearing dark blue or black on a 90+ and the sun almost directly overhead.  I doubt I will ever purchase such colors for summer wear. Remember, the moss and dark red, become much darker when they are soaked with perspiration.  BTW, the rust colored shirt has faded from the sun, still like that color.
B00JZFZL0U|3|I wear a small and this fit was way too tight in the body and the arms
B003AU5VZQ|5|Perfect fit
B00LCWSPOI|5|Good price , nice looking tie
B0038IULDC|1|If you have a tiny, peanut head, this wig is for you. This wig came up extremely short in the back and barely covered my fringe in the front. I ended up throwing it straight away because it couldn't be returned once opened. Crappy!
B00LO0JFRE|5|Excellent style and great quality makes this a must have item.
B002QDERNA|5|I looked all over the place for a tie with blue and brown and I came across this one. I wasn't too sure about it since it was so cheap but it turned out great!
B002AQRPJQ|5|The work to weekend pants from Haggar are my favorite work and casual dress pants that aren't blue jeans. They are comfortable and can be dressed up or down. The fabric is thick and good quality, there is no sheen to the color which is great for business attire. If you live near a Haggar outlet check it out, these pants usually sell for $29 there and you can save yourself some money. The Cool 18 pants are nice too if you are on a budget, the fabric is thinner and great for summer time when you cannot wear shorts, the fabric does have a sheen to it but it's not too bad, I have a couple pairs I wear to work on those 100+ degree days here in the south. The Cool 18 pants can be had at the Haggar outlet for $19 which would save you a good amount of money compared to the work to weekend pants if you are on a tight budget.
B00FEJ6OR0|5|I love these socks! They are perfect for being cozy in the house without making my feet get too hot.
B00FEZTRKA|5|The shirt was delivered very quickly and packaging was perfect!  It was a little smaller than I hoped but definitely workable ;)
B00D8408YI|5|:-)
B00M0O1J54|5|Great quality swimming shorts! Very glad I found these on sale. High quality product, no lose stitches, vibrant colors, high quality materials, and fit right. Highly recommended.
B003N3UQEQ|1|If you hook in the front and slide it around, it scratches the heck out of you. The sewing on the hook side has the dreaded nylon thread and is so rough I ended up putting moleskin around it. Very very dissatisfied. Would not buy it again.
B00ANU2NXO|5|Cute dress. .... TRUE to size. ...fabric is very stretchy. ...love it. ..:)
B009RAE8NO|4|Fits my wife but runs small in the shoulders
B00167T8QS|5|good item
B00LJMOJNW|4|Hope I can get one that fits
B00HGRBLU8|5|I really like this t-shrit.  It's funny, patriotic, and looks cool.
B00BDVN1HO|3|I love the organizer, but the lights shorted out on one side after brief use & the lights were the primary reason I purchased this model
B00M8ZPV8G|5|It's everything I expected!  Lovely, warm flannel.  Well-made and comfy
B00IUAU7GY|5|Got rid of all my other shorts after buying these. Gonna buy one in several colors now. Great shorts!
B00JB2JFF4|5|Love this dress! Washed very nice. Got lots of complements. I am 5'7&#34; and wore flip flops and it hung over the top of my foot (I like that). Very soft. Just love PB!
B003M0PBN6|2|I purchased these jeans for there intended commuter title, as i bike to work regularly. After the first wash, on cold, the water resistant coating was completely gone. The one benefit to these jeans is the stretchy lycra feel that allows for great mobility compared to other \\"skinny\\" jeans.
B0089XEKFQ|5|&#34;dyed gusset to match&#34; thats my favorite part to these tights, because you need your gusset to match when youre kicking up your legs, no one wants to see some white patch there.<br /><br />Okay thats not the only thing I love about these. They fit me perfectly, are very comfortable as well. I love the convertible tights because some days I want to have them mid calf, and some days I want them full tights.<br /><br />I usually wear a medium in tights, but in these I went a size up per other reviewers suggestions and that was the right thing to do.
B00OI6IUB8|5|Perfect fit
B004GXA8RC|5|I ordered this bra because I already have one and love it--so I wanted two.  The size had rubbed off my first one and I mistakenly ordered the wrong size from Amazon.  I was able to return my mistake with no questions asked and reorder the correct size.  Good and quick service.  Thanks.
B00DSQU0JE|1|ick! Sooo ugly, not what I expected at all!
B00BWUF23W|3|The &#34;extra wide brim&#34; is a little too wide for me and the wrap is also too wide so there is a lot of &#34;wrap&#34; sticking out the back of my head.
B00A6SAV7I|5|At 60 years old, I finally found a bra that I absolutely love!! The style is so comfortable and has enough support and coverage.
B007KF1VZ6|5|I bought these for my son for school the sizing is kind of confusing but i read all the reviews and got the right size.  I love them they are nice and cushionny.  I have tried the ones from hanes from tArget and they are so thin and they get really hard and dirty.  I bought the ones from Old Navy and they run very small. these are the best and you can't beat the price.
B0076IW6Y2|5|I have been a longtime fan of Diesel and also have this same swim suit in two other colors so I knew this suit was going to be fantastic. Great color for the summer.
B00FJ5LW6M|3|Plastic inserts break quickly and the clasp does not hold when it gets any pressure from being full.  The aluminum is solid and its worked out okay but not as well as i'd hoped.
B00DCD90JO|5|this is a very comfortable shoe.
B00PN4YL44|5|Very soft and Light enough for these sticky summer nights.
B00CBSY4HY|4|The Young Hearts collection of clothing is very cute. I have bought several different outfits from this collection. The only thing I wish is that the material was a bit thicker for winter.
B00BF1B4EE|5|this was for the wife.. i think they look great.... Good quality fits nice. would buy again.
B007W4WK8M|5|I really love this dress, the color is gorgeour and very different. Its very comfortable although it can be a little boxy. It looks very professional perfect for work.
B00V2Z9EJK|5|I bought this to wear under some larger shirts (instead of a bandeau).  It fit perfectly on me.  I am a size 2/4, 32D.  However my daughter - who is a size 00, 34DD - couldn't get it over her bust - it kept riding up.  This tank would work for smaller or average sized busts but not larger busts.
B00DDSN7L0|3|This was a good looking costume. I bought it because my baby cousin is having a costume party and I thought this would be perfect since I like totoro. The shipping was good, it came faster than I thought. Although I give it three stars because it was HUGE on me. I'm 5'3 and weigh about 90 pounds and bought the smallest size for adults and it looked and felt like I was wearing a bag made of sheets. It was extremely baggy making it look bad on me. So in conclusion, I probably won't be wearing this to the party.
B00P0DQ5WE|5|So far so good, im 195, and 5 foot 7. I ordered a 3xl, when i first put it on it was really hard but now i can even get it on to the second row within 2 days! Its good quality, although i have nothing to compare it too since its my first waist trainer, but its really nice. I dont like that i cant machine wash, only hand wash. Maybe ill put it on delicate lol i dont want to hand wash that thing. But anyways im pleased. Dont order by your clothing size, i wear an xl in tops... its different for everyone so just do your research and find out what size you are, plus you can always return it or save it if its too small for when you decide to get it tighter. But anways excellent product! Will be buying again when i need a smaller size.
B0066SJPD8|4|Excellent looking hat.  Would've been nicer if ribbon and flower came in different colors, like white, to make it stand out.  It's had adjustable strap inside the hat to fit all head sizes.  I've received many compliments on the hat.
B00YAOEPY4|5|This was a hit with my son-in-law for Father's Day!!
B00KNWVTR8|5|Very flattering dress. Professional look for work.Add some bling type accessories for an evening party.
B00BU8Z3LM|5|I always hesitate to order clothes without trying them on, but took a chance based on all the positive reviews. I'm really glad I did because these are great yoga pants. Very comfortable and cute. They fit perfectly.
B00AZTRH9S|4|It was a bit big all over, kinda loose and sloppy.  But it is made well and of good sturdy material
B007KFSAQY|5|Excellent!
B00AOJGM7C|5|Was exactly what I expected! Very nice
B0042PY9L0|5|Keeps the cold out, nice and handy.
B00NT8JF0Q|5|Excellent product and great seller!
B00N1QHV84|4|not sure how much room I will have after giving birth..
B00D2L2VYC|5|High quality - fits great and wears well.
B006JYG5OG|5|Light weight and stylish. Fits good and sleeves are the perfect length. It also has a helpful adjusting drawing around the waist. Hard to keep clean though.
B00H3ZFNHU|5|My nephew loved these jammies!  Very nice to be so inexpensive.
B00282KOYK|3|Spikes fall to the side, won't stand up
B000PCMCDQ|5|very nice
B00E3J4JGK|3|this blouse runs smallish, the pockets seem to be placed too high. I would not buy again. a bit disappointed.
B00E0M3L3W|4|These pants fit as expected. The only issue I've had with them is that they seem to shrink in the inseam after washing. I wear a 34 inseam and they came long enough but have shortened a bit over time - but then, so did the dickies. So maybe I would order them in an extra inch or two. They are not &#34;high-waters&#34; now, just not as long as before.
B007T27LQS|5|Bought a pair for a week long vacation.  Wore them both while swimming and while walking around, lounging, etc.<br /><br />No issues with the netting being overly uncomfortable or with them being clingy or see-through while wet.
B008GE1MTU|5|This will be a good Spring coat , not real heavy, yet warm for early Spring.  I liked the style and fit.
B00G4CQNCC|5|Plush, absorbent, and snuggly warm.
B007A43V8W|3|the shorts look great and fit as you would expect.  I take an XL, thats what I ordered, and they fit as I would hope.  The negative is that the color in these shorts faded very fast.  Also, the mesh lining did not last long before it began to tear/shread.  Don't count on these shorts being very durable.
B000UJUJY8|5|I only wear Cherokee Low Rise Flare scrub pants. They're very comfortable and durable. I'm 5'7&#34; and I love the length of these tall scrub pants. They cover my ankles! I like the front drawstring with the elastic back. The color selection of this brand is incredible too!
B002B61D2U|4|Well constructed lab coat.  Sturdy twill fabric,stitching well placed and finished. Size is true in length<br /><br />although  shoulders,chest,and waist feel snug.[BMI 34} I have yet to wash item. Pockets are adequate<br /><br />in size and number.  Inside pockets would be nice. This is a real heavyweight compared to cotton poly-<br /><br />ester coats. I feel as if I'm wearing my &#34;dress uniform&#34; while as I round.  This is a good buy.<br /><br />  .
B002H8I3UC|5|The bottom line:  Great for airports and possibly other situations where you don't want a stroller, but you also don't want a child running free (or walking at the rate of a turtle).     We use this all the time when traveling through airports. My daughter is two, so we bring her carseat on the plane, but even when she was younger we gatechecked her seat through to our destination (we heard of too many situations when friends got malfunctioning or filthy carseats through the rental car companies). The travelmate made it so easy to get through the airport.  (note: be sure your carseat says that it is approved for use on the airplane - the flight attendants really do check.  It usually says it on the side of the seat, near the top.)      Why is it great?  * fun and easy travel method - my daughter loves riding in it. It's more \\"open\\" than a stroller, and she is a novel way of getting around.  I love it because she's strapped in through the carseat harness, so I can get through the airport much faster, without having to carry her, tossing her from hip to hip every 3 minutes.    * push or pull - I tend to push it in front of me so I can see my daughter as she gleefully throws her doll, water, and goldfish on the floor, but I could also choose to ignore the continuous stream of debris, and pull her behind me.  * easy to assemble - it took me less than 10 minutes.  You'll need a Philips head screwdriver to put in two screws, which are included (for those of you with similar levels of handiperson skills to me, the Philips is the one with the \\"plus\\" shape, not the \\"minus\\", at the top :-)    * easy to attach - To attach it to your carseat, you just wrap the straps through the seat and tighten.  Done!    * easy to collapse and take apart - the handle is like the kind on a wheeled suitcase and is easy to collapse.  To take off the carseat, simply unbuckle the Travelmate strap.   * can roll it all the way down the plane aisle - our Britax Marathon carseat can be wheeled (just barely) through the aisle of the plane (although aisle width probably differs across plane types), so we literally chauffeur our daughter to her seat on the plane in the Travelmate, unstrap it, collapse it and pop it into a bin overhead.    What don't I like?  * carseat strap issues - I have a Britax Marathon, and one thing that is annoying is the carseat latch attachments don't seem to have a home, so they naturally drag on the ground.  It's easy enough to tuck them into the back somewhere, but every once in a while a strap pops out and drags on the ground again.  Not a big deal, but annoying.  Also my husband insists on bringing the Travelmate on the escalator, so I am always terrified a strap is going to get caught (yes, I always take her out for those little excursions).  * you really, really can't hang a bag or coat over the handle.(I know you're not supposed to do that with strollers either, but who's kidding who?) I draped my coat over the handle, and the Travelmate immediately flipped over, with my kid flat on her back. (She couldn't stop screaming \\"again! again!\\" so any permanent damage was already inflicted prior to that little faux pas).  * wished for even more convenience - it would be great if I didn't have to detach the Travelmate before putting the seat on the plane seat or even in the car, for that matter.  I realize that is pushing the limits of customer requirements, but one can dream (I think some carseats actually do have wheels, just not the carseat I wanted).    To Buy or Not to Buy:  The first question is: do you need a carseat on the plane?  If no, then you probably don't need this.  If yes, then will you usually want a stroller at your destination?  If not, then you should get this.  It's a huge help getting your carseat and your child through the airport (assuming they will stay in it! my kid thinks it's the coolest ride ever.)  If you usually will want a stroller at your destination, then the decision is harder. I think the best way to figure it out is to ask yourself how you'd get the carseat to the plane if you DON'T have this. Then just pick the lesser of the two evils.       I actually can't think of anywhere outside the airport that I'd want this since it's so low to the ground and there is obviously no storage space like a stroller has (nor a coat hanger, as demonstrated earlier). I'd love to hear if others found a use for it elsewhere.
B00BUISAZS|5|Someone at work turned my on to shopping for scarves on Amazon.  I am so happy they did.  This scarf along with others I have received is beautiful.  It looks as pictured and the quality is fine.  Great prices and easy delivery.  Can't beat it.  I had very few scarves in my collection but now my wardrobe has a lot more style!  :)
B00ECUHE5I|5|very good, i expect the product was, the size was perfect to me, i dont see nothin wrong with this clothing.
B007PESS5I|4|My little guy loved them!
B00XY3AWPS|2|I don't like the material and for a large dress it is really small.  The size in China clothing needs to be standardize.  I usually purchase US medium or large and they fit.  This dress doesn't fit any at all.
B008YLOHUG|3|This runs a bit smaller than expected. Very tight in the arms. However it will serve its purpose over a tank top.
B00OPXK756|1|Um this is labeled incorrect. Says strapless & pure white & its red!?! What's the correct label here?
B000T381HW|5|Full support, not like other bras that claim to be supportive, but are clearly intended for smaller-busted women. Excellent, excellent support.
B00CB4MI9O|4|The blue jeans , watch  I am enjoying theme thank you
B00OV47AYK|4|Much larger than I remember a 3T.
B0030DFJ3M|5|I received a lot of compliments wearing thes jeggings. The color was rich, the fit was nice the sticthing at the faux zipper are could have used some reinforcing. All in all these are difinitely a good buy and great price
B00C0PF878|4|Fits perfectly, apart from the eye-piece. Kind of strangely shaped, and won't fit all eyes.
B00IV65U14|2|This shirt feels terrible. Although the image on the shirt is nice the material is not appealing at all. If these shirts were softer I would have bought more but I won't be.
B00GMCD494|5|This hat keeps my head so warm especially with the faux Sherpa lining.  With short hair I needed more than just a knit hat and this totally fits the bill.  Would love to see it in more colors.
B00DM7JZFO|1|Too Large & much too short
B00KKFQL5I|5|You're little man looks sharp and well matched. I buy these every year. They never disappoint me.
B00UBB5VG6|5|These joggers are great for big guys. I wear a size 38 and have pretty big legs and these joggers fit me great. Super comfortable and really nice quality.
B00MYB7CY0|5|nice item, good quality
B00KU0XMOQ|3|Nice fabric but runs small. I brought the size 14 for my 10years old and yet it looked like a size 8.
B009LKC3RS|4|A well made skirt in exactly the shade of burgundy I'd hoped for. Fits extremely well and looks excellent. Very versatile. Note: can get slightly static-y and sticks to tights a little bit.
B00HV60M2M|5|I ordered this and it fit as expected. It is low-cut but appropriate for the office thanks to the way that the pleats fall from the shoulders -- cleavage exposure is minimal even on a busty woman like myself!<br />I wish this were in a more hot weather-friendly fabric,though -- the polyester doesn't breathe so well. But it's super-comfy indoors and a flattering fit.
B001JM4U4U|5|comfortable
B00QO4KDBM|5|Excellent transaction. Very comfortable fit. Removable pads are comfortable. Don't be alarmed, however, when you take them out of the laundry and find the pads have folded over or even joined as one on one side. Easy to quickly put them back in place.
B004SWIY9K|5|This sweatshirt is comfortable and fits true to size. It does have ribbing on the sides, which I didn't notice from looking at the picture, but I definitely don't mind it.
B00DSSV5IC|2|extremely disappointed belt started separating on seams after only two times of use also notice cracks near belt loop holes. Belt worn less than four hours total. At this price I thought I was getting high grade of material. not the case
B0064C29H0|3|The wasit and hips fit really nice but the legs are kind of fat and unflattering, especially near the thigh area.
B009OKQHNG|4|OK- TIGHT LOOKING, MAKE SURE YOURE TONED!!
B00S0VBCI0|5|T He color is so much fun, the stitching,  very good...
B00822357I|5|just the perfect size, love the purple on the inside - soft, plenty of slots - awesome product - glad I found it plus its RFID which is even better
B00RFDAM12|1|Not the same red at all - not great quality
B00HWFA1JQ|5|True to size. True to color. Soft and stretchy material. Seems a good quality also. I ordered a size smaller, thought it would be big, but it seems to be true to size. Still it's totally ok for me. Think I'll purchase some more stuff from this label in future.
B002G9UEHC|5|I wanted a bill snow hat but one that was less d bag than most I see around town this one is for the working man than doesnt want his dang hat riding down his face fits great very warm
B0018OHCHG|5|This is a very nice pair of jeans.  Good weight demin and well made.  I had switched to Wranglers along time ago, but an now back with Levi's!
B008TSS6SS|5|absolutely.... anything angry bird...they should still produce this line...anything with this logo is worth buying shows definite team spirit and the force
B00BXPRKNQ|1|The pants I received were long rise (pant crotch about even with my knees) and not a regular rise. This make the actual length from the waist about 2 inches too long so the pants are not functional and they look ridiculous for someone of regular build. I don't recommend these because this sizing information is not disclosed either in the description on Amazon or on the actual pants.
B00410XSZ4|5|Good fit and works well
B002UKQKKM|3|I liked the colors (gunmetal against brown) but was disappointed it was just half a triangle.
B003IC0PVG|1|It came in upside down the whole suit was upside down and one day before halloween. The flap was at the top with the head and arm holes but the eight and crayola where upside down.
B0026GOODU|5|This patch is so cool. It is an &#34;iron on&#34; patch, which makes the application very simple and easy. I really like it.
B00EHMSDM4|3|I like the print and all the pockets, the coin compartment is nice as well but the exterior is just a tad distorted and has a strange texture but overall I think its worth it but if you don't really need a wallet I would pass on it.
B0046OA2M2|2|I only bumped up my grading to 2 stars because of the hat.  It takes an incredibly creative mind to see a Marine cover and think, \\"No. It needs to be more insane and ridiculous.\\" And then he went for it.  God bless you, anonymous costume designer.  Your bold design is a proud middle finger to the establishment.
B00NAIQ6KW|5|Love this skirt! It is well made and not to short as some pencil skirts are. I was concerned about the quality of the skirt since it is so reasonably priced. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the price and the quality. I will purchase another.
B00XEM6GM2|5|So much room in this backpack and it came in perfect condition!
B00FKWCKU6|5|It us a Christmas present  but I'm sure the recipient will like it!
B010W9TJTQ|5|Son loves his shirt. Thanks
B006MPCD16|5|The material is so soft and the type is just what I love, casual,cool and skinny.navy blue is also what I prefer
B008F6HWJ8|5|Sizing runs a little large, but the sweater is a great item and warm. We have not cleaned it yet though.
B00KOL5K2S|4|good color  combination , light and fit
B00DOWE7VO|5|Another winner from Tea Collection.  I always wince a little at the slightly higher pricing than my typical infant/toddlee buys, but I know its a good value for the quality. I also buy a little on the bigger size so I get a little more wear out of them.<br /><br />The patterns and colors have remained vivid through multiple washing (in HE washer, no agitator.. may have different experience with a washer that has center agitator, they're geberally hard on clithes in general), as does the gsrment construction.  Fit is typical. Cloth os a soft cotton. Certainly not the heaviest I've seen, but much more substantial than some other brands. You certainly can't see through the fabric holding it to light. Looking forward to many wearings.
B00HNG7PXO|4|I loved the first one so much I bought them in several of their colors! Love the style of this shirt!
B00JB5IYQM|1|Ripped apart
B005GYGEWS|5|Great quality.
B00JZ69DXK|5|Love it
B00J5SJYDM|5|Cute and stylish.
B00B79E2IE|5|Looking for boxers for my grandson, I've paid this much for only 2 pair of boxer briefs so I loved this deal.( I bought 2)
B005OKK64Q|4|There are a few of these online and I hesitated to buy as some reviews said it was cheap and poor quality. It's so cute and for people who live in mild weather places and love the look of hats and scarves but often don't have the cold temperatures to wear them, it's perfect. Just as it looks, the only negative thing I have to say is the scarf is a bit short. It's definitely shorter than a standard scarf which you can wrap it around the neck more that once. You can maybe throw over your shoulder or wrap around very closely to the neck as in the picture. Otherwise it's very nice.
B00CMEIGNA|5|I bought this for my adult daughter who LOVES pinky pie. The shirt came very quickly and I got it in time for her birthday. She was very pleased!!
B0085C8F1G|5|Very nice quality, good for winter
B00GHOFEYU|5|I have one on now, I like my shirts bigger, but they are for work, so, im pleased
B001FD34OU|5|Very cute. Very comfy. Fits good. Sometimes certain designs run a little small, like assuming a small means you're a size 0 or something. I'm small but not a twig. So I was happy that the small was an actual small.
B00C612Y5K|5|I like it very much, the only comment I have is that I ordered a large one and after being delivered I have been using it in the last hole.
B00NIMNPIG|5|Great looking shirt, true to size, very happy
B00N4076PU|5|Great sock, soft and nice size.
B00PDR0EB0|4|Beautiful heavy garment, but tight fit.
B00EB0Z190|4|They fit perfect and are light and comfortable for summer<br />My only complaint is that the left pocket seam sticks out a little bit.
B003AU5WEG|4|Slightly larger than expected. Did not put in dryer so can't say if it will shrink much.<br />Solid workmanship and appears that it will last a long time.
B004B7YLHG|5|These socks are great. I won't spend another cold Chicago winter without them. Super warm and look cool to boot!
B0010XTBU6|5|Good quality and made in israel
B00DYOUXEW|4|These are nice pants, but a little on the small side.They are comfortable, and look good.
B0044YQC1Y|4|It's good tie. It's nice and sturdy, it dosn't feel cheap or flemzy at all. The colors are little more vibrant than I thought they be, but it's still a good tie.
B00BB40O0U|5|My fiancé & I ordered these socks for his groomsmen for our upcoming outdoor wedding. These socks are VERY nice and look (and feel) expensive!
B00CQ3DRAO|4|Good for the price. When the fabric is stretched it does become see through, so I'm more comfortable with a slip underneath.<br /><br />*Now that I've worn it a few times and purchased other brands of maxi skirts I have to say this is by far my favorite. Because I'm long legged I have to wear the waistband unfolded, but that's okay. I love the drape and flow of this skirt more than the others I've purchased. I will definitely be getting more in other colors.
B000RRV9G0|4|I ordered this product for a student film I am making, and it's great! I looked all around for a realistic bear costume and a lot of them either look cuddly/creepy or like mascot costumes. This one is made really well and looks awesome.<br /><br />I've had mine for a few days and the seem by the zipper is already starting to tear, also it sheds like crazy the first time you wear it so be sure to shake it out or buy a lint brush. The head was kind of tight as well, but I picked at the foam (it was easy and didn't harm the shape of the head at all) and it fit way better and was easier to breath in it. Lastly, the company who makes these are impossible to get ahold of. I emailed them through Amazon and they never got back to me (there was some shipping questions). But I got it before I thought I would anyway, so it worked out.<br /><br />Overall the costume is great and is exactly what I was looking for.
B00DQJRAEQ|5|We have not used it since our daughter is not due till a few more weeks, but it is adorable!! We plan to use this as her 1st Halloween costume. The material is very soft and the colors are so vibrant. The skirt has a drawstring so it is adjustable from the waist. The diaper cover with the mouse tail is super cute, but it does look kinda big, but I do think that it can be easily adjusted with safety pins. The mouse ears on the beanie are perfectly round and they stay standing! I love it, cant wait to use it! Shipping was very fast too, took about 9 days to arrive!
B00NGVKF3M|4|Very comfortable, and an awesome look.
B007GB8EZY|5|We are big fans of Leveret 100% cotton snug fit pajamas, since we will not buy chemically-treated flame retardant pajamas for our son. The designs are classic and cute, with themes that appeal to toddler boys (trucks, helicopters, construction, etc.). We find these pajamas to be perfect for spring/summer, since they are lighter weight cotton, and we like that they are very soft from the first wash. These pajamas get worn 1-2 times/week in rotation, and we've found them to be very durable through many washes. They will be outgrown before they wear out. Since they are designed to be snug fit, they do run a bit small. Our son, age 2 1/2, 37&#34; tall, 31#, is able to outgrow the 3T size. We will buy Leveret pajamas till they no longer make his size. Hubby and I wish they had them for adults!
B008R50VMW|5|For the price the shirt is excellent, it fits correctly and the material is  very good and comfortable in a tropical climate.
B00I03RHJ6|2|to be bothered in sending it back, maybe someone will get blessed and have  a prom dress
B00QWA7XIY|5|Fit great. Great price.
B007T54VBS|5|Daughter loves it
B00HAU3528|5|I like that it is black and has Mario and I like that my parents  and friends like it and I am a big Mario and luigi fan they are freakin awsome
B00J580I8C|5|Lovely
B00CAHQUGY|5|So comfortable I just ordered them in another color.  Fit perfect.  Lots of pockets.  Best summer gear ever. I highly recommend them.
B0081HHHBE|5|This was exactly as pictured. Got it for someone who loves Hello Kitty and collects frogs!  Arrived quickly and safely.
B005MXHQXO|4|I found it difficult to purchase handkerchiefs locally.  So I searched online and found these.  They work well and I have no problems.  I will purchase again.
B00A65Z4W8|5|This sweater is STUNNING!  Fits perfectly, fabric is lovely, and it looks incredible.  I LOVE it!  I'm going to order more from this vendor.
B00E1MGD4A|5|granddaughter loves
B00B3PP5Q0|5|Got this for my fiance just because...and he loves it! To get it engraved, just email the seller and let them know what you want the engraving to say as well as the style writing you want it in. So easy and it came out great! We might have to get these for his groomsmen too...
B009XFD4SS|5|Beautiful graphics
B000YIGIXQ|4|the wallet is good, quality is ok, lots of slot for credit cards. reasonable price but the color description is a little bit off, i ordered a burgundy but it's more like brownish.
B001QK4RZC|5|Great quality and workmanship.
B00ESVMQ68|5|Love the color and texture. Looks like a good silk number. Easy, accurate fit. Impressive on the little man to be!
B005OFSL16|3|I work but I don't expect it last forever, I think the plastic material is gonna get damage faster. I haven't wear it yet, but I try it and that is what I can see of the product.  Kind of cheap but I expected something like that for the price.
B00C6TZNE6|5|We love this ugly sweater.
B00009QOQ2|3|it's an adult mask, pretty durable, but just a mask.  Kind of scary looking in person.
B00M9BJF0O|5|Super cool and so cozy. Mom and 6-year-old active son both love the set.
B005VCCYZ6|5|The colors are gorgeous. It runs a little big but otherwise appears to be well-made. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B00CW8XUCS|3|I like the PJ top, it's a nice color, I expected it to be roomy, but it barely fit with no room left over at all. Kind of skimpy<br />I had already washed it or would have returned it. Order a size up
B002WUNPPS|4|This product has fulfilled all of my expectations and I recommend it to anyone searching for a good, excellantly priced, travel vest.
B00UZFO4C0|5|True to size, it is a great dress to wear on a hot day.  Love the color combination of the bright pink and grey.
B00BZC477E|4|I absolutely love this coat, I live in semi-cold climates where it gets to the lowest about 20 degrees and this coat keeps me warm. It's not too short and not too long. I am usually a petite and I ordered an XS, but it fits a bit larger than I would like. The best part of the jacket is that it is well made and looks a lot better and is better quality than what the image shows.
B006PDNCZQ|5|I LOVE THIS TANKINI!!!!!!!!!!!! the fit is very supportive and comfortable. This is a great product for women who has a full bust line... I wish there were more stars to rate it because its very good. When I tried it on I was amazed on the support that I got... I would definitely be buying more swimsuits or even bras from this company...... Great Job!!!!!
B00A3PCMEY|4|The petticoat isn't the best quality but we should all know that paying as little as we do for these kinds of things. The hoop skirt is drawstring but will fit a very large person. I am a size 14 and there is plenty of room to spare. The skirt puffs up my wedding dress and will do for one evening but I wouldn't trust it after a few wears. It will definately serve the purpose I got it for.
B00UNKSM0C|5|Fits perfectly.
B00IPZKR28|4|Good fit, Extremely comfortable.
B00O29RORM|4|Nice pants, little thinner material than expected though.  Fit is nice
B005FR9WQQ|5|Love it! Bought 2 about a year ago wear them every day and they are holding up just fine :)
B0072DEWLG|5|Love this wallet. have been looking for a trifold wallet that has two bill compartments and this one is perfect. Good quality.
B00ESZCZY2|5|These are light weight material, but strong and durable. This is the second one i've purchased. The fit is tight, so great for trail running, kayaking, etc. Keeps you cool in hot weather.
B004EI8678|5|This bag is nothing less of the cat's MEEEOOWWWWW i kid you not if you buy this bag the ladiesss will be all over you sayin things like ohhh sweet bag!!!!!, i luvs it can i have yo digits!! but in all seriousness this bag rocks my socks it's really shweet.
B008BLN82M|5|Exactly what we were looking for!! Not too expensive in case she won't walk down the aisle and can be worn again to another function.
B001XON4BY|5|Works
B007M6DKC0|4|My daughter really love this shirt! It put an smile on her face when she got it for her birthday! I wish the material could be better quality!
B00OK9V042|5|My favorite!
B00NHQV7Q0|2|I love the actual thing but it collects way to much hair and it stays, I've tried everything.
B006PGGJOE|2|Too bulky
B00D3IK1SC|5|i love it! the color and the style is perfect.
B007R1OLUK|5|Graphic is depicted perfectly. The fabric is comfortable. I bought it for my boyfriend and he says it was the slightest bit small but he still loves it; a size bigger probably would've been too big for him. He has a very slim torso.
B00FJ02NIS|1|fell apart after a week of usage :(
B0017W1XB0|3|They're very comfortable but run small.
B009B14SA2|5|This was perfect. It came with everything you need to look exactly like flo on Halloween. My costume was a hit last year. Recommended.
B003SS0MHW|5|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. Shipping was prompt and the over all quality of the shirt is good. My boyfriend loves this shirt and wears it often. Two thumbs up, looking forward to buying from this seller again. :)
B00EC19SF6|5|I love it, my son is so cute in it.  It is very soft and warm.  We use it often.
B005H2FQPU|3|I love the tshirt though it is a little narrow so I probably would have gone with the bigger size.
B0034G65Q0|5|Cotton :)
B00505DX2W|5|It was a great costume for super hero day for my daughter for homecoming week. The fit was great and pricing was also great it meet all the exceptions for my daughter
B00MR4RN3O|3|Not what I expect. Color wise. Too thin. Small feels like medium
B00FB6J54A|5|nice!!!
B006L3V612|5|Hue no-show cotton liners are amazing. [[ASIN:B006L3V612 HUE Women's 4 pair pack Cotton Liner, Asst, Medium/Large (Size 2)]]  They do not slide off of my heel the way the Keds' version of the liners do.  With a size 9-9.5 foot, the med/lrg size 2 fits very well.  There is no tightness around the edges and the large silicone heel pad does a wonderful job of keeping the liners in place. As for the show/no-show around the edges of the shoe, these liners are cut lower on the sides than the Keds' version.  As such, they do not show as much on the sides.  The silicone heel gripper seems to work well after one machine washing followed by air drying.  In all, a great product.
B00JNMDVEI|4|I brought this bag for my friend for her b-day. I hope when i give this bag she'll love it. When i saw this i said to myself this bag look like her.
B00KABL9VI|1|Do not buy
B004071Z3U|5|Great Jeans! I love them.<br />I have many pairs of NYDJ jeans. I order them all from Amazon .<br />I have never been disappointed
B00K287WZQ|2|Ordered and received this top quickly.  I am a small to medium in every top I purchase - but this top, well, unless you have no chest to speak of, the size medium is, at best an extra small, in reality.  Terrible fit.
B0025UNGJ0|5|nice fit, cozy.
B005TNDSHA|5|My niece loves this, she wears it all of the time and looks so cute in it, it is just adorable!
B000KD44G8|2|They are extremely thin!  They have virtually no cushioning. I will be interested to see how they holdup in the future.
B000XMKBF4|5|soft cotton and secure fit
B00DXY08T8|4|These look great, I love Unionbay Jeans but this size 3 runs a little big, but I plan on exchanging them for a smaller size.
B00JXO1ZE4|5|Five Stars Works
B00GAZWGRY|5|I'm a bigger guy who finally gave up on trying to buy Ecko jeans (their website has basically given up) so I was in the market for a new brand. Enter Levi 511s as one of the highest rates pairs of jeans on Amazon. I went ahead and gave them a world and I am super glad I did. Some notes:<br /> - These jeans are definitely slimmer. They are made with a slightly stretchier material (not as stretchy as girls pants but still have some give) that pretty much keeps its shape after its been stretched out. You will definitely feel it slipping into a pair that is freshly washed.<br /> - Nice think material<br /> - Overall pretty tough. I did a bit of boarding in them which can really put a pair of pants through its paces but they held up really well to the pressure.<br /> - For this particular style, the gray is pretty close to the color in the picture even after a few washes.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that Levi 511s are my go to brand and style of jeans.
B00GBVSJK0|5|Good
B0089H12XU|5|Quick delivery! Love the show...love the pants!
B00LSF3HPQ|5|Excellent bag to beach... i personally use it for small one day trip.
B00IT82030|4|One of the rhinestones came out the 1st time I wore these and cut my hand....but the FIT and look of these allow me to disregard it. Thick, quality, sexy cute!
B00MCVFUZA|5|Bought it for my friend for his birthday and he loved it.
B00BNB36ZG|5|I really love this item.  How do they do it so cheaply?  It is a wonderful quality and I receive many compliments on it.
B00RCJVW4K|5|These suppliers were so helpful in getting me this dress in the short time I needed it in. The dress fits well, maybe a bit loose in the armpit/arm area. Love it though and received a lot of compliments!
B0038QUYJ0|5|The best part is that most people dont know what wriststong is from and the people who do, totally give my high fives. Yes! I wear it everyday.
B005ITU5OE|5|Before ordering, I read the reviews, both good and both negative. But it didn't stop me from ordering. I am in love with it. It's so soft, and keeps my head warm :) fits over my head a bit big but that just means more warmth for my head lol I love it and will always wear it everywhere
B00MGASV3K|5|I am in love! This is an awesome set! The towel snaps are awesome! I have always used ones with velcro and it gets stuck to other towels in the wash. This does not! The material is awesome. Who doesn't like 100% cotton? I also have short fine hair, but with a thick mass. The headband is perfect to give it a little omph while it is drying. All in all, I am very satisfied and absolutely love the set!
B00FRD4DQM|5|I like
B00BP6154S|4|This belt is just as listed. Very sharp looking and just the right size. The color is just what I was looking for. Great price.
B008MPV978|1|This product stinks like mold.  It's not even real leather, I didnt even bother to send it back, I just threw it in the trash.
B0018OM3WK|4|I love it but the size was too tight for me, now I do wear the exact same model of levi's jeans same size 31/30 and it fits me perfectly.<br />So I guess I will have to give it to someone because I'm traveling and I won't be able to return it for an exchange on time.
B00KVMNTBO|5|Very nice jacket!
B000UV3K4W|2|I have never been an X-Small ,but rather a small or medium in costumes, shirts, dresses, etc. This was was too big in the chest (I'm a full D but I have a smaller back so maybe that is why it was so loose). It was also way too long for anyone not 6ft. The boot covers came in 2 different sizes and one was ripped. The only reason I didn't return this item was because I had no time to buy another one. I had to hand stitch the rips and take in the corset part.
B000V1ZP9O|5|Ordering this belt was the first time I've ever purchased anything from Old Glory.  The belt arrived very quickly and we are pleased with the item and the price we paid for it.  Excellent shopping experience.
B007VX4VTU|4|Fits well.  A bit larger than the last sets that I've bought for my daughter, but they fit well and she likes them.
B00NL7GSDC|2|Cute and Comfortable...BUT I have worn it a couple times and what looks like a pocket on both sides is not..until the stitching came lose I cut them both open. real pockets sewn shut! Also, I ordered a size larger and fits great otherwise.
B00FS5DM7U|5|I find it is a little fat than normal size, so other buyer should be careful with that, Don't hope to add extra margin of your size.<br />But, for the material of the pants, very soft and elastic, this is very different wirh Lee's.
B00J5AW158|3|I do not like the fabric, or color, I thought it was darker and is a very pale and light orange.
B001P3054W|5|I love these bodysuits, they are cute! Good colors and right size for my baby boy and very good material. Thank you!!!
B003DKYK82|4|Not figure enhancing. Not much stretch... But fit is OK
B002QRBLUI|1|I purchased an XL knowing that the advertised length would fit my waist. The actual belt was 6 inches shorter than advertised. I cannot wear it unless I stretch it around, which is very uncomfortable. After looking through the reviews I can see that the lengths of the shipped product are not consistent or reliable.
B005LX6SSO|5|Excellent jacket, fit is as described. Moleskin liner is exceptional. My only complaint is the button's/button hole design makes it challenging to button up the jacket. The system used on my Filson Mackinaw Cruiser is much better, not sure why they didn't use the same buttoning system.
B00GS8K364|5|Very lovely dress. fits perfectly.
B000IEC9CU|5|I was very pleased with this dress. It was so much more beautiful than the picture! Definitely would buy it again maybe two a few sizes larger for future occasions!
B00P5WN7IK|4|Very nice way to dress up
B00N023426|5|Just as pictured, good quality shirt, great color and really good price.
B00P9QCHP6|5|I bought three scarves in different colors for Christmas gifts and I kept one for myself. The colors are beautiful and the material is soft, lightweight but warm. Definitely recommend and will be buying more in other colors!
B000IPYHCY|4|I have to emphasize the very high quality of customer service at Tai-Chi depot in the mist of shipping problems:<br />my order was lost twice by USPS and every time Alex at Tai-Chi depot went out of his way to solve the problem,<br />he replied almost instantly to any questions I had , after the first order was lost he refunded the shipping and an extra$10<br />while he was sending out a second order which USPS lost track of around Xmas time (I tried to track it with them to no avail...)<br />I was ready to give up and ask for a full refund but Alex insisted on giving him a last chance, he also would throw in a free single DVD of my choice,<br />so after I suggested UPS for shipping ,m he went out of his way to pay the extra shipping cost for UPS and<br /> I received the package in less than a week ....
B00KDCBOBE|5|It fits as it should..I just hope it does what I want it to do and that is decrease my waist size!!
B00OZWDCPO|3|This hat fits kind of large. The strap has to be tightened in the back to make it fit tighter which then makes the buckle in the back not centered. It also has some silver thread running through it which makes it &#34;girly&#34; looking. It is okay looking but not really my kind of hat, I wanted a more casual look but it will do for now.
B00IXVIV72|4|i love hurley for my son but this particular shirt is fading a little too fast for my tastes.  cute shirt tho
B003VZHEOG|3|Received the most hideous colors and not the ones shown!  Hanes panties are nice if you don't care about the color.
B00DM3YL34|5|Comfortable. Has printing on the outside on the belt line so you will know easier if they are inside out. Elastic seems as if will last a long time. I will recommend.
B004PHX9ZW|4|They aren't very breathable at all, but look great!!
B0029EBNI8|5|What can you say about a hunter and his passion? Well you could tell him that this shirt fits him perfectly and watch as he opens it up on Christmas and the biggest smile crosses his face.<br /><br />Yeah that kind of reaction is what I got. On top of that? I paid close to nothing and the quality of the shirt is surprisingly amazing.<br /><br />I call that a deal well chosen.<br />5 Hunted Stars out of 5!
B000EHNG5A|5|Got this shirt for my wife who pampers the German Shepherd, and she just loves it.
B00GD4H726|4|I spent forever trying to replace an olive green, waterproof anorak I bought a couple years ago. it was really hard to find something that was fashionable and *also* waterproof and I think this does the job. I'm 5'9&#34; and a size 2 and the small was a good fit length-wise and width-wise. It is a bit long, and I'm tall, so might be a bit too long for shorter people. Didn't really care for the gold all over and the front chest pockets but I'd mostly wear it open, rather than zipped, so you can't really see them. Good quality overall!
B00GFH9QTI|2|They ripped right away and my nails aren't even that long. And the crotch area doesn't fit right (legs aren't long enough on them, and I have short legs)
B00KHWUIK8|5|Very  comfortable
B00KU3IH70|5|Love this suit!  I've had 3 kids and this suit covers the stretch marks without looking like an old lady!  I wear a 36 b/c and the top was large but adding in the provided pads made it fit perfect and made it more flattering too!  I take a 12 Jean and the bottoms fit great!
B00EYNVUO4|4|I knew it was a possibility but I assumed (quality control) I would get two different colors.  Otherwise, the product is as advertised.
B00IGZFRJ0|2|It's see through.Expected better quality
B004I2IC9M|4|Nice gown, probably best for after baby is born. It runs big in my opinion so order carefully.The print was nice.
B00C9T32XW|5|This T-shirt fits perfectly and the thin cotton make it feel cool and nice when it's hot outside ( or inside )<br />Many of my friends told me that it's very very nice and looking good on me :)
B00LEJF9SE|5|Great Shirt,fast service
B00801Q3ZC|5|All of my Gadsden and Culpeper shirts fit great. They do not fade and shrink very little if any. Quality t-shirt.
B00KQJF0C8|5|Good quality, great fit, and really comfortable...
B0031C0Q7Q|1|I wore a medium in Grey's Anatomy Scrub tops and recently lost weight and was swimming in the medium. I ordered small, thinking it would fit, but it was extremely tight. I can not believe how huge the sizing difference between a small and medium. I am very disappointed as I love Grey's Anatomy scrubs,  but can no longer wear them, as I swim in a medium but can't breathe in a small.
B000F236W2|5|The robe is awesome, I love the feeling and the way it fits!!!!!!I would  highly recommend this item to anyone
B00LPHBKCE|5|Nice sturdy nylon underwear.There is plenty of four way stretch so it is super comfortable. The fabric is not the thin fabric I am used to with cheaper underwear. It is nylon like stockings but much more substantial. The fit is fantastic for my curves.My shape is bottom heavy and large thighs.  It doesn't dig in anywhere and it doesn't slide off or roll down at all. It doesn't show lines through the clothes. The seams don't dig into my skin and leave marks. The colors are just as shown.  It's perfect.I haven't washed it yet. If it lasts, I will buy more.
B000OWC1IS|3|Good support but not the most comfortable bra. The edges are stiff around the under arm and the overall fabric has no give. It compresses pretty well but doesn't give your breasts very good shape. This bra is definitely all function.
B003IC264A|3|Too large
B00DMWQKRK|5|Super comfortable; just bought, so  cannot comment on how well it will wear, but I genuinely love it, even if it winds up as just pajamas.
B009AFSJPO|5|I Love this Oil Skin Jacket. I am originally from Ireland, & for quite a few years, I have been trying to find one, as great as this one! I Love mine so much, that for my Sister's Birthday in July, I just ordered one for her also. Thank you! Beautiful Waterproof Jacket. Perfect fit. I ordered Large in both my purchases. A very happy, & satisfied customer. Deirdre O' Donoghue.
B00EYFMGMM|1|It was too big on me and ably if to be honest not like in the pic
B00FRKCZL0|4|Nice jacket but it was smaller than the size indicated. I would have gotten the next size up if possible. It is a really cute item.
B00JUM1DGY|4|The material is nice. The inside is comfy and warm. Fits perfectly. Unfortunately, I ordered Navy, but they arrived gray.
B0091OO4TY|5|Just what I needed.
B004XM2XII|5|This is a pretty rare Nirvana shirt, printed for a specific show (I don't even think this was a reprint, because there were only 4 [of various sizes, 4 total] when I bought this, and no more have come in). Anyway, I have an extensive Nirvana T-Shirt collection, and it was great to add this one to my roster.
B00MHGYD0I|5|Looks pretty much exactly as pictured. I used it for my maternity photo shoot and it photographed well. It's not high end by any means but for the price, you can't beat it.
B00GNZDWD8|1|Horrible fit and design, don't buy!
B00IM8BG0A|3|Nice heavyweight cotton T. The fit is right for an XL like myself except it is too long, had the length been a little shorter i would have given my Garment Dyed T shirt 4 Stars. The length on this T is best suited for someone over 6' tall.
B00P7K3BIQ|5|Got this cute bodysuit in size 6 for my less than a month old baby and it fits great with room to grow. Therefore, go a size up for a better fit. It washes beautifully and the cotton is soft.
B00BY3KQIS|5|Very nice,  well tailored, and different.  I can't wait to go on vacation on winter to wear it.  I love it.
B00639N68A|5|My daughter loves her belt buckle. It is a nice size for a 3 year old not to big but not to small either. The buckle seems to be well made.
B000WVTAI0|4|nice quality jacket for the price, but seems a little small. I would order a size up defintely!
B002GJPNGE|5|My daughter loves these. Great product.
B0043VDJPK|5|Cozy and perfect sized!
B00MMKH5U4|4|Great sock, with a plastic pearl on one side of the sock, not just knitted in. Great color, but a little on the large side.
B00MJFSJFW|5|SWEET
B005R1VP9M|5|Before getting this style hat, my children would rip  their hats off of their heads! I'd be collecting them off the floors of stores everywhere.  This hat stays on!  It was smaller than I expected, too small for my 20 month old, so perhaps it would be good for children 5-16months?
B00BJOSRVK|5|Nice material, fits great!
B00DQTNHWU|5|Excellent<br />Thank you very much<br />Looking forward to cooperate again
B000M8UR08|5|GF has 36.5&#34; hips so i bought her the small, They look super sexy on her and she says their super comfortable. Bought her black, white, and beige.
B00C7LGMSO|5|I purchased this for my 6 year old daugther who is tall and slim and the size 6 fits her perfect!  She loves it and looks adorable.  It seems well made and has held up so far through several washes.
B0030DFBZI|1|Never saw and got so wide D3 Dockers pants bottoms. Furthermore Amazon photos are positively misleading, for they show items identical to those currently sold on the Dockers site. Have I been really delivered genuine Dockers products, or otherwise are they twenty years old ? New and scandalous situation, beneath Amazon indeed.
B00DDXO1EC|5|I order on May 1st I received 15th it's all good and  fast delivery it's a very beautiful dress fit well I wear med.  and order a med.  and it fits perfect  I love this dress thank you
B0088X2HWA|2|I bought these based on the other great reviews. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Firstly, like one other reviewer said (as opposed to most), I do not recommend wearing these on their own. They are very thin and feel more like an undergarment. Second, they fit big. I bought the size small, so at 5'6&#34; 105 lbs I hoped they would work, but they didn't compress at all. Only a little bit at the waist. I would recommend sizing down a size, as the material is very stretchy and silky (and again, thin). I purchased these for compression purposes, hoping that with the amount of stretch in them, they would help with aches, but that is not their purpose. If you are looking for shapewear, they may work, but again I would recommend sizing down. I am not going to return them, only because I have to pay for return shipping and it isn't worth my while. Great price, but you get what you pay for.
B0079MGW5O|5|Cute shorts. A tiny bit small but they stretch. Would be true to size for kids, as an adult I wasn't quite sure. I got a large.
B000NA59JY|3|Perhaps I was looking for a miracle, but I looked in the wrong box.    When I got this, I was extremely excited from hearing the reviews and tried it on immediately.  One thing I can say is, make sure you're completely dry (after a bath or showering) before you attempt to put this thing on or you'll put yourself at risk of ripping it (or developing a serious muscle-strain).      I was somewhat dissappointed that the \\"firm control\\" wasn't quite as firm as I'd hoped--although that was more a problem with my expectation than the product itself.  I'm not overweight or obese, but I'd hoped to hold in some of the extra skin (leftover from pregnancy) from hanging over the top of my new skinny jeans if I wore a form-fitting top.  Unfortunately, as you can probably guess, there was still a bulge present--although it was a bit smoother.  But a bulge is still a bulge, and I detest a muffin top.      It does work well under a dress if the skirting is long enough to hide the mid-thigh cut-off; and it was comfortable to wear even under the jeans.  I managed to wear it for extended periods of time which did require a little acrobatic manuevering in the bathroom.  I found (forgive the details, but you'll want to know this) that the best way to use the bathroom is to pull the fabric taught on the outer side of both buttocks as you sit down.  And hold it there while you slowly relieve yourself #1.  I would NOT recommend attempting the other bodily function, I have not tried this for fear the hole is too small.      One last thing, if your jeans are \\"skinny\\" be prepared for some roll-up when you pull your pants up after using the bathroom.  I'm sure some people in the other stalls got quite a kick out of my jig performance, but I eventually got it all worked out in the end.    Aside from my humour, I'd say this product is okay.  Just don't expect an instant miracle (there is no fool-proof substitution for a good workout or lipo).  As long as you keep in mind the product's limitationsand how to use it, you will probably find it does a decent job for smoothing out the lines.  But no, it will not keep everything sucked in for a perfect figure.  I'll let you know when I find something that does!    Please note, I much prefer the bodysuit with legs vs. the plain bodysuit.  The legs assist in avoiding a pantyline while the bodysuits from multiple manufacturers seem to give me lines no matter how loose I pull it down.  Although with the bodysuit you can at least use the potty without a problem.
B00IQAOU2K|5|Excellent, I did purchase a pair of grey draw string pants the price is reflected in my balance but I haven't received the product!
B0051U184Q|4|Love these socks.....
B00JQUMYZE|3|Small around hips. Good quality materials  for the price
B00550QGGW|3|First time I have tried this brand of bra.  It is a little too padded for my taste; did not realize that it even was padded.  Feels nice to the skin, but I could have ordered a 36D and it would have fit around better. I do like the quality of it.
B00EALWNYG|4|Returned product. Not quite what I was looking for
B00HSGJ6RW|3|The sweater was too large but the merchant was accommodating about my having to return it.
B00D9NS692|1|About two sizes too small. I order a whole size larger than what I use and was still small.
B00M7XHZWO|3|As it is made for the Chinese market I expected it to run small. I'm usually a size 6 and ordered the XL. It fits my shoulders, a little tight in the waist and just a hair too long on the arms. The skirt is way too full (I wasn't planning on wearing my Georgian belle hoop skirt with it) but that's the intentional design. I was concerned about it arriving in time for my costume event and the seller responded quickly and kindly. The buttons are all very loose but I will replace them for my costume. And it's certainly fine as a lined light rain-coat. The navy is very dark.
B004UO1VKU|3|Doesnt stick well
B003C0EKZG|5|High quality, high SPF, good looking
B000KF2E9U|5|Feeling a little frustrated and being the kind of joker that I am, I decided to send the Board of Directors at Amiga Inc a gift saying how I feel about the current situation in the Amiga Community.    Don't be surprised if Santa does the same thing guys.
B00VWNTCXK|5|I love this jumpsuit I have some many people asking me where i got it from<br />The fit was a little big but overall i love it and would buy again
B001MA1Y9S|3|The material does not hold up as well as I would have liked. After about two weeks of wear the fabric has started to have a different texture which is not as soft and any lint within a 6 foot radius seems to get stuck to them.
B00GD3QDRW|5|Very cute and hip....lights up brillantly!!!!
B00EU7AQCG|5|This is a very comfortable bra that I will wear a lot.  It looks great under clothes and has soft material with good support.
B00PYTX2XE|5|perfect fit I would order again it goes well with a dark denim jacket.maxi skirt.or just layereing thanks
B00I5QXNBY|5|Super comfy also
B00DRUYLF0|4|Definitely runs small. Love the coat. Just make sure you order a much bigger size. I ordered an XXL and I am a size small to medium. It is still a tight in the under arm area for me but I still wear it. If you have long arms this wouldn't be a good coat because the arms on mine are a little short. I am 5'6&#34;. The arms a little short but doesn't look horrible.
B002DWTNU6|5|It's Carhartt.  It's great.  'nuf said.  have to write 20 words, so...  ...if you've never tried Carhartt, do so.  Loose fit for working, high quality for value.  Outside the U.S., it's a fashion brand, too.
B00EYXEVTK|5|Great birthday gift
B00MIJV0YG|5|good
B006JH82CQ|5|Good solid material & size which seems to fit me really well.<br />Sold as advertised.<br />I have used Dockers & the quality has always been excellent
B005SW59CY|4|Got to love these, quick shipping, exactly as expected
B00ERKMM82|4|Sizing worked how the other reviews said it would. Fits in the waist but legs are a bit baggy but it's fine for our purposes. I would get again at the price.
B003KQ696A|1|The quality is great however it's not really a watch cap it's way too big for that it's a large beanie with a fold, not a watch cap.  Does not fit correctly.
B001XJBP3I|1|This bra has absolutely no support. It needs adjustable straps at least. I'm a 36DDD and when I received this it was loose fitting and unsupportive. I think it's made for small busted women.<br /><br />You'll have saggy boobs if you wear this.
B00422MCW6|5|This wallet is absolutely amazing. Its lightweight and had a lot of card and cash C%C space available. I would recommend this wallet to others.
B004V3HO2Y|2|Belt fit fine, was not happy with service person, told me smell was a coating put on by the people that made the belt! Told me to leave it outside for a few days and the smell would go away! That's BS! I live in an apartment, if I left the belt outside it would disappear!!
B005H3BT46|5|Got it for my 11 year old sister and it fits her head well (it also fit a plush Olaf from Frozen that I gave her with this on it).<br /><br />It will be snug for an adult but that will just add to the comical nature of it.
B00LZY1ZR2|5|Vert good
B00IYV2KGO|3|Got it on time, 2 days, only reason 3 stars is when I opened back zipper pocket, the seam was ripped so I can see the inside of the purse.
B001O9BEKQ|5|GREAT
B00HN3OR88|4|I wear an 8 but ordered a 10 and it is really snug!  I really like the style of the dress.
B00DKSVPOE|3|This jacket looked great, fit great and made my friends jealous, however the fabric is light and cheap but comfortable. The buttons aren't quality and it took a while to get here. I wasn't happy with the durability or the fabric but if you just buy it for cosplay or something cool to walk around in then it should work but if you wear it to free run in then it won't hold up or if you wear it for a substantial amount of warmth then I suggest a better jacket.
B00I2ZBJQY|4|I know it's a man's baseball shirt, but you don't find too many of these in women's clothes. Fits rather well and the colors are nice. Love colorblocked items!
B00CRWUVXA|2|Kid's pjs with flame retardants, when there is so much controversy over their safety, I would have expected that at least there was a warning on the site. At least there was info when it arrived. I am promptly returning it.
B005P5QB0I|5|Bought for my adult son,thinking that it would look good on him. Turns out it looked great on him and he love the look!!! Better than wearing a baseball cap all the time.  He plans on buying more  in  different colors.
B002FRHHE8|4|I purchased this item a few weeks before Halloween. When I got it I laughed so hard. It was perfect! The only complaint I had about the wig was that the pouf was a little too high. Also, the hair where it is lifted is thin. I tried to brush it as best as I could but there were still areas where you could see the netting where hair was supposed to be.<br /><br />Ladies... I tried to flat iron it a little bit but it did not want to take. The hair comes almost ready to wear. You will need to brush it out a lot before you wear it.<br /><br />I wore the wig for an entire day at work. The wig itched a bit and it started to get heavy so the wig moved around a lot. I had to go into the bathroom multiple times during the day to re-adjust.<br /><br />Now, even though there were a few things wrong with the wig, I still looked just like Peg Bundy!! I won the costume contest at work...and it was the wig that put me over the top!! So, if you don't mind adjusting the wig a bit and brushing it a lot then this would be a perfect addition to your next costume!!
B006CQYDHC|5|comfort and beauty sometimes don't go together but these panties are the best I have been using them for many years and they last a century, lol well I got some from Vanity Fair for 10 years and they haven't lost the elasticity on the waist and legs. Wash after wash they look the same. You will have to throw them out of boringness.
B000RN753U|1|I had heard so much about how wonderful Le Mystere was supposed to be, mostly fueled by Oprah's Favorite Thing designation in the past--so I finally splurged and ordered three different Le Mystere bras at the same time. I was stunned at how inconsistent the sizing was with both band sizes and cup sizes varying wildly. This particular one had reviews that were very favorable PLUS some that were clearly not--and, unfortunately, my experience matches the negatives. While this LOOKS attractive--even out of the bag the material felt scratchy (lace does not have to be). The band ran WAY too small for the 38 I ordered--my standard size in almost any brand and by measurement--and the material on the edges instantly irritated my skin AND the band at the back is way too narrow for this size so rather than causing a smooth back--it cuts into the skin too much. Definitely wouldn't be worth the money for me as neither the fabric nor the fit were what would be expected at this price. (Side note: I ordered three styles in the same size and the variations in sizing was amazing--even though all were full cut.)
B0036BD304|1|Looks more like a dragon fly then four leaf clover. Also the material is more like a gauze then cotton. We did not use them. They were poorly made and ugly.
B0129CYEEY|5|Perfect fit!!!! This looks so good on me of course I am thick and i love how it fits so comfortably and it makes my body have an hour glass look! Great price!amazingly bueatiful for us bigger girls!!!thank you!! Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a thick hour glass look!!!! Very nice  elegant and sexy all in one!! I had no.problem with the size it fit perfect
B000TA8LJ8|5|Great sock for work boots, better then the carharts
B000QFPXH4|5|Great - as expected!
B0091WCA06|5|This is a quality t-shirt. Printed on a heavyweight shirt. It's also seeks out my fellow &#34;Arrested Development&#34; fans. One gu asked me if I owned the Bluth Company. But those who recognize it always have a comment which leads to an &#34;Arrested&#34; discussion. I love wearing this shirt. It draws out my fellow Bluth compatriots.
B00GGISQGU|5|It took a while to get here, but it was worth it! This one looks and feels as great at the purple one. It's been a warm spring up north, but when there are cold nights out, I'll be ready!
B00FRB5YJ4|5|Great and adorable dress. Actually goes to my daughters knees, which is hard to find! Really soft fabric too.
B00RD5SRRI|5|Excelente producto.
B005OS4Y2S|5|Party on
B00J0615ZO|3|Clasp on top comes undo easily, but looks use and like the colors. Slightly brighter in person than on screen.
B00ATB3CPK|5|The material is nice and soft, so the shift was comfortable to wear. The wordings are a bit rubbery. I have no problem with that, but I dunno about you. Cheers!
B00O91W8V0|3|White isn't bright enough on such a light gray tee. Should be darker gray fir white print to show up. It is not as dark as in picture.
B00CJ3SADU|1|Looks cheap, I would not recommend this shirt to anyone.
B00H46N5FU|4|They stay on my feet and keep them dry.
B00B2PO4MW|5|I have very conservative tast, so I thought, &#34;How great could this be for $60?&#34;  Turns out the sewing is perfect; the liniing nice; the fabric nice and substantial.  Just cut off their little black bow, and replace it with a real balck satin one you tack on in the same place, and you would NEVER guess this dress didn't cost much more. It doesnt need a full slip...just let the fabric fall along your own curves.  Paired with black patent pumps, it's really lovely.  I found it fit true to size.
B00KT6MP8A|4|Waist and length fit pretty true, but I found them rather tight in the thighs.
B00GC5MMPS|5|Comfy
B007THTNPK|5|looks great with dresses, which is what I bought it for. Stretch makes it fit great yet movable and comfortable
B00K0KCMIS|4|My six year old daughter loves animal print and fell in love with this coat. Going off just the Amazon pic (wish there were reviews or more description), we ordered it. The faux fur is exquisite - tremendously soft and comfortable. Good quality I would expect of Calvin Klein product. I was hoping this could be her winter jacket; however, I'd consider it a medium-weight. Therefore, it is not thick enough for winter...but my daughter can't bear to part with it and it is quite luxurious at a reasonable price (I ordered at a 20% discount time), so we're keeping it.<br /><br />My daughter is 47 inches and the (6/6X) coat goes to her knees.<br /><br />All-around great coat; I personally just wish it were thicker and would love to see thickness/weight in the description. Hopefully this review will help someone wondering the same.
B00ZWND3RM|1|Way too small.
B00AKF7ICI|4|We live in WI and the winters can be pretty cold. This jacket if perfect for our average size 9mo old boy and it keeps him very warm. The only drawback in the cuffs are a little tight so his mittens are very hard to get on if we put them on before the jacket so it doesn't really work well with mittens that are bulky. All in all very warm, well made, and not too bulky for the carseat. Very happy with our purchase.
B0083SW1XU|3|Nice neutral shade.  The material doesn't feel as soft or as stretchy as Silver's blue denim jeans; I guess that's why they specify this as &#34;twill&#34;.  The cut is similar to other suki Silver jeans.  The waist fits tighter than my Silver suki blue jeans of the same size, but that may just be because I haven't broken this in yet.  I wouldn't call this &#34;high rise&#34; though; it's mid-rise at most.
B009Z6XAES|4|Pretty color but, more of a purple hue to the pink instead of the baby pink I was expecting. Not very warm, still cut though and I like them.
B009O9HYXE|4|Very nice fit!
B00BNBD75K|1|All three boys refused to wear these out of the house because they were &#34;prickly&#34; or &#34;pokey&#34; or &#34;itchy.&#34;  Had to buy another brand.
B00F98TOWS|5|These are very comfortable and don't slide around in your shoes. I highly recommend that everyone owns several pairs of Thorlo socks.
B00GS02WV6|4|Beautiful Coat especially for very cold weather.........I am usually a size 10, sometimes a size 12 in coats as I have wide shoulders. I could barely get  the coat on and ended gving it to my dayghter who is a size 6 on top and 6-8 on the bottom. she looks beautiful in it .  My suggestion is to definitely order 2 sizes up, also another minor negative was it took a very ,very long time to arrive  Over all a stunning coat.
B006Z8IBDE|4|Shirt fit great.
B0015PKB08|5|These are great socks and they fit my size 9.5 feet perfectly.  What I want to point out, because the ad and photo are misleading, is that you get SIX pairs.  I was expecting only three.<br /><br />If someone has really long gunboats, like 11 or 12, I think they'll fit, but they'll be more stretched out, so not quite as thick feeling.  I love the thickness on these.
B00GW2OWWW|2|The problem is that I received an item that has no fleece. I wanted to buy it to send it to Chile, a country where it is winter now, but the leggings I received seem to be for summer. The fabrics is completely different from the other one.
B00I5115AK|1|This dress was too big for my daughter and the  fabric was not how it looked like
B0064X6ZU6|5|I always worry about how something you plan to wear will look when you are unable to try it on before buying it. I was pleasantly surprised by how really nice this dress fits. I wanted something besides the nurse's uniform I usually wear at WWII events, and this is prefect. I would even wear this for non-reenactment occasions.
B00HRH3038|5|Very comfortable shirt. Great graphics.
B009GWY7NY|5|Not only the warmest gloves I've ever owned, but the easiest to handle things like my telephone in the snow. Or smoke a cigarette and handle my ski poles. I love them.
B00GKABJCC|5|I recently purchased this dress at a store, and loved it so much I came to Amazon to see if I could find it in another color and sure enough I found it and paid less here at Amazon!  This dress is simple, yet SEXY.  You can dress it up or down and it's so comfortable you'll forget you have it on (lol).  I don't usually buy the same dress twice, but this one in various colors is a must.  I recommend this to anyone looking for that &#34;go to dress&#34; whether you're going to work, to church, to party, or just want to feel good.  I was amazed at how quick I received it as well...that Amazon Prime is amazing, I got the dress in 2 days, just in time for a weekend outing.
B00OCD7E8C|4|The t-shirt itself is of good quality.  It is a decent thickness, the graphic seems to be holding up well thru washes, and the shirt maintains its size after washing.  This also got lots of good chuckles for my wife who is a teacher who wore it during a Tshirt day during their school's spirit week.  She says her kids still chuckle and go &#34;Sshhhhh&#34; as an inside joke to her.
B002PAR86W|5|This is a nice belt and has a nice buckle on it!  It is made of a thick canvas!
B00J7LAWME|5|It's so hard to find boys elephant PJs for kids! These are perfect!
B007ZTLJMM|5|This wallet is so cute! It arrived in the mail along with the purse I purchased fast. It's perfect! Everything fits in it just right. You can't hold on to too much change though since the change compartment is rather small, but that isn't a problem for me at all!
B00LQL11P0|5|Great quality coat! I'm hoping to get coat in other colors.
B000G8DTPE|5|I love this brand, superb material. They look invisible on me. Excellent customer service, I received my hosiery within less than a week after placing order. I plan to repeat my order and tell my friends.
B00Q8V35T8|5|My 11 year old daughter loved it!  The muffs are super warm and cozy.  The band durable and not too tight.  My daughter is very picky, and wore these ear muffs whenever it was cold enough out.
B003EBDVXK|5|Love it love it love it!
B006ZQW9R0|5|I like it a lot. Its comfy and not too tight like many other beanies I have bought. Get it
B00R4IBXM0|5|This fit amazing on me!! I am 5'1 115 pounds and it literally fit like a glove! I wore this to my 30th birthday party that was Gatsby themed, ordered the gloves and necklace from Amazon as well. I got compliments all night on my outfit. I did need to pull the dress down a number of times, but that was to be expected with a stretchy material dress as this one was. The order arrived on time (prime account), it was packed well; I was even provided packaging in case I needed to return the item. Kudos to the sell, I would definitely buy from them again!
B004MC72EO|5|I love this shirt..I get lots of compliments and smiles while wearing it
B00SMAASGQ|5|Little long, but I like it, I shortened the length and it's ok now
B000ZPOZQ0|4|Somewhat thicker material than other brands;<br />waistband resists rolling better than Fruit of Loom;<br />hems at leg bottoms lie flatter that Hanes.
B00LJV84WA|5|Great
B00OAZWZHC|5|Love, love, love it
B001FFOE6K|2|Label said size is medium but size when compared to the other color is one/two size bigger. Inconsistent sizing. Very disappointed.
B000M9LQ20|4|It is exactly as described.
B00GOIEDVO|5|Bought this shirt for my 13 yr old son for xmas. He loves it. Price was right too.
B00GYX1YZ2|5|I bought this tank for my husband (he is a runner). He likes it so much; asked me to order a couple of more. Light, wicking great, comfortable for running, he said.
B0051EDBYM|3|Waist too big & too baggy through legs
B008EMDCPQ|5|I first tried these on in the department store just to see how well these overpriced jeans fit.  I have to admit they were the best jeans I ever put on, but I didn't want to pay that price.  So I went online to find them cheaper.  Now I have a pair and they are the most fabulous, comfortable, slimming jeans I own.
B007N7KRUG|5|Hands down my daughters favorite dress. The material is so comfortable. The bottom twirls around which they love. They can run and just be kids in this dress. Washes so easily, don't have to worry about wearing it every day...which is what my girls like to do. I have it in three colors!! The perfect dress.
B00HK3RFYE|5|good quality, a bit through looking, delivery time perfect
B0043REAJ8|5|was worried that this wouldn't fit as it has \\"Juniors\\" in the item title, but i am 5'4\\" and weigh 135lb and it fit well.  was going for the fitted t-shirt look and i got just that.
B008BFJ6F6|1|Replaced the returned Isotoner gloves that I gave for Christmas with these same brand gloves.  These were starting to fall apart when taken out of the package.  Return was easy and Amazon is sending a third pair..  I hope the poor quality of these gloves is better on the third replacement pair.
B009ODYB6S|5|I bought this shirt for my daughter to wear to Bronycon.  She loves it.  She is hard to fit, but this shirt is soft and roomy.  She is so happy with it!
B00BT1Q15C|5|This dress is so cute for the price, ad fit perfect! I'm 5'4\\", 95 lbs, and I ordered a small. I'm always worried that strapless dresses won't hold up on me, because I'm small-chested, but this dress fit great! Not too tight, just cozy. I will definitely be ordering more from this particular brand, because for me it comes down to comfort, appearance, and most importantly, price! This dress gets five stars!
B00CYRIMSE|3|Beautiful shirt. I usually wear a 2x - 3x and thought Id better buy the 3x but really wish I would have gotten the 2x or even a 1x might have worked.
B00BYN0MUK|4|This dress fits true to size. It is very flattering and made of a very comfortable material. The dress seems to be fairly well made and I am happy with my purchase. My boyfriend absolutely loved the way it felt and the way it looked. It's perfect for date night or a night out with the girls.
B00KIWDG5G|3|Hard to keep the straps in place.
B00PYYSZ2M|3|Didn't exactly care for the way it fit. Sat really low on my head. Only paid $10 for it so oh well.
B00C2DJ8YC|4|I ordered it a size too small.  So I ordered a bigger one and will give the smaller one to a family member
B00OTG714Y|4|It looks how the picture shows and I got earlier then the estimated delivery date. It fits little tight on the inside so doesn't hold very much and one side with the card slots were sown crooked so nothing would fit in it. But besides that it looks great and is actually real leather. Its also very durable.
B00U889YYW|4|great coat, warm and dry.
B003VQQZM2|5|My boyfriend got this dress for me, from Amazon, for Vday and it is absolutely amazing!! The dress fits like a glove, zips up nicely, and does so much for my figure. He ordered a size 5, i'm about 110 lbs and it fit PERFECTLY! amazinggg! i may just start purchasing more from this product line. =]Very very satisfied!
B0077QBVNK|2|The picture shows a slip style but upon arrival the length is more like a camisole. Still useful so not a loss but not what I thought I was ordering.
B00A7QUENA|4|Extremely soft and comfortable!  Only thing is I have a longer than normal torso so wish it was a little longer, but still fits wonderful!  Definitely buying more!!
B005CPQRD2|5|My wife bought it for herself and here is her review \\"I bought the Red one and I loved it. It's so cozy; so perfect to snuggle under on a cold or rainy day .. it's so soft, sometimes our 5 yr old son loves to use it as a throw .. \\"
B00L375BSK|3|This delivery was great and so is the wig. The only thing was I thought it was gonna be FULL lace. But I can work with it. Thanks!
B0087B3HMM|5|We LOVE this little fleece jacket. True to it's size, soft, and a good combination of colors! Perfect for cooler days when you don't need an actual rain jacket/coat. Fits well under coats/jackets as well. Will definitely buy another one in the next size up when the time comes!
B004759MA8|3|The custom is really short. We ordered first the small size. It was very small and too short. We sent it back and requested an exchange to medium size. We had to pay the shipping cost for both way ($12). The shipping of the medium size custom was fast but the difference between small and medium size is so minimal that you can hardly recognize it. The custom is still too short but we gave up. It is not worth to pay again $12 shipping cost.
B00AB7SZ3G|5|FANTASTIC. Unfortunately I lost one of mine and ordered another brand to replace these. I tried the other brand then I promptly ordered a new pair of North Face e-tips and am happy again!
B00B93US6I|4|I bought two of these, obviously I love them :)
B00FQWJTZO|1|Size 3x fit like a medium. It was made cheaply and the size was really too small. Gave it away!!!!!
B00KHHWDEM|5|Shipped quickly and package came intact.
B003AUOUVW|5|It fit great and looked great.  It was a perfect outfit for me to dress up in for my daughter's Halloween party.  She was so excited that mommy was dressing up a witch.
B00BSNB4T4|5|Beautifull
B00ARBTQA2|5|It is very nice and looks great.  I was happy to find a small size.
B00I80VEZE|1|this skirt is as thin as tissue paper :(
B00KXMZJLU|4|Nice pants, but sizing is off. Had to return for a smaller size
B003OBZ02K|5|This was for my grandson. The bag is as cute as it can be but small. It is perfect size for a couple day stay.
B00C03IRDM|5|This is a great gift for anyone, as long as the person knows how to use it. It's pretty sharp and heavy. So be careful.
B00OLLW8JA|5|Bought these for my fairy wedding and for the price I am so happy with them
B00HLRHRWO|3|I decided to take a chance on these since they were a great deal. I have an hourglass shape, so little waist with bigger hips. These pants were too big in the waist. These pants would be better suited if you have a straight shape or larger waist. I love the finish and color on them. Just wish they fit me better because I would have purchased another pair if they did. Sizing seemed true to what I have experienced in the past with Dockers.
B00D2LGTU4|5|Very comfy!!  I'm 5'3'', 115 lbs, and the size Small could not fit any better.  This is lightweight, so perfect for summer nights, or just around the house.  'Am very please with this!
B00CJG9UDG|5|I love this lb top!! Very pretty and great dressed up or casual! A soft light material.. Very comfy :) happy with my order!!
B00DHMJR8O|1|It's not what they say. It's cheap material and not soft at all. Don't get it
B0042CHRDK|4|I ordered a size larger in these and they are still a little small, but they are very cute and made of good material.
B00BGEVNDW|4|The size fits good.but plz remember to take one size larger than your original size.the quality of material is also good.Just the vest should be little cheaper.overall good.
B00FGST64M|4|Overall this dress is beautiful and exactly what I wanted. The only complaint I have is as I took it out of its packaging two buttons already fell off.. Not something I would expect from a brand new product. The shopping was SUPER FAST. I mean like 4 days fast!!! That's amazing. If the buttons would have stayed on I would have given it five stars.
B00B15FNQO|3|Smaller than advertised
B00AMA1USO|5|I love these leg warmers! They look super cute with boots ! Made just fine for the price. Would buy another pair.
B00KBLGU5M|3|For costume purposes it will do, but for far more exciting purposes it fell far short of what was desired.
B008F6HSJM|2|I love cable sweaters and am particular to the ones with zippers and pockets. This one had both. Unfortunately unless you're a midget you won't be able to use the pockets. I ordered a Xtra Large Size on this sweater and my hands will go in up to my knuckles and that's it. Yeah I know I've got large hands but they're not that large. You don't have any problem finding quality hoodies that have adequate pockets so why shouldn't you expect the same from something that cost $50. If you're a person who doesn't use the pockets then it might work fine for you. I had considered getting another one in a different color but am glad I didn't now. I won't buy it again.
B005LLGUKC|2|not wide enough to cheap need one without elastic
B00JUMCXZO|1|I mean, I order this sweatshirt for school, and it was way too big!!<br />When I put it on, and took it back off, all my shirt was covered with fuzz from it, and the &#34;cotton', that totally not cotton! it was so itchy and uncomfortable, that you will never know. Please dont order these!! sorry<br /><br />0 stars!
B00HDA2NX2|2|I was disappointed in quality of the material of these outfits. I've purchased others from this brand and liked them, but these felt almost plasticky.
B00DZRVPMM|5|I received the dress in a small box, I wrote an email to the company to make me custom made dress. The fabric is beautiful, the dress is stunning, beatiful, delicate and more beautiful than what you can see in the picture, fast shipping and the dress was very well packed.The dress have the perfect fit!
B007C07SMO|5|I wear caps a bunch in the warmer weather. Have to actually after I had a tumor removed off my scalp a couple of years ago. Pale people should not mess with the sun. I'm not just pale, as some of my friends call me Powder.<br /><br />Wanted just a basic cap, no logos or anything. This one is perfect. Fits well, looks great (loden). Definitely going to order some more colors.
B00CI0HZAS|5|It looks really cute on
B00H87O3GU|1|The face is a little messed up so was disapointed
B008KCJYRK|5|I spent 22 years in the Air Force and was issued this style jacket as part of our flight uniforms. This jacket is of the same quality and fit I experienced back in the Air Force. The one extra is the side pockets are already there to keep your hands warm. Back in the day we had to have it altered to get these pockets added.
B00B011FSE|5|I only needed the hat for a costume and didn't put on the gloves (which seemed really big) or the tail.  I washed them once after Halloween and still held up well so it can be recycled.
B00BLPXWI0|3|Ways too small even if you order your expected size.
B00CMO2XDO|5|Comfortable & fashionable- it is so hard to find stylish clothes for girls that aren't frilly and pink! Nice quality
B00BOLTLTU|5|This is really a nice n sexy swim suit I would recommend the material is great I don't know if they make a mistake hope not but its a Vitoria secret brand
B00C2KHS9W|5|Time to look nice
B00BGBFB2Y|5|Perfect.  My daughter wears it every day it seems like.  I don't think she has a single complaint.  She just says &#34;can we order more&#34;.
B0020HRYZA|3|They are just not quite wide enough around the calf. I wish the came in sizes so that a wider calf was an option
B00DRGJTYM|5|Favorite!!
B00IUA2E6U|5|Cute onesie. Fit perfectly
B009XDLCCU|3|It shrinks easily. otherwise a great shirt.
B00J0VCU26|5|I purchased these for a homeless shelter. Socks, jeans, and boxers, and soap are on the top of the list for requested items.
B00THLA8J6|3|Its super cute but run too big in some parts
B00LVKAPXK|4|Great hat.  I didn't realize the bill was purple though; I would have preferred it to be the same color as the rest of the hat.
B00EZDMJS4|2|Onn the picture it looks very bright and fun, but in person the color is very washed out and its just not vibrant. It looks like something that your grandmother could make on her sewing machine.
B000SDCMK0|1|This product has a nice zip bag and good sized containers for about a week long trip. However, the caps on the bottles are of very poor quality and they all break, with very little pressure. Without the caps, the product has little value.
B000OV99YS|5|Very pleased with the fit and look of these dress pants. Just what I needed.
B00E7NZYLQ|2|too tight
B00V91U1FS|4|I really like this wallet! It feels nice and seems more expensive than it is. My only 2 complaints are that I wish it had an outside pocket with no zipper for easier access and I wish it came in more colors. :)
B008VO5XDQ|2|This sweater doesn't drape very wee. I tried wearing it with a collared blouse and a drop neck black sleeveless sweater and the cardigan just didn't look like it fit.
B00NNPV3FK|5|Texture is very good, if you can often do activities as well.
B009L4EDIQ|1|i ordered a medium and received a large.  they said they fulfilled their end of the bargain but they didn't.  what a ripoff!!
B00HA7F51A|5|fits great
B0030IMZ3Y|4|I love the jeans, but they do run a bit small. I wear size 6, but they are a little too tight for me. I do hope though they will stretch to adjust my figure in the end. I really love the model and the tummy slimming panel. They look really flattering.
B00KDNSGU0|5|I get complimented every time I wear it.  Not the sturdiest construction but it's not so fragile I'm scared to wear it dancing.  The material is super soft and the fit is comfortable.
B00HYPL9UY|5|It's as perfect as I was waiting
B00FX4H1G4|3|i received the shirts as expected, but i got two of the same color shirts(i ordered a black with white stripes and a red with white stripes) which was odd.
B00C3DZ8HM|3|The fit is nice, and it is a nice dress. But the fabric is a bit interesting. It's a nice lightweight material, but is also clingy. I couldn't wear it when it was hot b/c my sweat made the dress stick to me and was odd. I am looking forward to finding a slip that fits with this well and wearing it in the fall w/ a leather jacket
B00BESSJ4G|3|I ordered a small for myself, given that I am 5'4\\" and 118 lbs with an a-cup bra size.  Although it was tight to get on and off and was definitely compressing, it didn't bring in my tummy as much as I thought  it would.  It was good at smoothing out, but I was hoping for more tummy control.  I don't think I'd order another one, but I will be keeping this one for times when I'm feeling self-conscious in a particular top or dress.  I enjoy the melon color!
B00GD3QALG|3|My daughter loves this backpack, and it's a fine backpack, just know that it will wear out rather quickly. The cording around the edges frays in weeks, and the quality of the material is decent, though not meant to last for a whole year.
B00IRWKB4S|5|This swimsuit is better than i expected. It fits perfectly (i am 5'7 and 118 pounds) and it looks very nice. I was a bit apprehensive because the delivery estimate date was stated to be June 6th , when i ordered it the 12th of May . However, it shipped from China on the 14th and got here on the 21st. Fits true to a size small
B0081TUMO6|5|It was true to fit. I bought a cup 38 D and it fits perfectly. It is comfortable as the other reviewers have mentioned. Its a moderate hold (in terms of a shaper) its not pulling me in at all, just keeping it all smooth and in place. With that said, I imagine it will be a comfortable wear all night long. The crotch snaps make using the restroom comfortable and easy without having to totally undress. Its also very pretty.<br />I was concerned that it would feel a bit scratchy as its lace, but its not at all. Its quite smooth and flexible. I like it. I would recommend. Its pretty, sexy and comfortable. Perfect for under my wedding dress.
B00KNV0ORU|4|I wear a 12/14. I'm 5'8&#34;. I ordered a large and it fits well. The fabric is a little thinner than I thought and its not stretchy fabric. But its still a good fit.
B009A4YCW4|1|good afternoon gentlemen<br /><br />I write this note in order to discuss my dissatisfaction with this purchase because as it is possible to pack one jacket that weighs one pound in a box that weighs four to five pounds or weight which is a very high weight to these purchases as well as I spend with you with another coat of the same brand, very bad this and hopefully not coming back, it can not be a company's environmental commitment also important as you these boxes are very expensive and must be given a better use
B00EKPO9J4|5|I was very please with this costume<br />Very complete
B00NTJSJ70|4|My son loves this sweatshirt
B00HYQZT6S|5|The material is not see through!!!! It's thicker than expected and looks expensive and great quality! GOOD PRODUCT, The gray is a very soft gray, not a dark as pictured. I love it! MAKE MORE COLORS
B00FS2MAIU|3|This sweater fits very well on my husband, and keeps him very warm.<br /><br />Unfortunately, during the first few hours with it, the mask buttons came apart and was not able to be reattached. It's a neat concept and my husband still enjoys the sweater without the mask.
B00JXIU12C|5|These have been fantastic and super absorbent for our very drooly 7 month old. She also looks super stylish in them. Great product, worth the price.
B00YM5Y2TE|2|It is a cute top but I guess it is not made for tall people. It fits great around me but the length looks like I was going for a crop top which was definitely not the case.
B00NNWOEWM|3|They were either sized wrong or run an entire size too big! I ordered a 6, but they fit like an 8! Will have to hold onto them for a while. Other than that they appear to be very nice.
B00PGWQC68|5|But it's a very pretty dress.
B00JFS2FY2|4|the 38 fit more like a 39-40
B00CBKO15M|4|When I first opened the plastic bag the belt was wrapped in, I noticed that some black something-or-other was coming off on my fingers, but after a quick five minutes of wiping the belt down with cold water and a paper towel it was pretty much gone. I like how sturdy it feels. Four stars because I don't know how durable the snaps will be over the long-term, but otherwise it's great.
B008ALO0PC|4|Thank you very much! I love it
B00EW2FJP8|5|Excellent quality
B00CEK9ND4|5|Bought these for a poison ivy halloween costume - great price, great quality, great color! Love them oh so much!
B002SKM22O|5|This was a gift for hubby.  He has always loved The Mountain's tshirts and has quite a few of them he wears regularly.  Of course over time, some of his older tshirts needed replacing.  I was happy when I found them on Amazon and got him five new ones for Christmas.  He loves them!  They are well made, good quality tshirts with vivid graphics so he was quite happy to get them.
B00HJOMKAI|4|The shorts fit as described.  I like sleepwear to be loose and with a 34 waste, the large fits the bill perfectly.  They material is soft and the elastic waist band is thin so you don't feel it when you lay down.  My concern is the material which is a bit thick (like old school sweats) so they might run a bit warm on hot nights but it hasn't been a problem thus far.  I recommend these, but similar shorts by Hanes for about half the price are a better value.
B00D65Q3PC|5|I bought this for girlfriend and she loves it as much as I love her in it. Fits great and for price very well made. Nice material. Fast shipping. I can't wait till next time she wears it. I like to surprise her with sexy dresses and she loves this one. She is a size 10 and fits great!!!!!!!!!
B007L7DLT2|3|I wish it was more fitted like the shirts Abercrombie or Hollister.<br /><br />Need to have better material was a bit rough.<br /><br />Other than that, go SAMCRO!
B00E4I4UAA|5|Comfortable socks that I wear to work,
B00DDZIS1M|5|True to fit/size<br />Shipped incredibly fast
B0007ND5AW|1|Okay, so maybe 50 pounds is a slight exageration but these jeans definately made me look chunky and figure-less. They did nothing for me at all. I am 5'9\\", have a 34.5 inseam, a short torso and generally wear a size 8-10. I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size smaller because they are super duper stretchy (which I don't like-- a little stretch is good) but it didn't help. I have a curvy figure and these jeans actually made my butt look flat! Not Good. I'm sending them back because even though they were $14, they're still not worth the price.
B00KRV6BDC|3|great fit however a bit childish lookin
B00HVAUJLM|2|The pattern is a good idea in concept and looks cute in the photos, but it doesn't translate in person
B0067SEDWK|5|For all of you who love bathrobes.....this one is a winner!  We purchased it for our B&B in California.  Last week we had guests in from France for a week  and we laid out two bathrobes...one from a different vendor and this one.  They BOTH wore this one off and on for the entire week!  Although it is advertised as a \\"women's robe\\"...both husband and wife wore it and hardly wanted to take it off.  I can see why. It is incredibly soft, comfy, warm and at the same time light weight.  Also the size fit both the husband and wife and both were quite tall.  A fantastic product all the way around!  Thank you Manor House & Home!
B00JQPQGWQ|4|I nolmally wear size M but I ordered this jacket size S ,But it still too big for me. So beware to order one size smaller then your actual size.
B0000DZJLM|1|These shorts are awful.  They are too hot to work out in.  The fabric is scratchy and irritates my skin.  The waist is too low, making the shorts slip down.  The cut is unflattering.  To add insult to injury, I wore one of the pairs to try it out, and now I find out I can't return it because I wore it once.
B001FAX68W|4|very satisfied
B00LM2Z0PA|5|Shirt was a gift and they enjoyed it.
B00P2CHPTK|5|These pants are perfect just a little small but I'm skinny so they fit as expected. Delivery came very early than expected so that was good and I love how they look
B004VJMELE|4|Fits well. Material is decent quality for the price. I'm getting complements on the color. I would buy another sweatshirt like this again.
B0098PGK3E|5|Not to thin but a perfect fit to the knee.  Recommend these socks for other piano lovers!
B008B7RZ2K|2|Too small, material is rough and cheap.
B008ZBM6MQ|5|Puchased \\"nauti\\" long sleeve shirt and jeans for my husband.....I was shocked by the pricing and selection,, will definitely be a regular customer!
B0041M3BAO|4|Fishermans net brief was sort of on the skimpy side. I found it a little uncomfortable but it was generally alright.
B005T5BO24|5|Shipped quickly and arrived in great shape. This pin looks even better in person. The black keeps it subdued enough to not be too loud like some other square and compass pins I've seen. The gold colored accent keeps it classy though. The contrast really makes it pop. I stick mine on my backpack, guitar strap, hat, or whatever, but I wouldn't hesitate to wear it on a suit as well. Its the perfect size and look to fit any style or application, and I would definitely reccommend it.
B00DZZUNWM|3|I absolutely loved these when they got here and they fit perfect until the first time I had to wash them. I hand washed and hung them up to dry but they lost all their shape after washing. It was like the waist band lost its elastic somehow, after washing once they are too big in the waist and constantly falling down, so sad because they were my favorite when they came in.
B00DFN51BC|2|The top of this dress is... Odd. I could never get it to sit correctly. There is a lot of fabric on the sides and the back of the top of the dress. It's quite long (which I like). I think if you could get away without wearing a bra, this may look better.
B00NOMH35G|5|Very cute! Pants are a little long.
B00DNPD56U|1|Not what I expected.  Waste of money and very cheap.  But for Under 5 bucks I should not have expected quality.  Just keeping if real.
B0088X1I20|5|Very soft, cute p'j's.  Nice bright figures on the p'j's, fit well.  Would recommend these to others and a great purchase!
B003UYEGYE|5|cute
B007E682YY|5|This top fits well and is super cute. My girlfriend tried to steal it as soon as I opened the package if that says anything.
B005DJ8HIU|3|The buttons pretending to be wheels are too big and bulky for a PJ. It is nice, but it is not as nice as I expected to be.
B003S2IMCU|5|If you want fluff, this is it! i love its multi-layers and it's meant to be short, i paired it with panty/ruffled bloomers and it is adorable under my costume and would be a great fit for a photo session as well!! Great purchase.
B0017WUPXC|5|These are adorable.  I give them as presents to new moms.  Everyone gets the Mary Janes, but I personally think these are much cuter and more versatile.
B00C7Z5TUC|2|I ordered this hat for my baby. It is huge. It fits my 8 year old. I am returning it. Bummer.
B0008FV3EY|5|the whole line that I bought were of good quality.  I could not find these in athletic stores.  I like the material and I bought several colors
B0032Z3QBU|5|Shorts were exactly what I was looking for.
B00K92EW3A|5|My granddaughter loves Minnie Mouse and was so happy to receive this t-shirt. It fits her perfectly as she can wear it for probably several months to a year more.
B0009MZYEQ|1|The socks themselves are very comfortable.  However, if your running shoes fit properly with \\"normal\\" running socks so that they are snug but not tight, these socks are so thick that your shoes won't fit.  I kept the socks to wear around the house because they offer very good padding when my feet are sore after a run, but they are useless for actual running.
B002WTC6DG|5|My order was processed, shipped, and received in an easy and expeditious manner. The socks are very comfortable and so far seem to wear well. I'm completely satisfied!
B009NUC6MI|5|I got this for my daughter and she loves it and it is so cute. I will buy it again
B00D3ZSWQS|5|I love it and he is toasty warm too! I recommend this product for anyone mom or dad wanting to keep their little snug as a bug.
B001E3C9DI|5|It did fit large, but we wanted it to so that he can wear clothes underneath for the weather!!!!!
B008PDB1DE|4|Very good !
B004XIMZZ8|5|LOVED LOVED it :))))  - not only did it arrive on time in its original package, it does the job very well and the price was perfect
B00DJMDJ7M|5|My son wanted a new coat & helped me pick it out (even though it was to be his birthday gift). The large we originally ordered was too small through the chest. The exchange was the fastest & easiest mail-exchange of all time! Matter of fact, the new one came over the weekend before I could even mail the original one back! The XL fits him perfectly & makes him look so &#34;adult&#34; & fashionable. He loves it! He's especially appreciative of all the pockets. He almost always carries a deck of card in case a game of euchre or hearts breaks out, so he loves the inside pocket!<br /><br />Thanks for making his birthday special & affordable when money was tight! :)
B00J9TMXIU|5|I have other Coolibar garments, so I ordered this for my husband. He hasn't worn it yet, except to check the fit, but my own experience with Coolibar is that it washes very well. It can be a bit hot, because it blocks the breeze, too, but it is VERY effective in blocking sun.
B00J2L4DHY|5|This shirt fits great! So comfy and looks exactly like it does in the picture.
B008RNNQJY|4|This is a really comfy outfit; however, it runs big.  I normally wear a 14/16 and ordered a 1X, which was too large, so I'd recommend a Large size.  The top is tunic style and is nice and long.  I have seen reviews on other sites stating they thought that the material felt thin, but I find it very comfortable and warm--not overly heavy.  It is flocked velvet with a nylon lining.  The set looks nice with a turtleneck and boots and is certainly much nicer looking than running out in sweats to the grocery store or to do errands.  I live in snow country so not only does it look nice, but is cozy to wear for the winter. I got the black set and plan to get the brown set, but in a smaller size of course.  Overall, I give it a B+ rating.
B002N63AVK|5|Perfect.....went on perfect and it looks great!
B00K0SZWI2|5|I ordered this dress and it arrived in 2 days... it fit me perfectly.... im 5' 5&#34; around 130lb and the dress fit like it was made for me. It is stretchy so it will fit a large and small woman. Perfect length as well. Would recommend this dress!!
B008O5AKF8|3|Nice shirt.  Neck is pretty big though.  I have to wear a shirt underneath.  Fits true to size and cotton is nice.
B00EGJ1QHW|5|I love it, it is just beautiful
B008HPODQM|5|I really like my Jones New York Jeans. I am going to order two more pairs! The fit is great
B00B20MNCK|5|This little girl is absolutely beautiful ! Fits perfectly.  Just make sure that you don't order to large. Sizes ARE appropriate.
B00E8RC2ZW|1|So im giving them 1 star just because this item was supposed to be delivered from December 4 to December 9.<br />I bought this item among many others as a Christmas gift, I bought my presents with a bunch of time because Im going to travel  and I need to take the gifts with me, everything else was delivered on the dates they were supposed to.<br />Today I received an email from Roxi saying that the item was going to be delivered on December 12, that they were really sorry for the inconvenient. I travel the 11th, so, im sure the product is great is just a shame when companies don't commit with time, specially on this dates.<br />If you are buying this product and you dont want to pay extra for shipment my advice is, order it two months before you actually need it. Time is just as important as money.
B008VTIXBA|5|Classic blazer, well made and a fantasic price!  I was thrilled to receive it on time and have worn it numerous times.  With dress pants, over a dress and with jeans!
B006SU4EYO|4|got this today and I'm very happy with it!  I'm 5'4&#34; 120, busty and it is very flattering.  I ordered the medium and it hugs the body but not too snug.  not too long for bang petite either.  the only thing i will say is although it is soft, i was kind of expecting a more &#34;cashmere&#34; like feel according to the pictures.  Feels a bit synthetic.  overall very happy- would order again.
B00B0YSMUA|5|Bought this for my 9 year old daughter for Valentine's Day. Came in a very roomy white cardboard box that made it extra special. Made of really high-quality ribbon and headband material. She loved it and I scored major Dad points.
B00CAA0L7U|4|Mask is very uncomfortable and the leggings are not nude, they are white.
B00MB6NT6I|5|love it for sleeping!!
B00IWNL2AY|5|adorable for the price
B009GYK8D0|5|Worked well as shorts on a cruise ship excursion and as a bathing suit at the beach. I would have loved another pocket, but it wasn't necessary.
B007RGCX64|4|I'd give the shirt 5 stars but in a matter of 1 day the price went up $3.... I thought I hit purchase and it sat in my cart overnight. The next day I got an alert advising me the price changed. Not really sure if the financial reasons for this except the &#34;demand&#34; for the shirt went up and they were making extra money.
B0002TW2IM|4|The socks arrived promptly and were as advertised. The quality is acceptable, but I was disappointed to find the socks were made in Mexico.  The add says \\"USA/Imported\\", so it's not misleading.  However, I have been trying to buy American-made products and wish that a clear distinction had been made.
B005QHR5CI|5|Dont wash it with any machine or you will kill the Jean. Wash it by hand and let it dry.
B000E5YNWM|2|The product is good. It eliminates you're Chest good but it is suffocating. You cannot put you're hands up or move them efficiently without itching or extreme congestion. Especially from the underarm area it is extremely tight. It also is very hard to take off.
B00J6SK4FS|4|This dress is lovely and vibrant. Fits nice, my only complaint is that the elastic comes off in the wash, on delicate. I would suggest hand washing and air dry to keep it in tact. Great price for such a pretty sundress.
B00OCK8VY6|5|Good quality. Nice short.
B002RXE806|5|This is the costume that my husband chose to wear for our wedding.  It fits great and is well made especially for a costume.  I was very impressed with it.
B00K5AFQ22|4|This is a nice wallet with a slim profile even when filled to the max. Identifying and removing a card takes more time than a regular billfold because the cards are all stacked together in the same slot. I've been enjoying this wallet for over a month and will likely continue to use this over my old billfold wallet.
B00BLNYVY6|1|I bought this belt from Amazon in end of  July 2014 to replace a similar style belt that I purchase from a major clothing retail store. I thought that since the rest of the Amazon community gave the belt high ratings that this was a good quality belt. Today the loop for the belt broke off cleanly. This was after the belt started to fray around the loop, and the belt continuously came undone. I am very disappointed with this purchase since it didn't last near as long as I thought it should. It looks nice to start with, but a belt it intended to serve one purpose and this one failed to do the job.
B003YOZVJ4|4|Good fit, as expected, however  packing slip/bill of lading not included in package
B00MVHM0VM|4|I was quite nervous after I ordered this because there were no reviews but soon after I saw that there were new reviews stating negative things about this dress. The dress is similar to the picture but it definitely it's not the same. The dress my 5 yr old recieved is also very pretty, the cape is almost as long as in the picture but definitely not as wide. The details on the stock photo are not how the dress we recieved looks, but overall it is a pretty Elsa dress and my daughter and everyone I have shown loves it.
B00OAW2DTK|5|I love this dress. It's perfect !
B000PCIJI8|2|Right size, wrong fit, too small.
