B00H1LED4A|5|I love giant squids!!!
B008N660UW|5|I've been using this helmet for the past 2 seasons. It is super light, very comfortable and looks even better in person. The breath box directs your breath down and away from your goggles, they've never fogged and my head has always stayed warm in very cold (down to -25F) weather. I would recommend this helmet to anyone that is thinking about it.
B00K6ZWSKE|4|The hitch installed pretty easily.  Fishing the bolts into the frame is the trickiest part.  You need a helper, or a way to hold the hitch in place when fishing the bolts.  I used a floor jack and bungee cords to hold the hitch in place.  Two characteristics held my rating to 4 stars.  First, the hitch hangs lower than the factory hitch and is therefore more visible from the rear of the vehicle, and second there is a collection of stickers, also visible after install, that are a pain to remove.
B00DH2YV3K|5|Easy to apply, looks good
B000GU5WO8|5|Works great the chrome finish is excellent.
B005SUV77W|5|The installation instructions are weak but if you can't figure it out you don't belong anywhere near a wrench anyway. The chock does need some fine tuning to make sure the rear catch does not rub against the lower fairing, at least on my CBR1000RR. Very solid construction, easy to assemble, all the holes line up properly and bolts securely to my trailer deck.
B007Y85XMG|5|Brand new starter received next day than expected  and  just installed fit, crank up the engine in no time. Very impressive.  Save over one hundred dollars  compared to local auto parts stores. Highly recommend.
B0049Z8X4C|1|The product only lasted one month before the BMW logo was separated from the key chain, the only way to fix it is to solder it. The rest of the key chain was nice but I would not purchase it again due to this defect.
B000W0OFXG|5|Works great
B003YYMM1E|2|Edges aren't smooth and the shape was irregular.  It almost looks like it was cut out with a razor knife.
B00CQD4BUE|5|Too expensive, but very high overkill quality and works very well.  When you think about it, the old dipsticks on old American cars were made out of a long thin piece of flexible metal.  The end was curled over to make a handle and they never broke.  The original MINI dipstick is a good example of a needlessly complex composite assembly that doesn't work very well (too difficult to get in and out) and breaks (potentially leaving a piece of dipstick stuck in your oil pan).  Never thought I'd spend this much for a dipstick, but at least the MINI has one.  My BMW 335i has no dipstick!  Don't get me started on how dumb that is...
B000F13I4Y|2|Didn't fit correctly for my 2007 Camry.
B004SSAFFU|4|Perfect
B00KIFMO0G|1|The plate looked great a first but began to peel within the first three months.  My car is garage kept and the plate still peeled.
B0075PXMFI|5|Very heavy duty and well built. My only issue was that this does take quite a bit of tweaking to get it to fit. It's very snug but once it's on, it's on! It looks great! Just a suggestion, remove the screws that hold on the chrome fingers and loctite them. I had one fall off while riding and only made it about 30 miles. The rest seemed tight but when I replaced the screws, I went ahead and pulled all screws and loctited them so that I wouldn't lose any more. Thanks much!
B004WJHADA|5|Being a mom that MAKES her boys wear helmets when they are on anything with wheels, I like to make them helmets fun! we bought this for our middle man! He loved it the quality of the spikes was good it's like a broom material... The only issue we had with it was the suction cups weren't strong enough to suction it to the helmet... we fixed the problem with super glue... I'd still recommend this product to anyone!
B00YDUOS38|1|It arrived so late. Im not happy. The 1 star is for me... For not reading that its a sticker!!!! I can print bigger sizes! All the while i thought its at least close to a real sign that u can buy in a souvenir store in NY. Ohhh wasted money!!!!
B000JK2D06|5|As a lifelong DIY detailer I am always on the lookout for the &#34;best&#34; wax for my stable full of Mercedes. I've used the high end carnauba stuff, regular wax from FLAPS, you name it. For years my go-to wax has been 3M Show Car Wax, but since I came across Insulator Wax I've changed to it.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Mainly because i get the same level of shine and luster, and it seems to hold up longer than the 3M product. This is important to me, since I live in a subtropical climate where the sun is out daily. Not to mention it's easy to apply and remove, as long as you're careful not to let it get too dry.<br /><br />Heating it up in a container of warm water prior to use helps with the application as well.<br /><br />Great stuff, I'll continue to use it as it's the best product (in my opinion) I've found in many years.
B007LCHZ3U|5|perfect match, easy application
B00CCIM1YQ|5|Very strong lock although it's pretty heavy.  I stick it in my backpack while riding and it adds a considerable amount of weight although I knew this going in.  Nice and big, could easily lock two bikes together on a bike rack.
B0052SF0LO|2|Was bigger than I thought it would be and it was two separate pieces that you would have to mount in two separate places. Too much surface space would be taken up on the front of my house.  I thought it would look pretty junky mounted to the  house so I have returned it.
B000KZ2ROM|5|We were leery to purchase two of these, but it turned out that they were perfect! The set up was easy and they both work great!
B00PC3ZO4C|5|It worked.
B0049MTHTA|5|Works well, like the many options to plug in.
B0019VZYN2|5|Purchased for a 2006 Honda Civic LX 1.8. What a difference! The engine revved much smoother and was more responsive. Best improvement for $$ that I've done to the car.
B009OBW29S|5|After reading reviews on other products and researching I feel this is the very best product for black cars.<br />I tried it last night and it worked flawlessly.
B00AE27RN2|4|They did not fit my 2008 Odyssey front bumper.  They appear well made.
B000GU5IH4|1|This cover badly faded, dry-rotted, and shredded in less than a year. It's made of a very thin material with very poor weather protection.
B00CJ7U7WS|5|👍👍
B006HYA7EM|1|What a hassle this bumper was from start to finish. First off please let me warn you not to purchase this from dukes automotive or you will end up getting a used piece of junk poorly packaged and missing parts as well as poor communication. That aside this bumper like the description said is a real toilet. Nothing fit correctly and I had to alter alot of stuff. The nut strips where the worst not lining up with the supplied brackets and needed to be trimmed to fit. Also my particular bumper could not be adjusted up to sit neatly under the taillights because of a giant sloppy bird turd weld that I had to grind down.quarter panel armor did not fit properly and the rivets where not long enough to even come in contact with the front of the armor where it mounts to the body. This bumper also has some no sense trailer safety chain mounting system as to where most safety chains wont fit on it properly i had to again spend more money on this junk bumper and purchase more hardware for chains to work .Directions where poor and missing a lot of critical info. Also many bolts and rivets where missing from the kit. Bumper came dinged and dented. Avoid this bumper not worth the money or hassle.
B001EOWPOA|5|Works nicely for a trailer tester I made.  It doesn't get a lot of abuse for my application, but appears that it is well built.
B008LPEZ6Q|5|This smells sooooo good! It cleans very well, and has a nice amount of shine. It does not have that greasy shine that armor all has. The smell actually lasts a few days too. I will be buying more of this!
B004P1WNXC|4|Took a little bit of work to install but definitely worth it. So easy to fold the top down and put it back up definitely recommend.
B00AC6WBKY|5|Love this tshirt, very sexy yet sensible.
B00757KJTI|1|Terrible for picking up stations.
B002M2KIW4|2|Tried to install one myself and it broke. Took it to a shop and they tried one and it broke too. still intact enough to do job
B00U8695HK|5|Nice
B012BMJGP4|1|This image is stolen. I know this, because I'm the one who designed it. If you want to buy the real thing, go here http://www.cafepress.com/stargazerdesign.1612008014
B000E682GY|5|Fixed my failing ignition switch. Excellent value and good quality.
B0097CDPBI|5|Exactly what I needed.
B00KGT9KD8|5|I was expecting cheap material but was presently surprised.  These are well made, have a quality heavy feel and GREAT for the price!  They ALSO are the CORRECT colors.  Many others on Amazon do not seem to have the right colors OR there is no spacing between the stripes.  (like the real one)  These are just like stock emblems.<br /><br /> Just use a heat gun or a blow dryer on your existing ones and they will come right off.  Then put these ones on!
B00W8T51Y6|2|Worked once and then would never connect again. The product that I received was defective and I chose to trash it.<br />However, I have added a star because the seller, despite my failure to follow-up on the failure, contacted me directly and offered a replacement or refund.  I chose refund and the credit card was credited in 2 days.<br />Bottom line, the seller is honest and shows that he stands by the product.<br />My rating was on the product and at the low price point did not feel it was worth it to go through a timely process.  I now know the process is not time consuming and would recommend the seller.  Since I did not chose a replacement, it is possible I had a lemon.  YMMV.
B000C5CERK|1|this is a bad product for up to date cars soon as i used it it made my check engine light go on will not go off and every time a get a diagnostic check its reads gas cap thanks for interfering with a perfect car !
B00MB0E21U|5|I just got it in the mail...I opened it and I was super scared it was too big for my little car! But then I put it on and it fits PERFECTLY! I love it so much and it's super comfy for my hands! Some people on here complained about it being too big for their hands. But I tend to disagree. I am so glad I found this and bought it! :)
B00BZVYM98|5|Excellent product. Was able to program it in less than one minute. Highly recommend it.
B00SZK1420|3|This product showed as compatible with my 2012 Dodge Durango. When I installed these lamps, the housing was NOT an EXACT match to the design of the original. I compared them to the originals and found that there is some slight difference in width of the coupling. So they will not snap in to the sockets to the lamp housing (the electrical connections/pins DO line up though). What I love about these lamps is the 700 lumens of LED light. I almost don't need headlamps with these powerful fog lamps!  Bottom line is, I jerry rigged them to fit in place and am enjoying truly functional and powerful fog lamps. IF the fit was right, I would give these 5 starts.
B000EDUUHQ|5|product is as advertised
B00JH0ODCU|5|Very good belt worth it 150%!
B00FXAHKA0|1|I DID NOT LIKE IT ....WHO WANT THIS PICE OF SH  T ON THEIR TRUCK...NO THINK YOU.... ATTN:   DO NOT GET THIS ...DO NOT BUY THIS....YOU WILL NOT LIKE IT...DO NOT GET IT
B00K1UEGQ8|4|It's an adaptor. What's to be said?<br />It fits my driver and holds sockets. I bought 10 because they seem to get lost allot.
B00080QHMM|1|don't  work most of the time!!
B001NZSFHG|5|great product, plugged into factory plus, would buy again
B0022ZN6WU|4|Haven't had it very long - we'll see how it &#34;holds up&#34;! Seems to be good quality for the price. It does &#34;pool water&#34; when it rains and doesn't soak through. Doesn't quite cover my entire bike (Kawasaki Vulcan 900 custom) - a little bit of the wheels peek out (just like in the picture). I do have throw-over saddlebags and it does cover. Pretty easy to get on and off. Seems like good quality material!
B00JA3BMDW|5|I love this temp gun--it's accurate and surprisingly fun to use. I tested it against my thermometer inside of my tortoise vivarium, and they both had the exact same reading down to a tenth of a degree (F).
B0041E07WC|4|Great product
B00T8AA13O|5|Great quality and design!
B00WXI6FKQ|5|I needed upper and lower ball joints and the sway bar links, after a lot of research I found this package and since the 4 ball joints and 2 sway bar links would have cost me 100 bucks I went ahead and got this set. Me and a friend replaced all these parts in a little over 8 hours. and my blazer is like new again (after an alignment). The bar codes for these parts was cut off a box and taped onto the bags they were in (no boxes included) i noticed on a few of the parts it said Moog. I don't know if all the parts were Moog or just the couple i noticed but they seem to be just as good quality as the Moog that was replaced by these parts.<br /><br />They have been on my blazer for a couple weeks now, if I have a problem with them I will come back and add it to this review.
B004DMVIDE|4|Great purchase
B0000AXQE8|5|Drank hot chocolate in my Mercedes all throughout my trip to Colorado. Never drove before. It was great. This thing works :)
B009TNDY34|4|Fit like it should.
B000HHLQ2M|5|Great Product. YAY.. I love this stuff.  will order Again and Again.. I can NOT find this item in any local Tack Shops or Saddle Stores.  It is Amazing ....  Love It .. Been searching for the past  1.5 years ..  So Happy
B008DILDTS|4|I ordered these for my 2014 Honda CR-Z EX Nav. The lights were treated and worked but when I went to install them I discovered they did not come with metal clips to lock them into the bumper. Instead I would have to remove the bumper cover to install some screws and I was not willing to do this. Apparently they used to come with the clips 3 years ago but no longer do.<br /><br />I will say the appear to be made well and the LEDs all worked and were tested on the battery. If not for the clip issue i would have kept them. Thank you to iJDMTOY for writing with me on the return
B00JGQUEQY|5|I wish I would of known about this sooner. It completely stopped the rattling on the back gate due to my heavy spare tire. It was easy to install too. Love it!
B00UJ9BPC4|5|Espectacular !!
B00MVBNBU2|3|I was happy when I got the package but what did I get? A hatsune miku lanyard. Like what??? with the bleach sword. like even more of a what. I'm dissapointed. I saw a letter too. I don't really want to put the letter out there because if it really is sincere of what the person is saying, i wouldn't want to ruin someones job. Thank you though.
B00CMVTWGI|1|I purchased (4) of these to replace my OEM 2004 Ford Explorer's TPMS sensors, as they were 11 years old and I was swapping out tires anyway. I got them installed, tires mounted and balanced, and got ready to program them, and I couldn't get them to program. I called a garage who said they could program them. When I arrived they had a Snap-On TPMS3, which is a $1200 tool for this purpose and should do the job. NOPE! Turns out you HAVE TO HAVE DORMAN's Multi-Fit PROGRAMMING TOOL. I'm now going to have to sell these, buy the 974-002 that according to Dorman will work with my vehicle, and then break down my tires, replace the sensors, mount and re-balance my tires, and then go back to the guy with the Snap-On TPMS tool. Talking to Dorman technical support (Jarrad, if you care) they do not seem to care that this is an inconvenience.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I love these car seat gaps. I was always dropping things into the pesky areas between the car seats. These areas  are so difficult to reach into.  and vacuum if I got crumbs in my car.These &#34;Drop Stops&#34; do a great job and fit nicely in the spaces between the seats. They also included some neat freebies-including a pad that attaches to the dashboard and holds items like pens, etc. Very nice item from a great company.
B00L5EXM9G|1|Rusted within a week
B002P3U6WM|5|very good n i love it fit perfectly
B002UK2GZ0|3|&#34;Quality embroidery&#34; was more like an iron-on appliqué.<br />&#34;Hook and eye closure&#34; is no where on this product. It has Velcro closures.<br />&#34;Soft velour cover&#34; would be accurate.
B001HRMZ6M|5|worked well - fits 2004 BMW X3
B0001EXSIG|5|Works well
B00OU7MRC8|5|Love these. They shipped fast and are good quality. And they are SO cute!
B00FBQGUMA|3|They are fine although the photo shows a grease fitting and there is no provision for a grease fitting on the units I purchased.
B007U9EXVQ|5|Love this Decal!
B000C5ESQU|5|Exact replacement!
B00E0PX2AQ|5|Love these chaps. A bit tight however. I would size one up from any normal sizes you might wear. Other than that they work flawlessly.
B007S0LDME|5|It works pretty much as advertised.  We have a MaxxFan (much greater air flow than a conventional bathroom fan) in the bathroom of our RV, and I only detected a slight whiff of odor once in all of the times flushing with the fan running full speed.  I'm pleased with it, and plan to keep using it in the future.
B000IZ2YTW|4|Best for experienced do it yourselfers. Not an exact replacement for Chevy cavalier required drilling rivets out of 2 brackets to replace and use new bolts I drilled new holes in door inner skin to reach rivets.
B004RNR9BY|5|product is as advertised
B003OGZ0MA|5|It fits great !! Perfect for a 370z I have a 2014 model year
B0002UNON8|5|Works great. this does a reasonable job of removing scratches. ive had several on my truck and this got rid of all but one because it was too deep. this works best for the less deep scratches and they will completely vanish. ive used this several times and am impressed and not too concerned with the random scratches that appear on my truck.
B008YJTHBW|4|A little on the pricey side but it works and is OEM Subaru. Purchased for my 05 Subaru Legacy.  I really only needed this as a backup key.  Seller responded quickly to my questions.
B00AIBNL7A|2|The cover was nice but it was way too big for the 1999 Ford Ranger steering wheel.  It was a stock steering wheel whic measured 15&#34; to the outside but cover was still too big.
B000JD6KNY|5|Great value and hold up to west Texas 100 plus weather and no more wind tunnel effect from driving with my windows down
B000630J02|1|Not worth the price for something that doesn't work as intended.  Dial indicator works great, but when attached to tool you can not get an accurate measurement for ring filing.  Depending on where you have your ring at on your grinding wheel will change the dial indicator zero point. Therefor you will never get knowledge of how much you take off the ring.. Recommend doing it by hand with a hand held device. This takes off way to much at a time.
B00U868BN4|5|I don't know how this little thing works, but trust me it does! Worked great in my pickup!
B00HRXNLIG|5|Totally fixed my issue in my car.  Thanks.
B009S94RK8|5|Fits perfectly
B003BZD08U|2|pressure set too low for my needs. I need at least 60lbs and this was set at 40psi.
B000GZTJOM|5|Good Tach,I installed it on my 2005 Yamaha Road Star,very simple to wire up,and if your installing it on a Road Star,the grey or orange wire on your coil is the negative contact that you want to connect to.
B0028QVNGO|1|One of the lenses popped out the first time I used these goggles, stranding me with no eye protection.  Cheap junk, don't trust!
B007HRJNIE|5|Very pleased with these.  They definitely make the Equal-i-zer hitch quieter...no more sounding like you just ran into something.
B00Z8RCCY2|5|Decent seat.  Not as tough as original seat but its good.  Makes a tight fit even on older foam.  The size was indeed a near perfect match to the original.
B00EZAABH8|5|Pretty good deal on some nice shiney wheel covers that aren't hard to clean.  Fast Free Shipping, and a pretty good price... fairly easy to install, though I did get the valve stem bent under trying to install one at the curb in almost dark conditions, and slightly cracked that one.... but installed properly, they work fine and stay in place until pulled off.  Good covers for around 40 bucks... beats buying a single new OEM cover from GM for double the cost.
B008OY8RMW|1|Absolute crap.  Super thin 16 gauge steel... wouldn't trust these to tie down a mini bike.
B0056BT9T6|4|They work as advertised. I was able to remove and install sport bike tires without scratching my rims. I did hear some cracking like they were going to bust with the amount of force that is needed to get the tire on but no problems. I will add that there are no special magical tool to make this job any easier why removing and mounting tires by hand but they work great to keep the rims in perfect condition.
B00VLF4XHY|5|Great Products!
B001UC8WK2|5|Great replacement part. Really did the job at a great price!
B000NCOKV0|5|Nice unit should do just fine for what need charging
B009DJWJMQ|5|Fast service, taillight lens fit fine. Good price.
B00EJSHKMK|4|Switch works, and the case cover has a small screw to secure it.
B00FRHOMNM|4|Just great, I love the product and the fast fast shipping! It's a great way to shop!
B009K4H42Y|1|Did not receive A01 as advertised, got 5 A02's. The box states &#34;5 case of A01&#34;.
B000N5N5CW|5|I've had this installed for two weeks and it seems to be a very good quality product.  The exhaust tone isn't too loud.  There is a noticeable improvement in throttle response and the engine runs smoother.
B0046ET9TE|1|stopped working after 20 days of use. I had to unplug it to drive my car home
B005G82C8E|1|Broke first day! Really....
B008HIW424|5|Kickass
B0030G7Y64|4|i have to say , i would have loved the temperature controle, and not the power control.. but hey, cheap and everything stays cool or cold or frozen, depending of what i want!! great!!
B00S09T8M4|5|This is a great product for cleaning and dusting around the house!  Also can be used to wash your car, picks up dust and grime really well, and is easily cleaned in the washing machine.<br /><br />I bought this because I was wanting something that is gentle enough to clean my flat screen TVs without using substances that can damage the screen.  Worked excellent!<br /><br />I also used it to dust around and the house and had great results.<br /><br />Has held up well on its first wash in the machine and I bet I will be able to use it for a long time coming.<br /><br />Was given a slight discount to leave feedback on this product, and is a 5 star product. Don't hesitate if you are looking for a Micro fiber glove!
B000F5ED12|5|I pity anyone in need of this kit. However, if you need it, you won't find a better price. Works exactly as it's supposed to
B00II7DUIG|5|great price great look used oem Harley 5 3/4 lens and bulb with Harley trim ring light is real metal and really gives that comin outta the bike look

B00ELJ90SE|5|Liked the funny saying
B00QSWT18Q|2|I like the paw prints, but i thought they were going to be black...they came in white and the daughters door i was going to put them on is white so you can't see them
B004ETK0AI|3|Great Product!!!!!!!
B003NNZ1QY|5|nice and beefy
B004RCXB8A|5|Works very well. Easy install
B00AC869KU|4|very wellbuilt and it fits
B00COYNY1W|5|This is actually quite a sweet keychain. As everyone has already said the colors are baked on rather than painted, and seems to be quite durable. It has a silver shine anywhere Boba has battle damage which is a nice contrast to the matte green of his helmet.
B00WO8E8I6|3|only needed  the passanger side. Was a good fit but is not as bright as the OEM on the drivers side
B0018ETWJ2|5|Great suit. Love it. Saves me everytime.
B00FYEUWIW|4|Came with the wrong sized bulbs for the front doors courtesy lights
B00J00X3NW|5|well priced and performs well. Have Been using this motor oil on all my vehicles. About 5 cars already. Don't go cheap rout buy this oil and Off course buy Mobil 1 synthetic filter because if you think about it what is the point of good oil if filter cant stop all the bad stop.<br /><br />People think filter is not important and i think they are wrong. If you cant filter oil well than all junk just keep going in circle.<br /><br />Pros: can drive up to 12-15K miles<br />I drive about 12 every time<br />Less time oil changes between maintenance<br />Well priced<br /><br />Cons: None lol
B008BW3M6S|5|works great, pretty easy to install
B00EHHV2OU|4|Installed on 2015 ACE 29.3. TST 507 flow through sensors.<br /><br />Sensors do not fit front wheels with out modification of wheel covers. Valve extensions do not work.<br /><br />Cut a half moon shaped access for sensor in wheel cover with Dremel Tool.<br /><br />Will still have to remove wheel cover to add air when needed.<br /><br />This should be noted on product description.<br /><br />Electronics work well, easy setup.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Love these! Never lose a phone down the inside of your seat again!
B002NEV6GS|5|Everything is good about this product for my use. I am using to replace and repair cue stick tips
B0055LVFTY|5|Very nice and very fast shipping.. 😀😀
B000DN7Q3S|5|Replaced the 2x4 with these to keep my hood open. Great replacement. Works on my 99 JGC Laredo.
919900013X|5|looks really nice on my Camry only thing is I wish they were a little bit bigger for better visibility but you can see it fine
B0002JMF9I|4|Fast delivery good product
B008OWZ6LO|5|Fast delivery and easy to install.
B000JFNAAS|3|was just too lazy to go to store. Worked great for my application and is still in operational condition
B001O19INO|5|Service Engine light turned on and diagnostic testing showed a leak in the fuel system. The new cap fixed the problem and no more warning lights 2 months later!!!
B00O3QB67S|5|The item is great in my full size extended cab. I can see my whole back seat window to window.
B00LEBLI82|5|Fit perfectly and definately made the travel trailer brighter.
B00Q0HVKQU|5|Love this coin purse. It is larger than I imagined but it is wonderful.
B000EBONVW|5|Pretty good. Sturdy enough, and hooks are useful.
B00DYZ4AW2|5|These come apart very easily for a painless retrofit into other vehicles, just tiny screws hold everything together. Each section is a different circuit board, so all I had to do was extend the wires and then hot glue the boards in place. I took them apart and installed them into my BMW e30. The large taillight and brake light board is a nice upgrade from the single bulb tail and brake OE set up.
B002NT1R6W|5|yes fixed the speedometer
B001JT33F0|4|This is great for replacing old speaker wire. I used it on my Klisch 2.1 THX system for my computer. The wires had gotten wore out and needed to be replaced. I couldn't find anything anywhere until I ran across these. I was so glad I did. The only problem for me was the ends were not tinned. So I had to strip and tin them myself. But otherwise they did the job.
B00DSD5TIY|5|Husband loved it.  It's still in good shape, and it's summer monsoon season in Vegas...Hot and humid.
B00480BWCI|5|Helpful, functional product that is lightweight. This is a &#34;must have&#34; item for anyone with a camper of any size.
B00KZ3439Q|5|Great
B0008G5F3S|5|Awesome, perfect.  You will not be disappointed.  Great product!
B007Q1FGLY|5|Awesome
B00VQUXXWA|5|Since it is already summer, and the sun is shinning bright and hot we can not avoid having sun burn and heat rush.Kids especially have sensitive skin and easily get irritated due to extreme heat.The car's tint is not enough to protect them.I got this car rear side window shades for them.The shades are easy to install even my kids can stick them to the window with no sweat.It can cling perfectly to our car window.It has a reinforced frame and a UPF30+ which is good, against sun rays.It has a plastic sleeve with buttons to keep the sun shades after use.I hope the manufacturer of this product should consider also other colors other than black for aesthetic purposes.But just the same the product is very good.<br />I have this product in discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
B005QION0Y|5|but got the wrong size
B00U8695HK|4|I've only had it a week but the seller keeps harassing me about writing a review. So far, so good.
B008NMHDKW|3|I had it installed today.  It fit onto the engine OK, but the holes for the heat shield were in the wrong place, as in not even close.  I had them put the catalytic converter on anyway.  The muffler shop said it wouldn't be a problem. We'll see.
B00AMMC7R0|5|Love it very much
B001C9AEKE|5|Good fit, Great parts!<br />Bought 2.
B00F1I1ZZA|5|Awesome and arrived right now time
B000SL4AA2|5|Excellent. As advertised.
B0080E7JFC|5|Best filter for you e46 M3!
B00IEGBIRG|3|I ended up using the whole bottle on what should have only used up about 1/3 of it.  The first time through it didn't remove much and I was mad.  The second time it took quite a bit more.  The third time it took quite a lot.<br /><br />In the end it worked OK.  It didn't get all of the rust but it got most of it.
B00BALZWH4|5|Perfect! I got a brand new X-11 with the bike I bought, it was perfectly clean outside (never down) but worn out (and smelly haha) inside, so I changed all the part. My main issue was that it was XL (it is my usual size) but still too big for me (it fit well but I could twist around my cheeks, not cool!). So I changed all the liners (down to an L size) but the most important for downgrading or upgrading the size are the cheek pads. It formerly had a 35mm (felt flatter since worn out) so I ordered a 39mm pad (my cheeks are really flat) and now it fits snugly, perfect!!! Remember to wear an helmet which is pressuring (a lit bit) your cheeks and forehead (without giving you a headache). Now I can ride safely!!!
B001DBBTO6|5|Muy bueno
B00GS6HT04|5|Soft, and lightweight. This looks amazing with a black mini, tights and boots or over skinny jeans (I wear this one with grey skinnies) and tall boots. I love this tee! I get compliments and, &#34;Where did you get that??&#34; every time I wear it.
B00LG9112K|1|I expected it to be white and it came black.
B00FSBTYPS|5|Oh, my goodness! This part was an exact factory replacement part. The door shuts like it did right off the assembly line. I could not be happier. Great service as well!
B007XE5LTG|5|it is a lot better than the local stores for a lot less
B00G2CF9FQ|5|Great product very fast delivery and great price
B00KTIZPF8|5|WORKED FINE AND WAS VERY EASILY PROGRAMED
B0042OX8VS|5|Works on my 2001 4Runner. The other guy saying it didn't is wrong. He was probably trying to replace one of the 2 VSVs in the engine bay. This one is mounted to the charcoal canister between the rear axle and the spare tire. Use your stock jack handle (under the rear passenger seat which has a little pull cord and the rear of the seat bottom pulls up towards the front of the car) and lower the spare. Take a #2 screwdriver (a JIS one like a Vessel might be a good idea) with about a 6&#34; blade to remove the one screw. If the screw is rusted it's going to be a pain and you may need to drop the canister. Mine was not too rusty. If it is rusted, I recommend replacing it. I am fairly sure this one was an M4 thread (4mm). You'll want it about 8mm long (10mm is probably fine; 12mm long might need to be cut a little shorter). Use a stainless steel replacement and go torx or hex (&#34;allen&#34;) because they resist stripping out better than Phillips (though hopefully you won't need to replace this part again).<br /><br />I've read lots of reports that the screw is hard to get to. Honestly it was not. There are lots of vacuum lines there and it IS a bit tricky to place the new VSV in there correctly, but getting the screwdriver on the screw is easy. You want to approach it from the rear left corner of the vehicle (at an angle).<br /><br />Make sure when you install the new one that you don't get it upside down or you'll find your electrical connector is a tough reach and one of the vacuum lines is also not going to fit. To get the screw in, press the screw through the hole on the canister and just move the VSV around until it finds the hole (only the VSV itself is threaded, not the mount on the canister).<br /><br />Note that if any of your vacuum lines are bad, do NOT just use regular vacuum hose. Use fuel hose or &#34;fuel vapor hose&#34;. Regular vacuum hose typically will not stand up to fuel or fuel vapor.<br /><br />3 VSVs on the 2001 4Runner w/ Toyota P/N:<br />-Mounted to vapor canister near the gas tank - this Dorman part is compatible - 90080-91233<br />-Engine bay, driver side, there are two mounted next to each other. The one closer to the front of the car is: 90910-12245<br />-Engine bay, driver side, there are two mounted next to each other. The one closer to the rear of the car is: 25860-75230<br /><br />Not sure if Dorman has cross-refs for the latter 2, but thought I'd give this info for reference. Not sure which other Toyotas use the same parts but that's what the 2001 4Runner uses.
B00JXU7GR8|5|Best blind spot mirrors I've had so far.
B00KG577UA|1|It was a bad idea to order, did not meet my expectations at all.
B00HWWICVS|5|easy on and off, good quality
B000R2MTM8|5|excellent product.
B0007ZL174|5|Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ
B006WQSJWM|4|Shipped fast and fit great!
B00BR1TP2A|5|Wow, this light is bright! Great purchase!
B00VXZRKZE|5|Great buy. Worked perfectly and makes the truck look much newer.
B0009IQXFO|5|This car wash soap works very well.  It suds up well and makes washing the car easy since it removes most surface dirt.  Bugs and such do require scrubbing, but this is a good product.
B00BV6XWHU|5|Great and fast
B00SG8FMBU|5|High quality decal! Went on perfectly and easily
B00FSC1AO0|5|Perfect fit to replace out the lost cover.  I am suspecting when I hit the driveway curb, the cover came off and I did not even notice it until I got home.  With a big hole, it made the van look so ugly.  I receive this cover and I popped it in and it fit perfectly.
B000CN7904|5|very nice bushing set
B001DRLPJE|5|Fit and finish were perfect!  Of course this is an OEM manufacturer so I wouldn't expect anything less!
B005DZKORG|5|Easy Peasy
B00BEBCL8S|5|Factory OEM part fit perfectly!  Delivered promptly, too.
B001OMPJGS|5|Like night to day in terms of illumination.  People often click their lights at me, mistakenly thinking I have my high beams on when in fact- I hardly ever even use the high beams now.  Exceptional brightness and a rather wide illuminated path- great for safer driving in seeing Moose and Deer before they cross my path.  (It is as if they put night lights in Jeep Wrangler head lights- in comparison, these are like spot lights on high beam.)
B0000AYYU1|4|Included all the parts I needed to replace the impeller on my 2001 Maxum boat (with mercruiser engine)  Good price.  Including some instructions would be helpful, but google works too I guess.
B00153EYR6|5|Go Power is the best inverter out there and this makes life easier to manage appliance use on our boat.
B000C9S4RU|5|Whether these last 15 years as the originals did, I don't know. All I do know is that they fit perfectly. Amazon said they would fit my truck and were right. A little pricey (?) $17, but no one had better prices. Butt terminals are supplied. Made in Mexico
B003BZCZZE|5|They came just as described and work great

B00UCA8EEC|5|Prompt delivery,as advertised, i would buy again!
B000BRV5WY|5|works great
B00MUF4Q6M|4|Excellent product. The only problem is that the leather loop has a narrow opening and will not fit over wider belts. I wish that they made a wider opening. However, I gave it to my wife and she can make use of it.
B00B0KWO3U|5|100% satifyed
B000IZ3OH8|1|I didn't  get the rubber o'ring which goes around the top of the filter to keep the oil from leaking out, so the oil filter is no good without this seal..If you would send me this o'ring then I could use it next time I change my oil

B000H8U2S0|5|It was exactly as described, installed on my son's car in about five minutes, and it fit perfectly. Plus it was cheaper than the one from the auto parts store and arrived in just one day. So this was a win-win for me!
B00BZNOAIO|5|Thank you!
B00AINV47C|3|I like them but they don't fit very well.  Slide off all of the time.
B00PGCD8WY|5|Great addition to our truck.
B000C2YCFU|5|Recently replaced the motor on my Dad's JD Zero-Turn with a different motor. The new configuration required a shorter belt. This belt was a perfect fit for this purpose.

B00KLKKJ8C|5|Fit 350 worrier good
B00JSYJ3KW|4|The Allen head bolts should have been made out of black high carbon steel instead of stainless steel which is much softer metal.  We replaced them of course!
B00VA0WLW4|4|NICE CHAIR EASY TO PUT TOGETHER - WHEN YOU SIT IN IT YOU GET THE FEELING OF SITTING UP AND FORWARD AS IF IT'S LIFTING AND/OR PUSHING YOU - NO SINK IT'S RATHER FIRM - BUT ALL SAID - MAYBE THAT WILL MAKE IT LAST MUCH LONGER, I FIND THAT MORE CUSHY ITEMS WEAR OUT QUICK.
B000CODGZU|4|They work great.

B007HFT034|5|Very easy to install, only took a few minutes.
B0022ZN68Y|5|Sticks nicely once the excess is squeezed out.
B00T7NBXT8|5|I bought this light while keeping my fingers crossed because it had one review that wasn't helpful in the least. I thought I owed it a real review.<br />The price was right and it's the right length for my application. I've had it tucked under my roof rack of my FJ Cruiser for about a month now and I gotta say, it's worth every penny. I have it mounted between two KC plastic roll bar light mounts. It's not as bright as a two row LED would be but I love the low profile of the bar. Most people don't even notice it up there until I turn it on. It gives a flood light effect and not much of a spot but that's what I was looking for. I wanted to be able to light up a large area in front of the truck and that's what this bar does. I have had no issues with water intrusion or fogging.  I've driven through some really heavy rain storms and still no sign of moisture. A very good light for the price.
B00KB3NPRQ|5|Looks good on my challenger. Heavy duty chromed aluminum. Not like some of these that are plastic.
B00042KJQ4|5|nice and sturdy, great product
B007NZ7R92|4|It hasn't failed yet so that's a positive thing!
B004SL8568|5|Delivered on time. I got surprised that the price was 10 only at Christmas time.

B000LDIJ72|5|Item arrived promptly and was as described.
B00GRHRTEU|3|basic no frills, but how little the doors are off you do not need much more.
B000JZDU7G|5|Installed on my '04 V6 Ranger 4X4 three years ago. Removing factory intake contraption took way longer than installing this simple system. Noticeable increase in power & MPG. Can't claim any HP increase numbers, but I can swear to 1.5 MPG gain on the highway. Filter has been  virtually maintenance free. Clean once a year (low mileage driver). Definitely a good overall investment & almost paid for in fuel savings.
B006D9W5FA|5|Great product everbody that goes to the dunes shuld have a set of these
B00LQHR9GE|5|Very bright and looks awesome on my 90s chevy
B00FW14SX2|5|Fast service.  Good product.

B00XN1DAP0|5|nice
B000TCB602|5|Use them all the time.  Really like that they fold in.
B0009H529I|5|This filter is great for many reasons. First it's a great filter all around and will last a few thousand miles longer than others without filtering degradation. When installing or changing, the grip 'sprayed' onto the can is great. This is the brainchild of truck mechanics who would spray bedliner/undercoat onto oil filters to help when changing.<br /><br />10/10 would recommend and the only filter I use.
B00E1JNAC6|5|Does what it's supposed to. Works great.
B008RDFXFO|5|Item delivered on time, was as described

B000FOUB8M|5|Exactly what I needed for my truck to have items and tools stored safely in the truck bed!!
B000B8WMAW|3|This is perfect for camping and relaxing on vacation. It's light for carrying. However it is horribly annoying when you are carrying it and it pops out multiple times, nailing whomever is standing next to you. I guess it's light at least. Another issue, I ended up wrapping washcloths around the arm rests. These are the most horrible uncomfortable arm rests ever. You never seem to appreciate a camping chair armrest until you have used this one. And lastly, don't rock on this when people are sleeping. Although I tried to deny that it was me squeaking with every movement, but my case was clearly guilty when I stopped and the squeaking stopped. But it seemed to not to that before the camping trip so maybe it's just temperamental? Maybe it wasn't me squeaking! Overall a good buy but only if you really need a rocker vs a normal one
B001GF2PUQ|5|Perfect
B002OTKTVA|5|Very nice
B000COC67E|5|We have 4 vehicles in our big family and do most of our own maintenance. Brake jobs were always a pain, since we use basic jack stands and have to work close to the ground. But with the Torin Creeper Seat, the job is much more comfortable. It rolls easily on our rough concrete driveway and supports my 275 lb weight just fine! Can't imagine why we didn't buy it sooner! I especially like the smooth rolling soft casters; not noisy at all.
B00UJ95ZMU|5|GOOFIT cylinder kit is awesome. It was easy to install and the parts fits perfectly.Gain of torque and power was noticeable.Gives me a powerful experience. The cylinder is better built than original one.Excellent product at best price and came in timely.I am totally satisfied.
B000WKF2XS|5|Good brakes
B003908L3Q|5|Two of these fit perfectly as pushers on my 86 ford ranger  I placed them side by side. Used a relay to activate when the AC compressor clicks on. Now my AC is iced cold when Caught  in slow moving traffic.  Or waiting at the scales on a dump run. Make sure you check polarity, confirm which wire should be positive to get the desired air flow you need.  I have a yellow top ultima battery, with a new 80 amp alt. no stress at all to my electric system.  I used good wire, connectors, fuses. Never skimp on your cooling system. Over heating is the number one killer of engines. Was an easy project as fans arrived with holding mounts, zip type, I have all ready recommended to others.
B0018NG5MU|5|Very nice mats.  They look great in the bimmer
B00HNW8MJ4|3|This gets sticky and slippery but is better than my steering wheel. It stays put. This is easy to put on if you know what you're doing.
B00OT7IZ0W|2|Didn't fit my Suzuki bike even though they were supposed to. Weren't what I wanted or needed at all.  However, they never said they were an authentic Suzuki part, so they weren't lying.
B007TY8BOM|5|Only took three days to get,easy install, I give them a five star rating, work just as good as a factory one!
B005UGI7WW|4|Nice

B000BWCEC4|5|Right price and works as it should...
B0002H335A|5|Superb. I got these for my tractor, which doesn't weight a lot, but is very high off of the ground. These were well made and easy to install. The price was high, but fair for this quality.
B001KSAMAO|5|Perfect price for part and works excellent
B00JE61B22|1|Compressed the thing twice and it broke off (the shock shaft from the body) Don't want to bother returning it for the price I got it.

B00BY4X5MQ|1|Neither bulb worked.
B008NGVNDQ|1|Very poor quality and colors are dull, I would look elsewhere for this product.
B00FOON3ZQ|2|Says (brush) but it is shiny chrome. Now does not match the other side. Also the cover for the screw to attach has too shallow a pocket so it won't snap in.
B000C14HME|4|stock manifolds for cheap
B000KYX5JO|2|don't work. having problems talking with seller
B00KXK0GNI|5|Very good quality, has a little weight to it, but not too much. Great keychain for my Mustang, have even had a couple compliments on it, rare for a keychain, although I get more on my motorcycle keychain that says &#34;Remove Before Flight&#34;
B00PX6DYIG|4|Fits great over my leather seats for the summer.
B000BQYH6Q|4|work well, small enough to keep in the car or truck
B00RVEFO8G|5|Great and fast shipping
B00L3E0LQU|5|Fits 2015 Camry LE. I believe they actually call it a &#34;convenience net&#34;, as it is not designed to fit in your trunk which would require it to take up much more space and act as sort of a divider in the actual trunk itself. That was how the cargo net in my wife's previous car performed causing us to disengage it form it hooks on one side or the other to utilize the trunk for larger items. Instead this net stretches across the trunk opening and acts as catch all and flexible barrier. Wife loves it. Not really sure why it doesn't come with car standard as the cleats it is fastened to are already in place inside trunk. Bargain at twenty three dollars. Would recommend.
B006E4SKQ2|5|Fit like a glove....Love it!
B001PYU7FS|1|Poor quality part. Was leaking after instalation
B007OW603I|5|Fits my 2012 Sienna. Saved me a trip to the auto parts store.
B009S31VVW|5|The piece was perfect for my 2006 ford fusion.  Went in easy with the help of YouTube.
B002BG4WX2|1|didnt work
B009ISJJD4|5|Perfect. I have had so many people ask me where i got this. It is great quality!
B00G4ATR54|4|I really like this bike rack.  The only issue I've had are the arms holding the bike frames down.  The foam has torn on all of them.  I did call the company and they kindly replaced them.  I then did not push the arms down as tight on the frame, which seemed to help some, but on our last trip, two arms were torn again.  I called the company for some advice and I plan to try their ideas.  They were quite helpful.  That said, the foam shouldn't break.
B00NTU18KY|5|Its a cheap little device, but it does exactly what it is supposed to do.
B00L3FKPYW|1|Single worst compressor I've ever had the displeasure of using. The heatsink isn't properly attached to the pump, and when I tried to screw it back down, it simply wouldn't work. Either the screw is too short or it snapped, because it certainly isn't stripped and all it does is spin.  On top of that, the actual compressor itself is hugely frustrating to use. It ONLY works by setting a set PSI level; which in theory sounds great, but in practice is worthless. You see, obviously as you're putting air into the tire the gauge is going to be inaccurate until the pump is turned off. So if the tire is at 30 PSI and you have the compressor set to 36, it reaches 36 in like 10 seconds, then shuts off. However, then you watch the digital gauge slowly drop from 36, back down to 31 or 30, but the compressor never turns back on again.  So even though the digital gauge can be accurate, it obviously isn't while you're pumping air, and since you can't just let it run, it shuts off. The only work around is to either place a ridiculously high PSI limit on it, or constantly turn it and turn it off again. I recommend this to nobody.
B00PTQOF4W|1|This is a complete joke of a wiring kit. Wired it to my truck with a 42 inch led light bar, started driving down the road, turned on the light bar and the wires started smoking! I ran back to my house as fast as I could and stripped all of the melted wire out of my truck. In the process burning my hand and the inside of my headliner, with smoke filling my entire cab!! I highly recommend a professional install before you look at this wiring harness. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star rating but am forced to.
B00ZN5TBRU|5|WAS DELIVERED IN THREE DAYS. WORKS TO MY EXPECTATIONS AND THE THE SELLERS CLAIMS. 5 MIN. INSTALLATION. THEY ARE A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER CONVENTIONAL HIDs.
B004GC2E16|5|They are just what we wanted and arrived on time.
B008X02MBE|4|Nice product at roughly half the price of the big name brands. Fit well except for the brake line hole, I had to file it a bit on both the right and left strut. All the creaking, clunking and squeaks are gone.We'll see how long they last.
B009ZXCSO4|5|Like the Chamberlain's furniture milk I purchased, this product did not disappoint. It took a summer's-worth of grime off my car seats, and they look brand new again. Application is simple and quick - literally a 10-minute process. Worth the investment, and I'll continue to use this on my car seats to keep the vehicle looking great.
B00SNOC1UM|1|less than 6 months old hardly ever been used and leds are out 4 leds are no longer working looks weird cant return product
B005NLQAHS|5|Works perfectly with my Mk4 VW Jetta and nexus 7 tablet with Torque Pro.
B00ANT1GE2|5|Met expectations. Will make further determination after first charge cycle in 2 months.
B0009IQZH0|4|The Meguiar's microfiber isn't as plush as I thought it'd be... you'll want to use the towels folded in quarters, or at least halves. I was also surprised at the amount of lint that was shed during the first use. They do a very good job in the application of spray waxes, wiping on and wiping off without leaving streaks. One minor annoyance is the tag -- would it have been to difficult to have maybe just imprinted their name and fabric details on the surface of the cloth itself?<br /><br />Finally, the product descriptions talks about &#34;maximum absorbency.&#34; This is not a product you'd want to use for drying your car -- okay, maybe 'spot' drying -- they're just not big enough. Stick to using it for waxing.
B000CN74EK|3|I didn t feel any differences on road.<br />But easy to install when you need to change your stock Bushings

B00GS4EXLY|5|Perfect replacement. Bought a truck that already had these installed. One side went out. Works great now. Have had it for months still works like new.
B004AIEY3C|5|So far good after a few thousand miles. Needs to be replaced and people dont even know about it
B00RKKWFHY|5|Excellent. Fit like a glove the first time. Love it when a plan comes together.

B000T9LZDI|5|Exactly as promised. Love it!
B0009IQZSE|5|Fit perfectly in my 1989 Jeep Comanche 4.0 l. Fram has always been a trusted company. It swept across mechanic shops all over the place in 2006. With interactive display, you could often times see the difference for yourself first hand. Fram is not only of great quality. It also has one simple characteristic that sets it aside from the other brands. That is the textured rubber on the top, it allows you to replace the oil filter hassle free and with only your hands. No wrench required.
B0002SRCMO|5|Like
B00S0QLUUK|5|I bought this as a spare.  Quality and construction matched the original exactly.
B008BA97WS|5|Need a bit of modifying to fit the E38, but they work great and look good.
B00XMO5PWY|5|easy to install ... great color ... bright ... love the look
B006DX187W|5|Excellent
B001O153MY|5|Awesome!
B00YB470EA|1|Product was cheaply made & broke during installation with minimum pressure applied. No installation instructions were provided & parts seemed to be missing compared to other kits. Returned item last week & still waiting for a refund. Be cautious when purchasing!
B000Q0PG9E|1|This item comes shipped with main gaskets where the locators are too far apart and as such make the gasket 'bow' upwards and fall out. It is impossible to mount the manifold with these gaskets. trust me, I tried, and the locators dislodged resulting in the manifold not making a good seal and coolant then flowed into the air intakes, resulting in hydraulic lock-up. I then disassembled the entire job again and installed Fel-Pro updated gaskets MS98000T. I waited for the new gaskets to arrive then reinstalled. Same problem - coolant flowing into intake chamber... Well this is clearly a manufacturing problem, now the issue (and probably always was) is that the machining of the unit was poor and will not allow a good fit to the vortec heads.. In all the time it took to work this out, Amazon will not replace the Manifold.. Hopeless. I've done my cash and have a useless piece of cast aluminium..which needs to go to the tip.. Not to mention I have to pull my brand new fuel injectors out of the manifold, which will break the clips on the injectors.. VERY POOR Dorman.. Will never buy from you again.. You have cost me nearly $1000...
B000BUU5WW|4|Good product...
B00KO77C5A|5|Just what I was looking for in a 5th wheel hitch. Excellent quality and fast delivery service!
B002YKBPXA|5|A very handy tool for knocking on tires or whatever.
B00JBIC6TA|5|It's very good .. delivery was very fast .. and it fits perfect and has an awesome look
B0009IBJBM|4|works fine
B005HMOSM2|5|I have been running these pants for two seasons now. They are great pants for aggressive riding that live up to Klim's reputation. They are warm enough for backcountry/freeriding down past -20F with just light thermals underneath and breathable enough they are comfortable to the mid 30s. The built in snow gaiters are perfect for keeping the snow out of your boots on the deep powder days. The built in knee pads (soft foam, don't get in your way) are great for saving your knees from bruising when they slam into the cowling during aggressive riding/ jumping. After trying a few brands, these are by far my favorite. I would buy again without a second thought.  Sizing: For jeans I wear a 32 waist and 34 inseam with a pretty athletic build.. The large tall's fit me perfect. Its nice finding snow pants with long enough legs for me
B0042AFBMG|3|so so, but at least the right length studs.  wish flat washer was better quality and nuts were brass.
B00M5D8D54|5|e
B005NLQAHS|5|Plugged it into my car, connected my phone to it via bluetooth, fired up my phone's app and it worked like  a charm.<br />What a time to be alive!
B00D8TL7RK|5|Peace of plastic.
B00094I1SA|5|Nice
B00480J4QY|2|This product does not have the brightness as it advertises.
B008HZNEEO|3|Metal shapes are not precisely compared with my original part (TOYOTA)
B00E3E48DO|5|Item fit perfectly. Nice and snug! I have a 2000 Ford Expedition. The bolts and control arms were the exact size that i needed. The items arrived on time.
B00MP08TOC|5|I installed these under my truck as courtesy lights, to turn on when the doors are opened.  It's a little unconventional application but they work well.<br />HOWEVER, I did take the advice of another poster and first installed some silicon at the edge of the glass where it meets the housing.  I also installed a glob at the back of the housing where the wire comes out.  A couple extra buck for that silicon, but I think it's worth it.
B0006NCGL2|5|worked great , no problems
B000XEGEWG|5|Use these to wash my car. They work great for washing. Don't love them for drying. I use old towels to dry and they work better. I do enjoy the colors also, smile.
B000RXNLK6|5|Works very well and is easy to apply.  Car doesn't seem to show spots after rain as it did before.  Keeps a nice shiny look.
B00ZGQCN8A|4|I gave it 4 stars because it didn't come with the 2 clips or the 4 screws needed to attach it to the refrigerator. There is nothing wrong with that, but it needs to be in the description. If I had not saved the broken one, I would not have had any way to attach it. So, buyer beware, save your old parts when purchasing this product.
B00HG85A4U|5|Very nice
B0024E6ZRW|5|This was a savior for my latest trip.  The support of my older RV had gotten loose and the stair was very unstable.  I used this to hold the mechanism up until I get it properly repaired.  I'll still use it to stabilize the step once the repair work is completed.  Nice addition.
B008XNZZ7O|4|really does minimize the cigarette smell in my car. However after 2 weeks or so the product stops working as powerfully.
B002GO784Y|5|Easy to install and holds up good
B003RVTANC|5|This is a great replacement entry remote. It is affordable, comes with programming instructions and it works as designed.<br />Teddy I.
B002MQCYO0|5|WOW !!! I have used a lot of cleaners in my days this is awesome I WILL BY MORE OF THIS PRODUCT
B00DSD4NTA|5|I got this Mickey decal for the other side of my camper. Very easy to install. Had some problems with my order at first. But it was all solved easily in the end. Even got a mini Mickey Mouse Wink Decal to compensate the problems we had. Loved that.
B000C7ZQFA|5|Fits my 1998 Ford F-150 4.6L V8 perfectly. I replaced the original part that was no longer working. This made every difference for performance. I had parked my vehicle while I was out of town on leave. After returning 18 months later, I had to begin to solve error codes coming up from my engine. After replacing this part my engine had improved performance and response.
B003V5EU5W|5|Excellent
B003IHMHLW|1|This trailer jack is of poor internal quality. This was my second one. I lubricated and cleaned this one more meticulously and it also did not last more than 2 yrs before starting to seize and being difficult to turn. Now I am in search for a trailer jack of good quality. According to reviews, even the cheapest ones are excellent... UPDATE:  A Fulton basic jack, I bought after these two &#34;Pro Series&#34; junks, works like a charm...no signs of rust or seizing/hard cranking
B0009OR8ZM|5|very high quality, american made, will last a lifetime.  finally a good strong pair of snap ring pliers.
B008BLKI2U|1|First off it doesnt come with the sticker in the picture and it came wrinkled and was hard to install plus it looks like s***,waste of five dollars
B00QQD1I3S|5|Great product! This oil drain makes it really easy to drain oil with minimal mess. It has also withheld under quite a bit of abuse. The oil is able to drain very quickly and doesn't splash! We have loved how portable and easy to move this drain is. We have been very impressed with the performance of this product and would highly recommend it!
B00JEGXVL6|5|I just bought a monthly membership to a local car wash. I was worried about losing the stock antenna for my truck. This item looks awesome on my white Titan with black trim. There's no noticeable difference in the radio reception. I'm glad I bought this!
B000CMHVGM|5|Easy to install, took about 10 minutes and it has worked great.
B003TQ2WOY|5|great scales makes life in the pits much easier
B0014H94UA|4|Works great
B0051SFW5E|5|Good product, easy to install & works well. I'd buy this one again.
B000IYT158|5|Security for my gas tank.
B00BTGSGFK|5|Great Applicators!! Have washed them couple of times and they are still holding up.
B000CFME2A|5|got what I wanted when I expected it, thanks
B001AMEG20|1|I just had  these installed and found that both of the air inlet valves leak. One of the PSI signs can hardly be seen. This kit is junk, the air inlet valves are the main part of the system.  Find another kit through another company.
B002803TCG|1|Ordered these lug nuts for an exact replacement on my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  It had chrome lug nuts on black wheels.  These would have made all the difference.<br />When I opened the package and when to install, the lugs were much smaller in thickness than the factory lugs.  So much in fact that I felt like they were too narrow and might slip through the wheel.  I repackaged them and returned.
B006TMPLSO|5|Came in perfect shape. Extremely satisfied!
B0019C2VIW|5|great fit, but took sometime to put on
B008564ZQG|5|Was at described, and worked great . Thanks 👍🏻

B00MO9T9SE|5|Snap on tightly. 75-80 MPH no concerns of them coming off. The Convex outside mirror is just a skoshe small but not that big of a deal.
B00MG687JW|5|I used it to jump start my cars twice last month. Worked great.
B00761KHOA|5|A plus
B001DRNBA0|4|they fit and work great
B008032NJK|4|best bang for the buck
B0000AYFTH|5|Satisfied!
B006P8A7T0|5|VERY NICE PATCH FOR MY NAVY, &#34;WHITE NICK FURY&#34; SHIRT. THE BOX WAS WAY TO BIG FOR THE 4 INCH PATCH STAPLED TO A BOARD, AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE PHOTOS I ATTACHED. YOU'LL LAUGH AT THE LABEL WARNING FOR KIDS. GREAT PATCH, THANK YOU Hot Leathers
B000EGZ5FK|5|Yep, it's a funnel.
B001JT5QBO|5|Worked like a charm...wasnt that loud like some said.  Does take up a cup slot, but oh well.
B00JV3U7VE|5|looks sharp
B0018GSVG0|1|only refund me $8.33 so i am not  a very happy costumer
B00ACN6OAU|5|Arrived quickly and is of excellent quality. Also came with other various stickers!
B00JRHI1LM|5|Nice and hard if you have a bad back its great! Fit like a glove!
B00L849724|5|Everything came and pretty quickly!<br />Thanks!!
B010N7RW2S|3|Started with a wonderful excitement. I get this in the mail in the evening. start my Nissan Versa 1.8L that evening and was happy! Mesured battery voltage before jump, it was 10.12V. Since it started wonderfully, I unplugged it and kept it for charging until next day morning. Next day morning outside temperature is 60 Degees F and took out the jumper setup to start the car so that i can drive it to the repair shop. Measured battery voltage before jump, it was 9.98V.  And it failed! FAILED to jump my tiny small engine Versa! I tried it 3-4 times, all fail. The red light at the jumper cable kept blinking. So, frustrating!!! May be the lower voltage was too low for this jumper to handle. Something ANKER should look at.  I have used several Anker products and all were great, EXCEPT THIS! Returned it the next day. This sucks.  Had to call road side assistance to jump it!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Updated Take Anker sent me a replacement jumper a week later and it worked. SO, may be I got a one-off product. Good job Anker.
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Great Tool. Reasonable Shipping. A Good Investment.
B000EDOSKQ|5|Made a roof vent install very easy to do.  Will buy again when the next roof vent is replaced.
B0019D1S6M|4|nice jacket but the sizes run small
B00KTS6M78|5|It's awesome. I have a Cyclone 3912 which, anyone who does, knows the landing gear they put on these (and other models as well) are fairly well under-engineered. Old gear box (Venture) was plastic and like everyone else who got stuck with these, sooner of later one of the plastic tabs will snap off. I lived on 'borrowed time' for almost a year by using a pipe clamp strap to keep it in place but the time had come to replace gear box (noises inside were getting really bad). Got a Venture aluminum gear box locally (Amazon has these too) but ordered this Strom-Carl heavy duty motor to replace the Venture one that came w/ the plastic gearbox. Old one still worked, but in that Heartland's incredibly stupid design makes access to the motor/gearbox an incredibly difficult event, as long as I was in the area I decided to beef-up the motor. Motor fit perfect on the aluminum gearbox (I imagine these are all pretty much the same for all single-motor tandem landing systems unless you looking for the 'fast' lift solutions) and while in there I shot some oil into the worm and repacked grease in leg gears.
B004I0Y7Z2|5|Item fit perfectly on our Suzuki SX4 2011.
B001FAGL0M|5|What a deal! Sure it's gray, not black... but hey better than that ratty stuff you might have now!!  Fits pretty good, minimum wrinkles. Not too hard to install.
B00892EW8W|5|As promised!!!
B009AA2GQC|5|Worked great and solved my &#34;service air bag&#34; warning.
B00JUX1DRW|5|Definitely recommend this. Use it on my R6 and I love it. Watched he Ram installation video on YouTube. Its so easy
B00067BVDC|5|These bulbs are bright and white but not too powerful for driving in town.  The transition from brights to dim is pleasant. And the service was excellent.
B0007RDVH0|5|works great on the motorcycle whitewalls
B000LQN0CI|5|good fit and finish, I used flat washer to install the shorty light bar, the holes in my fender were larger than the new bolts that came iwith the new light bar. looks better then OEM
B004B8GTQG|5|WOW - this stuff is amazing!  It does everything the manufacturer states and more!
B009FNWTIO|5|Very nice & just as described
B004LF3B4C|5|It was the right product at a very good price!
B000J3ZVHA|5|Made especially for my car. It's excellently made and does a great job. You can order one for your make and model too. Better than a generic. It cuts down on summer heat very well. I paired it with rain guards which allows you to vent you car while parked by allowing you too leave your windows open a bit without having rain water get into your car. Especially good for people like me who are sensitive to heat.
B004DDPHAI|5|Excellent battery.  Keep it on a conditioner and have never had a problem after years of ownership.
B000BONJRQ|4|Great Product!!!!!!!
B00T2GT9L4|5|Great tool. Would love it more if the jump leads were longer. At least 3x longer.
B002N4GPAA|1|I bought this to place on a guitar case for my Gibson Les Paul standard I bought used I wanted to add this sticker to the case however it is way too small to make a diff. it's only about 6 inches wide and 5 inches tall I was hoping for something alot bigger.
B00M4QWTV6|1|Parts came on time and in perfect condition..BUT!.. for assembly...instructions were faded n unreadable...the instructions did not even specify which lettering goes to where...one of the struts was unlike any of the 5...so had to rig n improvise..overall..very dissappointed with instructions..took more time needed to assemble with poor unreadable instructions!...
B004325QZ0|5|Happy with this mat
B00M08TDH6|5|Great enhancement to my 2013 300xc KTM. Improved bottom end and middle range power.
B00F4PH2E8|5|Great product!  Nice fit!
B0097M85AE|5|Great product
B004RCRS9I|1|Total crap. Broke off on my first car wash. It will scratch Black paint. Any paint for that matter.
B00EE56UAG|5|Great product, great seller!
B00BFU7214|1|Dont buy it its not the one the picture
B00YFHKLOY|4|Does what it should do.
B009DK9PFY|4|fixed my problem its been a month no issues
B00UMQ5P8O|1|The bolts are rusted already and it really doesnt fit well
B00CA6XBDU|1|Does not stick correctly, had to cover it with clear tape.  Otherwise the barrel sags.
B007N6POLE|4|well made, easy to adjust
B0044GB6MM|3|great price, works as expected
B00U6CBAEW|5|I was looking for a quality storage unit for the back of my car, and I ordered this one. It’s great! I have been so happy with how many pockets it has, and the amount of storage available is amazing. It’s very durable and has lasted quite awhile without showing any wear or sagging. For the price I really think I couldn’t have found a better one. No more messy car for me!
B00030410W|5|Great product, fast shipping
B00B3W5H5M|5|I had this on my wish list but no one would buy it for me as a gift.  However, I did get an Amazon gift card so I put it to good use.  I received it quickly, took it out to my 2005 Chevy 4 door truck and snapped it into the door.  Perfect fit!
B00IDW3V1M|5|onan is always on track!!
B00GHT8NAC|5|fits perfect!  works well.
B00DPNBXHI|5|Had no problem returning wrong size
B00JWMV17I|5|works great for the winter for snow blowing my drive way in Michigan!!
B004AXESTM|5|Dont waste money on the more expensive HID lamps, these work perfectly and you cant beat the price. Great product and superfast shipping.
B009JXYBLS|5|Still good since Sep 2014. no problems at all
B00BZQZCE2|5|Has a little bit of squeak when going over bumps, doesn't bother me though. Easy enough to fix with spacers, felt or more washers.<br /><br />Made the rear of my vehicle 100% better! Way more room for activities.
B0068ESCZC|4|Great seat way better than stock
B00CX7KXLE|4|Neat units, one unit had a connection that needed tightened up.
B00ULQXJM4|2|The sticker lived up to it's name, not good quality at all. Oh well, now I've got a s*** sticker for my s***car.
B004LX3AXQ|4|If 4 1/2 stars was an option, this would get an extra half star.  I'm using this to maintain the yellow-top optima on my Kubota genset, and so far it's doing a great job.  Comes with a set of leads with ring terminals, and a set of leads with alligator clips, which is really nice.  Cords are nice and long, and plenty flexible.<br /><br />My only gripe is that there's no way to mount it.  When used for maintaining the battery on something, it would be nice if there was a way to permanently or semi-permanently mount it.
B000R308RA|4|I am not using it underneath my tailgate because I don't have one of those I do have it on my headache rack for my flatbed truck it looks great easy to install
B005VUJVKE|1|Ordered this part as identified for a 1999 Chevy Silverado.  Took the time to research and verify that I was getting the right part with high quality instead of the cheaper, flimsy knockoff.  Guess what!  It didn't fit!  Very disappointed!
B000CSPDB6|5|Beats the Honda Bugflector hands down.  Easy to install, but be very careful when you tighten the included self tapping bolts, especially the outer ones.  If you strip the threads in the hole, no worries...Just bang it a few times (very lightly) and flatten the hole out, then re-tap it. I would recommend tapping the holes first, before you put the bugflector on your vehicle.  But once it's on, it is really nice looking !  I opted to put the stick on bumpers on the underside of the bugflector instead of sticking them to my car.
B000TYOS3C|5|Great!  fast delivery and perfect fit.  Best part is that this manufacturer had the smarts to add securing tape to the inner side to prevent the loose fit problems of the past.
B001F0GZZ8|5|Works well. You may want to actually scrub any dirt off prior with soap and water. This appears to be more of a barrier protectant they a cleaning solution. It leaves a wax like feel on your hands afterward, so it will provide some weather protection. Makes my boat seats looks great.
B008OIH1X4|5|Exactly as advertised. Great product.
B00542UUWW|1|cheap junk
B004GCAJK4|5|Excelent
B003YZ6LTC|5|Works great.  It was the exact right part and installed easily.
B0009N0W2Y|1|Does not withstand extreme heat. Melted all over dashboard. Does not point north all of the time.
B000C42QE2|5|Works.
B00L1S0JU6|5|Just received it and tried it on my car and dryed my car very well after washing it. Thank you for a awesome product
B008B8971G|5|Very nice quality product. I didn't use the screws included instead I used black zipties which was much easier to install. I also had found an RS emblem that fit perfectly through the grille.
B001449KS4|5|After this product w/stripper & wax, I was simply amazed, astonished, shocked how my bath & kitchen floors gleamed with clean and shine.<br />Simply put its a great combination to get years of wax & dirt build up sparkling clean.  yes five (5) stars.
B00WVU7U1O|1|This is in no way made for a Mini Cooper. Other than the coupling fitting the throttle body, there was no compatibility. It doesn't fit under the hood. The PCV line is too short and too small of diameter. After cutting the pipe at the middle of the bend an 1-1/2&#34; from the nipple it almost fit, but it is still smashed between the  transmission mount and the hood / bonnet. If your looking at buying this for a base model Mini Cooper you will need to have some fabricating skills to make it work.
B003WLQNBE|5|Works perfectly for our 2004 Honda Element. Seems to actually run smoother than the drivers side that has a shop replacement.
B0036GGFV8|5|Love the bag, is a little bigger than I expected but it fits great on my bike plus the extra room came in handy the day after install. Install took some time but I think that's more about my bike than the bag. I would definitely recommend to friends.
B00EPDLC6E|5|looks good and a little tough to install but love it
B00ZECEDBQ|3|Light is very brigh you can see forever it lights  it lights up a 20 acre field but what you see in the pictu is not what you ge you got a ligh last two bolts on the side for mountin and cannot find a mount for the ligh have to buy on and modify it to fit the light
B00D50EG6G|5|Great deal. Solid quality parts. Now rides like a new car. Saved $1,200. Watch the youtube video for installation instructions. You will need a pickle fork to separate the ball joints. The ball joints are tough to separate. Also a 21mm and 22 mm wrenches and similar sockets are necessary.
B00IA10VNC|5|nice and matched helmet
B001OQW5AM|5|Just what we wanted and arrived on time.
B008HZKBD6|3|I wish i could give it a five stars. The brake feels great, I changed them with the routers together. BUT, be mindful, CHECK the sensor before you get everything set up. My first order, the sensor does not work, the &#34;brake wear&#34; light was on the whole time, but I didn't know until I have installed everything. When the replace order came, I install the sensor first before I take off any other parts (just plug it in with your car first) and it work. So now i have to redo everything from the beginning but at least i know the reason why.
B004HCM9GK|5|Works great and looks great. I would purchase again
B005FKN3QI|5|Came on time, price was really good and now I am writing this feedback after more than 6 months. They work just great. Installation was easy I did it myself.
B00STRWYOQ|5|Easy to install within 30 minutes each side. Rides great.
B00R1M4542|3|Great little filters, at least 2 of 3 were. The third came with a hole built in which made it I useable. Would have liked to have contacted seller before leaving a review but phone app doesn't give me that option.
B007ZGF1Z6|4|seems fine. not quite as stiff as snow's line but seems okay. Time will tell.
B01068FSJI|4|Fit fine with NOCO Military terminals using 3 each- 4 gauge cables on the (-) & (+).  Highly recommend but I can not LOVE any auto part.
B000VHM19A|2|overpriced & underperforming
B000BWAP3E|4|just what i needed
B003RF8VEC|3|It's really too small for anything but a child.
B0006V2BSC|4|Work as advertised fit well
B00T2XWQCQ|2|It barely covered my scooter seat and the Velcro straps are extremely cheap and easily tear off to don't hold the seat in position.
B0063IVZO8|5|can not tell you how great this tool is
B00CD261HO|5|Great brakes for stock replacements, Have a little better bite to them than stock plus they look great! Would recommend to anyone with an F150!
B002DV1CUG|5|Wow this items makes a HUGE difference in the Hot Hot Summer! Total Life saver! Fits PERFECTLY! It almost sticks to the window by itself it fits so well! A+
B009UIUX3M|5|I love it! Very subtle, yet displays its intent.
B004BSUYW6|4|Doesn't work for scion tc. Didn't say that it did, but just so people know.<br />Seems to be good quality none the less
B000CSEZ42|5|No problems with this order.
B009IF1IKY|5|part fit exactly, shipment was quick.
B001EP0G72|5|It works.  No mounting screws were included but none were advertised.  Like others have mentioned, wiring diagram/colors may be different than your vehicle.  I don't think this is a fault of the connector, the industry standard is not so standard especially when you get in to the home-built trailers and repairs.
B009AFKXYE|4|Fits really good
B00D3XVVRM|5|Very nice heavy made bracket , holes actually line up unlike ----tech 's do .
B00JAXS12C|5|Love these in my wife's 2014 Nissan Rogue SL.  Match the color as well.
B000M5YYIW|4|Good strong cotter pins for replacements when needed.
B001CA9D14|5|work perfect, little problem with the steel band
B008NB3CIK|5|Very handy skid steer attachment.
B00HTP8N0I|5|Worked as described.
B00E5P180M|5|After some 100+ items purchased on Amazon, time for my 1st review... While trying to identify the right / best trunk mat without spending $150 on Weathertech - reviews were contradictory if not misleading.  Cutting was easy, grip on carpet is more than adequate, any &#34;rubbery odor&#34; is minimal at first, dissipate within days.  Fits perfectly in 2014 Porsche Cayenne Diesel & purchased similar from same manufacturer for my kids 2013 Ford Fusion.
B009PJJG1Q|1|Wrong part!
B003NHDPO0|5|Exceeded my expectations....easy to install ......easier to live without having to grab and support the weight of a dropping tailgate.
B00UB3MRXE|5|Excellent product
B00EQ0LGE4|2|Good light bar but it's not 24&#34; unless u count from bracket to bracket
B003YCINNM|5|They need a couple of washes before you get most of the fuzzies off but work great as gym towels!
B004C443PS|5|After having foot surgery I was confined to a wheel chair for seven weeks.  My hands were becoming blistered from pushing the wheels so my husband ordered these gloves for me to use.  They have really helped.  My hands are no longer suffering from the effort of wheeling the chair.
B005BNZ9UM|3|These work well on pavement or solid ground (gravel), but flex excessively on soft ground. They do help spread the load but if you have large pads these really aren't worth the expense. In fairness I have a 38 ft. 5th wheel toy hauler with self levelers that weighs a little more than 8 tons.
B0041CFXF0|5|great fit, looks good, awesome ride
B001TJZ6IC|4|You get what you pay for. Works for me.
B001UC8WKM|5|Replaced 1 bad & 3 aging sensors on '08 Chevy. Actually respond to pressure changes much more quickly the oem units they replaced. You will needs the programming tool but, it takes less than 2 minutes to train the new set.
B00IW33UPO|5|Works great!! All you need is a screw driver to install it.
B004QDN518|1|Higher pitch than what I as looking for but it is loud. UPDATE... the horn only worked for about 13 months. I would not recommend anyone buy this piece a garbage!
B004QEJ6ZQ|5|Perfect fit w/ bolt.
B002MBEA1K|5|Works good
B00T834JO8|4|These fit great and are performing well. If you have a v6 toyota or lexus from the 90s, you need these.  I could not find them ANYWHERE locally, and was glad to be able to get them.
B00ELR3FT6|5|My hatch no longer slams down onto my head.  Success!
B0002JN56A|5|Easy to use and worked great!
B0093E8SRG|5|fast shipping and good quality product.
B00LMVN8GO|5|I love this, only problem I had was that I didn't realize the top of the decal came off like the bottom, so when I placed my name on the decal, I didn't place it directly on the decal. I had to take it off of the plastic and replace it on the decal itself.  Probably if I were more familiar with decals i wouldn't have needed more instructions.  But in this case, for me, more instructions were needed, but not supplied with the product.
B00GDBKVGI|5|Is perfect  price i hope get more stuff in good price like this
B006F94Z88|4|Fits like a glove.
B0041CDPQO|5|Plugs directly into the pigtail you plug your Battery Tender into. Ran it into my saddle bag and there's still about 2ft of wire left so you can run it anywhere on a bike. Good product.
B000HBNV8U|5|I use this to sit I use this to seal oil pan on my 7.3 L diesel Ford truck. It worked!
B00GBW894A|3|Didnt want the faded looking version of this. And was bigger than i though it would be.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|EXCELENTES
B000E7WLJW|3|The bag is great and very well built. The starps are very difficult to figure out. You need a mathmatics degree to understand how they work. It was easier for me to purchase a cargo net and throw the straps in the garbage. Would be easier if the strap system were bonge or permenant attached.
B0027XYKZO|5|Fit the truck perfect. Made a lot of difference
B00IN5X2P4|5|Nice liner, made of rubberized plastic, keeps spills off the carpets.
B00SBZAG5U|1|The covers for the screws did not fit.  So now I have a tag with exposed screws.  Not what I was expecting.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I purchased this sunshade for my girlfriend's Infiniti G37 sedan and it fits perfect. She said it actually covers the dash and the whole window. In the Texas summer heat it is definitely making a difference. Especially since the car has black leather seats. I would highly recommend this sunshade for anyone in a midsize vehicle.
B00AC6Y9S6|5|This bag is awesome I have a road King and the saddle bags hold my leathers, tools and first aid stuff. The bags holds every thing I need to take for a long multi-day ride.
B0032J1KAK|2|Did not work for me.
B00NKUHMIU|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B0002F6688|5|Well built and work fine.
B004ZLF65Y|5|better than expected
B005HYAIOW|4|Received on time I put belt on scooter hope lasts will up date. It says MMG Kevlar on belt no place of manufacture.
B00JXAH7NQ|5|good
B00OGUKSYI|5|Happy with this lights
B00850DBDA|4|Genuine Mopar part. Fit in my truck perfectly.
B000I66JEM|5|Nice ... very handy.
B00X2TUW1I|5|These work great.  I liked them so much a bought another set for my other vehicle.
B004ZF3KA8|5|A++ stuff. I'll be buying more. Color temp is nice and accurate and build is perfect.
B004ZF4F2U|4|Good quality. Installed with the digital rectifiers to stop the pulsing and warning lamps. I had to cut the square 3 prong adapter off the kit I was replacing and solder it to this kit. This kit came with the newer style headlamp plug.<br />Works great. High and low beam function.
B00192JGA8|5|Does what it is intended to do
B003YMBO2E|5|Fit perfect ...look awesome!!
B000X25OYW|5|The product was everything advertised
B00JRHPDZ4|5|My boyfriend LOVES this hat and gets compliments every time he wears it.
B000O09U8E|5|Worked like a charm seat will now go back and forth. Was able to install without removing the seat. hardest part was getting the old connecter unplugged.
B00029WYEY|5|This product was very simple to use and it worked very well. I recommend this product.
B005MZZF8A|5|just what I was looking for -prompt delivery-very impressive magnetic decal-thanks
B00G23UYAU|1|Not sure if this is a good product or not, but I ordered it in July and maybe it will arrive for Christmas...just saying.
B008RJMY9G|5|Perfectly foot for my 2005 evo mr.
B0083TYGSW|5|We purchased these covers since our seats had slight tears due to wear and the sun. They look very nice and are pretty snug do it doesn't move around. Just be careful not to pull to hard when your putting them on. Also, worth the price compared to purchasing new seats @ $1,000+.  I'm definitely happy with the product so far.
B00XZCGZQ8|5|Excellent jacket meeting all my expectations.  You can ride cool even in high temps 90's,  Sizes run true, so if you need extra room go size up.
B000CAINRK|5|I absolutely love this product. I've ordered several of these to keep one in each car and one for my purse strap. I have a medical condition and seatbelts are excruciating for me. I wish I had found these 15 years ago. They are like little pillows of heaven on my shoulder and it takes the pressure off my collarbone. I recently had bilaterial surgeries for this condition. These have been invaluable while recovering and for car rides to and from Physical Therapy. They are very inexpensive and completely worth buying.<br />In terms of durability, one of my cats puked on one of mine and we couldn't wipe it clean, so we machine washed it. It held up just fine inside the washing machine. I've had my oldest seatbelt pad for about 5 months now and it's good as new. I have recommended these to other people with the same medical condition as I do, and they also liked the product. This thing is a life saver when it comes to pain!
B000BHL0WY|5|Serves its purpose. Great product
B00VQJRC4G|4|Works as intended.
B00GFDAAF6|5|Good product, works fine.
B00OKTJ7LU|5|Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ
B008JYXYNY|3|It works. What can you say? I'm in different vehicles every day, so these are exactly what I needed. A little expensive for what they are, but they do work.
B005BNYY26|5|Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ
B000VKODGG|5|They look just like the OEM filters. While the instructions were somewhat clear, I found an online video that was more specific; however, despite the clearer instructions, getting them in was a challenge since they stack onto each other in a slot but the slot is big enough for just one to go in a time meaning that after inserting the top filter, you have to hold it up rather awkwardly until you get the bottom one to slide in. Tough, but doable!
B00X9R5DTO|1|not impressed . very vague instructions as to how to get them connected to the factory horn button
B0038KVOZE|5|was exactly right.  very satisfied
B00MR57TXM|5|Easy to install and looks good.
B001NW7YD0|5|Works great
B007WWS1GO|5|Worked great
B005UUIECQ|5|Fantastic
B00GZWEN82|5|LOVEIT !!
B000RFUF12|5|This works great.
B0064FXRWI|5|Easy to install, and they look great.
B0002L78CU|5|It works great in my Murano!! Completely covers the windshield...
B00FRHODI6|3|doesnt fit my car
B009S9RFXY|5|Good
B0010E00T6|5|it's a filter, it works
B008E951R6|4|It's areal nice light thank u
B004X8AH58|4|This fit perfectly on my exo400.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it is a little too dark when I ride at night or early mornings. This is even worse when I am on FM roads with no other cars or lights.<br /><br />I figured it would be worth it if I did not have to wear sunglasses under it in the daylight, but this is not dark enough for the blazing Texas sun. Especially when it is bouncing off the rear window of the car in front of you. I find I still need to wear sun glasses under this, but maybe my eyes are just more sensitive.<br /><br />The mirror finish great though people do not see in.
B004YID6QE|5|good buy
B009V4FKRE|2|If you're searching for a cheap alterative for an aftermarket muffler, look away. This is not a muffler, it is basically a straight pipe, won't pass smog, may be too loud for some states decibel laws. It fits directly with no issue, but sounds a tad under a muffler delete.
B00QJF7L0W|5|I have a 2000 ford excursion and the mirrors fit perfect on it,  the instructions for installation were real simple and easy.  They also arrived right now schedule as promise.  It really has changed the appearance of my truck.
B009EYZ8V4|1|did not fit my 94 camry
B0078P0PCI|5|Very good As expected
B000CB3EUK|1|Switch was bench tested and was defective straight out the box.  I have been to busy to contact seller, say what you will but i was busy.
B00CE6OXY2|1|Would have liked this fakey gizmo but at 83 mph... it came off with a huge bang, thump, thud.<br />Needs wings.<br />Hope it didn't go through someone's windshield behind me (?).
B004CS3BPW|5|Came when advertised. Good study lock, not plastic, easy to install, less than 10 minutes. If you need to replace your lock on your camper, highly recommend.
B00IZ2CXPU|5|Been on my car 1month
B002S70MP6|4|Instructions miss one critical item - pressure can go very high when the compressor cycles off.  This is an issue if the system has very low pressure when you start, and filling takes enough time that the compressor starts cycling.  Other than that, this did a good job.  Beware that refrigerant will be left in the tube when you remove the re-usable tube - so store it in a bag or something.
B004BTBUTQ|5|Received these mats within a couple of days from ordering. Like a little kid, open them up like it was Christmas time, dropped them in my charcoal gray Dodge Charger, and sat back looking at how awesome they look.
B001PWFPE8|4|Very easy install, works good (not great), I would like it to drop a little slower. It is however still hands free. You pull the handle and let it drop and it does not bang at the bottom. Should have bought it years ago.
B001RLTU2A|5|Works great, couldn't find this item locally.<br />Needed it to get my tractor running again.
B000EJBPLA|5|works great, low dust, no fade
B004GE9S6S|1|Terrible, not even close to original.
B00LE6UTTG|5|Awesome
B000JZY5ZW|5|excellent product, easy to replace for the hood or rear glass.
B00MH19MGI|1|They did not informed that it is not competible with iphone 6 plus. It is also not universal it is just an android adapter not for all phones.
B000IYI9X8|4|Shop installed without issue in one billed labor hour. Went on Front passenger side of 2004 Subaru Legacy 35th Anniversary Outback wagon 3.0L V6, w/auto trans. No vibration or noise issues as of one month in use. Packaging was lousy, fortunately it wasn't damaged, but box was flimsy. Maybe a good value if you need a quick cheap fix. Reviews on the quality of this axle are mixed, but I got a good one. Your results may vary.
B00TI68FZ4|5|Fits perfectly for my Nissan Titan!
B000J2ERSK|5|Got this for my riding mower and works great.  Connected easy and grandson likes it to since he mows for me sometimes.
B0087S7DM0|5|Works like its supposed to. (I own a BMW X5 35d 2011)
B00U2ITORA|5|Just put these in my van and right away I can see the difference, my stander lights are yellow and with these it's bright white. Will see how well they hold up but for now they look great. You can see your nose hairs with these puppies! LOL.
B006OQ35GU|4|Good product...
B00QN88HQM|5|very well made, , looks nice, quick shipping, does cover registration stickers as it is large, Yet very pleased
B006IHYOD8|5|Great product.  Worked like a charm.
B007V2E9CA|4|I like the build quality, but it's expected for the price. It would be perfect if it was just slightly taller so it would fit without having to use the car visors to hold it into place. I know this is the common method for sunshades, but since it's &#34;custom&#34; fit it would be a nice perk.
B0002STRG8|3|Good heavy duty kit
B00BCRM9RM|5|Received today, already installed in my Tahoe. Love them! The color is vibrant.  They look HOT in my truck :)
B00KY0KQ14|5|Works great easy to install.
B00KR9W6UQ|5|Love this sticker!!! Awesome design
B00PWVVYFM|4|Good
B0041CE5M2|5|Way better than I expected... First I wasn't sure if I wanted to drop $800 on it, but it was definitely worth it.. YouTube videos don't do it justice.. if u have a fz6r this is a must have
B00FXAHL7C|1|I ended up with three of these and none of them are the same measurements and none of them fit. I have a 2004 F150 super crew
B00G9ATWPY|3|The unit works fine but there are some drawbacks. The picture shows the water inside of the screen after exposure to a light rain.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />1. Unit has a very big display. The display is actually too big for a motorcycle because except for the gas tank, there is usually no easy place to mount such a large display. Thus, the large display is easy on the eyes but it is also a con.<br /><br />2. Accurate pressure. The displayed pressure matched a separate tire gauge.<br /><br />3. The battery seems to last long enough for a full days trip of at least eight hours with it constantly on.<br /><br />4. The display is easy to read. Did I mention that it was big.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1. It's not waterproof. Not only is it not waterproof, I don't even think that it's water resistant. On my first trip I left the unit on the bike and it rained lightly. The unit has water inside the display that covers 80% of the display. It still works but I had to put the unit in front of the vent and turn the heat to maximum in the summer to dry it out and I still can't get half of the water out of the screen. Water is a lot easier to get in than out. DO NOT even think about letting this unit get wet. Anything that's meant for a motorcycle should be waterproof. Even a clear plastic case that seals in the unit would work but this is not good for a motorcycle part especially if you get caught in the rain.<br /><br />2.  It takes anywhere from 2 to 3 minutes for the sensors to register from an off position once you start moving.<br /><br />3. The display alternates between front and rear tires every three seconds. This can be dangerous because to check your tire pressure you must look down at the unit (which means you aren't looking at the road) for three seconds and WAIT for it to cycle between front and rear tires so that you can see the pressure of both tires. It would be far better if both tire pressures were on the screen at the same time and you could check both tires with one quick glance. It has tire temperatures but I really don't need to know that because there's nothing that I can do about the tire temp anyway.<br /><br />4. The ON/OFF switch is on the bottom instead of the side. if you have the united mounted on the tank or any other flat surface you must remove the unit to turn it off or on because the switch is on the bottom.<br /><br />5. It uses a mini-USB port (not microUSB) to charge the battery and a small barrel plug to power it from the cycle's power. A microUSB that serves both purposes would have been far better.<br /><br />The unit is a good unit except the display is huge and alternates, the on/off switch is inaccessible when mounted on a flat surface, it is not waterproof and does not use microUSB for all power.es with one quick glance.

B003XNGLJU|5|First saw these when I worked for the Sheriff's Department in Northern Illinois.  Our squads had been hitting quite a few deer and after the installation of these the number of hit deer dropped sharply.  After seeing the results on our squad cars I had to have one for our car that we take up to northern Wisconsin.  I am a firm believer in these.
B00W6J1J5S|4|These fit my 1998 Chevy perfect they well made note i herd on other review that the 3 m tape didn't stick well (note the ones I received I say make sure you mark were they go before removing plastic over tape on the first one I didn't I just touched it to metal guess what it stuck had a tuff time getting it back off so I'm saying it sticks very good
B00NXRYG3E|1|I have been a huge advocate for Silblade because I truly like their products. Well this past Monday 8/3/15 after getting off work a heavy rain shower hit and the driver side wiper broke at the connection and wiper went off in roadway. The plastic connections on the Silblade are not that heavy duty to begin with and it reared it's ugly head on me. I was able to turn around and retrieve my wiper but it is broken beyond use. Hopefully someone from Silblade will step up and take care of my issue to take care of a faulty wiper I just purchased about 6 weeks ago.
B001658MJY|5|I needed something smallish just for day trips to carry rain jacket and any other items I may want to bring on a ride.<br />Love the built-in buckle system and included straps make it quick and easy to strap to the back seat or my luggage rack.<br />My bike is a 2004 Sportster with a Mustang Day tripper seat. I like the bag on the back seat, but if you have a luggage rack it will work easily there too. Very happy with the size and quality.
B00BT1GS3W|5|As expected. Found tutorial online to replace.
B00RSG1LXY|1|The device worked well for two weeks.  Then for no reason, water exposure etc. the device stopped working.  I read this happened to other reviewers also.  Wish I had listened to them and bought a better quality MP#/4 player.
B0002UEOLO|5|Good price, works as expected
B000NWA8HU|5|Acdelco enough said
B00S25Q7HK|5|This pump came with everything needed and is very quiet.  Bike is running great!!!!
B000XEGEWG|4|They work, but do leave some lint behind.
B00OU67Z80|5|Whoa, this light lights up the neighborhood. Love the versatility of being rechargeable. This is a spotlight, not a floodlight. I use this light every evening when my pups need to relieve themselves. I live in the country where bears, coyotes, deer etc. roam. This light shines farther than i can physically see. SUPER!
B006TQZQU8|5|Perfect
B0041TM0GS|5|Works great.  Slightly tighter fit than OEM (by a mm-or-so).  Recommend removing Catalytic Converter heat shield prior to installation.
B004B8FS1I|5|Love the Sticker
B0041TOQ92|5|Easy to fit, and can feel the difference in the cleaner air specially when driving through smoggy down town.
B001KYJALK|5|Good gear oil what else can i say other then fast shipping !
B005JU5VH8|5|great fit
B00ZI5LS2G|4|All perfect fitting for  my 2001 Honda CBR F4i<br />Gas Cap lil Ehh<br />Seat lock Perfect all parts needed👍🏻
B00CTUSEMU|5|I have to side with Samuel Medina, spendy, but if it saves a transmission until the rest of the car is worn out, then it's a viable investment.<br />I disconnected a cooler line on this '09 Corolla and had an assistant start the engine and ran the engine until it was drained of about as much of the old oil as a person possibly could.<br />In spite of the claim on the dipstick, this oil was very dark and changing it definitely wasn't a bad idea.<br />Though many vehicles furnish a plug to pull to drain the pan, letting the transmission drain itself seems more efficient, so long as the engine is shut off when air starts to come out.<br />I used an old milk jug to drain the old oil into, which indicated the trans needed 4 quarts to replace what was drained.<br />You may as well put another filter on while you're under there, cleaning the pan & magnets at the same time is a good idea too.<br />A tired cordless drill with a 10mm socket will speed up the job too.
B009YK1EY8|5|Good quality, nice lights and fast shipping !
B000GU1NVE|5|Looks good, works good. They've been on my bike now for months and are still in very solid and tight.
B005GYDBNS|3|Couldn't tell you how it does without laboratory testing
B00SI01MQ0|5|Easy install. Works great
B001DMFOQY|5|These are a must for peace of mind when leaving your vehicles while off sightseeing. Glad I made this purchase.
B000CO7IK4|5|Works well
B002MKMVHQ|1|easy to get dirty and moving around
B007XJ9CBO|5|nice and fast ship
B00QN8EKF4|2|Great idea, just hope that the words stay on the frame. They appear to be a paper material placed on the frame and that they won't last long. I guess time will tell....
B00SH33Y00|3|Work well for 3157 application I received all bulbs intact, beware do not work for 3757 application over heat for some reason and melt
B003SKCARK|5|Great product, use it on some of my high-end purses, along with boots and gear.
B009DK3NRA|1|PUT THIS ON NEW,,RAN LIKE CRAP,PUT OLD 1 BACK ON RAN DECENT,,,,SAVE YOUR TIME AND BUY A NAMED BRAND
B000CITKCE|5|Kept the  battery alive all winter.
B008W1O1RM|1|poor quality
B00KTJ9V16|4|Had these programed at a dealership and one works flawlessly and the other has issue with unlocking the doors, kinda sad about that because if I get one replaced I have to reprogram both remotes and I don't want to pay to program 2 remotes again.
B0027VT0I8|4|You will need to install a second car battery to run power tools continuous. Also the bigger the DC cables to the battery the better. I measured a DC current draw of 150 amps running a 1/2 hp non clog submersible pump pulling 10 amps or 1200 watts. Starter repair shops can build a heavy duty alternator for about $80 in Central Florida area. Works great on job sites with these additions to the vehicle. This invertor is designed to be used in off the grid solar systems with multiple batteries. The more batteries the better. Search you tube for vids of continuous operation over 6 months averaging 50% load. It runs ac and fridge with several batteries connected.
B00290PQMG|5|Excellent product!! Thanks
B00CHDDBV8|1|This inner fender is not very good. It is made of a super flexible rubbery plastic. I live in Michigan with lots of snow and ice. When I requested a return because this part will not full seat into the wheel opening and my fear of it sagging, I was told no. The supplier indicated that they have never been told it was to soft. I give zero stars to the product and negative stars to the supplier. A true gm part will hold its shape because it is made of an abs plastic. This part lays flat on the floor as it is made of a rubber type plastic. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!
B001B5T5SQ|5|Awesome product.<br />I use Exedy in all my vehicles!!
B002UJVNFA|5|Exalent quality for the price your getting 3 pairs that could be priced easily at 20 a pair. Very pleases all uv 400 and the datk isnt too dark but its datker then the photos. Will be buying a second set in the fututre
B000FW7V50|5|vehicles seem to run better when this is used regularly
B00G1BXINI|4|I love these caps. Economical and arrived quickly. However, my negative was the lock. I made many attempts but the screw to lock did not fit. After many unsuccessful attempts I realized if someone wanted to steal them they could cut the valve. I decided not to use the locks. Give the were great quality and cheap I decided if they were stolen like my previous I would buy new caps.
B00RXFPAAK|5|worked perfect for my 2006 Honda pilot.  the kids now have air in the back seat again.  YEA!
B00L2G4DMM|5|The Hood lifts work perfectly on my vehicle. Easy to assemble and fits perfect.
B00860GQZE|5|Bought this rad for my Saab 9-2X, EJ205 engine. The fans didn't line up exactly but I got it to fit with a little bit of tweaking. went in good.
B00KMYYQ36|5|Works just as advertised.  I tried spraying just have my boat canvas to see if there was a difference in the sides after applying water on it and the protected side stayed dry.  The water just beads up and rolls off.  Not sure how long it will last but if it last the summer, I will be happy enough.
B00BH1K4Q6|1|Put them on, and after the first car ride, the emblems fell off. I bought them for the emblem. DONT BUY
B007JEK2E4|1|Did not go all the way down in my 1999 Legacy SUS no matter how much I tried. Doesn't look like the OEM antenna. Just search online for the OEM part number 86323AC030 and while it's more expensive it'll get you something that actually works and looks better
B00AN97I3A|5|keep key remote cover keeps it safe
B00CMOY3RI|5|Compared to the OEM filter there is very little difference. Installs easily- especially given the location of the filter on the Fiat 500. Looks to be a high quality European made filter for a great price over the moper filter. I have used it for over two oil changes now (10,000 miles) no issues to report.
B000765DHC|4|easy to install
B002GJM5B0|4|best bang for the buck
B00A7EPYLE|5|Nice to have a light that doesn't get hot and is very bright.
B002GI42DU|5|My 2006 Scion xb was having tranny issues. It was starting to get difficult to shift into 1st and 2nd. Drain the old grease (like black water) and refilled with Eneos. Some of the problems went away, but it wasn't until several months later that I noticed that all the tranny issues had disappeared.
B002IVCZUM|5|Great value. Using on 20' boat primarily in shallow ocean and waterways.
B00GSAUHB8|5|It fits the windshield of my F250.
B0031AOL1U|5|Solid product
B00BCRM9RM|4|They wee a little difficult to get on but give the interior of my car look fresh and new. This set is better than others that I have tried.
B00BGDI0P2|5|look great
B00HX40DKI|3|I just bought this cushion to use on my desk chair at home. It arrived much more quickly than anticipated which was very appreciated. It came today. It seems to be extremely well made. However, the cushion is as hard as a rock when I sit on it. Maybe I will get used to it, and will give it a day or so. But so far, I am really disappointed. I do a lot of work from home, so I am in my chair a lot and I get sore. I had hoped that this would relieve the pain. Had I bought it at a local store, I would take it back immediately. The company seems to make a quality product, but I need something that relieves pressure points and pain, and right now it isn't helping. I bought this thru Amazon, but when posting I didn't see where I was to click to notate that.
B00LG07MZE|5|Works well, fairly priced, easy to fold and store in door side pockets.
B004QK3PT8|2|I bought these for my 2015 jeep grand Cherokee, but they are too bulky. It is difficult to get in and out of the jeep. You have to make a much wider step to be able to get out of the car because they are so bulky. I wish they wouldn't stick out so much. In the process of getting them removed.
B003XET6JG|5|I have had this keychain  for months. The key chain  have not fell apart. The quality of this keychain is nice. People ask me all the time when I get this key chain at. If it ever falls apart I will order me another key chain from this company.
B00180G0Z0|1|I installed this part, and it rubbed against my axle upon any type of braking or hard turning.  The ends of the Moog part are quite a bit bigger/thicker than the oem, about 1/4&#34; thicker where it seems like it shouldn't be.<br /><br />I returned it and used a Lemforder part instead. (looks exactly the same as OEM, including the plastic on the backside)<br />R52 2006 Mini Cooper S Convertible.<br /><br />Image attached.  From left to right, Moog, Beck Arnley, OEM.

B00WNGV0WG|3|I was very excited to buy this for my daughter who is blind and autistic to use while we are in the car,  she always has to have something in her hands and i felt that this table would help her be secure and help her keep her toys in reach.  when i received this product its bent in the middle of the tray and will not stay flat.  ive contacted the seller and im hoping to get some type of resolution.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Product was received on time and was just what I wanted & is working good. Thanks Expertpower
B00W69WVS2|3|Installed the item on my vehicle looked great. That's when i noticed those decorative bolts around the grill front had fallen off. Removed product replaced it with the OEM.....lesson learned.
B001QIUGVI|5|This is one of the top models of innova's scan tool product line its does evap testing 02 sensor testing, as well and cummincatiniig with ABS/SRS system. It has live data capability that has a list of 26 different items to view live. Though this tool doesnt have as much functionality of its higher en brothers it still does 90% of the functions you would need it to do in order to do any repairs on a vehicle. You can use it to view 02 sensor voltage as well as a live fuel trim. If you choose to install the data link software onto your computer everytime you pull the codes on a car and plug it in it automatically uploads basic car information as well as the VIN onto your computer where it then allows you to add customer information archive codes that were pulled and add comments on work done. a great tool for any DIY mechanics as well as a someone works for themselves and wants to keep track of customer information. I work at a shop and i like to use it to keep track of what work i have done to customers cars it makes it very easy when a car comes in to look up archived repairs and codes and see what has already been done to the vehicle to help rule out repairs when new issues arise. So far my experience with this scan tool has been great the only other scan tools that i have used that seemed decent were the autel one which i believe is android based so its pretty user friendly and the newest model snap on one which was very nice but also 5 thousand dollars so a definite no for me
B000BQW5LK|4|I was skeptical after reading some reviews but, this little pump worked perfectly for transfer case fluid change on my 2002 Trailblazer!  Screwed right on to the quart bottle.  Pump worked very smooth and was effortless.  Just hold the outlet in the fill hole and pump away.  Since it only supplies 4cc per pump, when you start to reach the filled capacity you can pump slower to limit any overflow.  For under $8, this was money well spent!
B007N6YXI4|5|Great
B002ESY88Q|5|Door aligns perfectly now! Great product, good service.
B006VU36WC|1|DO NOT BUY FOR WATER SPOTS CAUSED BY SPRINKLERS!!!<br />Worthless for water stains from sprinklers.  Saw all the high reviews and was looking forward to finally getting rid of the water spots (very annoying as you know).  Mothers did not remove any of the water spots.  It didn't even thin them out of lighten them.  Makes me weary of other Mother products now.
B00E6A6B94|5|I like
B002QWYU5Q|5|Great little safety tool to keep on your keychain. You never know when you might need it, but best to need it and have it!
B002G2YAVU|5|Serving good so far..
B00TM8T4TO|1|It is 9 inches. Not 12. When I asked about it after I received it, the reply I got was to return it if I didn't like it. Do not buy unless you want the smaller logo.
B006DX18RC|5|Excellent
B000C0TB8U|4|perfect for my 09 Nissan Rogue
B00GFCB44S|5|Perfect. Just what I needed and worked like a charm. Easy to install.

B000KBH7KK|5|It has changed my life! Since I started using this soap caddy my soap has not touched the filthy shelf in the gym shower.  As years go by, this soap caddy will continue to enhance my life.  My only regret is that I only have one soap caddy, but I have two sons and will have to decide which one inherits it from me.

B002R89LPS|5|Exactly what I needed
B00KQXKG46|5|Love it and easy to install
B008CL49P6|4|I had trouble getting the key programmed using the directions posted. They were not wrong, but here is a revised list that is a bit more precise; using these worked when I had failed before. Messing up does not mean you can't get the programming right on the key, so don't worry if it does not work the first time.<br /><br />PROGRAMMING:<br />No need to panic rush through this procedure, just do it right. Haste makes waste.<br />1. Make sure all doors are closed:<br />2. Simultaneously depress and release brake and accelerator pedals 1 time.<br />3. Insert an original Master Key into the ignition but do not turn it.<br />4. Within 15 seconds depress and release accelerator pedal 5 times.<br />5. Within 20 seconds depress and release the brake pedal 6 times and remove key.<br />6. Within 10 seconds insert New Key into ignition but do not turn it.<br />7. Within 10 seconds depress and release the accelerator pedal 1 time.<br />8. Now sit and wait for about one minute until the security light in the center counsel stops blinking and turns off. It will seem like a really long time but keep waiting and eventually, the security light will stop blinking.<br />9. Remove new key and depress and release brake pedal 1 time.<br />10. Test your key now by putting it back in the ignition and turning the key.<br />The car should start if it has been programmed correctly. If not, go through the steps again.
B000DN7VME|5|For everyone who reads the first review that talks about having 2 of these pumps and by rning these pumps up in short order, that is one persons misfortune which was probably self inflicted due to having a restriction on the inlet side of this pump (5/16&#34; line clogged filter etc) or having it too far from the tank. These fuel pumps are known to last 100k plus miles in millions of cars all over the U.S. And the world, this one is just supplied with the nessesary parts to be used as a universal pump
B000QUXYXE|5|Fit perfectly.
B005NSLUUI|5|Tried after market sensors didn't work put this in execellent
B00F3R23W8|5|Works great in my HD Road Glide. Smoother shifts compared to HD Syn 3
B003VAUFMY|5|This is a good test light. I have given 5 stars because I can't find one that is better all around. My favorite for many years was the Wirehawk, but that light is now only available with LED bulbs.  I don't like LED bulbs for general purpose 12 volt testing because they can mislead.  After several weeks the wire did break off at the top of the clear handle but that was because it got been pinched in my toolbox drawer too many times.  I can't fault the product for my &#34;abuse&#34; I ordered this 2 months ago and only paid 25,70 I can't believe it is 36,16 now.
B0002Q7ZJ6|5|1998 Jeep Wrangler TJ (sport 4.0)<br /><br />It went in without much problem. Biggest issue was getting pebbles and gravels in my face due to years of under-carriage filth. Make sure to squeeze connector clip to separate. Some WD40 (water-displacing, should be safe in a connector like this) sprayed on the connector helped get it loose. Don't lift. The tab will break off. Squeeze. I did drill a small pilot-hole to get the ground screw in, despite it being self-tapping.
B00EUUNJRM|5|Shipping was very quick. The universal mounts that it comes with have pros and cons. First the pros, because the bar sits up fairly high, the bar doesn't hum or whistle witch is a big bonus, and the obvious plus is that they'll fit on any vehicle. The downside, You have to mount it directly down, in most cases through the roof. With proper installation it's no big deal, but if your doing it yourself beware measure your mark and then measure 5 more times, cause a hole in your roof is not something you want to guess at. As far as brightness this thing is incredible. I have 55w HIDs that are bi-xenon so my high beams are pretty bright, but this thing is remarkable. As far as moisture goes I can't say for sure yet. Got a few tiffs of rain today and no problem thus far but I'll update it once I can say for sure. At the time I bought it I spent $55 and $15 for the wiring kit. All in all I couldn't be any happier.
B003FWNWN2|4|So far this guy has been working pretty well for me! One caution is pay close attention to the one you get. The first unit I received was not the one I ordered and I had to return it for the correct one. I had a hard time tracking the images amazon has for each Samlex device when compared to Samlex's website. Subtle model number differences or exterior variations are in some cases major differences in the device performance. Review Samlex's website for the model you're looking at an be sure the unit you get has the exact model number you ordered.<br /><br />For this unit though I have to say so far so good. I haven't measured with an o-scope to check the sine wave but the electronics I've been running are running clean and without issue. The thing is silent and even when the fan kicks on it is not very loud at all. For reference my Xbox is about twice as loud as the fan is on the inverter, even when driving heavy loads. I've been using this in combinination with a set of 12V UPG batteries and a solar panel.
B0022ZRFVS|5|I was leaking a bit of oil at the bolts. I installed this kit, and no more leak.
B000C57UVU|2|There is not enough clearance for a zerk fitting on this part. There should be a flush mount zerk included, or at least a zerk hole plug. I had to custom fab a plug. Its a tapered pipe thread, so a regular bolt or screw will not work.
B001COWUCO|4|Applied to our truck and looks great!  We get lots of compliments.  We live in a snowy environment and they still look good after a couple of harsh winters and salted roads.
B009D3E36W|5|Great product. Fast shipping and nice packaging.
B00WXNFVLU|1|It's not big enough for a truck/suv! I hate it!!
B005CCJ25K|5|As advertised!
B00FA7X0DM|4|very pretty
B0031720JS|5|Fit my 05 Yamaha raptor 350 and is A good solid metal material and will last a long time i would recommend this if you need it also increases your torque with out having to do motor work
B000EDUUIA|3|It works but came unglued because of rain water coming off the car. It would be better to put down with epoxy glue.
B00BYV3TPC|5|Can't beat the price if your a couple of Audi's Owner as myself. especially when you live 60 miles from the dealer.
B005C57G0A|5|Looks awesome on the bike. The package looked beat up upon arrival, but the product was in good shape. Easy to install!!
B000C946ZY|5|Very quite, Fit perfect on my 98' Silverado Z71, It is marked backwards the &#34;outlet&#34; is the inlet, but it only fits one way anyways so no big deal.
B00B4S29JC|5|Beautiful! The mats could've been packaged better, but they were a perfect match for my car. Great purchase.
B00SMXQD3U|5|Perfect fit I really like how the pieces fit and the color was perfect.
B000CPADSW|1|This does not work well on a 2011 Sierra/Silverado.  The sides are impossible to cover with this seal.  No matter how many times I tried to find a proper sealing edge, it is not there as a combination of the seal design and the bed design.  Let's face it, the sides were not meant to be sealed.  The bottom edge of the bed seals somewhat well, but makes the tailgate hard to close -- you will have to slam it shut.<br /><br />One other issue I noticed was that the seal applied at the end of the bed will retain water and was often very damp.  This will surely lead to the bottom of the tailgate rotting out quick.
B00UVYPU14|3|Smalll 😢
B00V3JONU0|1|Don't buy this product, no instruction to program the FOB. *** Don't buy save your money **
B00IVP5NG2|5|It's a great looking jacket @ a great price!
B00JR6HUVU|4|I purchased these stepper motors as replacements for ones used in the automatic antenna tuner in a Yaesu FT-920 HF/6 meter amateur radio  transceiver. When they arrived in a couple weeks, I found that the motors are identical to the original except for the wiring connections. The problem with the old original motors was the plastic/nylon gears were stripped out. I was able to use the gears from these new motors and repair the old ones. This worked out well and saved a lot of money from trying to buy the original motors from Yaesu. You will need to be able to disassemble and reassemble these tiny motors and the gears. A bit tedious but not too bad. The motor top case can be reattached by soldering it together.<br />A good deal if you can repair the internal parts of the motors using these for parts or identify the wiring and make the connections to the existing control wiring. 73
B005QZDU1K|4|great product. highly recommend. should outlast oem stockers.
B00CAKILAO|5|Nice heavy flexible rubber mat.  Easy to cut & looks great.  Highly recommended.
B001PILD8E|5|Perfect for what I wanted it for!
B00UEMH5L6|4|Adds and awesome look to my jeep.<br /><br />Would have preferred some clipping mechanism to tape. It has held up fine though.
B00KYKB75I|5|Truck on the back is awesome. Really good quality T-shirt.
B000IBDIX2|5|coated the gas tank great. no leaks. thanks
B00GF0B8DC|1|Not universal when there is no standard American 1/4-20 thread adaptor
B00GB85ZQ4|5|Super bright and well made.  Definitely an intense spot pattern, although there is a lot of residual light in the surrounding areas to add visibility as well.  I think I would have preferred the spot/flood option for my application (Jeep Wrangler).
B00O8RWHXO|3|Couldn't get it to fit my Honda Rebel CMX250C I'm sure it's great when it fits the flywheel.
B000V8WGIA|5|excellent easy to install

B000GTUZK0|5|As described
B00QJU3Y80|1|These won't fit a 71 nova with a 454 and factory manual steering without major modifications to rather the headers or installation of rack and pinion .
B000K049YS|5|I installed this speaker over 6 months ago and still working just fine and sounds great.  Not a single problem and am totally satisfied with the purchase, installation and performance of this OEM speaker.  Highly recommended for a OEM replacement speaker.
B00651CLVE|5|Awesome product
B00JWZWRY6|4|Pretty easy to install. Happy with look. Installed fine with only the 2 front panels off.
B00AFVC3HW|5|Good, like OEM.
B00XQWC6RE|5|Wonderful service and excellent price!  Thanks.  :-)
B00Z8XX0EW|5|Great product.
B007IO9F5C|5|Perfect for my 2005 evo mr for a third of the cost.
B00E9HWS9G|4|Trimming it up was not very difficult.  Did take about 30 Min todo it right
B00PTNL17E|4|Fit perfect
B00GSAUHB8|1|False advertising both from the sellers and from Amazon. I bought this as Amazon said it fits a 2015 Honda Odyssey (and there was a question about that which was answered 'yes').  In fact, it does NOT fit - it is TOO SMALL!  Because it is so small, it doesn't cover the whole windshield, and it is tricky to hold it in place with the sun visors. DO NOT BUY this for a larger car or minivan.
B00HS76T1W|5|Good fit fast delivery!
B00O7TXHBO|5|I was skeptical at first. When something is to good of a deal it usually is. But I bought these sensors for my 2015 Jeep JKU. I was having new wheels and tires installed and these are a lot less expensive than the ones they try to sell you at the tire shop. They installed them on the new wheels and they worked immediately. No tpms light. The dash readout of the pressures corrected it self to the new pressures in about 5 minutes. These are a great deal.
B00BDEPJ1W|5|great hose---- best I have ever had
B0084L0YR6|5|This product worked just like it says and even better than original.
B000W7GLB8|5|Perfect! Works great, high quality, and easy to clean.
B00ELJLU3W|3|slides around way too much
B00TDACOUW|5|I love my decal. I put it on my computer, so easy and if I am saying easy it is.<br />My computer is black and the blue is bright enough I can see it clearly. I love the<br />infinity and my paw print designs. Honestly I can't believe how inexpensive they are.
B0032ID0D6|4|Goggles seem to work as advertised went on dirt bike ride sound as if they should work in high humidity just have to tape battery cover in place as a precaution
B00WT5TGG8|5|Love these mirrors!
B00NXRX946|4|Using 18&#34; blades on a Miata. Blades seem to work well and arm appears to apply even pressure over entire length. No appreciable wind noise (not that you can really tell in a Miata) and no hop at highway speeds (and much higher on a closed track of course)<br />My reason for taking one star is that the actual attachment was not the most secure I have seen and I am not convinced it will hold up to ice this winter here in new england.
B0068NQLTM|5|It fits my BMW F650GS perfectly. The build quality is very good, it says made in Austria and I can believe it.
B0015D19SS|5|Worked great for hauling ladders
B000JFJLP6|4|Good.
B002SDTV4S|5|excellent, veri good
B008Y5AO40|5|Great bag with lots of room. Sturdy construction. Just used it on my 2015 Sturgis Trip. Weather proof cover is nice even thought I didn't need it. 4 straps are easy to use and bad didn't budge an inch.
B009DJUR0W|5|Exelente
B00AEJDASQ|5|It clicked in place easily. It turned out fantastic
B007O5LDZ0|5|These are great for the car..
B001G9KC5C|5|works great
B00EA1TV46|5|Great product tightened up front end a lot
B003HOH11C|4|Not quite the quality of the OE lights, but these cost one tenth of what the OE ones do.  These are very good.  They come with the switch, but the relay is needed.  If they included that, it would be a wonderful kit.  If you search on the relay, you can find a replacement one for a few dollars.  There are many instructions and youtube videos on how to install these lights.
B001CVXW1K|4|I really like these goggles a lot. The are very clear and I don't notice any lines or obstructions when wearing them. They cut down on the wind significantly and I wear them over my prescription glasses... which is where the 4 stars instead of 5 comes in: they barely fit over my glasses. They DO fit, but my glasses are stuck in one place and they come off when I take the goggles off. My prescription glasses do not have very large frames and it's still a tight fit. I would imagine for some frame styles they would not fit at all. They are comfortable while riding and I feel they offer excellent eye protection. When this set of goggles wear out, I will look for a larger set. I do think they look pretty cool.
B000EQ0O7E|5|So far it's performing much better than the original! !!can't wait to see when I will need  the next set...
B007JZKBVW|5|Great
B00IKKS4W8|4|Not as good as my factory jacks I replaced them with....
B005DUUK2U|5|nice to keep life jackets
B010ELYX7A|5|Fast shipping and a perfect fit.
B00JA3BMDW|5|It works but beware that it has to be adjusted / calibrated for different types of surfaces (wood, stone, metal, etc.).  This is typical of this type of device regardless of the manufacturer.
B0090WUHXE|4|Just so everyone knows these bulbs are NOT amber at all. They are banana yellow. And not that bright either. I like them cause theyre different but, if your trying to replace an amber bulb don't buy these.
B00MU5X17M|5|Easy to install
B004GCP2GU|5|Perfect match & good price.
B00LNIPAIU|3|Back seats are a pain in the ass to install. Theyre loose and baggy but the front seats look amazing. Good price and nice quality but back seats are a bummer. Id recomend just getting front seat covers. Back seat zippers are convientent if you ever need to fold the seats but make the covers look cheap
B00TUNSOMO|2|Very easy to apply.  It spreads so thin that you can cover a lot with just a few burst of spray.  This 32 fluid oz will last quite a while.  Do not use if the surface is hot and on direct sunlight.  Best to use when the surface is cold.  Leave it until it forms a haze then buff it to shine.  Do not start buffing right away as it will just comes off with your rug.  Let it air dry first.<br /><br />Cons: You better use a machine buffer as I find it so tedious if you are gonna buff it manually as it takes forever to polish and remove the haze.
B001KRED32|4|fits perfect
B00S198YQE|5|Fits perfect
B00029WYDU|4|My husband likes this product and won't use anything else on his Ford teuck
B00BUZ5BZS|5|Easy to contact, easy to order, great price, and quick service.  Thanks
B00MGTS1WW|5|Wow, we were so impressed in the room this bag could hold! We needed something to cover our items during our vacation trip. The bag was able to hold 2 large storage totes, 2 large suit cases and room for extra items around these items. It is a very durable bag and I would highly recommend!
B004I2JN54|5|Nice helmet for the price-----fit is good and it does a good job with air flow----if you are on a budget this should work for you.
B00LDNGU6Q|5|perfect and good price
B00K87QA54|5|Great purchase
B00AKWW7FY|5|It Came up saying it would not fit but spoke to the seller and this is correct. Like that it is light in weight.
B00S1Z7Q1C|5|Will use them on my 88 Winnebago air ride system.
B005LTIU9S|5|Wrks  on threaded fittings removes shrader valve without freon loss. Not for pressure release fittngs as a auto a/c has like my acura mdx.
B0066TLNT6|5|these stopped my leaks...so, no complaints!
B000CPCBOG|5|Installed and works as advertised on a 1st Gen Xterra. Oversized washers for Xterra's that do not have the thicker frame members. Remove the spare tire, remove one exhaust mount, bolt and torque, easy one person job. If you already have the spare tire removed for better ground clearance then you should be aware that this will interfere at the extreme but is easy enough to remove if required.
B008EEYKBY|5|Perfect fit on my '87 Toyota 22RE. Exactly the same as the AISIN factory one that I took off. Fan makes a LOT less noise now, I should have done this a long time ago. Why pay more for the same exact part from the dealer? I know others have messed with buying the silicone oil and rebuilding their old fan clutch, but at this price it's just not worth the hassle. Easy replacement, I was able to unbolt the fan shroud from the radiator and wiggle it down and out, then just loosen up the belts and remove the 4 nuts on the water pump. Whole job took about 30 minutes.
B00B3BKM1M|5|Point of Pride for a Ford Man  I work, my trucks are part of my work.  They keep me working. My skills need to get to the job site some how.<br />Quality product. Looks great. Lots of thumbs up out here in Ford Country
B007XUHDB4|5|Quick delivery.  Tested @110 amps!!!
B00S1OD4AU|3|this product well  maid but is not fit x5 models
B00E5PK8TE|5|Best deal for a Harley battery.
B0041TR892|5|great product AAAAAAA+++++
B000IYSZY6|5|Fit our 09 fusion perfectly.
B0009PCPNQ|2|It didn't work well on stains for me at all. It only lightened the stains a bit but couldn't remove them. I am going back with Blue Coral.
B007J8IKC6|5|good looking and works great. Prompt delivery !!!
B004OFNJZ0|5|These are the perfect size for my car and are very pretty. I measured my windshield before I ordered them so I didn't have a problem with the fit. They are light but sturdy and keep the car quite a bit cooler. Good quality for the price.
B00WE9SM2I|4|Price was right. Solid good quality air filter compared to the one that came off bike. Fit was exact on 02 FXDL and is washable and reusable. Will buy another in future. The smell from package was pretty bad though. Open outdoors because you don't just get a air filter, they ship you the manufacturing odors as well at no extra charge.
B0002VAZ34|5|I used this stuff on my 97 hydra sport original isinglass what a difference if you told me that this stuff worked this good I wouldn't of believed it I thought I would try this stuff before replacing the the vinyl  windows  glad I did saved me a whole lot of money windows where so bad it took three applications of the cleaner be fore I could polish it I couldn't believe my eyes worked great on all my tinted plexy glass as well
B006IA5V8M|5|Love my new 13.1 Magnet.  The black line around the edge is thicker than others and the lettering standsout more.  Very Happy with it!!  I have the 26.2 as well  Thank you so much!!
B000F5HV0W|1|Rigid one is better
B00LU6P23S|4|great price
B00M76FSH0|5|Really Cute
B00S4HFNXK|5|This is great for you boat. This will be great for tying up your boat. When tying up my boat it stops my boat from banging against the dock. This will help in the long from dings as well as dents. The rope is thick. The fender is nicely padded. Very easy to use. Overall a great way to use on your boat.
B00IVP9USY|5|I've ordered 3 other pairs of gloves I had to return, before finally finding these. I bought these for riding my Scooter. I like to protect my skin from the Sun. And since most gloves are himmed up short to the wrist joint & most of my long sleeve tops end up blowing back while I'm riding, I kept getting repeat sun exposure to my forearm area. I have been using good & strong Sunscreen, but I needed yet more protection. Before I ordered these, I read here that they are 12 inches long. I measured the tip of my middle finger back 12 inches & the length looked to be just perfect! Tried them on & rode with them & they are absolutely perfect! Do be aware that these gloves are super soft & comfortable inside, but they do get sweaty pretty quickly when worn in hot weather. And also the short sleeve cuff part widens out quite a bit. I don't think these would win me a &#34;fashion contest&#34;, but they are just enough length & width to tuck in whatever long sleeve I'm wearing, deep enough that I get the full protection I was looking for. And I feel quite safe wearing them, in case of an accident or fall. It's also just good to know, the longer the glove, the more skin surface that is protected.  Update 12/19/15. I continue to wear these during the cold weather now & they are great! They keep my hands & finger tips cozy warm. (I tend to get cold hands & feet anyways). They are snug & movable enough that they don't take any control away from my hands while riding. But still warm, great hand protection & the perfect length, so they don't just stop right before your wrists. I rode to the Grocery store yesterday & kept the gloves on while I was shopping inside, just to continue to keep my hands warm & it was awesome.
B00FS82Y4O|5|Awesomely simple wiring harness.<br /><br />Hooked up to the rear of my JKU on top of the Gobi rack. Still had plenty of wire.<br /><br />Lights up everything!
B00IWHIRYY|5|Fits perfect. True to size. My husband is a XXL and that's what I ordered. The leather is very nice to say the least.  If you looking for a REAL leather vest this is it.
B00S4HFNXK|4|The Extreme Max BoatTector 24&#34; bumpers have been absolutely great on our houseboat!  They are easy to use and protect our boat from the dock.  My only concern is the area with holes. I am hoping that they hold up during a storm.  I will update the review if we have any issue! My first impression is a good one!  After a week of use, we have not noticed any wear at all. See pics below.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />~ Size - Nice length!<br />~ Durable - So far, all is good!<br />~ Easy to use and great protection!
B00IUVN4SQ|5|Great combo. Everything you need to evacuate and charge your r134 auto a/c system.
B00157TGXY|4|These are much easier to use than the packets you have to tear open or the bottles filled with powder. With these packets, you just toss one in the black tank with a couple gallons of water and forget about it. You get the perfect amount every time and never get loose powder in the air and on the toilet.
B008FCDJLC|1|This does not fit on a 2015 Equinox.  There is no clearance on the 2015 Equinox to allow the hood deflector to fit.  I checked it against pictures of an installed deflector, posted on an Equinox forum website, that was installed on an earlier year Equinox.  I had the deflector correctly assembled and fit up to the hood based on the earlier model installation.  Even removing the weather stripping on the hood & grill will not create enough clearance to allow the hood to close properly.  However, when attempting to close the hood, I found it would not close.  I checked the fit up numerous times and there is no way this works on a 2015 Equinox.  Chevrolet shows this hood deflector on their 2015 Equinox website as fitting the vehicle.  This hood deflector does not work on the 2015 Equinox & Chevrolet should quit advertising this deflector fits the 2015 model.<br />Thankfully this exercise in attempting to install it, it didn't result in any paint damage or other hood damage to my new Equinox.  I had thrown the shipping box away assuming it would fit & couldn't return the part.  I'll take the loss of the money spent purchasing it; maybe this posting will help other 2015 Equinox owners avoid this situation.
B00BFXJGAQ|1|THIS DOESNT WORK ON THE YAMAHA RAIDER AND SHOULDNT BE LISTED AS ONE WITH THE BLASTER TAIL LIGHT
B0046ID5EK|4|Not yet tested but feels and looks sturdy.
B0002KKIUA|4|does the job, any uses
B004303BNQ|3|This just arrived this afternoon. Looks great so far, and just fits under our patio table. Hope my 9month old husky/lab mix doesn't find it tasty! I will review again in a few months to see how it holds up, it's it's not that thick so I'm not sure how it will stand having chairs pulled in and out.
B008HZOVVE|5|Since putting these pads on, I haven't heard a squeak! Quality pads for a reasonable price.
B003RYOWH8|4|They work fine. Purchased to help protect my original seat fabric from staining and fading.
B009YMC54Y|5|looks just like the imagine and screws on nicely! Love this extra touch to my MINI
B00HY06UXK|5|Totally changed the look of my interior!!!!!. It is really blue.  Luckily I had the foresight to change the vanity lights to white LEDs.
B000R8F47Y|5|Works great. TIP: Take the hooks off to avoid a timely untangling.<br /><br />Fit great and love the ability to resize via moving the hooks as needed.<br /><br />2013 GMC Denali.
B00RF4BCZ6|2|Mirror is not like original, as it misses the &#34;objects are closer than appear&#34; note.<br />It will fit well in the Kia Optima 2013 EX, but the internal cover that hides the screws and connection cannot be installed because the screws are shorter than the original.<br />If you still have the original mirror, you can go through the trouble of switching the bolts to allow proper assembly.<br />All in all, product is not bad, but dont think you are buying something that will look like the original.
B00852684M|5|good
B002R1QCW0|5|Fit like the factory headlights and look no different. Makes the van look like new again, and for the price it is hard to beat.
B00PVEUHU8|5|Exelent and fast!!
B006Z953EI|4|Nice little meter but not well pact, but it did survive the shipping . The fine adjustment to zero in the needle is worthless, must remove the cover for zero adjustment. For the price, you can't beat it.
B000C41OCC|3|Car stops better than it did before installed
B00I5057HI|4|The whole thing went together real nice. The second side went together went much quicker than the first, but the whole thing only took about 4.5hrs. It drives good, and looks great.
B0052FRVP0|4|It needed minor adjustments to install but works okay.
B008AJM62S|5|Easy to use
B00DSD84R2|5|Uplifts the room. My daughter loves it. Holds excellent on painted concrete walls.
B0077T23IO|5|Love the product and easy to assemble. Took me 15 minutes to finish both front and rear! Package was received as promised. Perfect fit to my CB500F. Lift my bike in first try!
B00FF9M6EY|5|Great product.. Works great..
B00755JMYS|2|The ones that work work good. Pack of 10, 1 didn't work at all, 3 are flickering. Got what I paid for I suppose.
B00IIOK87U|4|Cool wallet, nice leather, excellent construction, but the design limits the use on the left side cardholder slots.
B004KED68K|5|In my work I find myself working in small quarters, this wrench allows me the snug the bolts or oil filters the use the larger incumberant tools for a tighter fit.
B004PX1F9S|5|Worked perfectly,  used it to pull bed off my truck.  No problems.
B00H57E8T0|5|fits just right thanks
B00RGZWIW0|5|nice and neat. holds it's shape well. thank you! exactly what I need.
B0055DP5AW|4|I love the the foot pregs but , comes with no instructions on how to mount. delivery was ahead of schedule and was in excellent condition. the only reason i gave 4 star is because of instructions and no diagram to show where you are to install.
B00K551F18|1|Terrible product! It came all wrinkled so it is impossible to get a nice smooth fit on the lens. Very difficult to install - it is impossible to remove all the bubbles because of the poor thin material. The material also shrank after few days being installed on my taillight lenses. I decided to remove them after all the time spent and trouble I went through. Don't waste your money on it!!!
B004GE32BK|5|Direct fit, with a minor modification.
B000C8YY6G|5|Awesome!
B003AG4ZAC|5|My fiance loves it.
B00C3VSBAU|5|As advertised!
B00BLPT7VQ|5|I am very pleased with this product.  Very nice!
B004EIAADG|1|Poor quality. The ac plugs were loose and regularly lost connection to whatever was plugged into it. Tried twice to jump start a gmc 2500 with a 6.0 engine and it would not turn it over. Junked it and bought a &#34;pro&#34; power pack
B008G28KGK|5|They look great! They make the car look new again.
B000KQ08W4|3|I initially bought the front and the back.  The front windows work fine because of how they are attached.  This purchase for the back was to replace one that fell out after a few months.  Now even the replacement has fallen out not to be found.  I think that the tape may not be the answer.  The front window versions snap in and they are great.  I thought about a 3rd purchase then use super glue to hole it in but have already spent too much.
B001AI3JYA|2|Just figured out why this bogged so badly. Tried enrichening with needle position while on bike (XT225), still didn't help, so pulled carb and testing the accel pump on the bench. Not spray. At all. With a full float bowl.  Pulled the bowl and find two issues with this NEW carb. One, there was no spring for the accelerator pump, so the piston was just sitting in its bowl cavity. Had to bang the bowl upside down a while to get the piston out. It just sat on the bottom of its hole, no way to actually pump anything. There was probably supposed to be a spring under the piston so it could actually move up and down to pump and not sit on the bottom doing nothing.  Second issue, first time I took the bowl off, the gasket was swollen from the fuel (mind you, this is a NEW carb that had never been apart), so much so it was about 10% oversize, so reinstalling was a total pain and it leaks (seeps) now (prob because it's not fully in its cavity as it won't properly fit anymore). The fuel here has 10% ethanol in it, but bloody hell, you'd think a NEW, modern carb would be able to handle pump fuel??  So, just fair warning: Don't assume anything just because it's new. Fill it with fuel on the bench and check the accelerator pump action to see if it actually mists fuel. TWO, order some float bowl gaskets now. These aren't modern-fuel resistant and will be so swollen, you won't be able to get it back together if you do have to take it apart (it'll be kind of like a Holly, where you have to replace the gasket anytime you take the float bowl off).  Leaks and won't stop till I find a replacement rubber gasket that isn't too swollen to fit, so lowered another star (that and the following response from Powersport Superstore: &#34;I do apologize for the inconvenience, however if you contact the manufacturer Mikuni with this inquiry they will be able to do the warranty for you on this.&#34;)  Scummy deal all the way around. Summer has only so many days and I'm wasting half of them NOT riding because of the QC of these new Mikuni carbs...
B000E9TS6O|5|Hey, it really works!  Shines my car fast!
B006N91C2M|5|Good durable battery
B000M5NNQ6|5|Keeps injectors clean and efficient and the 5.9 likes it that way!
B00009V3ZE|2|I am kinda surprised by all the 5 star reviews as this product has &#34;no grit&#34; feel to it at all.  Seriously I could use this and pleasure myself, that's how smooth and buttery it is with no grit at all to be felt.  I am not trying to be funny just don't expect this to remove anything but the finest finest of scratches and hazes.<br /><br />This is nothing like the rubbing compound I remember from years ago where the slightest mistake could be costly.  I even used this with a drill and pad with almost no real results.
B003YKTNOM|4|Purchased this over the other brands based up on reviews on ramforumz.com. This was installed on a 2013 Ram 1500 Crew Cab. After watching several youtube videos, this item went in without incidence. The front visors just slip in. Be careful when installing it because at first it seemed like it would not fit, but in fact it did. When bringing the windows up, the auto feature of the windows brought the windows back down before going up completely. So I brought the windows back up about 5-7 times. Then I left it alone for about one week and had no issues with the guards. The rears were installed using the supplied double side tape. It should be noted that the double sided tape was not placed in a straight line, and some of the tape would be exposed to the elements. However, this did not stop me from installing. The install was very simple after following the youtube videos again. I did not open the windows for several days and had no problems with them coming loose. In the fast I have used the stick on outside visors, but found after a few months they would slowly peal off. This is the first time I was using an in-channel type of mount and I am very happy with it. As far as noise is concerned, none at speeds up to 70mph.But at speeds over 70mph they do produce a noticeable howl. When I hear this, it just reminds me to slow down. But when I am &#34;able&#34; to maintain higher speeds the noise does get annoying.  I cannot speak of rain protection at the moment because we have not had any rain recently. After washing my truck, I did notice a lot of very fine scratches on the visor. I was using basic car wash soap and water. I was disappointed that it scratched so easily. Also expect some loss of vision when looking out the window. The A-pillar looks a lot wider due to the size of the visor but I got used to it after a few days. Overall very happy with the purchase and would recommend this visor over the stick on ones.
B003APYWCO|5|Thank you!
B002UC4V4W|5|As described
B001H9K7WY|2|They pictured a long stem unit, and twice sent a short stem unit that would not work as I needed. Sent both back and cancelled the order.
B00XAX4B9A|5|VERY NICE, WOULD BUY AGAIN.
B000CCMKZY|5|It works like a normal anti-seize lubricant. It comes with a brush, and the application is very easy. I'll update when I need to change my spark plug again.
B00NEL75GO|5|Worth the money and these filters actually do help the air inside the car.  I've been cutting a regular filter to size as the ones in the parts stores are ridiculous for what they are.  I decided to bite the bullet and invest in one for my car as well as bought the freshener which works quite well.  I have actually noticed the air smells cleaner and I don't get that damp, mildew scent on the first power on of the blower.  I wish cars didn't have these at all as I think it's just another customer ripoff but if you have to change it you might  as well use this and forget it for 15000 miles or more.
B00EUWPFCM|5|Good product
B000C53S1G|5|came in when was supposed to, a little tough getting lower bolt in, but no big probles, truck sits 1/2 inch higher, rides about the same but hold rv weight up and no bottoming out now, very happy with product, would buy again
B000EDQQJ2|5|works well and small in size to carry.
B004TOB6EW|5|good product works great
B000H29WL4|5|Love them bulbs since it's bright enough for my night driving. It's white color and I can see better further away.
B00E9HWS9G|5|it was really well made & very easy to trim to fit
B000EQR87S|5|OEM quality
B00EVMT6A8|5|Very nice low profile design with an excellent range of view.
B00WUN5492|1|its pretty much a ipod shuffle that can't shuffle the songs or find a song you want to play. it plays everything in order so youlll never reach your song in the Ms with out clicking right 39884894894 times. i returned mine
B0002MAGTQ|5|Easy to replace.
B000TYQ9GQ|5|Working great so far. Recommend changing this if it is discolored at all
B00W32EO0K|5|Good Product
B000CMFRK4|5|Fit 2004 Acura MDX perfectly.
B00KTHX8N0|4|fit perfect
B0084L0YR6|5|Very easy to replace and fixed my problem of my blower motor not turning off.
B003AOMGZA|5|Very solid design and handy extensions (although, depending on your lift you may not need the extensions).  Definitely an upgrade from the standard clutch rod.
B00X1YR3IY|5|This windshield really works awsome cuts out all wind and dust well worth it!
B004EB12FS|1|I'm giving this a one star for now because I just received my items and the soap is spilled all over, will update review once I've used the products. Keeping them since my car really needs to be wash!
B00252KEHK|5|Perfect Fit for our 2007 MINI Hardtop
B000A8JLIY|5|Very good.
B0033BSH8A|5|Nice hat feels good.
B002ZTKEKA|5|These are much better than the black carpets that came with the car. Especially in the winter & rainy weather.
B00FOKMAGS|2|If you're looking for a red tint, this is definitely not red. I was so disappointed after a few hours of work on my lights to find out that they are more orange than Red. It looked horrible to be honest..... And putting another layer made it look even MORE orange. So upsetting....
B0053HNU9I|5|Good product...
B00UXZY0R6|5|Works great and a fraction of dealer cost! I'll be buying again if the need arises!
B001AJH1HK|4|Easy to attach, firm grip, not much affected by wind.
B000WEKQ3K|1|Not worth the price...cheap plastic
B0006IX87S|4|Simplest way to filter water in your RV
B00F68FCJU|5|Fit perfectly
B006LGKFEI|3|They look really nice on the bike but you need to use lock tite or jb weld to keep the Mirror from turning
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|It is very good.
B00GA9WR2O|5|Does the job and easy to attach. Great product.
B004RFKBEO|5|This carrier is heavy duty. Our items were so secure. We did use a few extra straps as this only comes with the one. Which the one is enough for the 4 bikes for sure. The first time we used it we put 3 bikes and some luggage on it. It nor the items ever budged.
B000XEGEWG|5|I am diabetic, and that means that I have delicate skin. Using these soft cloths instead of the rough washcloths I was using is a revelation.
B00E4CQH9S|4|Very nice glasses with just the right polarization. I had some problems with sweating around the eyes but I was driving through town on a 95 degree day. I'm sure they'll work much better on the open road. The fit is perfect for this medium-sized woman. These are better than the WileyX glasses my husband bought me that were too big for my head.
B0006IX7TW|4|Move the air very good all around the fridge, needs an on/off switch.
B008A1NHEC|5|Exact fit, quiet operation.
B00C5CN0CG|4|I have had this speaker for about two years. I received it as a white elephant gift for Christmas. It has a pretty decent sound. However if you love bass, this isn't the right speaker to get. I will say that my HMDX rave has had a few hard drops, one time on concrete and it still works.
B00N8LS9A6|5|Great product. Easy to install. Works amazing. Very bright light. Would be nice if it came with a better set of instructions than just one tiny piece of paper with a diagram on it.
B0075UQ4NK|5|I love the fragrance.  Many of my friends want to know where they can buy one.
B00JXOKB08|5|Fit as a perfect replacement for the main relay in my 98 Honda Accord.
B000P17NXQ|5|Works well on the camper
B00HGMZZOQ|2|This is NOT a rigid tire cover. It is about as rigid as a bbq grill cover.
B005JU5Z74|4|These do not fit a a 2012 VM Jetta TDI without nibbling off a bit of plastic with a razor knife or nibbler.
B00842A7F4|5|nice
B00S7E32L0|5|Got the key cut at an Acura Dealership. Moved the micro chip over and it works perfectly!
B00JGM7Z5Q|5|adjustability is nice.
B000CFAVA2|5|Perfect fit.
B0067MUM8A|5|😉
B007ZGE7MO|5|Work just fine.
B004VMXCE4|5|Very nice I can still get a cargo cover for my now 7 year old liberty and I got the matching grey interior color. Thank you
B000RFUF12|3|We tried using this but the water came out so slow that my husband got impatient and tossed it aside and got a funnel.
B005SB6S3Y|5|Very good product. Was easy to install. Made of good quality material.
B00BCRMAAS|2|Did not fit all seats in my 2001 4runner sr5 as promised
B008BX4V8U|5|Works very nice makes the truck look really good
B001B59I60|5|very good clutch my car is very good now
B000C7LYVK|5|Works right, really easy to switch in/out of 4x4
B0088YXDX6|5|Exactly as expected - hardware was perfect
B004A2WUBG|5|Working as expected!  Quick to ship...
B008D15U8U|5|Nice little clock for tight areas.  So far the accuracy has been spot on.  Not a bad price either.  Would definitely recommend.
B00029WSVI|4|Not Universal for Hyundai, but it is okay if you need a new one and don't have the money to buy OEM
B006QH6XQG|5|great price
B002IPQ5IG|5|2006 nissan altima.  With the wire adapter it came with.... fit like a charm
B00APM0AKS|5|Worked as advertise and a plus for having 40 of them for a low price since every time I take my car for a routine maintenance check at least one of the tire valve goes missing. Just pop one of these on the tire and it is as they never disappear.
B004SBEJ22|5|Very happy with my order
B004IVGA0G|3|seams to be a tight fit in RV bumper mount sold by Ultra Fab Prod. will have to grind some on corners
B005OZQDUW|5|all ok
B00194CEU0|5|I'm not a biker chic, and I don't exactly have a biker chic look. More like casual nerd. But I was looking for a pair of boots that was durable and NOT cheaply made, and these are them! They're beautiful, tough, and feminine. I think they would go with any outfit. I think they would help you survive a zombie apocalypse. They're just great.
B00147STQU|1|I hate to give bad reviews but to be honest unless the sellers of this grill can put it on my car I'd give it a zero star. I'd give it 2 star if it could grill my fish for dinner. Right now this product is something I can get at Home Depot and just sweat it out until I get the right shape to fit. To sum it up it's junk in my backseat right now. And yes I'm seriously gonna use it to grill my fish for dinner, only reason I'm not sending this back.
B0045WBVUM|4|It works well and my husband highly recommends it
B00XNK16CK|5|This chock totally saved my MV Agusta on it's maiden voyage home using a U-Haul trailer. Worked like a charm at a fraction of the cost of other Branded(TM) chocks. I WILL be buying an additional one for my Gixxer...as soon as I purchase a trailer.
B00KFNC43I|5|Great stickers
B0002Z9R0C|5|PIAA Silicone Wipers are the only wipers I use now.  As long as you know how to use them properly, they are awesome.  Here is how they work:  Every time you use your wipers, it will deposit a little bit of silicone in any little cracks or pits in your windshield.  You cannot usually see all the little cracks and dents in your windshield but they are there, all over the place.  Then the water gets on your windshield and beads up because it doesn't like the silicone.  It doesn't smear all over the place like it used to.  I don't use my wipers as much or as often compared to regular wiper blades.  Also, the blades can recondition an old pitted windshield by filling in pits with silicone.  These wiper blades take a little bit of work for them to function correctly.<br />HOW TO GET THEM TO WORK:<br />- Purchase the regular wiper blades first, not the refills.<br />- Follow the installation instructions.  Most important is a clean windshield and run them dry for five minutes.<br />- Keep your windshield and wiper blades clean.  These blades are designed for water, not all the bugs that you hit.  You will have to clean the bugs and their mess off the windshield yourself.  Wiper fluid made for bugs helps, but not a whole lot.  Dirt and grime may build up on the wiper blades too so check the blades them selves.  Usually I'll just need to rub my finger, or the windshield cleaning tool at the gas station along the edge of the wiper blade that is usually in contact with the windshield.
B00J594EGI|5|don't get this on your hands it will really dry your skin out
B004991LTW|5|just as described fast shipping
B007I6Z05Y|5|Easy to install; solid as a rock! Absolutely love my Jeep having a lock...researched many like-products; none better!
B000LG3DBG|3|Its the only decent true 1.5&#34; chrome exhaust tip I could find. Lots of weld splatter around the clamp bolt bracket.
B002EDYF9S|5|very good taught me alot
B00S4HFNXK|5|We have a bumper on our boat to protect it when cozying up next to a wall or a dock, but I thought these would be nice for extra assurance while the boat is docked. The ropes are plenty long enough even for a big boat. They are well made and thick enough to protect the sides of the boat while docked as long as the water is fairly calm. I would trust them to protect my boat in rough waters though. And I definitely wouldn't trust them to be my bumper when bring the boat in.<br />But they are great for a little extra protection.<br /><br />They don't take up much room at all in the boat. They are nice and flat and store easily. We are happy with them.
B000WK3I98|3|Well made good lighting but screw holes do not line up for my application.
B00651CLCS|5|Works great. Looks great. After reading slightly mixed reviews I decided to take a chance and it payed off. Quick easy installation. Most people complained about a loss of reception, I only listen to one station and that station was not effected.
B003SRRFY6|5|Inexpensive but good quality for the price. They instructions were clear and when I had a question for the seller they responded quickly.
B007H2PUKE|5|Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ
B0045G8836|5|These are very comfortable, well made gloves. They are thick enough to pad your hands, but not so thick as to interfere with your handling of the controls on a motorcycle. They aren't winter gloves by any stretch, but I believe they will keep your hands warm enough to ride in colder temps. Great deal for the price. Will purchase another pair if these wear out.
B00EP3PUV2|5|Great and easy install. Directions was ok but once I figured it out it was easy. Installed by my self. Look great and work great on my 2010 Dodge Ram 4x4 Crew Cab
B003BNK2WO|5|Works as advertised, great product.  Very satisfied
B005VUTLDG|5|exact fit and function, easy exchange with old worn out latches.
B001O77CMW|4|Great product for the money, but had to make some tweaks.  (1) As others have noted, the exposed interior screws can scratch your helmet if you don't buy the liner.  I glued Velcro on each side of the screw then covered with soft vinyl.  (2) the plastic insulators on the disconnects for the brake light do not stay in place, which leaves the metal of the connectors to short against metal bike parts -- which blew my fuse.  Fixed this with electrical tape and a new fuse.  (3)  The unit was secure on the rear carrier, but rattled in its mounting.  I put weather strip between the two metal studs on the base plate to make it snug.  (4)  The hinge pin is tending to work it's way out on one side.  Tapped it back in with a hammer, but haven't determined a permanent fix yet.  I may put a drop of glue on it before tapping it back in this time.<br /><br />I would buy this again. If fact, I could buy two of these for the price of a same size Givi and still have money left over.
B002MEJDKK|5|Looks exactly like the factory original that we busted. Fit and finish is identical to the original. The mirror motor and blinker work as good as new. Install was a bit more of a process than I expected, but that isn't the product's fault. Compared to what the dealer was going to charge, well worth the process. And the Amazon website's app to match model/year/item worked exactly as you'd hope.
B004K8V6XS|5|2007 Ford Expy. Fan would go to 100% when you tried to turn off the a/c. No real control of a/c. Purchased this as recommended in a few forums. Easy 2 screw removal below the glove compartment, next to the kick panel. Swap module. Easiest fix I've ever done on the truck.  Hope this part lasts. If not, I'll revise the rating.
B005FEGP7I|3|must already have software
B00OIT8VQO|5|Looks good still holding up been 3 months
B00BSGJQ4Q|5|Worked great, looks great!
B004V0D1S8|4|The steering wheel cover was a little hard to get on, but it looks great with the seat belt pads!
B008C0WAD0|4|It is pretty nice and the fit is good. The silver side is showing a couple of small bubbles.
B00O12FDPK|5|First off, let's assume you are as cynical as me. If so, you might be thinking the Tuf Shine cleaner spray isn't needed; or &#34;my tires are pretty clean already &#34;. You would be dead wrong. Tuf Shine says you need to scrub the tires multiple times to insure they are totally clean. This is where you (and me) need to kill the cynicism. Scrub them UNTIL THE CLEANER TURNS WHITE UPON SCRUBBING. With the tires completely clean, now - and only now - you are ready for this excellent tire sealant. I put 3 coats on each tire (about 5 minutes between coats); and you can do the white glove test. That glove will NOT have a trace of sealant on it. Seriously. As long as you use a mild car shampoo (most car shampoos are mild), it will not wash off. Only after 2-3 months does the shine slightly fade. Use a mild cleaner again and re-coat. You WILL be impressed!
B003PJOR5W|5|Great product
B003POJ1DU|5|Happy with the quality so far
B001FHZYBM|5|Great replacement bolts for one of FORD's finest invention of the plastic plenum on top of the intake. Grrr. But since I need them they were half the price of what the parts stores wanted.
B000GZT3U2|5|Feels really Good. Great lockup, and better than stock.
B00067BVLE|4|works good
B004I12438|5|Perfect!  We ordered this replacement from Amazon after realizing the outer plastic layer had fallen off of our tail light.  It came in a couple days, due to prime, and we installed it in minutes.  The instructions directed us to a YouTube instructional video, which showed us how to do it, and it was very easily done.  This was way better than going to the auto parts store and then likely being told it would take a week to order in, all the while being made to feel like an idiot.  Not to mention how much an auto repair shop would have charged us for parts and labor when it was so simple.  So we're totally happy with the product and the experience!
B00CVFIJ28|5|my key was loose this was the perfect solution to keeping everything together. and looks really nice!
B0093D362O|4|Pretty decent muffler, especially for the price.  One thing is, check the fit before purchase.  This would not fit a 2002 celica GTS because the stock ground effect was too narrow.  Would of had to cut the opening to make it fit, and was not willing to do that.  Gonna try it on a maxima instead...
B007Y87IJM|5|PERFECT FIT. INSTALLED AND WORKING PERFECTLY.
B00DZ355KE|5|It was for a project bike and I didt even use the battery for a year. It worked like a charm and started right up without charging or other things.<br /><br />I put it into a 2001 ninja 250R
B006FR133K|5|Superb experience!
B000C0UQUM|3|I bought this at the end of December 2014 and it is already making noise when the engine is cold. Once, warmed up it goes away as my OEM did. Although, the OEM took it several years to make the same noise. I have a fairly new belt on it since I installed that at the same time maybe that's causing more tension on the tensioner and caused it to start howling. Even so that should not cause this to already become weak. Very disappointed with only a 30 day warranty should have stayed away from this one. As at least one other reviewer noted try a Doorman or such instead. It couldn't be any worse than this junk. I will now be looking for a replacement so soon. Don't get me wrong it still works. I don't want to hear a loud noise when first starting up there vehicle and chances are neither do you. Would give this 0 stars if I could.<br /><br />(Updated)<br /><br />Amazon gave an unusual warranty or at least what I was told so I will now increase the star rating due to receiving a refund. 3 stars I believe it was my belt that caused increasing wear on this due to me buying a cog style belt instead of OE replacement.
B0009IQZX4|5|Its an oil filter and it works. Fits on Sv650s 05'
B00ATWLXT6|5|I'm really happy with this. It took a little effort to install it, but after that it fit snugly. When my car has been sitting out in the hot sun, it's wonderful to have a steering wheel that doesn't burn my hands! Note: It's yellower than it looks in the picture.
B000BO6O96|1|retarded, save your money
B003V57NUQ|5|Came with a bad screw but they replaced it quickly with no problems or extra cost. Works well.
B00TQHHCTK|5|Works perfectly!  Love it!
B004TXS0SS|3|Useful until extensions off circular portion sheared off for no apparent reason.
B00CIVVBVQ|5|Look great on my LJ!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00G6UC4GG|1|After a few weeks of use (mild climate, no snow, no 100+ degree days) they are streaking and skipping across the windshield, which i religiously keep clean.<br /><br />Would not buy again.<br /><br />Go to your parts store and buy some other brand at the same price.
B000MQABJC|5|Installed it on my 2005 Shadow VT1100C. It's loud and has great sound, even with the baffles in. I feel bad sometimes on starting my bike in the morning, feels like I'm gonna wake the neighbors up but oh well. I've had it for 5 months and still no bluing or discoloration. I would suggest to keep checking the bolts every 1000 miles though.
B00AWPHRPE|5|This is a MUST when skiing behind a Sea Doo if you don't want your arms ripped out of their sockets with 260 HP.  Anyone who is familiar its difficult to keep a constant speed on a sea doo because of waves/chop and cornering.<br /><br />I installed this on a RXT-X in hopes of having a better experience skiing.  Once installed you have several 'profiles' too chose from and customize.  Once its activated its a simple squeeze of the throttle to 'wide open' and the computer controls it all, ramp speed, top speed, cornering speed and speed in choppy water.  It does a VERY good job keeping a constant speed a well as SMOOTH acceleration when pulling the skier out of the water.<br /><br />Installation:  This is easy to install but follow the directions carefully at the same time I would say this is NOT something anyone can install.  You need basic electrical know how to understand how it works when installing to make it less confusing.  This may be a little overwhelming for some when they see the rats nest of wires coming out of the fuse box and the sea doo numbering system thats a little hard to follow.<br /><br />If I had one complaint, I wish it were a tad easier to set up when out on the water.  Once you are used to the onscreen set-up its fairly quick to get it in Ski Mode but it will take a little tinkering to understand the functionality and on screen set up the first few times.
B000V5CIJK|4|great price and works/protects like more expensive filters
B00AG39MO6|5|Fit was perfect! Fixed my broke one and help stop an annoying fluttering noise.
B0027HYVN6|5|An awesome addition to any Jeep .. Ditch that plastic thing and invest in one of these
B00FWOKKGI|4|Been good so far. Havnt had to add silicone yet, its been through a bit of water. This light is really bright and has a wide beam pattern, but doesnt go out super far. No complaints though, especially for the price! I would but this again. Might buy a second one for my RZR 1000.
B001U9BMD4|1|you can't coexist with a cult that wants to kill you.
B0026PI03G|5|They were a bit longer than the original wires but we just looped them around. They are really cool and just as bright as in the picture! After my husband cleaned the engine block and put these in they reflected and made the engine look blue.
B005XK04WG|4|this works great, I live in a place that can get kind of windy and gusty and this hold the umbrella like a pro!  no bending at all, bought another one for the other umbrella stand.
B002Q6DU26|4|Nice
B00E8CV0EQ|5|Although I haven't used these, and I hope I don't have to, they seem to be great tools.
B005F9HMUC|5|This was perfect for my car! Thank you!!
B00KJBC7SI|5|put in our spare key so we could have it on our key ring. it works. We did not get it cut.
B00IT9MBV0|5|Epic.
B00G9CRMUO|5|Perfect. Took only a moment to install and saved me a about $70-80 from the dealership.
B004W8R7QQ|5|Satisfied!
B0027I88VQ|5|What I needed
B0007M30BC|5|Satisfied!
B001EP2904|5|Works!
B00DQ1RV70|5|Nice and cheap
B000AP1MUC|1|Did not fit my 2011 QX56 as stated.. other than that I like K&N products
B00D9N76TS|4|Delivered on time and they fit perfectly. Nice to have on the rainy days to vent the car windows.
B00F4YHODS|1|Well, very small compared to what it appeared to be. It did not come with a string for the bottom loop. I used a mini bungee to hold it. Works ok for g-babies small items.
