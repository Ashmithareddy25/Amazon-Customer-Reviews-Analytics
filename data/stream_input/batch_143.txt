B000003TAB|5.0|This album is fun. You really get into it. It shows all the faces of Nirvana, pop and punk rock. Includes great songs like &quot;Dive&quot;, &quot;Sliver&quot;, Hairspray Queen&quot;, and &quot;Anuersym.&quot; This odds and sods album shows the bands playful side and rough side. It showed the world what their next album, In Utero would sound like. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes at least one Nirvana album!!!
B000002URV|1.0|With the exception of that song, this is truly the worst album which I have ever heard. And I've heard all of David Gray's albums. I bought this album on the strength of the undisputed classic sadeness, and turned it on to hear pathetic female exhortations for me to turn off the lights and 'meditate' which I studiously ignored. Then came the classic, followed by several samey, terrible songs. The album reaches its nadir with 'The principles of lust' which is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. The female 'singer' must be disposed of now.<br />I bought this album expecting to hear the greatest work ever recorded, and am extremely disappointed.<br />PS- An interesting story A friend of my brother was suspended from school for repeatedly chanting Sadeness (PT.1) at a teacher, who called it 'The Devil's song' PPSIt probably isn't. Enigma pretend to be devil worshippers but the reality is even more pathetic.
B000000Y2F|5.0|I put in this tape as I started reading and found myself constantly lifting my head to enjoy the wonderfully collaberated music. It seems that both Coltrane and Monk know rythmically what catches attention. The style of this music is laid back and full of well tuned melody. I can just lay on my bed and listen to this one over and over.
B00003CXE7|5.0|A lot of people have come down hard on Gladiator because its has been succesful, for that chic modish reason that if it succesful, it has to be pap. They then go over every scene with a knife looking for errors. The amusing thing is that they find many errors that are not errors at all. Firstly, the archers. Though it is correct that the legions did not use archers, the legions were only half the Roman army. The other half were the support units of archers and cavalry that backed up the heavy footmen of the legions. Roman cavalry swords were indeed used to slash, unlike the infantry swords. The romans did have saddles, but what they did not have were stirrups. The movies avoided shots of the horsemen's feet, so they would avoid that inaccuracy. Except for truncating Commodus reign and the idea that Aurelius wished to restore the Republic, this was a very accurate movie.     To enjoy this movie you have to be uncynical and not automatically disbeleiving of anyone with noble motives. Then you can enjoy the first rate writing, wonderful costuming and sets, killer soundtrack, and well done action sequences. This is a supurbly crafted movie about a noble hero, no more and not a bit less. For an action movie, it also has a message that can be hard to get: You are not told at the end whether or not the Republic was restored. Historically, it was not, but that last scene is speaking to us in the present: saving something that is good is not done by large impersonal forces, but by a few good people willing to strive and sacrafice.
B0000035E7|5.0|This is a classic indie album. It's cool to listen to because this was before the whole Nirvanamania thing. It was just three kids from Washington playing around, but this is a really good album. The album contains true &quot;grunge&quot; songs like &quot;School&quot;, &quot;Paper Cuts&quot;, and &quot;Sifting.&quot; It also contains very good pop songs like &quot;About A Girl&quot;, &quot;Love Buzz&quot;, and Swap Meet.&quot; This album is great all the way around and shows the early songwriting genious of Kurt Cobain.
B000002U8G|5.0|This was, and still is, the best pre-DSOTM (Dark Side Of The Moon) Pink Floyd record. I have had Meddle on CD for about 5 years, and the CD impresses me every time I listen to it.<br />One Of These Days -- One of Floyd's best rockers, and the title sums up the bands' feelings about a certain person (look for the Echoes FAQ on the internet and newsgroups to find out who it was about), and it's summed up even more by Nick Mason's voice being slowed in creative editing with the line &quot;One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces!&quot;.<br />A Pillow Of Winds -- A very relaxing but great song. Not too relaxing as &quot;Cirrus Minor&quot; from _More_ was (&quot;Cirrus Minor&quot; sounded so peaceful it almost put me to sleep)<br />Fearless -- Great rocker, and the soccer (or football if you live outside of the U.S.) crowd shouting &quot;Liverpool! Liverpool!&quot; made the song sound like it could've been a great &quot;interactive&quot; song (i.e. the crowd clapping and singing along)<br />San Tropez -- An okay song, which sounded like it belonged on _Obscured By Clouds_ instead of _Meddle_.<br />Seamus -- Okay song as well...in fact I don't know how to describe it. You'll have to hear it for yourself.<br />Echoes -- The &quot;magnum opus&quot; of the album. Even though the track is 23 minutes and 45 seconds lon, it is one of the best songs ever made by Pink Floyd (or ANYBODY for that matter). Great lyrics, great sound effects, and a funky part somewhere in the middle...what a great combination! BTW here's a fact...the song &quot;Echoes&quot; actually debuted in concert in 1970 under the title &quot;Return Of The Sons Of Nothing&quot;.<br />You will not regret getting this one. It ranks among Pink Floyd's five best albums (the other best ones being, IMHO, DSOTM, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall).
B000021Y74|5.0|Run Lola run is a movie full of startling movements of camera, bright cinematogrophy and a wonderful soundtrack to follow it all up. This director has surely made his mark on the American movie scene with a new and highly different movie. There are three episodes, all different scenarios of fate. Very worth watching, very worthy of all the great reviews it has gotten. This director has done a new movie, &quot;Winter Sleepers&quot; which is also wonderful.
B000002UB3|5.0|It was 1969, and the Beatles were on the verge of breaking up. The disastrous &quot;Let It Be&quot; album had nearly done the job itself, but the Fab Four still had room for one more album--and it showed that they had, in fact, saved the best for last.<br />&quot;Abbey Road&quot; is the greatest album *ever*. Starting with John Lennon's famous, catchy &quot;Come Together,&quot; it quickly moves into the beautifully harmonic &quot;Something,&quot; George Harrison's best song ever (save for &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;). Paul McCartney's &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; is infectious and cheerful, and his &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; is a blues-y track that will have you screaming the chorus along with him. Ringo Starr's only solo effort on the album, &quot;Octopus's Garden,&quot; is a happy little jaunt, and the riffs on John's &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot; are darkly wonderful. George's &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; is magnificent, and John's &quot;Because&quot; is, in my opinion, arguably the most beautiful melody ever written. &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money,&quot; of Paul's, is one of my personal favorites--a rags-to-riches song that starts out softly and sadly but flows into a harmonic, upbeat ending. &quot;Sun King&quot; is definitely the only average track on the album--it's entertaining, but nothing special.<br />After all of these splendid tracks, it seems as if the Beatles are nearly finished--but they've got something up their sleeves: the fantastic, famous, and outright glorious medley of the last several songs.<br />It starts off with John's &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot; and then flows smoothly into his &quot;Polythene Pam,&quot; both songs only about 1:30 each. Paul's &quot;She Came In through the Bathroom Window&quot; is next, followed by his gorgeous &quot;Golden Slumbers,&quot; and then &quot;Carry That Weight.&quot; The last is &quot;The End,&quot; which is one of their finest--everyone has a solo on it, including Ringo's first and only drum solo, and the song ends with the famous lyric, &quot;And, in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.&quot;<br />Finally, a thirty second ditty, &quot;Her Majesty,&quot; tops the album off.<br />&quot;Abbey Road&quot; is a masterpiece, and any record collection is incomplete without it. From melodious harmonies (&quot;Because&quot;) to timeless love songs (&quot;Something&quot;) and even humorous pieces (&quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot;), it will leave you with a sense of fulfillment--that is, until you feel the need to listen to it again!
0345350499|5.0|I have read this book over a dozen times and each time find it just as captivating as the previous.  I recommend it to anyone who likes to read about the Arthurian Legend and be swept back into time.  The author has done a fine job of bringing the era into the future.
B000002UA0|5.0|I would like to thank Syd Barrett (actually Roger Barrett, since he no longer is known as Syd) for this wonderful musical trip. Most of the songs are unbelievably fabulous.<br />Astronomy Domine -- One of my most favorite Floyd songs, a hard rocker written by Barrett<br />Lucifer Sam -- Fabulous song written by Syd. Great lyrics and great music.<br />Mathilda Mother -- (see Lucifer Sam)<br />Flaming -- (see Lucifer Sam)<br />Pow R. Toc H. -- I don't know how to describe it. It sounds like a wild psychedelic jungle with cannibals tripping on acid. Either you like it or you hate it, but personally, I love it.<br />Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk -- The first Waters-written Floyd song, and it shows how green Waters was back then. I do not care for this one...the lyrics could've been better, but the band sounded good.<br />Interstellar Overdrive -- The ultimate jam session, written by Barrett, Waters, Mason, and Wright. Fabulous song which fades into the next song...<br />The Gnome -- Whimsical Barrett song, and I love it.<br />Chapter 24 -- I didn't understand the lyrics at first, but after learning about the &quot;I ching&quot; stuff, I understood the song and I ended up loving the song.<br />Scarecrow -- Barrett still doesn't disappoint. Great lyrics and great music.<br />Bike -- Whimsical ballad from Barrett. Great song, but the end part (the weird laughing which sounded like a bunch of Donald Duck impersonaters) almost ruined it.<br />Once again, Syd, thank you for the wonderful trip.
6305426651|5.0|This film follows a father as he and his son are thrown into a concentration camp in world war two. Roberto Benigni plays the father and turns this horrible situation into a comedic and laughable treat. It is a very innovative movie, I think the first one shedding light on how horribly disturbing the Holocaust was, and how some people must have coped with it while in the camps. The cinematogrophy is beautiful.
B00003CXFG|5.0|Whoever said that Sci-Fi is only ever any good with huge budgets and big stars must be eating their hat now. <br />Pitch Black, with a cast of relative unknowns and relatively little money just goes to prove the opposite.<br />This dark, scary &quot;bug hunt&quot; movie will definitely not leave lovers of the genre wanting anything. Maybe not thought provoking but a great ride nonetheless.

B000002U9W|5.0|This is where Pink Floyd started to evolve from a psychedelic band into progressive rock (I've always considered them prog-rock). The title track is pure art rock featuring arrangement from Ron Geesin. The song features everything from a full symphony orchestra, a choir, and a revving motorcycle. &quot;If&quot; is, IMHO, the gem of the album. What starts out as a ballad soon turns into a song about somebody going mad...in fact, insanity would be a central element in future Floyd albums including DSOTM, WYWH, and The Wall. &quot;Summer Of '68&quot; is probably my least-favorite track...it sounds too much like the Beatles...Rick Wright could've done a better job with this one...sounded too &quot;poppy&quot; for Floyd back then. &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; is another good song...it could've been a great song but Dave Gilmour's guitar solo at the end could've been better...the song had GREAT lyrics. &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot; was a decent song...parts of the song sounded too spacy (a'la the title track from _A Saucerful Of Secrets_) and the rest sounded good (especially the acoustic guitar solo in the middle of the song and the whole band playing at the end of the song).<br />Atom Heart Mother is highly recommended from me, a Pink Floyd fan who has almost all of their CDs.
0684874350|4.0|This book is humorous and sad at the same time.  Oh and watch the movie too...it's really good.
0345440757|1.0|I cannot believe what this woman is doing! I agree with the reader (Mobile AL USA) who stated this woman is making a lot of money telling/teaching famous people to bring up their babies etc / doing what should come naturally to most of us mothers! I have been enquiring as to when Tracy is on TV again and it seems her tour has been &quot;suspended&quot; due to the nature of the press reports in UK recently, and many people have said she IS in fact not qualified to the extent she says she is. I find this very worrying, and maybe do her daughters, who clearly, from reading the press, did not have the loving nurturing for most of their little lives and have in fact lived with their grandparents since the ages of 3 and 7! Money is obviously more important to Tracy than her own daughters. The book ,as I have read it, seems to contain a lot of theories and very much lack of evidence. She was also married to the father of her little girls for 10 years and he is never even mentioned in her book, as if she is denying he was even there when they were born and I believe the youngest daughter Sophie actually lives with her father in Yorkshire, as states in the British Press. Why has the tour been suspended I wonder?<br />ps I will be sending this book back!
B0000028W9|5.0|I don't know how many would agree with me on this, but I think The Future is undoubtedly Leonard Cohen's best album. The lyrics on this album are absolute poetry - mastery, sheer mastery. From the dark satire of the title track to the cynical but all-too-true Waiting For The Miracle, to the appropriately titled Anthem, to the poetic and highly erotic Light As The Breeze, Cohen's lyrics stand nearly unrivaled in music. However, the real lyrical standout of the album is Democracy, a biting satire that stands up favorably to anything he has ever written. The covers Be For Real (and especially) Always are also very well-done, and the latter even features a nice Cohen vocal. Tacoma Trailer, an instrumental, is a nice way to round up the album. You won't find bombastic musical arrangements or overbearing vocals here, though. What you will find are Cohen's great lyrics sung in an intensely personal and moving way. And that, surely, is enough.
B000002U9Y|4.0|I will review this track by track :<br />Let There Be More Light -- Great song, IMHO. It sounds like a song that Billy Corgan would want to cover. Great melody and great lyrics.<br />Remember A Day -- One of Rick Wright's shining moments as a songwriter. It is a very good song...great lyrics and great music.<br />Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun -- This may be where Roger Waters set the mood for future albums that dealt with insanity. The title of the track could insinuate a suicide order from somebody like Captain Kirk on Star Trek, but I think it refers to a descent into madness (it could possibly be about Syd Barrett's descent into madness). Dark song with great melody (I love the bassline) and great lyrics...I love singing along to this song.<br />Corporal Clegg -- I'm sorry, but every time I listen to the song, I feel like a choad for listening to it. Some people say this was written by Barrett, but it was actually written by Waters, and it proved that Waters was still &quot;green&quot; back then as a songwriter. I can't stand the kazoos! I tell ya, THE KAZOOS KILLED IT!!!<br />A Saucerful Of Secrets -- Hard to describe. At first it sounds spacy, then it sounds like noisy garage music, then the final part sounds like a journey to the unknown with the choir effect. It's an okay song, but sometimes I don't like it.<br />See Saw -- This song depresses me...maybe it's because the song is not good. I consider it one of the worst Pink Floyd songs, and the worst song Rick Wright ever wrote.<br />Jugband Blues -- This is Syd's swan song with Floyd, and it's a marvelous song, but I didn't really care for the Salvation Army playing in the middle of the song.<br />This album is a good effort but it falls short of greatness.
B0000028M7|5.0|Much is made of early 90's grunge and alt-rock releases such as Nirvana's Nevermind, Pearl Jam's Ten, The Smashing Pumpkin's Siamese Dream, etc., etc., but this is truly the apex of early 90's rock. The simplistic riffing and inane lyrics that are so abound in grunge and alt-rock are gone here. They are replaced by Jerry Cantrell's highly inventive and greatly underrated guitar work, and the dark, brooding, and often starkly confessional lyrics. The self-loathing in the lyrics comes across as genuine, and is backed by the omnipresent wailing of guitars and the solid backing bottom of Mike Starr on bass and Sean Kinney on drums, which drives a doomy musical attack that is closer to Black Sabbath than Led Zeppelin. Dirt starts off with the short and inconsequential Them Bones, but quickly gets into the meat of the album with tracks such as Rain When I Die, the title track, and others. However, the centerpieces of the album are unquestionably the mini-epics Rooster and Down In A Hole. The former is a doomy war story, backed by some extremely heavy Cantrell guitar work and haunting vocals. Down In A Hole is a very depressing song that is made even more so by it's startingly fine musical backing. Dirt is a true classic of the grunge movement - and indeed, of 90's rock itself, that is sure to stand the test of time far better than many other albums that get more praise.
6300183971|5.0|It's still the best Dune. The look and feel of the movie are just right on the money. Jessica is perfect. This was also the last movie Sean Young made before she decided to become a flake, remember when she used to play sophisticated adult-type women, gang? Remember Blade Runner?<br />The way they made futuristic technology look ancient really worked great. This is a feudal system, these oppulent items pass on for generations and it looks it. The sets and constuming sort of remind you of footage of the last Tsar of Russia. And when you want to film desert, nothing beats actually going out and filming some desert.<br />Contrary to some of the reviewers on the New SCI-Fi miniseries, I thought the spaceship scenes were far better in this old version. They looked like the kind of spaceships super rich, royal dudes would have. That scene in the begining when the spaceships are docking with the guild transport is superbly done. You get the idea that they really are moving an entire planet's goods.<br />Trivia: Jurgen Prochnow (Duke Leto) was almost killed in the making of this film. The book about the making of the movie is kind of interesting, too.
B0000026J6|4.0|Although not as good as his subsequent album, The Future, I'm Your Man is certainly the album that got Leonard Cohen back on track. The album starts off strong with First We Take Manhattan, a lyrical fantasy that actually features some compelling backing music. Song like Ain't No Cure For Love, the title track, and (to a lesser extent) the somewhat cynical Take This Waltz are the kind of romantic and erotically tinged lyrical imagery that Cohen does so well, but the true centerpiece of the album is Everybody Knows, a bitingly sarcastic satire on the follies of the human race that also touches quite a bit on the AIDS factor in relationships. After these, Tower of Song ironically closes the album well. Undoubtedly one of his finer efforts.
B000000OU0|5.0|This recording is one of the best pop recordings available on CD.  When analyzing high-end audio equipment, this is one of a handful that I absolutely must audition with.<br />Clear, tight, dynamic, you name it.  Listen to the beginning of track 6, &quot;Hotel California&quot;, especially right after 32 seconds into the track.  If you have a really good system, you will probably get your hairs to stand on end.<br />Oh, the music itself?  First class, of course.  The best songs of the Eagles and all sound nice.  My favorite is &quot;Pretty Maids All In A Row&quot; with &quot;New York Minute&quot; and &quot;The Last Resort&quot; just behind it.  Of course, &quot;Hotel California&quot; sounds great, almost better than the original recording.<br />This album MUST be in your collection if you like popular music or even classic rock.
B0000025ZF|4.0|Although still a good album by most standards, Pros and Cons is essentially somewhat of a letdown to listen to, as it comes directly on the heels of 6 5- star efforts from Pink Floyd (Meddle through The Final Cut). Of course, this album is not to be judged by Pink Floyd standards, but it is impossible not to make the comparison. Even The Final Cut, which was in all but name a Roger Waters solo album, is vastly different than this. There are no standout songs, indeed, there are no songs at all in the usual sense. Whereas concept albums like The Wall and even The Final Cut had some songs that were good standalone, Pros and Cons is a true concept album, and should only be treated as one long song and listened to in one setting. Often tracks switch in the middle of a verse, and sound effects and instrumentation continue on unabashed with the changing of tracks. The album is more musical than people often give it credit for. Eric Clapton, who is the lead guitarist on this album, contributes some fine guitar work that is at the same time bluesy and somewhat Gilmour-esque. There are also some nice acoustic guitar parts (presumably from Clapton as well, but undoubtedly sometimes played by Roger himself) and Michael Kamen and others hand in some nice keyboard work. But make no mistake, this is no Pink Floyd record. This is Roger Waters removed from the musical influences of Gilmour and Wright, but still retaining some of his prog rock sensibilities. However, this album is not perfect by any means, and there are some mistakes that Roger failed to iron out until the release of Amused To Death (on of the greatest albums of all-time, in my opinion) in 1992. What are these problems? Well, in many respects Roger took things entirely too far. Now, we all know Roger is different and that's what we love him for, and as he is generally pigeonholed as &quot;progressive rock&quot; we should be prepared for damn near anything, right? Well, almost. Sometimes good old Rog gets carried awaywith these things... just look at the song titles. Also on this album (and the subsequent Radio KAOS even more so) Waters retained the idea of thematic concept albums, but got away from what made them universal. Whereas The Wall and The Final Cut were two widely universal concepts (isolation and war) The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking is about just that, the Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Not exactly your normal, everyday thing that everyone can relate to. The story is more of an actual story, and it is obviously somewhat fantasitical and not as personal or emotional as was The Wall or the Final Cut. This is not by any means saying that the lyrics are poor. Indeed, they are quite good, several great quotes abound, and Waters' cynical commentary on human folly is still to be found, it's just bubbling slightly below the surface rather than bashing you over the head. The lyrics are still good, just the themes are not as universal. Amused To Death, where he really got back on track, is a first-rate album that I recommend unflinchingly to anyone and everyone, but his other solo albums, this one included, I recommend only to die-hard RW fans.

B00003CXE7|4.0|I purchased a DVD Player over the summer and I have been pleased with the movies that I have seen on DVD.  I must admit, however, that my favorite part of the DVD experience is all of the extra material on special editions.  When I watch a DVD that has no featurette, no outakes, no deleted scenes, no interviews, I think to myself &quot;What's the point of putting the movie on DVD?&quot;      With that said, Gladiator is one of the best DVD's I have viewed.  I purchased the DVD for the movie, not knowing what kind of extras were on it, and I was very pleased with the product.  I am a music fan, so I enjoyed the focus on the music on the second disc.  There are a couple of deleted scenes with the late Oliver Reed that are worth watching.  There is so much on the DVD, that I have not yet been able to see all of the extras, which makes me anticipate the next time that I am able to watch it.  It is given that the movie is good, (whether it deserves recieve the next &quot;Best Picture&quot; Oscar, can be debated), but rent or buy the DVD for it's extras as well.

B0000021RD|5.0|This is an album very similar to their first one (Chicago Transit Authority)except it has sort of a classical edge to it thanks to the talented James Pankow. &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; was Chicago's first radio hit which came from Pankow's &quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon.&quot; &quot;Colour my World&quot; which also came from &quot;The Ballet&quot; was a huge radio hit even though it was never released as a single. Both of those songs featured the vocals of the late Terry Kath. Robert Lamm's &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; was an even bigger hit that featured a very strong horn arrangement, strong vocals from Peter Cetera, and one of the best guitar solo's of all time by Terry Kath. Other favorites include &quot;Poem For the People&quot;, &quot;Wake up Sunshine&quot;, and &quot;Fancy Colours&quot; which were all written by Robert Lamm. &quot;It Better End Soon&quot; I think was a strong political portion of the album that brings a message to the rest of the world. If I could give 10 stars for this album, I would.
B0000541VQ|5.0|In my opinion, I can't believe this didn't sweep the Oscars.  The story is brilliantly adapted, the story goes lightning quick, and the performances are magnificent.  Glenn Close is a marvel as the evil Marquis and John Malkovich, though on first thought miscast, is also a wonder as her partner in psychological warfare.  His acting is so brilliant that he makes this part his own.  But Close should've been nominated &amp; won as Best Actress, bar none.  Her scene when she visits Malkovich's aunt and sees him staring at Michelle Pfeiffer (also brilliant), is as fabulous as her final ending scene in this movie (which I won't give away except to say that this film is Shakespearean in its depth and writing)  A powerhouse film

0380730367|4.0|First of all, the BIG error: in one scene, the main character Pat Kenzie is taken by Bubba to see a mob guy, who then warns him off pursuing his main target. This mob guy is prepared to kill Bubba, who he describes as a close friend and 'good earner', if Kenzie doesn't take a step back. We are led to believe, therefore, that this target's hold over the mob guy is very strong. We then learn a chapter later that in fact the mob guy hardly knows the target, was merely paid $10,000 to warn Kenzie off. Now, if Bubba was indeed a valued friend and 'good earner', there's no way a mob guy is going to take him out for just $10,000. A 'good earner' would imply that Bubba's putting fifty thou a year or more on his table, otherwise the mob guy just wouldn't notice. Also, Bubba would be no easy target (this scene builds up how even a lot of the mob guys fear him), the risks would be considerable. So he might start thinking about wasting him for $100,000 or more, but below that I think this particular part of the plot just doesn't hold water - it's just something else thrown in quickly to add to the tension.<br />Having said that (and really, this is something that a good editor should have picked up on), this book has great pace and some of the snappiest (and funniest) dialogue to be found on the bookshelves. So only one star off for not making the mobster scene work.
B000056K04|5.0|As a long time Dave Matthews Band Fan, I was apprehensive to say the least about this new album release, all the listener reviews and speculations.  But, after listening to the cd for a few times, it is truly awesome.  This album encompasses the following: Need, Hunger and Want.  This album really speaks to a band that is changing as they write, record, produce and finalize.  Over the last few albums the band has changed from peppy, carbonated songs to a matured ensemble that plays from the heart.  &quot;If I had it all&quot; brings back remembrance of # 41  &quot; I used to play for all the loneliness that no one notices now&quot;.  Why be negative; as DMB listeners, we should embrace these changes and celebrate them. Ten years is a long time and if a band does not change, grow, expand, and excel beyond our expectations, then why should we be listening to them?
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink 182 are the best band about...This is a great album, with excellent lyrics and good music.  I've been a Blink fan for ages, and this album shows how musically they've matured.  This is definetely, for non-Blink fans, their best stuff, and the most professional of their albums.  Personally though, Dude Ranch is a bit better lyriccaly but it's rawer and doesn't sound great due to their recording equipment and stuff(also the change of drummer helped for their latest CD). To get started though, this is the best they have to offer...Blink we await ur next offering...hurry up!!!
B000056K04|5.0|Being a graduate student of music composition at a major university has its advantages and disadvantages. The major one being knowing music inside and out. In general I have seen in recent years a major digressions in pop music in so as music ability (talent), original music composition, understanding and working knowledge of music theory, as well as variety within a particular group. We as a society are so overwhelmed music production (recording quality, show, editing etc.) that the music has suffered.<br />Every once and a while an album hits stands and instead of holding back music, progresses the music to new levels in popular culture. Everyday is one such album. This album fuses many different elements, while at the same time, has one of the best and original mixes I've heard since Under the Table. Highest congrats go to Mr. Matthews and Mr. Ballard on their excellent NEW music.<br />Now many may just say this is another Dave Matthews album, but after close examination, one will find elements that have not been so present in previous albums. Before Matthews has exceeded excellently in bringing in jazz elements back into popular culture. But now, each song has a different flavor, combining original Matthews elements of classical theory, jazz, and current pop styles. For example Sleep to Dream Her takes traditional Bach -like harmonies and progression and combines it in a funky 6/8 meter, while adding a little Frank Sinatra (it's be a stretch to hear the latter) <br />I do not buy many pop albums, my selection is mainly of Jazz and Classical. I own a couple of Beetles albums, Simon and Garfunkle, Bjork and Matthews. GET THIS ALBUM! I challenge toy don't go through life being warped by much of the bad pop music out there. <br />If you are to buy just one Matthews' albums, get this one. Music (not production) needs to progress, not regress.
B00002R0MC|5.0|First of all, this box set, should NEVER have gone out of print!!! Many people have passed on and missed it due to this fact. Please I beg the fans, let us not allow it to happen again - for the sake of humanity.<br />In 1997 I got a chance to listen a sample of the box set from a friend who dubbed it to cassette. There not much words to really truly describe Bob and his music, but he more than a musician. The man is an inspiration, a prophet, God sent, a lover of mankind and a revolutionist. His music was his weapon. This Box set manages to capture all this. You will never be the same after you get this, and you will eventually. <br />I could hardly afford it, but no amount of money could keep me from being in that very special group of people in the world to own their own Bob Marley, Songs of Freedom Box Set. I bought it in Feb 2001, and now I'm able to truly listen the album, my CD player is always decked out with three of the four CDs. <br />Many of the songs on the first two Cds, surprisingly were new to me. I got a feel of the journey of Bob Marley. Disk three and four speaks volumes of the Bob we come to know - Hitting out against political and social injustices not just in Jamaica, the Caribbean and Africa, but the world. At the same time he speaks of love and peace. I have spoken enough, as Bob would say - 'Dig this', Bob died in 1981 and today 2001 his music is as strong as ever, a professor of mine didn't even know Bob Marley was dead. He asked if it was possible for Bob Marley to put on a concert for the college ( I attended College in the States ). I explained to him that Bob died in '81 as we think of death, but in other forms he is very much alive. <br />You need get no other CD ever, except if it's other Bob's albums ofcourse. <br />If Bob is a legend then the word legend should be reserved for Bob Marley ONLY.  Otherwise make up a new word for the man.<br />One Love all.<br />Go buy the set, you never know they may stop printing it again. If they dothat we'll just have to 'Chase dem crazy ballheads out of town'
6305313687|5.0|\\"Good art restores values. It aims to destroy the false-not all values, not all authority-and create the good and virtuous.\\" That quote is what Oliver Stone believes good art should be, if it is to be classified as good art.   The movie American History X is very complex and intricate. I feel that it is indeed an example of good art. It clearly does follow Stone's guidelines to be classified as this.  In this film the false values are attacked, such as the showing of how ignorant and blind racism is and makes people. The film also goes on to create the good. You can see this creation as the film progresses. You see it in the form of Derek's transition from skinhead racist back to an almost \\"normal\\" human being. I found it quite interesting to see some of the signs of this transition.  I noticed how in the beginning of the film we see Derek so full of hate and anger, which leads to the un-thinkable act he committed against someone just because of the \\"color\\" of his skin. We see how Derek begins to realize the wrong in his ways while he is in prison for his crime. At first when he is paired off with a \\"black\\" man named Lamont for the task of folding laundry, Derek shows no emotion or any kind of response when he is talked to by his \\"co-worker,\\" but then as time goes by, he eventually begins showing some signs of emotion. Finally, the breaking point, he is actually laughing when Lamont makes a joke and then we begin to see him actually talking to Lamont with a certain amount of respect. This seems to be because he realizes this \\"colored\\" man is a fellow human being, no different from him or anyone else; it was only until he was forced to be near one that he realized that.   American History X, I believe, clearly works to create. Many people may take it as an attempt to destroy, but in actuality I feel it is working to create by destroying any notions that racism is okay. We are thrust into a victim's life, a victim who has felt the brunt of racism and its destruction of society. We see that this destruction, if not controlled or contained, is about to consume the life of another human being, happening to be the first victim's own brother.  The film aims to destroy the false values and beliefs that are set forth by racism in general. We are clearly shown the consequences of what can happen if something gets out of hand and totally consumes one's mind and way of thinking.  After this \\"destruction,\\" created is hope. It is shown that people can change, and although the main character, Derek, committed an atrocious act and apparently showed no remorse, he did in fact change. It was only when the consequences of such actions were thrust upon him and he was forced to see the \\"light,\\" that he began to gain an understanding and see the gaping holes in his beliefs. An understanding is created. The viewers are shown that these people are not hopeless; they just need help.  Hatred is often condemned by those who claim to have no hatred in themselves, while in fact, often the people that are condemning hatred are actually showing hate towards the people that are \\"doing\\" the actual acts of hate. This film in a way aims to open one's eyes and show them that such people are not hopeless; in other words, \\"it aims to destroy the false... and create the good and virtuous.\\" The look Derek gives himself in the mirror looking at the tattoo of a swastika on his chest after taking a shower is very influential, the looks almost says these exact words with out making a sound, \\"I just took a shower and cleansed my entire body and yet, I am still dirty.\\"   It took Danny's brother Derek to make those changes occur, Derek had obviously learned his lesson and did not at all want Danny to go through what he had just gone through. He wanted this at all costs and luckily Danny somewhat idolized Derek so all Derek had to do was basically get the ball rolling, although it was deeper than that.  In the film we are also shown where the root of this hatred came from,it originated from Derek's father. Although it was not a direct instruction to hate, it was a seed of doubt, doubt that told Derek to not \\"believe it all.\\" This was the beginning of it all and when Derek's dad was killed by a person which he was told \\"to be careful\\" about, this helped to spawn it even more. Escalating this mistrust and doubt into the eventual climax of hate which led to another person's death, although that person was still not totally innocent, his life was still taken.  I hold American History X to be an act of resistance and a piece of good art for in my opinion it clearly meets Stone's criteria for this. It was destroying the false by showing a \\"real\\" family and not a phony family, which is just for entertainment. It does not destroy all authority and not all values. It defiantly aims to create; it creates an understanding and a realization of the wrongness of racism and hatred. It aims to create the good and virtuous by showing Derek and Danny's new understanding of people towards the end of the film.   If this film were shown to people that are racist in someway it could help them greatly, and I believe that is a very important feature of this film as well, all the more making it good art in my opinion. I believe it adheres to Stone's principles very strongly and I also believe that more films should be like this one: good.
6301976258|5.0|Gary Cooper's first Academy Award winning performance (his other award was earned from &quot;High Noon&quot;) is in one of the most memorable films to come out of Hollywood.  World War I had been one of the most unpopular wars ever fought by the United States.  Even though President Woodrow Wilson promised to keep the country out of the war, the pressures to enter were just too great.  Even near the war's conclusion in 1918, uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict was quite prevalent; the United States was in need of a hero to keep the morale up.  This film is based on the true life story of Alvin York, a Tennessee native who at first objected to his induction into the army due to religious beliefs.  This gifted sharpshooter played a significant role in helping to win the war for the Allies.  This film has everything needed to be a cinematic classic whose popularity will endure for generations to come.
0679729895|5.0|I was enchanted with Roald Dahl's writing as a child ever since I read CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY and JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH.  I was pleasantly surprised to stumble across this book while browsing through the shelves of my university's library.  After reading TASTE and then LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER, I found it difficult to put the book down.  I find Dahl's style of writing and his keen attention to detail an absolute delight.  Every story is a treat and I relish the moments that I have a bit of time to read a story or two.  As a busy student, I don't have much time for recreational reading, and that's why short stories are a favorite.  I enjoyed the book so much that I decided to purchase a personal copy from Amazon because this is a book I would like to read more than once.  I had just been reading some of Shirley Jackson's short stories and was delighted to find another author who is consumately skilled in the genre.  For those of you who like unusual stories with a twist, this book is for you.
B0000027RL|5.0|Some say this is not Pearl Jam's best album.  They say its to polished and glitsy. But the fact of the matter is this. Ten is an amazing album especially in light of the swarm of mediocre albums by todays artistsuch as the poor man's PJ Creed.  Name me one bad song on the album and I'll name you someone who doesn't understand music.  The album starts off with the hard edged song Once and follows it up with the amazing song Even Flow.  From there it hits an early peak with the brilliantly emotional song, Alive in which the opening chords will instantly draw you in and the smooth growls of Eddie Vedder will keep you there.  The Album follows with the hard rock Why Go and fromthere to the deeply emotional Black which shows Vedder at his best vocally. Then comes the big hit Jeremy.  I still get chills listening to the song, its a classic. Now to side B. Nothing changes.  The songs are still great from  start to finish.  Oceans is unique and atmospheric song that shows PJ's ability change styles throughout the album.  Then comes Porch a great song that if you haven't seen it performed on MTV's Unplugged from '93 you are missing something. Garden is a tremendous  B side song which because it is B side shows the quality of this  album.  Deep and Release are great songs to round out the album. On Ten Pearl Jam proved they were meant for legendary status.<br />If you like Ten you must check these albums out:<br />Nevermind- Nirvana V.S.- Pearl Jam In Utero- Nirvana Are You Experienced- Jimi Hendrix (not direct link to PJ, but he's such a genius artist that youMUST listen)
B00004X01U|5.0|I have been a fan of Madonna from the beginning of her run in the early 1980's. She has lost me a couple of times along the way, but I've always considered myself a fan. The last Madonna CD I bought was &quot;Erotica,&quot; and while it had a few good songs, I found it to uneven as a whole. I had heard a couple of tracks from &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; and I dug them, but I never pursued the CD.<br />Flash forward to a couple of weeks ago when I heard &quot;Music&quot; blasting in a dance club, and I was hooked. ... Well, I liked them all, so I went out and bought the CD! What a great collection of tunes! I find the CD to be completely hypnotic. I especially find &quot;I Deserve It&quot; to be totally mesmerizing - I can listen to it over and over.<br />&quot;Music&quot; has already moved right up near the top of my all time favorite CD's. My advice is to buy this CD ASAP!
0446677450|5.0|Okay, I'll grant you this.  The whole book could be condensed to about 30 pages.  Yes, I skimmed most of the book and finished it in about 4 hours.  Yes, Robert is not the most talented author.  However, when I bought the book, I was not looking for a literary classic.  I was looking to learn how to make money.  In that respect, the book served its purpose, and I am satisfied.  His income/expense/assets/liability diagram alone is worth the price of the book!  It's a shame that people need to be flooded with information to think they got their money's worth.  Using this chart taught me where I stand financially, and how to get where I want to be.  One more thing, it is a big infomercial for his game, but I don't care.  I'm buying the game, and if it sucks, I'll send it back.  The point is I enjoyed the book.  Also, I read the two sequels, and they were similar.  They could've been condensed to thirty pages, too.  Once again, I don't care.  His Cashflow Quadrant diagram is as useful as his I/E/A/L diagram.  His 90/10 rule is equally useful.  I'm convinced that collectively, these three concepts will make me a wealthy man.

0345440757|5.0|I saw Tracy on Dateline and rushed out to buy the book after seeing how she calmed the babies I knew immediately that this book was for me. I did all the things that Ms Hogg tells you not to do as parents do, at the time I knew this can't be right but how can you stop yourself as a new parent from rushing in no one tells you in the other books I read. They assume that all babies are the same my son Jake was 4 weeks premature and all he wanted to do was sleep I on the other hand thought his cries were for hunger and was determined to get him from his frail 4lb to 10lbs as soon as possible consequently he had colic. He is now 8 months and thanks to this book I have him on a structured routine sleeping through the night
0066620694|5.0|This book is so good you wish your competitors could be kept from reading it! Christensen does more the think &quot;out of the box&quot; he shows you how he developed and substantiated the themes in the book. <br />The disk drive industry is broken down to exemplify an area that has rapid &quot;disruptive&quot; technology changes at regular intervals... and how companies adapt and fail... <br />I tell you this book can cost you lost sleep as you contemplate what could shake up your industry and how you will react. This book will be a clasic for 100 years (or more). A must have in anyones collection (no I am not related to the author).
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya has been one of my favorite artists since I first heard her over 10 years ago.  Her soft sweet voice and the positive tone of her lyrics are pure poetry.  A Day Without Rain is my all time favorite.  Some suggest that this CD has nothing new.  I could not disagree more.  Saying that there is nothing new here would be like suggesting that all of Emily Dickenson's poetry could be summarized in a single stanza.  True, the flavor is similar to previous works, but if this were not the case, this would not be Enya!<br />Being partial to her Gaeilge (Irish) recordings, my favorite on this CD is without question &quot;Deora Ar Mo Chroi.&quot;  I only wish that she would record more in Gaeilge.<br />If you have ever been an Enya fan, this CD is a must buy!

And, although Bill Bryson doesn't mention it, Australia even has a toad that will make you crazy if you lick it. <br />But you'd have to be crazy in the first place, to lick a toad,  wouldn't you?<br />You don't have to be crazy to buy In A Sunburned Country, though. It's as funny as his other stuff. Maybe even funnier.
0385335482|5.0|I could not stop reading this book.  As a fellow shopaholic I found this book to be very funny and enlightening.  Sophie Kinsella does a brillant job explaining women's &quot;need&quot; to shop and that is developed in the main character, Rebecca.  She does it in a way that is both entertaining and amusing.
0671027344|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life and I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you graduated high school in the '90s or love someone who did.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a must have for any audio-visual enthusiast.  It's great to be sitting in your living room being surrounded by bullets, explosions, etc.  Whether you like the movie or not you will get enjoyment from your system with this disc.
0399146253|2.0|I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that in &quot;The Last Precinct,&quot; Patricia Cornwell drags in way too much of her previous novel, &quot;Black Notice&quot;--the first hundred pages literally paraphrase what went on in BN.  Unlike others, I've never found Dr. Kay Scarpetta to be a particularly sympathetic or even likable character.  Cornwell tends to paint Scarpetta as the all-knowing and all-seeing wisewoman, with an insufferable attitude towards those she finds &quot;inferior&quot;, most notably Pete Marino.  The situation with her niece Lucy (oh, did you know that she's a lesbian?  It's hard to ignore when Cornwell mentions that fact seemingly every time Lucy's name comes up) is getting to be a joke as well.  Cornwell, as usual, is technically flawless in the forensic details, but inside Scarpetta's chilly, self-absorbed psyche is not a place where'd I'd want to hang out for very long.
B00003CWTI|1.0|I knew basically nothing about this movie when it began and was fairly excited for a noteworthy cast to deliver a respectable performance.  I think it's safe to say I took my first nap appx. 30 minutes into the movied when I realized it was going absolutely nowhere.  For the next 2+ hours (that seemed like 2+ days) I drifted in/out of conciousness. Waking up here and there to some occasional frogs, and other sad stories all converging in one big mess called magnolia.  Avoid this movie like a bad stomach bug.
0743201140|3.0|Since I didn't read their first book I thought the first half of the book was great. Their research on focusing on strengths v. improving weaknesses was really valuable. The test process and results leave much to be desired. <br />You get a list of 5 strengths and one page explaining each, but no guidance on what it might mean to know these things. For example, the book talks about how important it is to use your strengths to find the right role in your chosen field and then gives very little insight into mapping strengths to roles. Also, you don't get to see beyond your top 5 strengths which leaves you wondering about the others even though it says the next 2 or 3 might be important. The fact that you can't share with a family member or retake the test without buying another copy is really lame.<br />In general a good business / management book on why a strengths focus is important, but little in the way of understanding and applying your strengths. Guess they either took the word &quot;discover&quot; literally in that it means get a simple list of 5 strengths or there is another book on the way. Depending on whether you are looking for management theory or personal strengths insight it may or may not be a good buy.
B000031WD9|5.0|This movie is one that can be watched on a monthly basis without getting old. The scenarios are too funny.  From the opening scene with the funky music all the way to Stiffler's mom, this one will have you laughing out loud.

B000008DA5|5.0|At this time in Beach Boys history in 1967, surfing, the beach, cars, etc. was pretty much out of their vocabulary, just as  Beatle mania was no longer in existence for the Beatles, both were growing up or grown up. Although the BB's would return some what to the pop/surf sound a bit off and on through the years.<br /><br />Pet Sounds was the Beach Boys zenith (they found themselves), yet here was Brian Wilson trying to top it with \\"Smile\\", this was a big task to say the least, and he came very close to doing it, but in all fairness,  \\"Pet Sounds\\" didn't go over to well in 1966, in fact it wouldn't for at least 5 to 10 years, so Brian was probably still thinking he didn't reach the ultimate album yet, with the fans that is. So back to the drawing board he went. If \\"Pet Sounds' would have been considered great as it is today, his next one may have been a totally different album, who knows.<br /><br />Now, I will say this, \\"Smile\\" would have been great if released, what I heard on bootlegs was beautiful and amazing, but that doesn't mean \\"Smiley Smile\\" is a bad album, because its not,  It's a great album. It starts out with a Wilson and VDParks masterpiece, \\"Heroes and Villains\\". All sorts of flavors on this song, Pop mixed with some barbershop quartet and a bit of jazz, with sound effects etc. Then a health song called \\"Vegetables\\", great harmony with a thumping bass guitar, more sound effects. The next one is a great song called \\"Fall Breaks and Back To Winter\\" (Woody woodpecker symphony), Brian called it art music. If you listen in between the wood knock sounds, the deep echoed barks and bells etc. you can hear the Woody Woodpecker theme.<br /><br />\\"She's Goin Bald\\"(written by Wilson, Love, Parks), starts out like a lazy on the beach bongo song,  then the tempo starts going up, in a animated sort of way, then it goes into a 50s piano boogie, about how this girl has no more hair, Good one!  \\"Little Pad\\" is comic in its own way,  in a Hawaiian song style.<br /><br />\\"Good Vibrations\\"..., its truly a beautiful and harmonic song, possibly their best song.<br /><br />\\"Wind Chimes\\" is beautiful and unique; it closes with \\"whispering winds\\". \\"Getting Hungry\\", a Wilson and Love rocker, also released as a single, the bass is played really nice on here.  \\"Wonderful\\" is absolutely beautiful as Carl sings , almost whispering the song, yes the original was also great, I love both. \\"Whistle in\\" is a one minute lyric repeated song with piano and bass guitar,a ditty. Most of this album, (but not the hits and most of Vegetables) was recorded in Brian's living room made into a makeshift studio, he wanted to stay home, so they brought the studio to him.<br /><br />Then there's the album \\"Wild Honey\\", the titled song is a R&B rocker.<br /><br />\\"A Thing Or Two\\" is a nice jazzy rocker written by Wilson and Love.<br /><br />The biggest hit on the WH album is \\"Darlin\\". \\"I'd Love Once To See You\\" is a \\"sitting on the ground playing the acoustic for everyone, style song by Brian, it has that 1967 feel to it, great song. \\"Here Comes The Night\\" is more R&B by Brian and Mike. \\"Let The Wind Blow\\" is a favorite for this fan here, its pretty and again unique,written and sung by Brian Wilson and Mike Love.<br /><br />\\"How She Boogalooed it\\", is a rocker but has that old BB's sound to it, sung by Carl, written by Carl Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, and Bruce Johnston, only draw back it's less than two minutes long.<br /><br />\\"Mama Says\\" is another health song, as was \\"Vegetables\\", it was in fact part of that song originally.<br /><br />The bonus songs are fantastic; it shows the exhausting perfection Brian went through on \\"Good Vibrations\\" and \\"Smile\\".<br /><br />\\"Can't Wait too Long\\"/Been Way Too Long\\" is a unbelievable unreleased gem.<br /><br />There you have it, \\"Smiley Smile/Wild Honey\\", two fantastic albums on one CD. No, its not \\"Help Me Rhonda or \\"I get Around\\" no its not \\"California Girls, its what they became in 1966-67, they moved on, its great,you should buy this to enjoy also.<br /><br />Also check out the other great 2-fers,  \\"Friends/20-20\\", \\"Sunflowers/Surfs Up\\", all the way to  \\"15 Big ones/Love You\\", get them, you'll want them.nflowers/Surfs Up\\", all the way to  \\"15 Big ones/Love You\\", get them, you'll want them.
B00003CXN4|4.0|This star-studded movie (with many cameo's from Washington's finest) was an outstanding rendition of a tried and tired theme...How do we win the drug war.  When Michael Douglas's job hits close to home it reminds the viewer that the only drug problem is not in the back alleys.  Intriguing and entertaining.  Catch it before its out of the theaters.
B000056K04|5.0|Although some DMB fans will likely dismiss Everyday for its innovative sound and break from the &quot;typical&quot; DMB album, it illustrates a new direction for this high energy group.  Like the addition of orchestration on their last studio album, the band has revamped their sound again to explore new musical areas.  While I lament the omission of Tim Reynolds' atmospheric solos, Carter's fills, and the extended interplay between Boyd and Leroi, this album focuses more upon Dave's vocal mastery and lyrical abilities.  Some may argue that Glen Ballard's approach to shortening the tracks hindered the improvisational qualities heard on other recordings and I will admit that I do miss the more progressive and jam-oriented explorations of the other albums.  There are times when the listener will want and expect a ripping sax solo or mesmerizing drum and violin riff, but what you get in return is just as strong and original as previous songs.  And, while I've never been a big fan of the singles, don't let &quot;I Did It&quot; dissuade you from purchasing this great album.  Songs like &quot;Angel,&quot; &quot;The Space Between,&quot; &quot;If I Had it All,&quot; and &quot;Dreams of Our Fathers&quot; showcase the band's musicianship and hybrid blend of musical genres.  Not many bands would have the courage to take their sound in such a new direction and Everyday once again reestablishes the DMB as a band like no other.  Die hard fans will no doubt realize that the true power of these songs cannot be fully appreciated until the new tour begins.  Until then, buy Everyday and enjoy!

Although Suede hasn't received as much commerical success has other UK bands, they are one of the best. PICK THIS CD UP!! It is such a great cd. It has everything you would want from a cd. Sad songs, fast songs, happy songs, but most importently, great songs.
B00004XONN|5.0|Thom Yorke, Radiohead's lyricist, vocalist and one of its three guitarists, possesses a voice that can turn anything into beauty.  No difference on Kid A, as Yorke takes a wonderful mess of samples, keyboards, drum machines, guitar licks, crashing horns and vocal loops and turns them into the best and most beautiful album of 2000.  Please bear in mind, I am not giving sole credit to Yorke for the marvelous piece of work that is Kid A.  A lesser band might have taken Yorke's pleading, piercing, heavenly vocals and surrounded them with equally pleasant music, but Radiohead doesn't.  Instead, they do quite the opposite, and because they do, an album that would have been great anyway becomes a work of art.  Listen to the songs and then listen to them again; notice how dilberately ugly most of the sounds are, particularly in their arrangements, until Yorke's voice comes in, making everything seem all right, reassuring us that even in the ugliest of times, when we're surrounded by the most horrible and frightening noises imaginable, some force - namely an understanding, respectful love - eminating from an unnamed, unidentifiable source will sweep in and decide whether the women or children will be first; how many colors are in one's head; whether or not you are lost in the wilderness being eaten by wolves; whether or not you're crazy, maybe; and everything will be in its right place once again.  The world of pop music may be an ugly place with ugly sounds, but Radiohead will always be around to come save us, with a sound that's harsher, more daring, perhaps even uglier, and a voice that makes perfection seem attainable.
0812589041|5.0|Where to start... so far, I've found most people who read Ender's Game either hate it with a passion or love it with a passion. I've read over a thousand books in the sci-fi and fantasty genre (from authors old and new including Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke, Bova, Martin, Brooks, and MANY others) and E.G. stands above them all for me.<br />Partially, the reason is I identify with the character of Ender so well, partially because Card has a way of showing us the true human nature of the characters in ways I can relate to as honest and real (perhaps that is why some readers hate it so much... the people in E.G. are REAL people with REAL faults and REAL motives, both bad and good, not a fake society that's perfect like people wish ours were). Card makes very believable portrayals of all the characters exhibitting the good and the bad in each and the struggles each goes through in being human in a very convincing way. Though sci-fi is the genre, as he himself says in the intro, the story is more about the characters, and sci-fi is just the medium in which it is told. The story is a tale of Life, the struggle to be accepted as who you really are, the challenges of responsibilities being thrust on you that you must shoulder even if you didnt ask for them, the choices you make to further those responsibilities you've accepted and the responsibilities and challenges of just being human. This book should be a must read for everyone. <br />- Rob
B000056K04|4.0|Dave Matthews has said that he switched producers (from Steve Lilywhite to Glen Ballard) because the Lilywhite sessions left him uninspired and Ballard immediately renewed his spirit.  I believe in musicians taking risks and Dave Matthews Band (whom I have followed devotedly since I first heard &quot;Ants Marching&quot;) shows great maturity by reigning in their individual sounds and playing as a whole moreso on this album than any since Under the Table and Dreaming.  The new direction their music is heading in will undoubtedly yield excellent albums in the years to come and lead away from the creative roadblocks that crippled Matthews on and after Before These Crowded Streets.  Unfortunately, though I like this album quite a bit and consider it an improvement over Before These Crowded Streets, I believe that Matthews and Ballard have, in their desire to tighten the band's sound, inhibited the creativity of all the band members, most especially Matthews himself.  The great thing about Dave Matthews is that, like the early Elton John, his voice possesses not only great emotional power, but also the ability to carry that power in many styles.  Matthews has a beautiful, soft delivery and a wonderful falsetto that have marked some of his most powerful songs (&quot;Typical Situation,&quot; &quot;Ants Marching,&quot; &quot;Crash Into Me,&quot; &quot;Lie in Our Graves&quot;) and that are entirely absent from this album (save for &quot;The Space Between&quot;).  I miss hearing the different modulations of Dave's voice, both from song to song and from note to note.  Likewise, Carter Beauford's drumming, toned down from the excesses of Before These Crowded Streets, has been, I think, too toned down.  Beauford is capable of so much more than the basic rock beat with occasional roll-off that he is allowed here, and while I recognize that it's necessary to give an artist direction, it's quite another thing to sedate him.  Glen Ballard is a producer of hits.  Jagged Little Pill was excellent because of Alanis Morisette's unique vocals, not Glen Ballard's genius as a producer, and what's more, she is a singer, not a band.  I believe that Ballard has restricted the magnificent musicians of the DMB rather than given them direction.  Steve Lilywhite is a producer of art, as anyone who has listened to Peter Gabriel is aware of, and I think that he forgot, with all the artistry this band is capable of, to give his artists a focus.  Everyday is a good rock album that both DMB fans and the general public should and most likely will enjoy, but I hope that on their next album the group will stick with the tight rock sound established here, while also gaining more artistic freedom than Ballard seems to have allowed them.  It's great that Dave found his inspiration again... now I'd like him to get his voice back.
6305159432|1.0|This movie is the worst piece of clap trap that I have ever seen.  Built in the mold of the Rambo series, the film tries to play off of the West's fear of the Soviet Union.  You'd be better of watching a &quot;How to pour milk&quot; instructional video, than watch this film that will make you less smart!
B000056K04|1.0|Reviews are usually ambiguous and impossible to tell what the reviewer really thinks. So, to get to the point, this album is horrible. Yes I like Dave. No I dont expect Ants Marching. Yes I am open minded. No I didnt judge the album on one listen. Where are the melodies? Wheres the emotion? Where are the the elements that made DMB original? I wont even mention that the lyrics are pathetic....
B00004R7AP|5.0|The Corrs are the best band in the world. I love their music, and on Unplugged, they are performing at their best. Andrea's vocals are beautiful, and so is her tin whistle playing. Jim, Caroline, and Sharon are also multi-talented. This video showcases the humorous side of the band, as well as the raw talent that they have. This isn't just some band who was created by some record company, this is a family. Two of my favorite parts are when Caroline messes up &quot;Runaway&quot; and Jim makes a joke about it, and when Sharon and Caroline sing Heaven Knows (No Frontiers). This is definitely a video that you will want to own.
0783217048|4.0|Movies are meant to entertain and that is what this one does.  Who cares whether the plot is smaltzy or not, this film keeps you laughing all the way through.  I am not familiar with the actor who played Chi Chi, but I can't imagine anyone less macho than Wesley Snipes and he along with Patrick Swayze are absolutely hilarious as drag queens.  Michael Vartan as small town thug is just an extra bonus to watching this movie.  This movie is well worth watching.  My only complaint is that the song &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me&quot;, which was sung during the town dance, was not included on the movie soundtrack.
0440178002|5.0|Shogun has to be the greatest epic novel ever. The massive scale is enormously powerful, the flow of the story is outstanding, the characters are alive and the ending is unexpected but natural. It's useless to describe this book in detail, you can't describe it as perfectly as Clavell wrote it. EVERY SELF-RESPECTING PERSON HAS TO READ THIS UNBELIEVABLE MASTERPIECE!!!

0525945636|4.0|This is a book that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I think it was written with a movie in mind, and the movie should be a good one.<br />The basic plot, the amnesia of the protagonist, is a creative tool that makes the story all that more engrossing.  The ending is a little too neat for my mind.  Inconvenient marriages and antagonists get disposed of with un-lifelike ease and simplicity.  The happy ending is all too happy to be realistic.  But, getting there has been interesting.<br />I am a bit surprised by the anachronisms of the book.  Repeated use of a Xerox machine, yet to be introduced to the market (and perhaps not even invented yet, but I am not sure of that) is casually mentioned.  Any reader who remembers the 1950s and worked in engineering will remember, not fondly, the mimeograph machine and the ammonia smell of drawings being reproduced.  Not Haloid Corporation to ease one's pains; just yet.<br />More to the point than that, however, is the dialogue.  Teen slang of the 1990s (this &quot;sucks&quot;) was certainly not in use then, and the writer should not use it if he expects the text to have a ring of authenticity to it.  I think that the author got a few cars mixed up then, as well.  And, Corvette convertibles in the 1950s, as far as I can recollect, were not air-conditioned.  Why be picky?  The author thanks a professional writers' research organization at the end of the book for their support.  For sure, they should know better.<br />But, all in all, it's a good book.  A tale well designed to take advantage of a moment in history shrouded in a bit of mystery.<br />What are authors going to do when people forget the Cold War?  The Black Hats, and the White Hats, got trashed with the Berlin Wall's demise.  I wait with eager anticipation the next generation of techno-thrillers.  It's about time.
6305358613|5.0|&quot;Elizabeth&quot; embodies the characteristics of truly great filmmaking. Blanchett's portrayal of the young queen is nothing less than astounding. The transformation of this innocent and uncorrupt creature brilliantlly produces a strong and empowered figure, despite all obstacles. The style of this period is captured quite effectively, most evident in design of period costume and stage. &quot;Elizabeth&quot; transcends the less than accurate account of history by creating an emotionally satisfying experience for the viewer. Such scenes as &quot;Enigma&quot; with Joseph Fiennes is as climactic as it is chilling. A haunting scene I will not soon forget. Despite all obstacles, &quot;Elizabeth&quot; represents the remarkable power of the human spirit. A refreshing and passionate performance. Highly recommended!
B00004VVNB|4.0|This is a quirky, fun film.  I have heard that it borrows heavily from Arthur C. Clarke's City and the Stars but I have never read it so I really couldn't say if that is the case.  The premise is familiar to most SF fans.  Survivors of some kind of apocalyptic disaster are living within a seaside city that is totally enclosed within protective domes.  Those inside have little knowledge of the world &quot;outside&quot;.  They live in a hedonistic paradise (take THAT you me generation folk!) and are totally provided for...except there's a catch.  You must die at 30 so that the population balance within the city can be maintained.<br />Herein lies the plot.  Two people decide to escape and they find &quot;another world&quot; outside.  The rest is waiting for you and you will probably get a kick out of it, if for no other reason than to see the truly hilarious costumes and the sexy chicks.  Enjoy!
B000000993|5.0|I really can't describe how much I love this album in words.  Of all the music I listen to there is only one band i can classify as my favorite.  I can't even quite make a top-10 bands without feeling like i've left someone out, but Tool has always remained in the #1 slot.  This is definitely the album to start with if you're new to the Tool experience.  I have listened to this album inside and out so many times I will go with a track by track review of this album. 1. Intolerance-Opens the cd perfectly, if  this song doesn't hook you, you probably won't like Tool.  Very, VERY melodic while still incredibly heavy  (10/10 stars) 2. Prison Sex-Not one of my favorite Tool songs but it seems to be everyone elses favorite,  along with Sober this was one of the songs that put them on the commercial map and got this album alot of recognition.  It's a great song it just doesn't hook me like the rest of their music.  (8/10 stars) 3. Sober-The other song that gained them national exposure,  about an artist the band knows that is at his artistic best when he's wasted.  It means alot more for other people but that's the direct meaning from Maynard.  (9/10 stars) 4. Bottom-If I HAD to pick a favorite Tool song this would definitely be it,  hooks you along the same way intolerance should have, heavier than the preceding tracks, my favorite part of this song is at the end of the Henry Rollins sample, when they break back into the chorus, really sounds awesome. (11/10) 5. Crawl Away-This was actually an older Tool song that they had recordings of before Opiate came out, remastered for this album it became a great great song.  Shows you why Tool has been called &quot;progressive metal&quot; as it starts out really slow and slowly gets faster and faster, just to slow down again. (9/10) 6. Swamp Song-My other favorite on the album, I just flat out fell in love with this song from the first time I heard it.  Has a really really great hook that should grab you and hold you for the entire5:32 7. Undertow-The title track, not really one of my favorites.  A live track that alot of other fans really love.  I don't know why but if there is one i condsider this the low point of the album (7/10) 8. 4 Degrees-I could tell you what this song is about but my review wouldn't get posted :)  I really love this song, Maynard's voice catches me as really trippy on this song.  One of my favorites (10/10) 9. Flood-Not a whole lot of singing, but this song really shows you just how talented musically the band is,  could almost be considered an instrumental as Maynard doesn't do a whole lot of singing.  (8.5/10 10.  Disgustipated-A satirical attack on Christianity.  Really hilarious for an athiest and it really is a valid attack.  The song itself is just maynard screaming the same line over and over again so it's not much of a song, listen to the crickets chirping for long enough and you will hear a little phone message that was left on one of the band members phones, chilling....(8/10) Overall I consider this one of the greatest albums of my 17 year life,  I listen to Tool constantly and this album most often.  If you want to see why all metal isn't screaming and yelling, this is your album.
B00000016V|5.0|THe album is great- as with all Doors albums.  Once you have become acquainted with it, it is some of the best music you will EVER hear.<br />Except for L.A. Woman (the song itself) that is THE BEST song you will ever hear, if you're a Doors fan, and if your not I hope this will turn you into one. Texas Radio &amp; The Big Beat, The Changeling, Riders on the Storm are also absolutely excellent. Possibly the best album of probably the best 60s group.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Wow, Moby's Play is an awesome cd if you like music at all. Moby is a genius with &quot;Porcelaine&quot;, to &quot;Everloving&quot;, IF you like music then get Moby's play.
B00004Y6RO|1.0|I have listened to extreme music for a long time now, and never have I heard such utter crap in my entire life. The only good this album can do is to help tell the true metal fans from the trendies who think its fasionable. Slipknot have killed metal. Death to trendy metal fans! Death to false metal!
6301025040|5.0|This is by far Sylvester Stallone's best action to date. I must recommend it to any Sly fan. He is the best action hero working in motion pictures today.<br />Stallone rules!
B000002OHF|4.0|This album's only failing was that it was the band's next release after the classic ARGUS -- it was always going to be a tough act to follow.  The cover was also, by comparison, uninspired.  Nice windswept hairdos, lads, but we preferred the medieval imagery of  anonymous knights watching UFOs landing over Glastonbury.<br />WISHBONE 4 suffered only because the band were determined not to duplicate ARGUS.  In doing so, they perhaps reverted to the boogie style of their first two albums.  There are some great rockers on this album, alternating with some softer tracks, all of them sprinkled with anthemic solos from the dual guitars of Andy Powell and Ted Turner.  The sound quality on my MCA/BMG copy of the CD is not tremendous, particularly the drums, which are very dull and muffled.<br />The album reached No. 12 in the US, and the loyal fan base persuaded the band to become UK tax exiles there!<br />This is a good album, and the only reason for not buying this version is that the equally good follow-up THERE'S THE RUB seems now to be available only as a twin-set with this album.  I would recommend buying that.
B000002C4J|5.0|I believe this is probably the best album by Celine!! My favorite tracks are The Reason,Imortality, Treat Her Like A Lady, Why Oh Why, Tell Him, My Heart Will Go On, I Hate You Then I Love You, and Let's Talk About Love. I recomend this CD to everyone in this world!
B000001DQG|4.0|As with all these ramastered &quot;The Classic Years&quot; albums, it comes with a nice 20 page booklet with all lyrics and photos of EJ and band. Also a 3 1/2 page essay about the album by John Tobler. Also included on the album are 4 bonus tracks. So, even though this wasn't one of Elton John's finest albums, the little extra's make it a must for true Elton fans. The original album only spawned 2 hit songs, but the rest of the album isn't without merits. Among them, &quot;Pinky&quot; is a nice romantic ballad. The album also has some filler though, such as &quot;Grimsby&quot;. But all in all, I'm sure most fans would still like to have it in their collection.
B00000I41G|5.0|Next to &quot;mercy, mercy, mercy&quot;, &quot;kind of blue&quot; and &quot;ultimate blue train&quot; this is my favorite jazz cd. So much talent on one session. Soul and blues delivered in a fiery passion that engulfs the listener and transports him to the players world of emotion, is a pleasure to let go and feel it!
0440211727|5.0|I would just like to say, I've read this book three times, and it's one  of the best books I've ever read.  It was GREAT!!!  For myself, I admit I don't have a lot of time, or patience to sit down and read a lot of books, but this one, I couldn't wait to continue reading it. From the first page to the final page was totally excellent!  I am now an advid reader of John Grisham. Thanks to this book, I am now reading alot more.  Much more than I ever have in my 37 Years.   I've read the Firm, the Testament, which in my opinion, are also both excellent books.
B0000009XP|5.0|The passion and outright blues savagery are unparalleled in any studio blues recording i have ever heard! I have actually shed a few tears while driving alone and getting sucked into the blues played here!
B00003CX6P|5.0|&quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; is an Hitchcockian and blood-curdling study of the psychopath and his victims. At the centre of this masterpiece, set in the exquisitely decadent scapes of Italy, is a titanic encounter between Ripley, the aforementioned psychopath protagonist and young Greenleaf, a consummate narcissist.<br />But perhaps the most intriguing portraits are those of the victims. Marge insists, in the face of the most callous and abusive behaviour, that there is something &quot;tender&quot; in Greenleaf Jr. When she confronts the beguiling monster, Ripley, she encounters the fate of all victims of psychopaths: disbelief, pity and ridicule. The truth is too horrible to contemplate, let alone comprehend. Psychopaths are inhuman in the most profound sense of this compounded word. Their emotions and conscience have been amputated and replaced by phantom imitations. But it is rare to pierce their meticulously crafted facade. They more often than not go on to great success and social acceptance while their detractors are relegated to the fringes of society. Both Meredith and Peter, who had the misfortune of falling in deep, unrequited love with Ripley, are punished. One by losing his life, the other by losing Ripley time and again, mysteriously, capriciously, cruelly.<br />Thus, ultimately, the film is an intricate study of the pernicious ways of psychopathology. Mental disorder is a venom not confined to its source. It spreads and affects its environment in a myriad surreptitiously subtle forms. It is a hydra, growing one hundred heads where one was severed. Its victims writhe and as abuse is piled upon trauma - they turn to stone, the mute witnesses of horror, the stalactites and stalagmites of pain untold and unrecountable. For their tormentors are often as talented as Mr. Ripley is and they are as helpless and as clueless as his victims are.<br />Sam Vaknin, author of &quot;Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited&quot;.
6301902645|5.0|In a few words...A truly excellent auto-racing movie. Steve McQueen is very good in his role as the quiet racing warrior who is first and foremost about winning. &quot;Racing is important to me and I do it well ... Anything that happens before or after, is just waiting!&quot; he states.  He also shows his restrained tender side when he interacts on a couple of occasions with the widow of a fellow driver killed in an accident involving him the year before at LeMans. But it is his racing and the racing scenes that make this movie a treat, along with the &quot;other&quot; star.  That of course is the Porsche 917K racing car, acclaimed as the greatest racing car of all time in an expert poll conducted by Motor Sport Magazine in 1997.  If you saw the F14 Tomcat Fighter in the movie &quot;Top Gun&quot;, then you understand what I am talking about here with the 917. This movie is about racing at LeMans in the early 1970s. The &quot;battle&quot; scenes between the Porsche 917s and the Ferrari 512s are classic and really draw you into the movie. If you enjoy tough, aggressive, exciting racing action without all of the other side distractions and fluff, you will like/love this movie.

B000002OX5|5.0|The Who's Sell Out marks the beginning of Pete Townsend's concept album odyssey. Moving further away from the standard two-minute single format of the band's early days, Townsend approached Sell Out as a mock radio broadcast, with the majority of the songs connected by an assortment of jingles and advertisements. Apart from being quite funny, these commercial spots add an air of authenticity to the pirate radio format. And of course, the album works because Townsend was reaching his songwriting peak.<br />A broad range of styles are covered here. There's the standard psychedelia of 'Armenia City in The Sky' (written by John Keane,) followed 'MaryAnne With The Shaky Hands,'  adorned with Beach Boy harmonies and ringing tropical guitars. The highlights are numerous, but the most obvious hit is 'I Can See For Miles,' which can be found on any greatest hits package. Yet there are plenty of obscure gems such as 'Odorono,' a hilarious song/jingle about the merits of deodorant, the majestic 'Our Love Was,' and the coming of age tale, 'Tattoo.' The commercial format also seems to tailor-made for the morbid wit of John Entwhistle, who can barely contain his enthusiasm on such oddities as 'Medac,' 'Charles Atlas' and 'Silas Stingy.' If ever a song about spiders, crazy wives or money-pinching misers need be written, look no further than Entwhistle.<br />It's evident that Tommy was beginning to enter Townsend's conscience. The mini-opera 'Rael' contains pieces of what would later become 'Sparks,' while 'Sunrise' contains subtle hints of 'Pinball Wizard.' He was beginning to see a larger picture. The highlight of the album comes during the climax of 'Relax,' where Townsend defiantly declares that &quot;everything in the world is yours and mine.&quot; For him and his band, on the cusp of a half-decade of peerless creativity, such a declaration must have seemed prophetic indeed.
B000002HMH|4.0|this is fast,heavy,angry,emotional and metallica.this is better than reload,not better than ...and justice for all or ride the lightning, but still really good.
B000002H6C|5.0|this is a great album,an album that really made metallica the biggest band ever.this was the first album they did that had a music video,a creepy,disturbing,scary one none the less.in my opinion this is the best album because im a grindcore/death metal freak, so you can see in my profile,so i love anger, angression, speed, and heaviness in the music i listen to.that is why this is my favorite metallica album.this is really a change in metallica's songwriting, agression, emotion, and the way the all around music sounds in general.a good way to discribe this could be if you put alice in chains, earlier metallica, judas priest, and the misfits in a blender you would get this album.but you cant really desribe this album in words,just sounds,that is kind of how this became my favorite metallica album.i dont think there was any metallica album before or after that could relate to this.so buy this album if you like aggression, heaviness, speed, and creepy, wierd anger.
B000000W5F|5.0|The Stones dig into the vaults going back to the Goat's Head Soup sessions. They pull out songs like Worried About You, Tops and Waiting On A Friend which were recorded with Mick Taylor on guitar. Start Me Up was a huge hit. I find it to be a good enough track and it works great as an album opener but it's still no Brown Sugar or Jumpin Jack Flash. Hang Fire has an excellent melody and Black Limousine features Ron Wood's all time best guitar solo. Only weak track is the bizarre Heaven.
6305910103|3.0|This movie has a great reputation, and I can understand that.  The conflict between Khan and Kirk is probably the most compelling one the movie series has had to offer, with the possible exception of Kirk against the Klingon conspiracy in Star Trek VI.  The character relationships between Spock, Kirk and McCoy are drawn exceptionally well, and Kirstie Alley's Saavik made a nice addition to the crew.<br />So what's the problem?  The movie rests on a series of coincidences and plot contrivances that are ultimately too frustrating to overlook, most of them centering around the first battle between the Enterprise and Khan aboard the Reliant.  Khan is able to inflict massive damage to Kirk's ship, and kill many crew members, because Kirk didn't follow regulations and had his shields down -- even AFTER another officer reminded him of the regulations.  That kind of sloppy thinking should lead to an investigation and a court martial, at the least.  Then, to get out of the predicament that Kirk's arrogance/ignorance has gotten them into, they use a code that lets them take over the enemy ship -- and after they fire a few shots, they let the ship get away, repair itself, and resume the battle.  It's a deus ex machina in the middle of the movie, for crying out loud, and then it gets ignored.<br />I'm not saying this is a terrible movie.  If you like fun SF, you'll probably enjoy it.  But it is an extremely flawed movie, and I find it hard to justify calling it the best of the series, as many have done.  The Voyage Home and The Undiscovered Country are, in my opinion, much better films.
B000002B35|4.0|First off, to the [one] who wrote that this contains an important message for mankind, the only advice I can offer you is think before you speak (or this case type). <br />Anyway, the playing is good. David Gilmour's voice is somewhat weak compared to Roger Waters, however. The complete verison of Dark Side Of The Moon is interesting but the album was built entirely in the studio and thus the verison here does not stack up. Other than that, this is a very good recording, and the best live Pink Floyd album out there. Gilmour's guitar solo on Comfortably Numb completely blows away the studio verison. Also very good verisons of Wish You Were Here, Shine On You Crazy Diamond and the Syd Barrett throw back Astronomy Domine.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is such a well-done movie I don't know where to start.  The story is so carefully laid out that every turn first surprises you, then has you saying, &quot;Of course!&quot;  The themes of hope, redemption and freedom are so well-explored that I still can't watch the nding without getting choked up.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are absolutely superb, nowhere more than in the scene where Robbins as Andy Dufresne delivers the line that I really ought to get emblazoned somewhere where I'll see it every day -- &quot;It comes down to a simple choice; you can get busy living, or get busy dying.&quot; <br />The cinematography and editing of this film are absolutely terrific, as is the score, the production design, the lighting, and so on.  It's as beautiful as film to watch as it is a beautiful story to experience.  So I'm disappointed there aren't more extras on the DVD, because I would have liked to learn a bit more about the process of putting it all together.  Maybe Darabont figured he had said all he needed to say in the book version of the screenplay, which I highly recommend.  But the movie itself is so worth seeing I guess the omission of extras is forgivable.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Melted disc, damaged speakers and a hearing problem as a consequence of unstoppable listening. They built their own musical stile, without any influences, truly original. Their music is contagions because of its power and energy which is squeezing through the songs. Nice combination of melody and great Cedric's vocal. They have also literally good lyrics, that are spreading a great feeling. Many people like to mention their similarity with Rage Against the Machine, but I disagree, the only similar thing is the vocal. Time has come for some serious changes in music, and just like Nirvana in 90s, At the Drive-In will make the revoultion nowdays. Buy this CD and step in the new music era !
B00004YA66|5.0|I remember one review that described Frequency as intended for people who thought Field of Dreams was good, but really could have used a serial killer.  It's a flip comment, but it actually gets to the core of the movie pretty well.  There's the exploration of the father-and-son relationship between Frank and John Sullivan across the decades (and the fact that Quaid and Caviezel can put that relationship across without appearing together on screen is quite the accomplishment), and there's the cop-suspense story about the hunt for a serial killer preying on women.  The stories are handled with care, and for the most part the script does a good job of establishing the rules of its fantastic premise and sticking with them.  (There are a few slipups, as the screenwriter notes on one of the two commentary tracks.)  Stories that involve altering the timestream almost always end up sinking under the weight of paradoxes, and Frequency does to an extent, but for the most part the film holds up.  And because it has that emotional core to fall back on, one or two imperfections in the plot can't detract from it.<br />I'd give the movie itself 4 stars; the fifth comes from all the extras that New Line packs onto this disc, including two commentaries, a copy of the shooting script, and various storyboards and other effects info.  This one is worth spending some time with.
0375703241|4.0|I think this book was pretty entertaining in general. There were a few flaws in the book, but the action was what brought the rating up. One major flaw that really annoyed me was that the \\"good guys\\" would never make mistakes while the \\"bad guys\\" made their mistakes at the most crucial moments. As with almost all of Tom Clancy's novels, the Americans were the good guys. The good guys had to be completely \\"good\\" while the bad guys were really greedy and rather stupid. The action sequences that took place were the good parts of the story. It really is a page-tuner despite the flaw that the good guys were totally perfect while the bad guys made many crucial mistakes. I also think that the suspense in the book was pretty good. In my opinion, the theme of this novel is that not everything is as it seems. The reason to that is because of the conspiracy that goes on in the story.<br />I would recommend this book to people who like to read some exciting action sequences and can live with the unrealistic character stereotype.
0790734850|5.0|This is just an amazing piece of filmmaking.  It starts with the writing.  The plot is gripping and surprising, and just when it feels like things might be winding down, the story really shifts into gear.  The dialogue is sharp, each character has a distinct voice, and the actors do a great job expressing those voices.  Russell Crowe's intensity is great, and Kevin Spacey does an outstanding job of developing his character.  Everyone working on this movie was firing on cylinders, from the score to the cinematography to everything in between.  Heck, I'd be willing to bet the catering was top notch, but that's not really important.  What is important is that you really should see this movie.
B000002KXV|5.0|\\"The Nightfly\\" is a great concept album.  Too bad Fagen didn't release any more solo albums until the early '90s.  The whole album is great from start to finish, but the top 5 are \\"I.G.Y.\\", \\"Green Flower Street\\", \\"New Frontier\\", \\"The Nightfly\\", and \\"The Goodbye Look\\".  Although the overall sound veers from the stuff Fagen's done with Steely Dan, this album is very catchy and replayable.  I particularly like the title track \\"The Nightfly\\" because it has a jazzy feel to it, and \\"The Goodbye Look\\" for it's island-esque instrumentals.  I don't know if it's just me, but the lyrics came across as humorous to me- \\"Lou Chang, her brother, is burning with rage\\" and \\"The colonel standing in the sun... with his stupid face, the glasses, and the gun.\\"  Anyway, I think it surpasses anything Steely Dan has ever done, and we're talking about a solo effort here.  Pretty good for something that came out 20 years ago (the same year that I was born).
B000009QPE|5.0|It took me a while to get to &quot;Reign in Blood,&quot; but after getting a copy it was well worth it.  None of the songs have a weak link in them.  All of them are terriffic pieces of speed metal the way it is meant to be.  It's very refreshing to hear this 15 year old classic, when every metal outfit today has slowed down the tempo quite a bit.  Today its more cool to play &quot;herky-jerky&quot; riffs rather than a continous rage of energetic riffs like in all of the songs on Reign in Blood.  You often forget what technical precision is in metal is if you turn on popular culture's version of metal on the radio.  These songs on &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; from Slayer hopefully will never be heard on the radio since they are far from kitsch.  All tracks are my favorites, but I find myself playing &quot;Angel of Death,&quot; &quot;Jesus Saves,&quot; and &quot;Raining Blood&quot; the most.  Like I said, if you don't have this you are ignorant of a landmark album in metal!!
B00000269M|5.0|Although this came out when I was very young, I'm still old enough to remember singing along with every song that was released from this album. I think I remember trying to emulate his dance moves in some high-water leather pants I used to sport at home. I don't think there is one kid who grew up in the 80's that didn't try to be like Michael. Even though his rep is pretty tainted, and he looks totally different from when he released \\"Thriller\\", I have to give the man his props. Michael Jackson is a musical virtuoso who has no peers. In addition to writing most of his own work, he can also change up his voice in several ways. I have \\"Bad\\" on cassette, which was a bad idea because it doesn't include \\"Leave Me Alone\\", but I still like the entire album from start to end. This album is the starting point of a \\"less tame\\" Michael (which progresses in \\"Dangerous\\").  Although it's not his best album, it doesn't pale in comparison to the his other outings.  \\"Bad\\" actually has only one song I haven't heard on the radio- \\"Just Friends\\".  My top 5 (in no particular order) would have to be \\"Speed Demon\\", \\"Another Part of Me\\", \\"Dirty Diana\\", \\"Smooth Criminal\\", and \\"Leave Me Alone.\\" I wanted to include \\"Liberian Girl\\", but that would make my list top 6.  I have to say that even if they're not a fan, no self-respecting music critic can deny that they ever liked one MJ song.  That would be a boldface lie.
B000056K04|4.0|Upon first listening to &quot;Everyday&quot;, I found my self thinking, &quot;Hmm, this is different and doesn't capture the Dave sound I have grown to love.&quot;  Only after listening to the album several more times did I start to realize that there are some great songs on this record.  The fiddle-sax jam sound of Trippin Billies or Ants Marching is replaced with a more electric, studio sound.  Although it is different from the bands earlier albums, the disc still rocks.  Tracks such as The Space Between, So Right, If I Had it All, Angel, and Mother Father featuring Carlos Santana highlight the album.  Tracks such as The Dreams of Our Fathers, If I Had it All, and Sleep To Dream Her still posess a sound reminiscent of other albums.  All in all, &quot;Everyday&quot; is a step in a new direction for Dave, but yet still a reminder of the Dave Matthews band we have all grown to love.
B00000JCEC|5.0|Every fan of The Beatles and Ringo Starr should own this compact disc. This is the second best release of Ringo's solo career, with his &quot;Vertcal Man&quot; CD being his best. Musically and lyrically, this album is superb. And, of course, it is pure Ringo - which is pure fun! Also, very Beatlesque from time to time. You should own this CD, as well as Ringo's: Vertical Man, Goodnight Vienna, Ringo, I Wanna Be Santa Claus, VH1 Storytellers, Ringo the 4th, Stop &amp; Smell the Roses and the 3-CD set of Ringo &amp; His All-Starr Band Anthology. If you can find it, I would also suggest purchasing the CD single of &quot;Weight Of The World&quot; from his Time Takes Time CD as it contains an unreleased bonus track: Ringo's rocking rendition of &quot;Don't Be Cruel,&quot; produced by Jeff Lynne. Search Amazon.com auctions and z-shops for that one! If you purchase only a couple of Rigno CD's and you liked his &quot;Vertical Man&quot; CD, then do yourself a favor and purchase &quot;Time Takes Time.&quot;
0780622650|5.0|I am not a huge sci-fi fan but i loved this movie. I never saw the movie in theatres and i wished i had. I saw it on TNT the other night and did not get to see the whole thing. I enjoyed it so much I went out and bought it the next day. I recommend this movie to anybody. The actors and actresses did a great job of making the character interesting and the movie enjoyable.
B000056K04|4.0|When BTCS came out it was a completely different sound from the previous two albums. But it was GREAT. Now, with EVERYDAY, he changed again. I miss the violin, magical, Trancy sound of BTCS. There's no CRUSH on this album. But there is good music. The best songs are WHEN THE WORLD ENDS, THE SPACE BETWEEN, FOOL TO THINK, SLEEP TO DREAM HER, and EVERYDAY. I'd buy it just for these, but every song is pretty solid, just not what we're used to. One thing I don't get, however, is the constant lyric change. One second he sings about love and peace and the next he's being perverted. Well, thats not new, just Dave, I guess!
B000000OPU|4.0|The album was more than satisfactory in the ranges of elements taking the listener.   Originally purchased for the hits, Red Rain and BigTime, I find that these songs pale in comparison to some others the album features.   Peter Gabriel has never mainstreamed in the entertainment industry and the unique creativity applied to the journey he takes us on in So --- almost religious at points --- is a fine example why.   If you are not able to handle or don't wish to listen to dramatic, mood swings from song to song --- don't buy the CD.   If you want to hear sounds from the battleground to utopia then buy this CD.
0671688782|4.0|Holding time has worked miracles for my son's attachment problems. We are so thankful someone recommended this book in time for us to catch what could have turned into serious Attachment Disorder. Working moms and dads who aren't as in tune with their children's feelings, or at-home parents who emotionally detach themselves because of whatever reason--depression, apathy, ambiguity, etc. can regain control over their child/parent relationships after applying this method.  It is the best way I have ever found to get our son's anger out. He is now a calmer, happier child that doesn't resort to tantrums to &quot;communicate&quot;.  Those reviewers who criticise this book's theories about Autism research and scientific methods have either not read the entire book or applied the method incorrectly. Even in the book it says to use Holding Time for anger and attachment problems and when NEEDED.  However, I only gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons: - I think the weight she puts on the mother's shoulders is a little dramatic and guilt-ridden.  - I also thought the author's claim that the technique was just for mother was nonsense, as does our therapist. We do regular holding time sessions with our therapist where my husband is included and I think that helps immensely. A final note: remember, this is a technique that provides a safe environment for a child to express anger and leads to deep communication between parent and child.
B000000OPU|4.0|Gabriel has clearly created a remarkable journey for thos listening to SO.   The dramatic mood swings from song to song may take a bit getting use to but is clearly well worth the investment of time.   I am a binge CD listener and have kept Gadriels' SO in the player in excess of two week.   If you want to listen to ranging from the battleground to utopia then buy this CD, it will quickly become your favorite.
630588255X|5.0|This bizarre film is actually quite funny.  I was first introduced to this film in 1984 and still watch it from time to time.  Without giving anything away, Harold drives his rich family crazy with a number of hysterical suicide attempts - only to miraculously appear seconds later as though nothing happened.<br />Although not a mainstream comedy, this movie is tremendously funny and is a &quot;must have&quot; for your home collection.

B00004VW0W|5.0|I am not a huge Cat Stevens fan. However, this is one of my favorite albums of all-time by any artist. As a matter of fact, it would probably be in my top ten. It has everything! Cat Stevens at his best!!! If you own only one Cat album (other than &quot;hits&quot; or &quot;best of&quot; collections), this is the one to get. I never tire of listening to this pop/rock masterpiece. I hear different things each time I listen to it and that has been for well over 20 years now. This is one of the first CDs I ever purchased. It is not only one of the best albums of the 70s, but one of the best of the entire rock/pop era. You must own this one! Musically superior to anything else he ever did and certainly to anything out these days. Lyrically haunting and thought-provoking. Musical poetry! He paints pictures with words on this one! Brilliant!!!!!
B000056K04|5.0|I and a big dave mathews band fan and have been for a while now and i enjoy listening to there music. When i first heard this C.D iheard from friends That it was the first time that Dave used electrical instruments in his music.I was a little suprised after being a fan of the accoustic and the violin and sax.  I like the new sound also too it helps to get something new out.i also still like the classic accoustic style and i liked the c.d a whole lot and i think that the only thing that was missing from this c.d was that they didn't have as much of the sax and violin as dave fans are used too. All around it was a good c.d and the Dave fans will like it, You just have to get used to the new style and u will like it like the Newer sound from the same old great group
B000056K04|1.0|As an avid Dave Matthews Band fan, I was thoroughly disappointed with their most recent release, &quot;Everyday.&quot;  This album falls below the par that the past albums had set.  Anyone who is looking for a Dave Matthews Band should not buy this album, it may have the name of the band on the cover, but there is something else inside.  With the addition of electric guitar and the removal of long melodious jams, this album is more Dave Matthews with backup instrumentals than the actual Dave Matthews Band.  The only song that sounds like a Dave Matthews Band song is &quot;Everyday&quot; this is because it sounds exactly like one of their past songs, &quot;#36.&quot;  Anyone interested in this band should do themselves a favor and buy one of their early albums, like &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;  or &quot;Live at Red Rocks.&quot;
B000003N7Y|5.0|The first time I spun this record it turned my brain into jelly.  About a year afterwards, I had Mingus tattooed on my left arm.  Nowadays, the album still packs a punch, from the regal and elemental swing of &quot;II B.S.&quot; to the warm heart and doleful melody of &quot;Goodbye Porkpie Hat...&quot;  not to mention the most joyous tempo break ever in &quot;Better Get It in Yo' Soul.&quot;  While not everybody may be quite so fond of this particular Mingus disc on account of its more readily accessible nature, I feel this very quality is at the center of its greatness.  It's raucous at times, soulful at others, and throughout the recording it maintains all of its candor.  Whether you're a well-established Mingus lover or a greenhorn bass afficianado, this record will suit your needs and whet your thirst.  My brother was in Spain for a conference last year, and over a dinner table piled with barnacles and other potent sea edibles, he was asked what record to buy if one wants to love jazz yet can't seem to pull it off.  He looked in the direction of one of his colleagues, and they both replied, &quot;Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus.&quot;     'Nuff said.
B000002J6H|5.0|I first heard this album when I was a child. An Uncle of mine had made a reel to reel album of Albums for my Parents that included both Santana Albums, Sly &amp; Family Stone Greatest Hits Record, and Neil Young's Everbody Knows this is Nowhere, but it was Stephen Stills Album that made a huge impression on my young mind. From his Guitar playing to his beautiful Lyrics I had never heard anything sound so mesmorizing. Favorite Songs include Do For Others, Black Queen, and Love the one your with. My favorite Track is To a Flame. Little known Fact: The drummer on To a Flame is Ringo Starr. I highly recommend  the other Albums I mentioned.
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you loved the music while watching the movie, this is like listening to the movie all over again.  I really love this CD.  I have started exploring this music and I am not won over, it is difinitly this compilation that keeps my interest.  I would recommend this to anyone who had a song or two that they couldn't stop humming after the movie.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is the best voice i ever heard, she is so peacefull. The first time i hear one song of Dido was Here whit me and i like it. I recomendate this cd' to all the people how like a beutifull voice like Dido
B00000FZ1V|5.0|For most DVD films today, you need to purchase a recent release to watch a film that takes advantage of the many options available through DVD. (ie older films that contain the movie, trailer and sound/viewing options only)<br />Ghostbusters has done a remarkable job in creating a comprehensive DVD that beats out most modern movies released on DVD.  Trailers (for this and other films), FX commentary, director commentary, storyboards, the making of FX, trivia, etc...<br />For all 3 people in this country that haven't seen Ghostbusters :D, it's a unique combination of comedy and horror that doesn't disappoint.  Some of the best comedians from the 70's to today and a laugh fest that doesn't stop.<br />If only other classics did such a great job in turning a memorable film into a thorough DVD masterpiece...
6302150930|5.0|In what is obviously a total labor of love, Roman Polanski has taken Hardy's complex novel and has made a compelling narrative in just 3 hours running time. Complex as it is, it is leisurely paced, though never boring. Nastassia Kinski made her lead-role debut here, and laces her multi-layered character with simultaneous moments of strength and vulnerability. Polanski's attention to detail was rewarded with Oscars for sets, costumes and cinematography. This film is a feast for film fans who appreciate quality, substance and visual excellence. YOU MUST CHECK IT OUT!
B0000509BZ|5.0|As far as I can tell, the only difference between this and the 10th Anniversary Edition is that this one has a different cover. As for the film itself, I find it very enjoyable, especially when it is the Director's Cut version, as it has great additional footage. Now, I know the ending of the film is a bit weird, and the training with Ramirez (Sean Connery) is really weird, but I still gave the film 5 stars because it has a huge fun factor. This movie contains some top notch acting (sure, it's no &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot;, but at least you won't fall asleep watching it), great fight scenes, great characters, and memorable locations. Many critics complain about the camera angles and cut scenes, but those add to the experience. Frankly, I wonder if these people prefer the static camera angles of soap operas.<br />Anyway, this is the best and only Highlander film worth watching, and it rates better than the TV show. This movie also, in a sense, offers a counter balance to the romantic mythism surrounding vampire-goth films....living forever is not all wine socials and classical piano by the fire. It's really, really lonely.<br />As for the content-story-plot, basically our hero Connor MacLeod is an immortal, who has been living on earth since the 1500's. The time of the Gathering has arrived, where immortal must fight immortal until one remains, becoming god-like in power (a.k.a. gaining the prize). Immortals can only die by having their heads cut off, which means there are sword fights and decapitations for the whole family. It really is a fun movie, and the price is right.<br />Just one last note: it's best to not compare this film to the three &quot;sequels&quot; or the series, as they only vaguely tie together.
0385484518|1.0|A sappy, sentimental potboiler, Tuesdays with Morrie is a farce if you've ever had encountered or worked with Mitch Albom. It's clear that he's a talented writer -- just ask him, he'll tell you!  Maybe Mitch learned some lessons sitting with Morrie -- I'm amazed that Morrie was able to tell Mitch anything -- but it's clear that Albom doesn't apply those same lessons to his own life. Perhaps that's why Tuesdays with Morrie didn't resonate with me, I resent people who talk the talk, but don't walk the walk.
B00000I8UF|5.0|What a wonderful record! Coming home after a long day at school and listening to Lee Morgan's and Benny Golson's stylistic/creative solos just makes me smile. The songs are fairly simple(I just started transcribing them)but very hip nonetheless. This cd is an excellent buy. Score another win for Blakey!
0793518326|3.0|The music covered in this book is wonderful, of course, but if you have a good ear you'll find many instances where you won't believe what you see on the page.  A fairly simple example is &quot;No Reply.&quot;  The song is in a minor key, and if you have a trained ear, you know the chords are minor chords - - but the music is written here with all major chords.  In addition, on the recording you'll hear sevenths which the sheet music doesn't mention.<br />The format could also be easier - - the songs are ordered alphabetically, but if you don't use the table of contents to find a song it will be difficult:  the top margins don't have any key words to indicate the songs on the page.<br />But if you have a good ear, and are adequately suspicious of what you see on the page, the book will be a time saver.  And for that, it's worth the money.
0140177396|4.0|I picked up Of Mice and Men because it was short and I figured that I could read a good book in a small amount of time.  The book turned out to be as expected if not better.  I think that it is possible to get as much if not more sometimes out of a short book like this one.  The book kept me involved in the plot all the way till the end.  The ending made the book very good, but you will have to read it for yourself to get that satisfaction!
0375703764|1.0|I like all kinds of books. But this is the most sick and twisted &quot;book?&quot; I have ever (tried) to read. What a waste of money! After trying to wade through this mess I finally decided that I don't care what happens to these people. They can stay in there huge dark pit and no one would ever miss them, or care. The headaches I got trying to figure out this massive mistake for a novel just wasn't worth it. What's with all the swirls and backward paragraphs and even two seperate stories on one page? I tried to like this. I really did. I kept telling myself, &quot; It will all come together, it will all be worth it with a fantastic story, these people will really begin to matter to me...&quot;. NOT SO!!! Life is too short to waste precious minutes with novels like this when there are so many wonderful books that trap you, change you, make you think and feel. NOT THIS ONE. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
0792844793|3.0|The Movie is as good as ever.  The video quality of this DVD edition, however, is horrible.  Pasty resolution and washed-out colors make it look as though it was transferred directly from VHS.  Serious DVD collectors will want to pass on this one until a better print becomes available.
B000003S16|5.0|I heard this album the week it was released.  I was at a friend's house and the &quot;phone on the album&quot; started to ring.  My friend's brother was in the room and kept trying to answer it.  Needless to say....he didn't get it.  The album focuses on a wide variety of emotions and intellectual ideas (Eno as fetus).  &quot;Burn Me Up I'm A Cigarette&quot; has got to be one of the best songs ever written by Fripp.  A man on the rebound, in love and art?  What a hellava bounce!!  I've since snapped up a tape and a CD version of this work.  The epitome of &quot;alternative.&quot;
6301969294|2.0|Whatever you thought of the book - and I loved it - this film adaptation is a failure. The casting, the screenplay (in which Rand herself had a hand) fail to do the book justice. For the definitive film adaptation of Ayn Rand, I highly recommend the Italian-made &quot;We The Living&quot;.
0679879269|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I have never seen emotions displayed in a book so powerfully as in the Amber Spyglass.  Pullman pulls you into the story even more effectively than his first two books.  I was crying at the end.  Whoever can only see the twists on Heaven and God are obviously not looking far enough into the emotions of this book.  I believe in God, but fantasy that provides new views is a welcome addition to my library.  <br />The love in this book overwhelms all the other points.  Two angels that are Will's brief companions have such a passionate love for each other that they can communicate over long distances.  Lyra ventures into the world of the dead-and betrays the one she loves most-to apologize to Roger.  Even Mrs. Coulter's icy heart is melted by a new love for her daughter.  In the powerful ending, Lyra learns to put others before herself-no matter how terrible the price is.
B000001EC1|4.0|This is a good album from Bon Jovi - it doesn't have everything, but it does have a lot of their greatest songs. Livin' On A Prayer, Always, Wanted Dead Or Alive, Blaze Of Glory (Jon's solo work), Runaway and more are in here.<br />Under represented are their debut album and their second release, 7800 degrees Farenheit, with only one track each. They could have left out Keep The Faith, Prayer '94 (a slow version of Livin' On A Prayer) and put in some good ole Bon Jovi tracks like Only Lonely or She Don't Know Me. Suggestion: Buy this release and pick up the first two albums from Bon Jovi - this is the majority of their best work.
B000002L7Y|5.0|If you want to know how to write a good pop song listen to this cd. At the time it was very fresh and featured some really cool syntheszier sounds and electronic beats. And now, 16 years later, it only sounds that much better than many of todays pop acts who cant even play an instrument. Aha proved that synth pop could be beautiful and deep and meaningfull to a whole generation of electronic music fans who craved quality. DEFINITELY one of the best pop records of the 80's, and one of the best synth/pop records ever. They influenced many musicians, including me to no end.
B00004YZFR|3.0|Criterion had the right idea in cleaning up the audio, but the end result is a better *environmental* mix - there is a lot more crowd noise and a  lot less bass and drums in the mix - I don't want to knock it too much, because it's a great DVD - but I was surprised watching the expose about how they 'improved' the audio, when the end result, while probably 'correct', lacks much of the warmth and vocal presence of the previous version -
B000002OX7|5.0|The album \\"Who's next\\" has been made from the Pete townshend's dream project \\"Lifehouse\\" project. \\"Lifehouse\\" project would have been unique in its idea and concept, but according to Pete Townshend himself 'it was like the Brabazon aeroplane of the 50's: magnificent in concept and appearance but too big to get off the ground. Musically it is almost flawless. Here are the some of the songs those will fetch a 5/5.    Baba O'riley: Magical Intro ... and drumming? Toooo good. It's an everything's great song.    Love ain't for keeping: Acoustic sound. A touch of sorrow in Daltrey's voice... Lay down beside me ... Love ain't for keeping.    The song is over: Sadness in the air. A break up song ... Wonderful teamwork. You will certainly feel sad when the song is over.     Behind blue eyes: Another slow, downbeat song. This song is in the album twice. Different version though.    Won't get fool again: Superb intro again. Nice sweet rock n' roll track. Pete ... picks his guitar and plays ... Just like yesterday. Simply classic.    Pure and easy: Best of this CD. So smooth a song, it just flows like water ... the song name itself describes it all. Superb guitar work.    Baby don't you do it: Straight forword rock.    Too much of anything: A mellow, melodic song. One of the best in the CD.     Overall it is \\"an way too good CD\\", actually One of the most appreciated CDs of all time. What I want to say is \\"Don't call yourself a rock lover if you don't have this (or haven't listen this)\\".
B000056K04|5.0|alright, so everyday isn't the best dmb album, by far.  under the table and dreaming and crash are both superior to everyday... but why do i still give it 5 stars??  cause it must take a lot of guts for a jam band like dmb to take a chance and release an album like this.  think about it... dmb never does an album the same way twice.  this was their venture into fairly radio-friendly pop, and they pulled it off quite well.  if so right, angel &amp; everyday don't keep you groovin, then I don't know what will.  I DO hope, however, that they DON'T work with glen ballard on their next album.  for their next cd, i hope dmb does some crazy, jazzy music but for now this is just fine.  open your minds, people... dmb can't stay on the same path forever... they needed something new, something fresh, something energized, and everyday is just it.
1572522232|3.0|Well, I finally got up the nerve to watch &quot;Suspiria&quot; and I was a little underwhelmed.  I thought that it had a great sense of menace and I thought the music was effective.  Perhaps I might have enjoyed it more had I watched it alone (my friend hated it) but I'm not sure.  I have to admit that I did find the extreme use of red color a little too much and I did find the music, although effective, to be too loud and redundant.  Maybe that was the point, but I think the overuse of the music made it lose its impact.  I thought the opening murder was very scary, but I don't think that the gore had anything to do with that.  I found the extreme gore distracting rather than scary.  The ending with the directress was very effective (I loved the freaky girl with the knife, that was scary) but when it was over I wasn't scared to turn out the light and go to bed.  I'll see it again sometime, but it wasn't the heartstopping masterpiece I was expecting.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver was very interesting. It was like taking me to a whole new world. Most everything was different. I didn't like some of the people in the book's views. Although at the same time, I wanted to know how those people thought, worked, and felt. I wanted to know why did what happen, happen. There was only one man who seemed to care at all about anything. I thought the little one was cute as well. I felt sad when I found out what the father's job was. Another thing I didn't like was the ending. I wanted to know more!
0780626478|5.0|This movie is the best romantic comedy ever made by far. The script is excellent and that is elevated by it's all star cast including Brenden Fraser, Alica Silverstone, all time veterens Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacak. For most of you Guys out there who think it's a &quot;Chick Flik&quot; it's NOT, let me give you an exsample I was with a group of friends one night, both guys &amp; girls, and we all watched it and it was a hit i don't one person who didn't like it which just go to show you this movie is truly a great flick.
0385335482|5.0|If you are looing for great literature, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a fun, read in one sitting and laugh out loud, then you have found it.  This book was one of those &quot;Ohmygod, this is totally about me&quot; books.  How many of us haven't gone to the shops on a particularly bad day--just to browse--and come out with bags of things we don't really need?&quot;  Becky is a fun, real, character, and her predicament is not all that different from that of many other 25 years olds.  (Trust me, I know).  I loved her fantasies about how to earn more money, and the end is very sweet.  Plus, it gave me some ideas on how to avoid paying my credit card bills--who would have thought to date the check 2200?  :)  A great fun book, perfect for a day at the beach or a long plane trip.
0553278223|5.0|Don't be fooled: this book is not about Mars.  Rather, it is a picture of America in the aftermath of the second World War, with all of its accompanying hopes, dreams, hypocricies and hysterias.  Read in this light, the stories are not merely entertaining diversions, but (often scathing) social commentary.
B000002WYT|5.0|&quot;Crash&quot; is in my opinion, the best DMB studio album, even edging out the new album &quot;everyday&quot; slightly.  Every song on here is good, there is not one reason to press any button except play for this disc.  My personal favorites are &quot;Two Step&quot;(which I find humming as I am doing work), &quot;Drive In, Drive Out&quot;, and &quot;41.&quot;  Get this before any other album on your list, it is magical.
6305622957|5.0|What a bonus.  I was able to get this film as part of a World War II DVD package. <br />Released in 1970, the film remains comparable to more recent World War II epics.  <br />The producers succeed in dramatizing the historical events leading to the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, an event that remains a day of infamy and controversy into the 21st century.<br />While the Japanese sequences are especially well-done, except for Japanese pilots who may be seem as stereotypes from a John Wayne movie of the 1940's. <br />The blundering Americans depicted in the film make me a bit uncomfortable. It's difficult to believe so many people made so many mistakes, considering the political developments in the Far East and Europe during the 1930's.<br />It's a shame that producers didn't make a companion documentary, &quot;The Making of Tora...&quot;  It would be very educational to see how the explosions, etc. were shot.<br />&quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot; is another good film for World War II buffs, and a good teaching tool for junior/senior high school students -- especially for recuctant learners.<br />Spectacular on widescreen format.  Great sound.
6304493681|5.0|This anime film it's the second best of all time, it's very interesting, has great animation, a great story and character development, the storyline is great, also it was very exciting and suspenful, but here is my word for parents, this film contains nudity, specially at the begiing and near to the end, also it has 5 bloody and gory scenes, the violence just limits to shootings, explosions, fihgts kind of martial arts, so please i strongly recommend you to stay with you children when you see this movie. Also the DVD is great, the Dolby Digital 5.1, sounds like DTS!, the picture quality, it's very very good, but in comparsion to a little preview that is on the Manga Video promo comercial, this movie is a must see but probably not a must own
6305127638|3.0|Everyone should have this DVD in their collection whether they're a Trek fan or not.   The Dolby Digital 5.1 Soundtrack is an experience everyone should share.   Hooked up to a decent home theater system, the Federation's battle with the borg cube in the beginning of the movie is astounding.   Lasers and photon torpedoes resonate from left to right and right to left.  Ship explosions, exploding base, are distinct and accurately placed.   For Trekkers this is a dream come true.   This is the battle at Wolf 359 that we never saw or heard to our liking.  The rest of the movie is pretty good too.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Sadness, happiness, jovial, tired and sleepy are the feelings and moods i feel before i press the play button of this cd. Suddenly my drums snaring and i am alseep, sybolising entering a new world, all the moods i have in my mind, body and soul are rushed down the flowing rush of solemn tunes of the siamese dream album, then in the end you wake up, from the euphoric nature of the album, you feel bliss. you love, you care, you understand. You understand why things are bad and good around you and in the end, every humble track has passed by, the only words and expression on your face is happiness and relaxed. Its a cd of medtation from alternative rock from the gods. I believe this is the cd which will be the only cd i will ever cherish and love. I will always love, the smashing pumpkins. You made my day, and my, life.
0780020685|5.0|This movie gets better every time I see it.   The first time I saw it I thought the fight scenes were slapstick and hilarious, not until I bought this DVD did I realize that Kurosawa was going for realism rather than typical Hollywood sensationalism.   The commentary on this DVD is excellent and supplies a plethora of info on Kurosawa's life and career as well as on the impact this movie made for Japanese cinema.   The picture quality is excellent, but not in the widescreen format as shown on AMC.   The sound is as good as possible I suppose, considering the age of the movie, but I find listening to the commentary much more enjoyable.   The subtitles are easily readable, an improvement over AMC's presentation.
0679720200|5.0|Find a couple hours in your busy life to read this book--yes, everyone.  In this very existential story, the Stranger, Camus shines a bright floodlight into the soul of modern man.  Told in the first person by the Stranger awaiting death by the State's guillotine, it is obvious by the very telling of the story that the man was never so put to death.  It is also obvious that the Stranger was totally indifferent to whether he was or was not put to death.<br />The death of the Stranger's mother sounds the breakfast bell for his own demise.  Later at the beach murder scene the Stranger undergoes a Paul-on-the-Road-to-Damascus-like enlightenment.  The Stranger describes this event very poetically.  He sees a shaft of light shoot upward from the steel blade of the Arab's knife.  He sees \\"Cymbals of the sun clashing on my skull and ... the keen blade of light flashing up from the knife, scarring my eyelashes and gouging into my eyeballs.\\"  Next, \\"the sky cracked in two, from end to end, and a great sheet of flame poured down through the rift.\\" Had the reader seen what the Stranger saw he too may have emptied the pistol bullets into the poor Arab.  \\"And each successive shot was another loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing.\\"  Beginning with the  murder he was \\"through with the unreal years of my life.\\" <br />The Priest visits the cell and forces his trite message upon the prisoner. The Father asks, \\"how do you picture life after death?\\" The Stranger wants very little.  He answers, \\"A life in which I can remember this life on earth.  That's all I want of it.\\" The prisoner's certainty of death was totally sufficient, it was  something he could get his teeth into and that was far better than a brittle, fragile belief in God.  The torture of waiting for his own death emptied him of hope, thus allowing him to lay \\"his heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.\\" Thus sharing, so brotherly, his fate with the universe made him realize that \\"I'd been happy, and that I was happy still.\\"  In death the prisoner would attain public recognition of his indifferent life.  \\"All that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.\\"
0684853523|4.0|If you love Stephen King, do not write, and therefore think that this book would not fit into your collection, you are mistaken.  If you are a struggling writer, but Stephen King has never been high on your list of respectable authors, and therefore this book was banned from your acceptable purchase list, you are mistaken.  This book serves the duality of providing autobiographical information for the Stephen King aficionado, and provides ample, relevant information regarding the art of writing.  Thoroughly engrossing, both for the King fans and wannabe writers, I highly recommend this book.
B00004Z459|4.0|I am not a big rap-metal fan but Linkin Park is quite bit different from the Papa-Roaches and the Hed P.E.'s going on out there.  First off, they use a lot more melody than these guys and their album is much more consistent.  There are only a couple of tracks I don't really like.  In my opinion,  this is rap-metal done right.  I like their use of electronics and the singer's voice coupled with the confident background rapping. My personal favorite on the album, would have to be &quot;Crawling&quot;. Also, &quot;Papercut&quot; is a perfect track to start the album off with.  It is INSTANTLY accessible and will get you in the right mood for the rest of the album.  I'm not saying that this album will go down as a classic or anything, but for what it's worth, these guys are really original in a time where everyone's ripping each other off.  I haven't seen them in concert yet so no clu here as to how they sound live.
B00001SIES|5.0|Muse are a group that are rapidly becoming one of the best groups around at the moment.  Their album is a masterpiece, its easy to get into but it contains that edge that many albums seem to be missing.  Showbiz contains the hit singles, Unintended, Sunburn, Muscle Museum and Plug In Baby show that this is an album that is worth having in your music collection
079284209X|5.0|I take exception to the reviewer who said this film is part of De Niro's downward slide.  This is a great action film, with the best car chase sequences since The French Connection, and solid performances by De Niro and Reno.  I especially enjoyed the repore between the two.  <br />To those who think De Niro is in a downward spin, I loved his performances in Analyze This and Meet the Parents.  It shows a side of him not seen since Midnight Run, my favorite De Niro flick.  To those who thinks he has sold out for the box office, comedy performances are never recognized as being as difficult and challenging(ie, Kevin Kline in In and Out), but I think shows his diversification as an actor(drama, action, comedy), he is superior at all.
B000051VWW|3.0|I love Sade's previous work.  The Live concert is a must have.  This CD really disappointed me. I have really tried to like it.  It is really depressing.  The CD seems to be one long song chopped up into smaller pieces.  I liked the bands endeavour during Sade's abscence (sweetback) and I hear a lot of the mellow sounds they captured in this production. However, there is no pulse or expected uplift anywhere in this CD. It leaves you low and never picks you up.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|Although not as good as Bruckheimer's &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; and &quot;Enemy Of The State&quot;, &quot;Gone in 60 seconds&quot; is a decent flick with eye-catching visuals and slick camerawork. Actors fit very well in their parts, including Nicolas Cage, Robert Duvall and Will Patton. Many people mentioned that Angelina Jolie's part is underdeveloped, but I'd say that for a female character in a &quot;car movie&quot; it's quite enough; she's not exactly Jessica Lange or Meryl Streep yet. The film also provides a few laughs a-la &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Overall, a decent movie, with nice 'DVD-reference quality' material - loud crashes, explosions, etc.
B000003S1A|5.0|I consider myself to be a fairly knowledgable and open-minded KC fan.  Ever since I got into their music some twenty years ago, I was always convinced that the best Crimson line up was the Fripp/Wetton/Bruford combo of Red and the Lark's Tongue era.  But after years of listening, I am now certain that the early '80's line-up of Fripp/Belew/Levin/Bruford was by far the better.  This album is a testament to that fact.  The music is simply amazing and its influence is staggering.  Primus fans should take notice to the similarities in structure between Levin's stick playing and Claypool's bass riffs.  There remains little question that this album is stellar on all fronts.  The musicianship is beyond words.  The addition of Adrian Belew to KC is the ingredient that threw this album over the top.  Not only is Belew an insane guitar player, he is also a great vocalist reminiscent of Byrne from the Talking Heads.  The tracks are KC classics that the band to this day still plays heavily in its live repertoire.  Songs like Elephant Talk, Frame by Frame, Thela Hut Ginjeet, Indiscipline remain indispensible classics.  Whether you are a serious musician or just a casual fan with good taste, there is no denying the genius of this album.  A must own.
0452282152|5.0|The best way to read this book is to first visit The Girl with Pearlearring website.  Print the paintings that are provided there.  These make a great referral as you read this terrific book!  The author does a wonderful job of transporting the reader to the setting of Vermeer's lifetime.  Although this is a work of fiction, I am convinced that the author must have been Griet, for she seems to know exactly how these paintings were created.  The book is unique, and a learning experience as well as great fun to read.  Ms. Chevalier, well done!
0451191153|1.0|Like most people, I read THE FOUNTAINHEAD in high school, right in the midst of feeling out of control and feeling like no one &quot;got&quot; what I was trying to do with anything. I found the struggle of Howard Roark fascinating, the characters intensely developed, and the massive, epic sweep of the novel astounding........Later on through......ouch, this book is flawed, on some kind of basic level. First off, the whole Objectivist philosophy is pretty abhorrent, unless you think that the planet would be better off if everyone was totally self serving. Howard Roark is a Fascist, refusing to see anything but what he wants to see. Which isn't a problem, except the book makes a hero out of him, wants us to realize that being just like Howard Roark is the highest standard one can acheive to be. But that's just philosophic differences. The book itself, is pretty pathetic. Everything in it, the plot, the characters, are just tinsel and paint that cover up Rand's manifesto. The characters are deeply developed, but come off feeling like one dimensional caricatures, their dialogue pathetic, their motives worthless. Howard Roark moves through the book like a walking Deux ex Machina, all at once omnipotent and always functioning with total flawlessness of actions. Still, I'm glad I read it, just to realize how far I wanted to set myself away from it.
0440224764|2.0|The Partner has an interesting plot, but fails to deliver on it.  A lawyer fakes his own death, steals 90 million from his partners and escapes to South America.  Patrick Lanigan is the lawyer and after four years, he is caught and brought back to Biloxi to face charges against him.  Before returning he is almost tortured to death and due to this he is allowed to stay in a hospital instead of jail.  While in the hospital he clues his lawyer and his judge friend in on the details of his escape. Everything falls into place too easily and of course Patrick gets away with everything.  No one would have as much luck as he had or be that smart to get away with it and it makes the story not very believable.  The ending does a fairly interesting twist, but the problem with it is that you see it coming about five chapters before it happens.
6302891272|5.0|I am a huge fan of Akira Kurosawa. I have watched as many of his movies as I could find. Seven Samurai was the first film I saw by him and I still think it is his best. It's hard to say, but Throne of Blood might be my second favorite. Their are a few other movies that challenge it, such as Yojimbo, but I think that it might be Throne of Blood. First of all, Throne of Blood is mostly based on Shakespeare's Macbeth. It turns out to be one of the best adaptations of Shakespeare's work to film. Kurosawa, however, did not just copy the story word for word. He hads some really brilliant concepts to the story and changes some of the scenes to fir the story seamlessly. Toshiro Mifune gives one of his best performances. Overall, Throne Of Blood is a very impressive movie that is both artistic and entertaining.
044022165X|5.0|After The Firm, John Grisham stumbled through low quality efforts The Pelican Brief, The Client &amp; The Chamber.  He got away from crisp writing and strong character studies of his first two books and threatened to lapse into hackdom.  On The Rainmaker, he gets back to those original traits.  Rudy Baylor is a young lawyer who looses his job with a promising firm and has no other prospects.  He worked at a bar where shady characters frequented and the owner who likes him hooks him up with a small law firm. It is a less than scrupulous firm, with an ambulance chasing attitude.  Rudy is schooled in the art of hanging around hospitals from Deck, a squirrelly little guy.  In the meantime he moves into an apartment over the garage of a lonely old widow, Miss Birdie.  He tends to her yard and starts working with her on her will.  He also gets a case for a young man whose dying and his health insurance company refuses to pay for his medical treatments.  While hanging around the hospital, he meets Kelly, who turns out to be a victim of spousal abuse.  He gets involved with her while working on his cases.  The case against the insurance company is a classic David vs. Goliath scenario.  Mr. Grisham expertly weaves all these plot lines together and keeps the pages turning with bright, vivid and entertaining writing.  The Rainmaker is the best book of his career.
B000056N8X|5.0|My one and only gripe is that the villan wasn't nearly as powerful as the theatrical trailers once purported him to be. That aside though, this is one movie that no Highlander should be without.  <br />The addition of 12 minutes of footage really made this movie a lot better than the theatrical release (which was admittedly a bit of a disapointment). The new ending in particular was a very welcome emotional pick me up compared to the theatrical &quot;I'm still depressed they killed (insert spoiler here).&quot;  <br />There have been criticisms of continuity problems between this movie, the series and the movie. Well, that just goes without saying since the first movie ended with the gathering. The series itself doesn't even hold to the movie continuity. If they're ever going to make another Highlander movie, of course they will necesserilly have to ignore the last ten or so minutes of the first movie. Take it in stride and enjoy it.<br />The extras included on this set are also worth a look at. A choice of three quizes can challenge even the most fanatical Highlander fan. A second full length cut is also cool. It's the same story, yet so diferant. It's always interesting seeing some of the decisions a producer goes through making a movie. There's many more special features than can be listed here. But between those and the movie itself, Highlander Endgame is definetaly worth the pickup.  <br />Don't forget to find those easter eggs!
0345423496|5.0|I was very impressed with 3001.  It was very different than most sci-fi type books.  I really enjoyed it because of the science accuracy and the realistic perspective Clarke created.  The ending in the book was amazing.  It totally made sense and brought the other 3 books in the series to a close.  I would suggest for anyone who enjoys a complicated and realisitc book read this one.
B000002U84|5.0|If the song RIO doesn't make you feel good, nothing will.  This album is my all-time favorite.  The sounds and flair this album possesses is incredible.  Hearing &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; for the first time in my used-1975 Firebird is something I will not forget.<br />The album is electric with varying feels from &quot;RIO&quot;, to &quot;Hold Back the Rain&quot;, to &quot;New Religion&quot;.  This album is solid... I highly recommend this album.
B000056K04|4.0|DMB have been one of those bands whose music I have always enjoyed when it played on the radio, but had never purchased an album by.  Then I heard &quot;I Did It&quot; over and over again, and read that the album was good, so I bought it on a whim.  I was pleasantly surprised by the tunes I found.  I dig the melodies, and the beats.  You can't help bobbing your head to songs like &quot;So Right&quot; and &quot;What You Are.&quot;  There is some really beautiful music on here.  That said, I have to say that it is pretty different from the other DMB stuff I have heard, and I think it is a travesty the way Glen Ballard molested the band's sound, and pretty much ran their show.  If this had been an album by some unknown band, it would've gotten five stars.  I sounds to me like Ballard pretty much wanted to make it the Glen Ballard Band, having had all the songs arranged and planned out before the rest of the band even sat down with Dave.  It seems that his pop mentality crept in here, and as always interfered with art.  He nixed all long jams and solos as if they were unimportant dressing (the pop mentality).  I can imagine how the rest of the guys felt when they went to record, but that's neither here nor there.  Buy this album, and enjoy it for what it is, forgetting old pretenses and expectations.  It really is really good.
0380789019|5.0|Mr. Gaimain has written a wonderfully dark story of adventure.  I enjoyed his twists and turns, and while they were slightly predicatble I nonetheless found myself flowing along with the story.  My favorite characters bar none were the two hired hit men and the marquis.  Their wit drove this story and while I never actually laughed out loud I wore a wry grin from cover to cover. I very much liked the ending and the question Richard the main characters asks.  What if you got everything you ever wanted and then discovered that's not what you wanted at all? Wonderful story and while not overly complex it is very easy to flow with.  I highly recommend this to anyone who's in for a little light reading the dark side of the street.  I read this book very quickly and I imagine you will too.
B000002HRE|2.0|...Load I thought was the worst CD of all Metallica CDs.Reload, in my opinion, is probably the 2nd worst Metallica CD.  The reason I'm thinking so negatively here is because I expected Metallica to be a little bit more metal sounding; I was really expecting more drive.<br />Fuel is good and one song, Memory Remains, is really cool.<br />What I really didn't like about this CD is that the instruments  sound too tight and commercial; It really does sound like they didn't use amps on this CD! It sounds like they used some POD like devices. I swear I heard keyboards too ... it's really disappointing  -because they really are a popular heavy metal band-  if you know what I'm talking about...
B00000BKDZ|5.0|Since I'm going to give this 5 stars I must start with a disclaimer:<br />Can I Play With Madness nearly wrecks this disc all by itself.<br />Why?  Well, it's commercially inspired!  The other 7 tracks are so freaking intense, so musically complex, and soooooo well done, CIPWM just sticks out like a big fat sore thumb.  <br />When I listen to this disc, I just skip past track 3 and live in bliss.  7th Son, 7th Maiden studio disc, 7 tracks worthwhile.  That's perfection.<br />Best tracks on this disc are:  Infinite Dreams, The Evil That (wo)Men Do, Only The Good Die Young, the Clairvoyant.<br />Everyone should own this disc.
0790729377|5.0|There are only a few words worthy enough to describe Elia Kazan's 1951 masterpiece.  The words are adjetives.  The first is Flawless, this would refer to the direction and cinematography that gives the film such an uncannily realistic quality.   Incredible is the next word I would use.  This word applies to the performances of Marlon Brando, Vivien Leigh, and all the actors who participated in this film.  It's dominance in the acting categories at the Oscars is testimony to this fact.  Each actor portrays a character so feasilbe, and so real, it's difficult not to get wrapped up in the film.  Reguardless of gender, you can relate and really feel for each character.  A Streetcar Named Desire is probably the first REAL movie, with realisic characters to come out of Hollywood at the time.  And the final word I would use to describe this film is timeless; all one would have to do is colorize it, and you'd never know the difference as far as time frame is concerned.  This is the definative movie that really examplifies what acting is, and should be.  It is the film that inspired me to become an actor myself.
B00000BKDY|5.0|After reading all these customer reviews I just had to respond on this album.  Only because it's my favorite, from my favorite band, a band I've been freebasing since I was 11 years old.<br />So, to you morons who slag off on this disc, here's what I say...<br />1. Someone wrote that his album doesn't &quot;pack enough punch&quot;.  Did they miss &quot;Sea of Madness&quot; and the title track?  Finding songs with more punch in the Maiden catalog is real, real hard.<br />2. Someone complained that no Dickinson compositions are on here. He did write during this period, and you know what he wrote? &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (later released on No Prayer).  Sorry folks, but that song is weak when compared to other songs Bruce wrote from 1984-1988. If that was the best Bruce wrote for this album, I'm sure glad they put it on hold!<br />3.  Synth! Synth! Synth!  Hey, live a little.  Musicians as complex as those in Maiden NEED to find different ways to test themselves.  It's called maturing.  The bass/guitar synth is awesome in my opinion.  It gives this album a futuristic feel like nothing else.<br />4.  Someone also said the band was &quot;burned out&quot; on this since it followed the huge World Slavery Tour.  Burned out?  No, only on fire.  As a guitarist, I must say that the Murray/Smith solos on this disc are BLAZING!  Check out Davey's on CSIT, or Adrian's on SOM, and then check out the pair on &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, a song Steve Harris himself recently called &quot;the best song we've never played live&quot;.  Oh, and Adrian's slow solo on SIASL is proof that some of the best solos don't have to be played fast.<br />5.  Any more complaining morons need to just pick up a live bootleg of this tour.  They reproduced it live.  Complain about &quot;over-production&quot;?  Well then how did they play it live?  <br />This is the greatest Maiden recording of thier 12 studio albums.  Hands down.  End of story.
B000001F3C|5.0|&quot;War&quot; is U2 at its best. This is a sensational album that has already become a classic in the annals of rock music. There's not a bad cut on this album. I highly recommended it!
B000059H98|5.0|I first saw this movie when i was 16 (now 21)... and i fell in love from the very beginning.  I'd never call this &quot;quality cinema,&quot; but it is thoroughly entertaining, and quickly became one of my favorite movies.  The color is breath-taking, Lori Petty is absoltuely beautiful, sexy, funny, wonderful, etc.   And this is just a kick-a#$% grrrl-power movie, without the corporate cheese that tends to come in the package.  It is a fantasy world that i ventured to often as a teenager... and now with a DVD version, the journey can continue. ENJOY!
B00000IQC8|4.0|Ok, just watched it again, and continue to be impressed at how cohesive Smith's work is.  The movie, set up almost as a series of vignettes, plots through a somewhat unusual day in Retail Hell.  The film is definitely a first, independent effort, set up  to showcase talent to the Money.  But it definitely has that DIY sensibility, as well as Smith's consistent and dead-on view of people making their way in the world, and making their foolish mistakes.  <br />A word of advice to people new to Smith's films  - it does help to see the New Jersey Trilogy - Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy, in order, both to watch the improved production and maturing throughout hte works,as well as to catch the continual cross-references.
0790729628|3.0|As with almost all Director's cuts (maybe with the exception of Das Boot and Brazil (Criterion edition)),the film is diminished from its original release. The theatre voiced-over ending was much superior to this one and the unicorn sequence, other than contributing to the speculation that Decker is also Nexus, adds nothing to the film. You would have thought that at least the alternative ending would be on the disk, but sadly there are few extras.<br />Since there were so many possibilites for the DVD edition of the film it is disappointing that Scott and the Studio couldn't make a better product.  Under the guise of artistic vision, Scott has taken what was an excellent film and turned it into one that is just ok. If you can find the original VHS tape anywhere grab it.
B000002BBY|5.0|Arrogant, snotty, subltly aggressive in their songwriting, you've gotta either love 'em or hate 'em.  Personally, I think this band is GREAT!  One of the best of the 90's decade.  One of the few who kept on with straight-forward, in-your-face, rock as opposed to the teeny bopper stars and Limp Bizkit style blunders that took over near the end of the decade.  In retrospect, alternative music today, in general, doesn't please me for the most part and it doesn't take the place of good old-fashioned rockn'roll, from which these guys grew their roots.  True, many of their tunes are simplistic and the band has often been accused of ripping off older bands, especially the Beatles, but really almost all true rock bands in one way or another have done that.  Oasis is just more straight-forward about it.  <br />On to the album, aside from the two instrumentals, which are really much too short to be considered actual songs, every track on here is memorable in one way or another.  The hardrocking openers, &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Roll With It&quot;, kick things off with a bang.  &quot;Wonderwall&quot; tones things down a bit, and while its one of my least favorite of their singles, its still a classic lovesong, which will be remembered by many for a long time.  &quot;Don't Look Back In Anger&quot; is another ballad, much more touching and heart-wrenching.  This song alone may be well worth the admission price as its one of the finest tunes Noel's ever written (and sung!).  Other tracks, from the hard-edged guitar driven &quot;Some Might Say&quot; and &quot;What's the Story? (Morning Glory) to the epic &quot;Champaigne Supernova&quot; to the quarky, yet catchy and addictive &quot;She's Electric&quot; will definitely make this masterpiece a pleasant experience all the way through.  A great album for beginners and one of the best of the 90's.  Highly recommended.
0440234743|3.0|I would describe this book as a bit of a disappointment. It has an compelling and suspenseful intro describing a millionaire's suicide, contraversial will, and the proceeding battle between his children for rights over his eleven billion dollar estate.  However following the intro, the book takes a turn for the worst never really reaching a climax.  The forty middle chapters between the beginning and end are basically a overly vivid description of South America.  Finally,in the final two or three chapters the conflict is resolved.  I must say that this was one of those books that I was relieved to finish just because I thought that I would never make it. Plain and simple, this book had the potential to be so much more!!
B000001E18|1.0|In a word, &quot;Zooropa&quot; sucks! With the exception of the title track, most of the material on this album is second-rate. Unlike other U2 albums, this one lacks consistency and content. To compensate for these shortcomings, U2 tries to make up for by experimenting with new and unusual production techniques. Unfortunately, the end result is an unlistenable album full of techno-junk! This is one album you won't want to add to your CD collection.
0380789019|5.0|This is the most MAGICAL book i've ever read.   I literally couldn't put it down, and had my roommate rip it out of my  hands when he wanted my attention.  I imagine the main female character, Door, incredible beautiful in my head... and she leads the main male character on a wonderful journey.  I think differently every time i ride the NYC subway now.  This is a book  you'll want to read and re-read every time your life seems ordinary.  Incredibly visual language makes this better than every film i've ever seen... and this is one of my favorite books.  ENJOY it at LEAST once.  =)
B000005KQT|5.0|This is a fine compilation of Little Walter's best from the legendary Chess Records. Little Walter was in a league of his own when it came to playing the harp. There was just nobody better. He was a great innovator of the modern day harp sound. And he was the first harp player to go &quot;electric&quot;, by using a hand held mike plugged in to an amplifier. This gave him that fat harp tone that seperated him from the rest. They called this new sound the Mississippi Saxophone. Besides having a unique sound, Walter was a fine songwriter whose music has been covered by many of the British artists of the 60's. &quot;It Ain't Right&quot;was covered by John Mayall and Eric Clapton on the classic first Bluesbreakers album. And also the Rolling Stones did a cover of Confessin' The Blues&quot;. Little Walter was probably most known for the song &quot;Juke&quot;, which he used to play as the opening theme song when he played in the Muddy Waters Band. I think his best instrumental song was &quot;Roller Coaster&quot;, which has some unusual opening guitar lines that were very creative for the time,  performed by Bo Diddley. But my favorites on here are &quot;My Babe&quot;, and &quot;Too Late&quot;, both of which Willie Dixon wrote for Walter when he played bass in his band. It's hard to believe these songs were put on vinyl before I was even born. Their timeless. And so is Little Walter. Walter lived a hard life of alcoholism and violence, which eventually led to his death from injuries suffered in a street brawl. He was only 38 when he died, but he left a legacy of great blues music behind. Little Walter had a unique harp sound that nobody's ever been able to copy, or ever will. That's a secret he'll take to the grave.
B00001U0E1|3.0|Well, surely, this is a good, and well made movie. But nothing was very impressive. First of all, I don't like to see a naked body (or nipples) of a heroine. Everything was fine but I thought it lacked some spices. Maybe I had expected too much from this successful film. One question! Is it really difficult to tell a lady who is disguising as a man from a man? Frankly, from this movie, the Kent character was onlything really disturbed me.
630460291X|1.0|This DVD defeats the purpose of DVD. The disk is single layered, meaning that at this movies length they (Warner Brothers) couldn't fit the whole movie on one side of the disk. You have to flip the disk over mid-film!! <br />Granted it is not the end of the world but it is an inconvenience that a DVD need not have. A DVD is capable of containing two layers per side. Each layer can roughly hold about 2 1/4 hours of high-quality video, audio and subtitles. So, then, each side of a DVD is capable of storing over 4 hours of footage. This means that each DVD can have over 8 hours of material.<br />Longer movies like &quot;Brave Heart&quot; can fit on one side of a DVD and still have space for a &quot;Making of...&quot; Documentary and lot more Bells &amp; Whistles then offered here. <br />I have gone over every symbol and every line of text on the package and find no warning of the &quot;Mid-film Flip&quot;. Because of this I am not going to buy another Warner Brothers DVD. <br />If I can not trust the company then my money will go elsewhere, and I suggest you do the same.
B000056K04|1.0|You people are crazy.  This album sucks.  Dave Matthews is overrated and his fans are chowderheads.  Have a nice day.
B000002KCF|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album!  Mr. Franks is a lyrical genuius...the subtle suggestiveness displayed in his lyrics remind me of Marvin Gaye's lyrics on his 'I Want You' album.  I would suspect that just like Marvin, Michael's lyrics were inspired by the love of (or lust for) some very special lady.  My favorite song is St. Elmo's Fire.   Oh, to be loved so completely and serenaded so beautifully!
B00001QEBQ|1.0|First things first: How the hell did a little green dragon suddenly appear and become her guide? When the Mongol hoards came at China, why were they four times the size of the normal guys and why could they jump off cliffs and not get hurt? And then when, miraculously, all the Mongol hoards died except for 12 people, how did those people suddenly get to Beijing within 5 days without any horses? And how did 12 Mongols defeat the entire captain of the guard for the Emperor, and take him hostage? And for the finale, how did a little Chinese girl take out Genghis Khan with a staff when he had a sword and was seven times her size? On further note: Eddie, we know your drug addiction is using up a lot of your money, but that is no excuse to sell your voice to a shotty movie like this! Disney, your ideas are stale, your productions have gone down the drain, and soon, your park just might fall down...be warned! I'll be forming an anti-Disney strike. See you soon.
B00005214X|5.0|Nothing else need really be said except this indeed was a surprise when it hit the stores in 1970.  We all knew Harrison had writing and performing ability but most us didn't know he had this much.  Of course, those were the days when radio would actually play a song with &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; or any religious message in it.  One note on the sound quality, though.  There is absolutely no bass on this remastering whatsoever.  It's interesting because &quot;Abbey Road&quot; had a couple of tunes with room shuddering bass.  Anyway, great album...just buy it to support good music.
B00003CX5A|5.0|I have always been fascinated with the story of sleepy hollow and am a fan of Christina Ricci so I knew this was a must see for me.  I bought the dvd before ever seeing it, anticipating it to be great.  I was right.  This movie is not only a spooky, horror story, it has beautiful cinematography and the clothes are beautiful.  <br />     This movie just has it all, for people who don't like gross movies this really isn't, maybe a little in some parts but the rest of the movie makes up for it.  It's not your average horror movie; it's a classic and highly recommended.
0140288503|5.0|This book captures the horror and bravery of combat with a thorougness, and eloquence, that is worthy of the highest praise.  I have never been in combat, I've never even been in the military, but after reading &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; I feel I have gained some small appreciation of the astonishing bravery our troops call upon every day.<br />This is not an easy book to read.  Almost from the start, the reader encounters American soldiers fighting for their lives in an immensely hostile city.  Through a host of first hand accounts and thorough research, Bowden throws the reader into this maelstrom of lead and blood.<br />Furthermore, Bowden did not give short shrift to tactics and military reality in the pursuit of personal drama.  In a step by step manner he walks the reader through the battle from start to finish.  He pays great attention to the tactical decisions, both good and bad, that impacted the battle.  At the same time, he considers the strategic environment these decisions were being made in, and evaluates the decision making from President Clinton on down.<br />&quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is a superb tale of courage under fire, but more than that, it is an outstanding tactical history of a military engagement that will undoubtably loom large in any decision to commit US troops to foreign soil in the future.  It is a must have for an student of military history and foreign policy.
0679420401|4.0|This is a great book.  I could hardly put it down.<br />I was supposed to read it in college but somehow couldn't get into it back then.  I was looking through some boxes and found the book.  I read it every free moment I had.  It was hard to get into it at first but after the third chapter I started to get it, then I was hooked.  I felt very connected to the Joad family.<br />I was pleased with the book up until the last page.  I understood the message but was disapointed in lack of closure with the characters.  I truly wanted to know what happened to them.<br />Although it was long I would have been more than happy to read another 600 pages if I thought there would be character closure.<br />I guess the author felt that if people during that time would lose track of their own family members we could sit back and wonder what happened to this family.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|Normally a big Bruckheimer fan, I found Gone in Sixty Seconds beyond stupid.<br />This latest rendition of the Bruckheimer School of  Film Production cries out for the more delicate touch added by Mr. Bruckheimer's former partner, Don Simpson, who passed several years ago.<br />Gone are the days of the pulse pounding, action filled good time that had at least a whiff of character development, as found in Mr. Bruckheimer's signature project: Top Gun.  Today, we are left with nothing more than a host of idiotic car stunts slapped together without rhyme or reason -- thereby making the whole somehow less than the sum of the parts.<br />The actors, virtually all of whom normally take great pride in their work, should have just taken Mr. Bruckheimer's money and beat it out of town in those fabulous hot rods.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is one of those movies you sit at home and wait for.  American Beauty is about the lives of a disfunctional american family with there struggles.  It's so hard to explain you'll be left in aw at the end it's so moving.  I can agree with why it won so many awards.  This movie is for people who like thoughtworthy movies.
B000002UVX|5.0|&quot;Who Knows&quot; and &quot;Machine Gun&quot; are Henrix at his peak. Powerful and soulful, this is one of his best works. Don't miss it. The wah-wah and fuzz box on &quot;Who Knows&quot; are worth the price of admission.
B00004XONN|3.0|The first time you here this album, you'll be wondering what has happened to Radiohead! It really is weird at first but then you sort of get into the grove. <br />Still, it is a bit disappointing. To me, it is almost like out of shere pressure, Thom Torke has just thrown it all together with no real concern about what people think. It's like he doesn't give a toss! <br />The band seem to be lost. It sounds like they just don'ty know what they want. This album is not an evolution of OK computer. It's a complete revolution for Radiohead and I just don't understand it. It's too electronic. <br />I think people need to stop calling these guys the 'best band in the world' cause they aren't. They're good, but not that good. Perhaps if we leave them alone, they'll make a better record next time out cause the potenial as we've seen in the past is clearly there.<br />And another thing, people keep saying that they're trying to sound like U2. What are u guys on about? They don't sound like U2 at all! And thats good, at least they have their own sound which is very much present on this album.<br />If you like Radiohead, get this album. It is an interesting part in their career. The part when they try and re-invent themselves. Those of you who love techno/electronic music will love it! <br />A good album. Nothing more nothing less.
B00000BKDW|5.0|This is, without a doubt, a major milestone in the world of heavy metal.  It is fast, heavy, and yet melodic.  And the guitars?  Oh, man, the guitar work is incredible, very technical, and yet not ostentatious.  It's hard to pick a favorite, I mean they're all great, but I guess the title track and &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; stand out the most, mainly because they're the longest.  But, it's hard to say, as everything on here is amazing.  If I had to complain about anything, it'd be that the riff from &quot;The Duellists&quot; sounds recycled from &quot;Losfer Words (Big Orra)&quot;, but I guarantee you won't care.  As many people here have already said, this is one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  I believe it is the second best album of '84, I think &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; beats it out, but like, barely.  I can't imagine how anyone could not like this album.  Guitarists have gotta check out the fast fingerwork on &quot;Aces High&quot;, &quot;Flash of the Blade&quot;, and &quot;Back in the Village&quot;.  Have you figured out yet that this is a great album?  You must have it, you must have it now!  It's even got cool cover art (as every Maiden album does).  I haven't heard every single Maiden album in its entirety, but I believe that until the mighty &quot;Brave New World&quot; came out, this was their best album (I know many people prefer &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;, but many also think &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is Metallica's best album, but I prefer &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, it's Pepsi and Coke).  Anyway, buy this album now.  You won't be disappointed, and if you are, you may suffer from a serious condition of bad taste that must be treated immediately.  Oh, and there's lyrics to some of the songs from &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; in the booklet, but I don't know why.  Also, check out Iced Earth.
034538072X|5.0|From &quot;the&quot; authority of Tudor England, &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; truly grasps in a very vivid style the continuous challenges, tribulations, manipulations and vicissitudes that each queen had to negotiate in order to survive. The book is downright brilliant; it is history, but reads like a novel. The prose is colorful and exquisitely worded. Yet two aspects sort of got me thinking: (a) the almost detachment of Thomas More during the course of passing the Act of Succession and (b) the lack of evidence on Anne Boleyn's adultery case. If I had to bestow a description to each queen, I would call Katherine of Aragn the most virtuous, Anne Boleyn the most dangerous, Jane Seymour the most fulfilling, Anne of Cleves the most pragmatic, Katherine Howard the most reckless and Katherine Parr as the most universal. In all, a masterful job.
B00000IQBM|4.0|Try if you can to view Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; as a seperate entity from King's masterpiece. The book is so good, that no matter what film adaption was created, it could never match the terror of your own imagination. <br />That said, Kubrick's film is a resounding success that I have seen many many times, and know I will enjoy watching again in the future. <br />The film deals with isolation, madness, and perhaps a haunting, perhaps not. The acting is among the best ever, I particularly like Shelley Duvall, who brings vulnerability and sympathy to her role as Wendy Torrance. <br />There are scenes in this movie that will stick with you long after you've viewed the film..the odd pattern of the rug Danny rides his big wheel on, the twins holding hands and calling Danny to come play...forever...and forever.....and forever,  the snow piled high behind the door, the manuscript, and of course the infamous maze chase.<br />This film is especially effective to watch should you find yourself snowed in, much fun.
B000056K04|5.0|Radio play. These guys, of course, want to get back on the airwaves. They want to re-emerge at the forefront of today's music scene, where in my humble opinion they rightly belong. Only problem is, today's music scene seems to be largely dominated by manufactured boy bands and sexpot teen singers, and decided by an increasing demographic of 12-17 year old girls. Bands composed of real musicians who have experienced what its like to play hundreds of gigs before being &quot;discovered&quot; are slowly being relegated to niche market status. Is it wrong to want to be at the forefront of record sales? Absolutely not. Is it sort of a shame that DMB feels they have to change their style to achieve it? Yes.<br />I do enjoy this album immensely. But there are some parts that are so CHEESY as not to escape my wrath. Everytime I hear the first 30 seconds of &quot;What You Are&quot;, I shudder visibly. Ballard adds what may be the lamest futuristic keyboard/synth sound I have ever heard. Awful. While he does an acceptable job contributing to other tracks, he absolutely mauls &quot;What You Are&quot;. If Glen Ballard ever tours with DMB as their keyboardist, I will absolutely boycott. And by the way, why is it that Ballard has more of a starring role in this album than LeRoi Moore or Boyd Tinsley?<br />&quot;So Right&quot;, on the other hand, is my favorite track on this album, and along with &quot;I Did It&quot; incorporates the new sound that they strove for on this album without going off the lame end. &quot;Mother Father&quot; is also stunning, as well as &quot;Dreams Of Our Fathers&quot;. &quot;If I Had It All&quot; has an intro to rival any in DMB's reportoire, but sorta fizzles out in the middle before picking back up. &quot;The Space Between&quot; and &quot;When The World Ends&quot; are also pretty good.<br />This album may not be among my favorite DMB albums, and I do think that may be due to the mixed blessing/curse influence that Ballard adds. With other albums, I could listen to the whole thing countless times, on this one I have a feeling I'll be reaching for the remote to skip certain songs. <br />But I really do like the new sound that DMB is striving for. I give it 5 stars for the effort, and and am eagerly waiting a live performance to put a fresh spin on the songs.
0553213105|5.0|It was an extremely funny story. The funniest parts were when Mr. Darcy said he would consider Elizabeth a beauty as soon as he would consider her mother a wit. Not that her mother is totally stupid or anything. They were the two best characters in the book. Mr. Bennet is funny too at the begging when he sayd he is not going to go talk to Mr. Bingley and he does. He is one of the most likable or I should say 'agreeable' characters in the book. Why does my review have to come last?
0312263120|1.0|This book is junk. The story is unconvincing and written like an action-movie script. It contains several technical errors and assumptions. The plot is not credible. The end is weak.
B00004U8H4|5.0|I feared that &quot;American Psycho&quot; would be a horribly upsetting serial killer movie with minimal plot. I could not have been more wrong! This film is very intelligent, underplayed, and well done. It never gets very gory, leaving you to imagine the atrocities rather than be presented them in graphic detail.  As a satire of the 80s, I think that this film works somewhat well. As a portrait of a sadistic sociopath, this film works much better. <br />This film makes statements about the lack of personal connection in the 80s society. Status symbols, expensive dinners, and posh clubs have become substitutes for emotions and real connections.  Patrick's coworkers cannot distinguish him from other men. He is mistaken for others at several points. Eerily, all the men in this movie do look alike, with slicked back hair and immaculate designer suits. The film reminded me more than once of the great book but lesser movie &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;.<br />There are moments of sheer terror in this film...<br />The biggest questions I had after viewing this compelling film were: did the murders actually happen, or is this merely Patrick's imagination?? You are left to decided for yourself. <br />&quot;American Psycho&quot; is not a pleasant film to watch, but is strangely compelling.
B00004XOWM|1.0|This is by far the CD I most regret buying last year. In fact, the only CD that was worst was Jennifer Lopez's &quot;On The 6.&quot; In the words of  your typical teeny bopper girl I can sum this baby up in one word: EW! If it weren't for Fred Durst's bad boy image, this band would be nothing more than a bunch of derelicts running around cussing. The only song I can stand without wanting to sue them for verbal assualt is &quot;My Way.&quot; As for the overall feeling of the album, well, we're paying a group of guys to scream profanities at us. If you want good hard care stuff, check out the recordings from the family values tour or Eminem's &quot;The Marshall Mathers.&quot; These are some CDs that actually are catchy and enjoyable though granted, they're still just screaming at you and/or bashing you and your beliefs.
B000055WIQ|5.0|The classic horror movie, The Excorcist, has been reborn. It has been completely remastered. Now, the the sound and picture are crisper and cleaner and the grainy appearance that accompanied so many movies of that time has been removed. It is still by far the best horror flick ever produced and the newly added scenes will scare the pants off any viewer that dare watch it. Reagan's performance still captivates onlookers as the demon dwells inside her. If you want real terror, rent this one on a Friday night for a weekend of nightmares. William Peter Blatty's classic tale lives on in a new version that will keep you hypontized till the final scene.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I love, love, LOVE this album.  I listen to it frequently.  Unfortunately, it reminds one of how far into pop music current country music has strayed and lost its unique soul as a consequence.
B000000OQF|5.0|Before dangerous amounts of hairspray led to the fall of hard rock/heavy metal, five men on a diet of heroin and alcohol put together a mindblowing album.  Appetite For Destruction is 54 minutes of gritty, unabashed and powerful music.  Axl Rose's raspy voice is surrounded by incredible guitar and drum works.  The music, written mainly by Izzy Stadlin and Axl Rose, is simply an in-your-face sound that hasn't been duplicted since.  Subject matter deals heavily with a life of poverty and drug abuse;  things the band had an extensive knowledge of.  &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; is the only song that could introduce what lies on this album.  &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; conveys the depths that one falls into with a herion addiction.  &quot;My Michelle&quot; is actually a terribly sad song about foresaking drugs for lack of love (like I said, they stick with a a subject they know).  No bad songs exist on this disc.  The only downside is that by the time a follow-up came out, the band had already begun to self-destruct and lost the energy they had in the beginning.  This is one of those rare albums that, whether or not you agree with what it says, changed the course of music.
B000056K04|2.0|The songs themselves on this record are pretty decent.  My problem is with the god awful production and final mix.  Glen Ballard has away of compressing instruments into the &quot;wall of noise&quot; syndrome.  Everything just blends together into sonic mush at maximum volume.  It's nearly impossible to make out the saxaphone or violin here. Mix engineer Chris Lord-Alge bleeds out any dynamics, making this record sound flat, abnoxiously loud, overproduced, and just plain terible.<br />I think Ballard and rock bands using acoustic instruments don't mix.  Anyone here remember the Van Halen songs with Diamond Dave back on the greatest hits album?  Listen to tracks and compare them to ones produced by Ted Templeton.  Ballard ruins those tunes the same way he does Dave Matthews.<br />Hey Glen, go back to your little girlfriend Alanis and stop destroying good bands.
0767825411|1.0|The only people who seem to like this movie are the ones that saw it in the theater when it came out. It's called nostalgia. For anyone watching this movie for the first time on DVD, you will be very disappointed. <br />The DVD itself has a very high quality transfer and excellent extra features. So if you are already a fan, you will be very pleased indeed.
B000003CMC|5.0|Living in the south, I remember The Allman Brothers first achieved cult status with their two first albums.  By the time  Eat A Peach was released in 1972, unfortunately their best days were behind them.  Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1971, while this album was being recorded. He appears on six of these classic nine cuts.  He was one of the great rock and acoustic guitarists of all time.  This album is the best of all Allman Brothers releases.  There is not a bad cut. The jamming and musicianship is outstanding.  I never get tired of hearing Duane's Little Martha, which has become a beautiful acoustic standard, plus Blue Sky, One Way Out, Ain't Wastin' Time and others. This was a hard working, no-nonsense southern rock band that redefined what good rock music was all about.  An essential buy!
B000056K04|5.0|I've always been a huge Matthews fan. That's why once Everyday came out I had to get it. I didn't know any song from the new album only &quot;I Did It&quot; and when I popped the cd in my car I feel in love with the new sound. The thing with Dave Matthews is that their sounds can change but the lyrics and the way Dave sings just stays the same and wraps around you. A band like this that has been around for a long time souldn't be takin lightly. All the songs on Everyday are amazing. Every song. I mean everything. The lyrics are humble and passionate, but they've been that way always. I really enjoy Everyday and I hope you will too. And if you don't then you really don't know good music. Just hearing Dave sing is powerful in itself.
B00000IBRI|1.0|C'mon people! Five stars for this garbage? I'm a big horror fan, I like &quot;weird and offbeat horror&quot;, and have enjoyed other Italian horror films by such directors as Mario Bava. Based on the great reviews of this movie on this site, I decided to pick this one up and was I ever disappointed. It's not scary and you'll see more gore in a Friday the 13th or Freddy Kreuger movie. The plot is so incoherent that the film becomes absolutely tiresome to watch. The only good things about it are seeing Jennifer Connelly run around in her nightgown, and the heavy metal soundtrack (which actually sounds very misplaced in parts of the film). The best part of the DVD is listening to the commentary by the filmmakers, who actually seem to think they've made some great piece of art with this film, when it's really just high-budget amateur hour. The only reason to watch this film is if you want to see a slightly weird, bad horror movie. If you do watch it, keep your expectations waaaay low.
0440219078|4.0|The Book the giver was a excellent book that was well written. The book had much to do with folklore and mythology. i would recomend this book to anyone who feels there are things out there unknown.
B000001EEN|5.0|You may notice that the songs are a little shaky. This is one of the greatest parts. At one point the string on his guitar broke, but what did slowhands do? He kept on playing. He is also accompanied by Pete Townshend of The Who and Ronnie Wood. This is a great little addition to the cd, but probobly why it is so overlooked. If you enjoy a good blues song then buy this cd.
0553478117|5.0|Agatha Christie wrote &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; in 1937, one year after &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;, and to all appearances &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; was intended as a prequel to &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;, which itself was a prequel to the 1934 classic &quot;Murder in the Orient Express&quot;.  The three stories make up a satisfying trilogy of mysteries as Poirot tours the Near East finding murder everywhere he goes.<br />All three of the stories follow Christie's tried-and-true formula: She introduces the cast of suspects, gives each of them a dark secret and a motive to lie, and piles up the circumstances in such a way that the flying fickle finger of suspicion points to every one of them at some time or another. She compounds the confusion by supplying false leads and deliberatly glossing over hot clues. In each case Poirot holds his cards close to his vest, tantalizes the reader/listener with cryptic comments, and finds the most inconsequential-appearing facts to be highly significant. Eventually Poirot airs everyone's dirty laundry, explains his chain of deductive reasoning, reconstructs the crime in all its improbable complexity, and gets a confession.<br />Of the three stories, however, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; presents the most feasible modus operandi for the murder, as well as the most likely motivation for murder.  This is a roudabout way of saying that &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; is the most realistic of the three.<br />I listened to the BBC production of &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; and found it the easiest of the three stories for the listener to follow.  For &quot;Orient Express&quot; and &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; you need a flow chart to keep up with all the twists, turns, and complexities of the plot.  All in all, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; provides the listener with an entertaining, satisfying story of murder and mayhem.
0380788624|4.0|Looking for enlightenment? Look elsewhere. Looking for fun? You've come to the right place! Well conceived and woven story lines spanning decades realized through engaging characters and incorporating what, for some, may be tedious tech detail but for me was an entertaining, eye opening, mind stretching learning experience. I love the anecdote-within-story approach Stephenson uses throughout the book, e.g., the first few pages of &quot;Wisdom.&quot; Essentially micro stories standing on their own woven throughout the novel using character and story thread. They're the kind of bits I found hilarious and kept handing to my wife to read which she did somewhat reluctantly at first and then, as did I, became totally engaged. My biggest gripe with most authors is unsatisfactory endings. Ending a novel well is extremely difficult and Stephenson passes my test. Stephenson is clever, cunning and stealthy. Oh yeah, did I mention he writes brilliant prose? More please.<br />P.S. anther aside, it was still a fun book.
B000002OMN|5.0|My first comment is that &quot;A music fan&quot; must be owed some money by Mr. Steinman to incur this much ire...<br />But seriously, about this album -- it's magnificent in its banality.  The lyrics are infantile at times, but they are MEANT to be.  This is an album made for married, successful thirty year olds who remember the insecure, peurile 15 year olds that they once were.<br />The music -- ah, it's 100% pure rock and roll as seen through ten or twelve layers of Broadway.  This is the holy grail of production -- what Phil Spector so often tried to do.<br />One question though -- has anyone else ever recognized that Jim Steinman has written exactly one tune?  I read once that Irving Berlin could only write in one key, and thus had a special transposing piano built to allow him to write melodies in other keys.  If you compare &quot;I would do anything for love&quot; with, say &quot;Tire Tracks and Broken hearts&quot; is it just me or is the the SAME tune, just played at a different speed?<br />Not that I mind -- the tune is still great :)
B00000J6AG|1.0|A complete waste of time and money.  I bought this based on a few songs I had heard on the radio.  Unfortunately, the songs I liked on the radio were not on the album.  Aparently the good versions are on the b-sides and remixes.  You might want to look there first.<br />I've only been able bring myself to listen to it a handfull of times.  The album has no energy, no spark.  None of the songs had that &quot;play it again&quot; interest.  Several of the songs were of the &quot;let's not go there again&quot; variety.<br />I bought other albums at the same time and they are wonderful: Olive 'Trickle', BT 'Movement In Still Life' and Delerium 'Karma'.  I can repeat play all day and not get sick of hearing them.
6300267997|1.0|Barbra's biggest film, moneywise, is also probably her worst film to date.  Self-concious and strained, it's just difficult sitting  through it all.  Kristofferson comes off  the best.  Barbra, trying to bring to the screen a youthful/contemporary  character, fails miserably.  A couple  of nice songs, but the whole affair is, sad to say, a waste  of time for all involved.
0385335482|5.0|Hi, I'm the real-life Becky Bloomwood. No, not really, but if she really existed, we'd be soul sisters. Ms. Kinsella provides a wonderful, quick-read that will resonate with any twenty-something. I found myself flipping ahead a few pages just to make sure that Becky bought something she wanted. Although fictional, her journey through a financial mess and growing up is inspirational and entertaining. Read this!!!
B00004XQ83|5.0|The movie was great! And the next day after seeing the movie I ran right out and bought the soundtrack CD.   I listen to the music every day and am not tired of it yet.  I love every song except the first one on the CD.It would be O.K. if the sound of the picks were not so loud!    The other songs are great, and the music stays with me all day!  I cannot tell you which is my favorite because I love ALL of them. I can just see the actors in the movies sing as I listen .  How about that yodeling! If you like old-fashioned music,  you must have this one. It has some great thought-provoking spiritual songs also.

0345389409|2.0|You know most of the time there are good points to any bad book, this is no exeption but there was not enough of them to over shadow the fact that this book should be subcribed as a sleeping pill!!!<br />has any fan of these books noticed a trend? Lestat is always stalked in one way or another. First by the Paris coven in TVL, then by all the little brat vampiers in QOD, by James in TotBT, and finally by Memnoch. Now the thought of the devil stalking Lestat is incredably interesting, it's the perfect exsample of &quot;be careful what you wish for.&quot; But it sounded like the devil should have been lieing on a leather couch, talking to Sigmond Froud, insted of driving our Brat Prince slowly out of his mind. I kept expecting Lestat to tell him to shut up! I know I was saying it.<br />a few thought on the side characters: Roger was intresting simplely becuse he had the nerve to huant Lestat I liked Roger, but his daughter? Well you know how Lestat drove Greathen from TotBT mad? Dora didn't need Lestat's help, she was flat and very dull, but under that you could all but hear her last straw starting to snap. In short, read it because you need to, to understand what happend to Lestat in The Vampire Armand just don't think for a moment your going to beable to read it in one sitting
0671042858|3.0|Trisha is lost in the woods of Maine for about a week.  She begins to hallucinate baseball player Tom Gordon accompanying her through the thicket.  What she doesn't imagine is something (not someone) stalking her through the woods.  The climax is very exciting.  The book does tend to drag a little through the middle.  King does an excellent job of scaring you.  This book is good but not great.
B000001GQP|5.0|This is a truely amazing piece of music, and this recording captures all the magic of the piece.
6305508550|4.0|There's something about a study of life in a \\"cubicle\\" to which just about everyone can relate; at least everyone who has ever had to get up every day, go to work and punch a time clock, then go home and wait to do it all over again the next day.  In \\"Office Space,\\" writer/director Mike Judge (the guy who gave us \\"Beavis and Butthead\\") captures the essence of the work-a-day world, in this case in an office setting, though it could be on any job anywhere, from the largest conglomerate to the smallest business concern; anywhere a \\"corporate structure\\" is in place and employed.  The subtle humor of Judge's vision is funny, and often downright hilarious, and all with very little exaggeration of the way things really are, from the weekly \\"motivational\\" talks from the boss, to staff meetings, corporate \\"mission statements\\" and the protocol of cover sheets and memos, all of which-- as portrayed here-- have a sterling ring of truth to them.  The central character of Judge's story is a guy named Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a software analyst for \\"Initech,\\" who after working with a therapist finds himself in something of a transcendental state of mind, whereupon he divulges to a pair of consultants-- \\"efficiency experts\\" sent in to streamline the company's operation-- that he does only about \\"fifteen minutes of real work\\" a week, due to the very structure (or lack thereof) of the company itself.  And his refreshingly honest candor in outlining his job description soon has quite an unexpected effect on his life, as well as that of a couple of co-workers.  Judge perceptively expands the satire to encompass facets of Peter's life outside the office, as well, which gives the audience even more with which to identify, like driving to work in bumper to bumper freeway traffic that has slowed to a stop-- in Peter's lane-- while the cars in the next lane going flying by; and when he changes into THAT lane, IT comes to a standstill while the cars in the lane he just left start to whiz on by.  It's an application of Murphy's Law that -- while certainly nothing new-- works well within the context of this particular story, in which the humor is derived from emphasizing the annoying, mundane things that happen to us all on a daily basis.  Like getting in the shortest line at the supermarket and taking longer than anyone else to get checked out.    Livingston gives a notable performance, giving Peter that sense of the \\"everyman\\" who'd like nothing better than to break free of the rigors of the 8 to 5 existence.  He brings an affable presence to the screen that perfectly communicates what Judge is attempting to say, and does it in such a way that it validates Peter's being selected as \\"Champion of the Cause\\" as it were.  Also turning in memorable performances are Stephen Root (a terrific character actor), as Milton, a guy whose very existence seems to be a study in suffering abuse and degradation; and Gary Cole, as Peter's boss, Bill Lumbergh, whose impudent, laconic methods of intimidation, delivered in such a droll manner, make him the boss everybody loves to hate.  The supporting cast includes Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, the waitress with a minimum of \\"flare\\" who has trouble \\"expressing\\" herself, according to her boss; Ajay Naidu (Samir); David Herman (Michael Bolton); Richard Riehle (Tom); Joe Bays (Dom); John C. McGinley (Bob Slydell); Paul Wilson (Bob Porter) and Diedrich Bader (Lawrence).  Reminiscent of the world portrayed in the \\"Dilbert\\" comic strip, \\"Office Space\\" works because it effectively puts real people in real situations, and brings you into contact with some characters you're going to recognize; I guarantee that no matter what you do to live, thrive and survive, you've run into these people, worked for them, and alongside them.  It's a case of art reflecting reality, and to Judge's credit he's succeeded in making a funny movie that really hits close to home, without resorting to any gross or infantile humor to do it.  It's a filmthat simply puts the \\"corporate experience\\" in the spotlight and gives you a chance to laugh at \\"the boss,\\" and maybe even a little bit at yourself along the way.
B000002AVF|3.0|I bought &quot;Mariah Carey&quot;, I bought &quot;Emotions&quot;.. I stopped at &quot;Daydream&quot;... as apart the old school fan of Mariah Carey- listening to her all the way back when I was Elementary school.. after this album, I feel as if she's ignored her older listeners to try and reap profits out of the younger crowd that's around.  If her videos and fashion choices are any indication, her musical quality has degraded as well to sell with mainstream and producers.  In this record, she's making the cross over from her usual ballads and infuses more R&amp;B to entice more R&amp;B listeners.  I also think she's trying to show off her raunchier side to her ex-husband, but that's just my opinion.  If you choose to buy any other CD's after this, be my guest, but I'd say you'd be getting the best of the last of her quality in this CD.
B000056K04|2.0|Although this album has a number of catchy tunes, I hope this will be a momentary departure from DMB's unique sound. While there is a little of Dave still left in &quot;Everyday,&quot; it's very disappointing that there is minimal sax and violin. Although we hear that the live versions will make up for this, I wouldn't mind having a taste of that jamming in my living room or in my truck. Decent album, but not noteworthy in comparison to past works.
0679720200|5.0|In the forward to the Mathew Ward edition of this book there is a comment by Camus in which he says that in writing The Stranger he was attempting to write an American book.  By that comment, Camus meant that he wanted to write a novel that was easy to read, fast paced, but at the same time full of meaning along the same lines as most of Hemingway's novels.  Well, he was definitely successful in accomplishing these goals with The Stranger.  Through his character Meresault, Camus is able to make the reader truly see the absurdity of our existence, and he gets us to thinking that maybe, just possibly, we live finite lives.  The Stranger though is much more than just a work of existential philosophy, it contains one of the most gripping court trials in literature, putting it on a par for suspense with most present day legal thrillers.  Camus is not an author who is going to make you happy to be alive, but he will definitely make you think more about why you're here.
0312966199|5.0|All Things Bright and Beautiful is a fantastic book that had a curious effect on the direction of my life. This sequel to Herriot's best-selling &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; continues the true, autobiographical adventures of the author as an English countryside veterinarian. I had just read his first book and dove right into this second one, absolutely convinced as a teenager that veterinary medicine was my destiny. But by the end of  this second book, Herriot helped me realize that while I loved animals, I wouldn't be happy as a vet. The odd hours, inevitable disappointments, and requirement to frequently and literally go elbow deep into places I'd rather not, caused the realization that petting a warm and fuzzy pet and fixing a sick and slimy farm animal are two entirely different propositions. One measure of a book's merit is its power to change lives. This one has such power, for which I'm eternally grateful. -- Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead and owner of 3 cats, 2 dogs, and 2 horses.
B00000IQB7|4.0|It has to be said that this is a bad movie. However,as with Dolemite, this does not make it a &quot;bad&quot; movie. Its very entertaining and has an excellent cameo by Dennis Hopper and some surprisingly good special effects ,especially the dinosaur in the latter part of the film. It wont suit everyone, but if you like trashy movies, then this ones up there with Dolemite, Runaway, Biggles and Leonard part 6. Better than ...? anyway.
B00000K19E|5.0|When I first watched this film with a friend, we were knocked out by it and we were already discussing it right in the middle of the film. I feel the special effects are totally different and you could just take it as a good sci-fi/action film but it has tons of symbolism, which the writers/directers obviously intended. I went right out, bought a copy of the DVD and have watched it countless times since.
B000056K04|4.0|Warning to all hardcore Dave Matthews fans: if you are expecting something like &quot;Crash&quot; or &quot;Under The Table and Dreaming&quot;, watch out. This album is REALLY different.  It's not the same band you've grown accustomed to.  Seriously, I can't believe the band members let something like this come out, especially when I heard the way Glen Ballard took over everything and blocked any sense of creativity or originality from them.  That to me is just wrong, especially to do it to Dave Matthews Band. That out of the way, the cd is really not all that bad.  When you really stop and think, it's really Dave Matthews's acoustic style brought to electric, and its still his music.  It's still a cd you can listen to straight through, too.  I just hope that when they go on tour they 1)change the songs so Boyd and the sax player can play open solos and 2)play their old stuff as well as their new stuff. Still, I would recommend this cd to people. Just expect something different.
B000002UB6|2.0|The whole thing feels like a B-side to me. Not up to their usual standard.  Forget for a second that its the Beatles and it loses a lot of appeal.  Kind of like Magical Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper.
0345440757|1.0|Aren't these ideas derived from NIDCAP training?
B000002UAU|2.0|Just a few observations on the album and the reviews.<br />On the album: The music alone simply cannot account for the popularity of this release. It isn't that consistently good.  I've noticed that everyone who says it's great tends to overlook its obvious flaws (Within You, Without You anyone?) The popularity of this record has more to do with its release being at a memorable time (the war, summer of love, psychedelia, etc.) than the music. Nostalia sells.<br />Finally, sorry, it's not a fact that everyone loves the Beatles.  And yes, it is up for debate regarding the appeal of their music. 2 stars
B000053VBL|1.0|I was exteremely disappointed with Trauffaut. The movie lacked any simple sensibility there should be in a movie. What is being called suspenseful by most reviewers is strange as there is nothing suspenseful about the kind of killings she was doing etc. The director rarely shows the trauma of what led her to be so keen on revenge etc. I think the movie was quite silly and very hard to believe.
B000056K04|5.0|Just when the DMB was sounding old and out of ideas they come up with their best album to date.  Some followers will despise this album because they won't find any 8 minute jams on everyday. Fans should look at it from a different perspective though.  On Everyday Dave takes his lyrics to a whole new level and the addition of electric guitar is a plesant surprise.  The best tracks on Everyday are The Space Between, So Right, and Angel.  Angel is an instant DMB classic and by far a cut above the rest.  Out of the 12 tracks on here only the first released track I Did It is a disappointment.  By the way if you like DMB check out The Pat McGee Band and Coldplay....2 of the best kept secrets in music industry.
B00000J7JO|4.0|Two words: Road Trippin'. That song, alone, is all the reason in the world to buy this CD. This album only as one or two not-so-enjoyable songs that bring it down a little, but still an awesome CD to pick up. - My $0.02

0671027344|5.0|This book was amazing. It was given to me for christmas and has been read a thousand times since.

This book is truly amazing you have to read it it made a big impact on me and the way i see other people!
B000002ADT|5.0|Admittedly, I was a latecomer to the genius of Miles Davis. On several occasions, I was told of the level of greatness in his music. Kind Of Blue was the first album I heard - thanks to two family members who might have been trying to tell me something; I received the album twice, on the same Christmas Day! Is this the epitome of cool/love ballad jazz? Complex enough to feel the aesthetic, modal harmonies- Concise enough to blend into the accessible rhythm. The clarity is powerful enough to validate that these notes, initially written down on scraps of paper and subsequently distributed to each established musician. Delicately chosen, Miles was always secure in knowing what type of sound he wanted.           I listen to 'All Blues' and love the fact that the song is quite the odyssey, performing a complete three-sixty, ending up right where we started.   As are all the tunes a myriad of the melancholy, (Blue In Green) across the gamut, displaying the bouncy-hip style of, &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; named after a real-life character. Miles Davis crossed definitive boundaries purposely, creating a timeless sound.
B0000214F3|5.0|Meet Joe Black is a classic, romantic drama with a happy and at the same time sad ending. The peanut butter-loving guy, Death is played by Brad Pitt. In a two way game Death is trying to show the wealthy billionaire, Anthony Hopkins, that he is still a human and that his life is going to end soon, so he better enjoy it. While Death is doing that, he falls in love with the billionaire's precious daughter (the beautiful Claire Forlani). Pitt actually succeeds playing a goofy guy, and he grabs your heart. Joe Black has a very important job to do, but is surrounded with the dilemma of whether to chose to take the billionaire or the daughter.<br />There are few other characters like Drew played by Jake Weber who is the guy that the father has chosen for his daughter and Jeffrey Tambor as Quince (the guy that would say anything to be liked from any powerful person) who add a lot of humor and rich acting to the movie. There are many strong, provoking and perfectly said lines that deserve the viewer's attention.<br />The first half and hour of the movie I was kind of confused. I couldn't catch up to what was happening and more importantly why it was happening. This is the type of movie that you have to pay close attention to everybody and everything or the movie gets blurred. Meet Joe Black is a movie where the viewer has moments where he or she thinks about life and how to live it.<br />The action in the movie is interesting and mysterious making viewers guess what will happened. Joe Black is keeping secret after secret, yet he is likeable. The movie makes you wonder if you truly appreciate life and everybody around you. I believe that the main idea of the movie is to show that people cannot buy happiness with money (even billions). <br />My only one suggestion is that there are scenes that can be shorten like the one of the 65th birthday party near the end. Although it's a three hours long, it's still interesting and keeps your attention. Meet Joe Black is a sensitive movie that is full of emotions and will leave you with a smile on your face and deep thoughts in your mind. At least that's what happened to me. I was very impressed by the acting and the message that came with the movie. Meet Joe Black offers humor and a serious look at life that makes the movie one to see. Don't miss the chance to explore how much you know about life, responsibilities and chances. Meet Joe Black teaches you or maybe better, it makes you realize that you have to be ready to take on the fact that one day sooner or later your time to go will come. That's why people have to enjoy as much as they can the gift of life...
1881273156|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best book I have ever read.  Dr. Chapman writes at the very end that he wishes he could give a copy of this book to every married couple.  I have to agree with that statement wholeheartedly.  The concepts as he presents them are so simple and basic yet incredibly profound.  I cried as I was reading when Dr. Chapman described couples with problems that sounded almost exactly like my marriage.  My husband is reading the book and we are once again beginning to communicate our love for each other.  We still need counseling to work everything out, but Dr. Chapman's book may have almost single-handedly saved yet another marriage from the brink of divorce.  I think everyone with a loved one (and I certainly hope everyone has SOME loved ones - children, parents) can benefit from the simple and understandable concepts in Dr. Chapman's books.
B000002HAF|5.0|The vocal combination of Black Francis and Kim Deal make this album the most beautiful and frightening album of all time.  It is also loaded with guitar riffs that will blow your mind.  My personal favs are Gigantic, Where is my mind, Bone Machine, and River Euphrates.
B000056K04|2.0|This CD sounds as if it were written in a week, and I think it actually was. Lacks all the passion and soul of all earlier music. Saxaphone and Violin are nearly obsolete. I am a big DMB fan, but I would not reccomend this album to anybody looking to buy their first DMB CD.
B00004XQ83|5.0|That's the only reason the songs on this remarkable 'roots' ablum won't leave you with an aching soul -- if you're alive and this music doesn't touch you, I can't understand it. I haven't seen the movie (yet!), but the album stands on its own as a coherent and thematic piece, an Odyssey through the heart of the country. Ralph Stanley's haunting &quot;O Death&quot; won't soon leave your mind, nor will &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody But the Baby&quot; or &quot;Down in the River&quot; -- or, for that matter &quot;In the Highways, In the Hedges&quot; in its simplicity or &quot;Po Lazarus&quot; in its starkness... I've always loved &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountains&quot; as much for what it says about the limits of belief (the jails are made of tin and the policemen all have wooden legs -- but there are both jails and cops, even there) as for its hopefulness. A thousand words... a thousand words aren't enough for this album. Everything on it is perfect. I've listened to it fifty or sixty times already, and I don't anticipate ever tiring of it. It's just that good.
B000056K04|4.0|How can something be different and predictable at the same time? I don't know, but DMB has done it again. From the slow, thoughtful tunes of &quot;The Space Between&quot; to the gritty sound of &quot;Fool to Think&quot; to the upbeat, happy sounding &quot;Everyday&quot;, Dave and Company have given us an amazing album that's sure to be a hit with Dave fans everywhere. That was predictable. What's new on the album is Dave taking to the electric guitar (very well I may add) and the relative shortness of the songs (not one is over 5 minutes long). <br />I see two problems with the album that knocked a star off for me. First, there's not enough of Boyd Tinsley (Violin) and LeRoi Moore (Sax), and second, because of that, I don't know if they'll have the great live success with these songs as they had on other albums (Under the Table and Dreaming, Crash, and Before These Crowded Streets). Even still, the band with the most creative name I've ever heard has given yet another gem of an album.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|This compilation is a mighty thin slice through their recording career, and not the best slice at that. Someone who knew nothing of the Beatles could be forgiven for not getting too excited just hearing these songs.<br />Also, the remastering leaves a lot to be desired. Simply stated, the problem is that the Beatles had a great ear for how to target 60's recording technology to make dynamite-sounding records. All of their performances in the studio were tailored accordingly, and it just plain doesn't work to use 21st century mixing techniques on this material. The music ends up sounding sterile and dissected, many of the most powerful signature riffs are de-emphasized, and in some cases, notably Penny Lane, the results are just plain bizarre. On the plus side, the new mixes do emphasize some aspects that were hard to hear originally, which helps the many musicians who enjoy trying to figure out just what and how they were playing. Overall, though, the updating  takes the soul out of the music. I lean more towards wishing that more modern music was recorded using 60's techniques rather than the converse. It was the primitive exuberance of their studio work that was such a big part of their magic, and unfortunately, that feeling is lost in this collection.
B000002NJS|5.0|Before &quot;Ray of Light&quot; I was never a Madonna fan, or even an electronica fan, but this record clearly stands out as something special in a teenybop pop music world.<br />As testiment to how unique this album is, Madonna's latest offering &quot;Music&quot; pales in comparisin and you get the feeling she may have just outdone herself.  Listening to each song you almost forget the room around you.  You are so heavily washed up in underwater ocean sounds and sheer peace and tranquillity you can't be bothered listening to other records.  The bleeps and squeaks of electronica usually interrupt the flow of a tune but here they compliment and improve on the melody and vocals.  True, there are no real fast tracks but you get the feeing it is better without them, this is truly a record to relax to, yet Madonna's dancefloor past sines through in Ray Of Light.<br />The standout tracks include the explosive Ray of Light, Frozen, and Sky Fits Heaven, which was wasted by not being released as a single.  Yet none of these tracks dominate the record and the whole experience makes you wonder why the likes of N'Sync and Beitney Spears even bother trying to make music.<br />Sensational from beginning to end, this will prbably be looked on in years to come as her Masterpeice track.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I thought the movie was excellent, and I probably couldn't add anything new to what others have already said about it.  It is a well thought-out action movie (yes, it really is technically an action movie, as one would say Fugitive is an action movie) with great acting (particularly from Jaoquin Pheonix), add an honor theme, great scenes, and a thrilling plot, and you get a movie that feels like an epic and is a wee bit more than  an &quot;action movie.&quot;  As I'd say, and lots of Hong Kong movies realize this, action shouldn't feel like action more than an extension of character, which I think works here.  Movie sure seem to know how to make the Maximus character seem heroic. As for the DVD itself, I'd have to say this is a very excellently composed DVD.  It has lots of great extras such as extra videos and interviews and storyboards.   The audio and video quality is quite excellent.  One of those rare DVDs where I felt I got more cool stuff than I paid for. ^^
6301963911|5.0|Woody Allen has managed to combine true belly laughs with heartfelt emotional conflicts in this modern movie classic which remains as satisfying today as it was when it won the Best Picture Oscar in 1977. Too often confused with being episodic or out of a chronilogical order, &quot;Annie Hall&quot; expresses found and lost love and all the mental juxtapositions that come with it.
B000056K04|5.0|I feel sorry for those DMB fans who don't like the change and do not see the potential these songs have to be excellent in concert.  A studio album does not have to include the jams, they'll be on the live album.  If you absolutely have to have the jams with these songs, then have patience, my child, it will come.  That said, I'm a new fan, I started liking DMB with Don't Drink the Water, and have grown to like 90% of his material.  I love the new album, and I love the fact that it has elements of their old style, yet plunges into something completely different.  Plus, I might add, that despite the lack of instrumental solos, there is quite a bit of the sax, and violin.  The violin is plugged, they hooked a synth to it, it's not ALL keyboards making those sounds.  Skip the concert and you'll be left behind in an incredible musical evolution for this band.  I hope they do not go back to making variations, of Crush, Crash, and Ants.  Those are wonderful songs, but 15 or so versions of them are enough.

Basically it is the continuation of the original tv episode, &quot;Space Seed.&quot;  In this flick, Kirk (William Shantner) fights an epic battle with the supposedly superior genetically engineered Kahn.  This movie has stunning special effects for its time, particularly in the battle scenes between the Enterprise and Reliant.  The plot is interesting, in that Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is killed while saving the ship from Kahn's genesis explosion. To this point in the series, no major character from the original bridge crew had been killed and fans left wondering, why did they kill of spock?  This of course leads to the third flick, &quot;Star Trek III Search for Spock.&quot;      Finally, what impressed me the most about this dvd, was the quality of picture and sound.  I still have the original vhs tape and the picture quality and sound have degraded considerably.  Now DVD will preserve sci-fi classics such as this for years to come.  Overall, a great buy if you love Star Trek.
0451196716|1.0|There's a reason this book is written by Bachman -- because it is terrible and King was smart enough to distance his &quot;brand&quot; from it. The story is dreary and uninteresting and the most fun to be had is chuckling over King's, er um, Bachman's use of language. Guess he was bored too. Don't bother. If you are this hard up for a book to read -- find some old Koontz thing lying around at a Library Used Book Sale.
6305350205|2.0|Hello, first let me begin in saying this is perhaps the weakest of the Star Trek films.  In this film the Enterprise is lured into a trap at the planet of Galactic Peace. Where Spock's half-brother Cybock, takes over the ship.  They then go on a trip to the great barrier at the center of the galaxy.  The potential for this film was vastly squandered, by the organization of ideas.  At the start of the movie, Spock, Kirk, and Dr. McCoy are on shore leave in Yosimite National Park.  Kirk falls off the mountain and Spock rescues him just before he hits the ground.  What does this have to do with later on aspects of the movie? I guess humor was the idea.  Another annoying fact about this movie is the humor that is forced upon it.  For example: The ship is full of mechanical flaws and we go through numerous scenes where Scotty complains about fixing things or Kirk complains about bridge crews being noisy. These scenes are supposed to be funny but they really are quite dumb. Overall the humor in this film, is just not funny.  This is in my opinion the direct result of William Shatner directing the film. He is not a pro and it showed badly throughout the movie.  His idea of humor and plot is quite bad.  Back to the movie.  When the Enterprise reaches the intergalactic barrier and the planet beyond it: Spock, Kirk, Dr. McCoy and Cybock, encounter a being claiming to be god.  After they discover he is evil and wants to take over the Enterprise they destroy him.  This makes no sense, because he or it is not physical. How can you destroy a being similar to god, with a laser? Try pondering that. Before they destroy the entity Spock's brother is killed and Kirk is saved just in the nick of time by Spock, at the gunery of a Klingon battleship.   <br />What turned me off about this film was the lack of continuity.  You jump from Yosimite Earth, to the Planet of Galactic peace, then the Great Barrier (which is supposed to be hundreds of light years away, which would take years for the Enterprise to reach and the Enterprise conventiently reaches in a few hours), and finally the planet beyond it.  Then Kirk, Spock, Cybock, and Dr. McCoy, fight and destroy a being claiming to be god.  All the while they are being chased by a Klingon ship, whose commander is seeking to defeat Kirk for fame and glory.  Where's the connection?  This lack of connection combined with bad humor and lack of real action makes this film dry and boring to watch, compared to the other Star Trek Films.   If you are a Star Trek fan, this film is okay to rent, but it is not a crucial film in the sequence of movies.  In fact, if you suddenly removed it from the Star Trek arcives the following movies would not be missing anything at all.  It is an unimportant side track in the Star Trek legacy, which leads to nowhere.   <br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to normal movie watchers.  You will probably not enjoy it, except for a few stupid humorous jokes.
0792844793|4.0|When David Lynch's masterpiece &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; first came out, many recognized the powerful vision of the avant garde director, yet dismissed the film as an attack on the notion of a &quot;nuclear family.&quot; However, nothing could be further from the truth.  Unlike the more recent &quot;American Beauty,&quot; &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; does not cloak the depravity of its characters in the context of the average suburbian experience: Instead it localizes it and embodies it in sado-masochistic Frank (played by the manic Dennis Hopper). Here, Lynch gives us one of the most complex Oedipal fantasies to be captured on film, but in the end the family unit is restored and its sanctity saved...or is it? Still, the film is about mood and texture, and Lynch's vivid surrealist imagery lends itself well to the mystery genre. Not for the squeemish, this film depicts violent sexuality which remains as controversial today as it did back then--so buyer beware.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5, because the DVD doesn't have very many special features--no behind the scenes, no script, no documentary etc.--Just a poor quality theatrical trailer.  Nevertheless, the film itself is timeless, and far better than &quot;American Beauty.&quot;
0060916540|3.0|The story of how the author survives breaking his leg on this winter mountain hike is riveting. However, I found the book tough to read due to the language. Many of the terms were unfamiliar me. The book includes a glossary at the end, but I needed the glossary to be about 10 times as large. If you are looking for a good outdoor adventure book try one by Jon Krakauer (Into Thin Air or Into The Wild).
B00003XACV|5.0|Ok I have been reading reviews of this CD. I absolutley love this CD and this movie for its shear brilliance and reality. Looking at annette benning i could almost see my own mother minus the afair. But that is beside the point Yes the CD is amazing there are 70 reviews here to tell you that. What i want to you is all those people who rated this bad because it does not have american woman or annie lennox on it..DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM...THIS IS THE ORIGINAL MOTION SCORE! NOT THE SOUNDTRACK THE SCORE! This CD has all the music written by Thomas Newman all the pop songs can be found on the other CD. Do a little research and read the back of the case and the songs list before you buy a CD ok? Dont whine because you didnt do the research and didnt get what you thought you would...
078322608X|5.0|I was tempted to review this title as a sci-fi movie with a time-travel theme, but the truth is no matter how you look at it it's never really clear whether everything we've seen was reality or the warped product of one's man imagination.  So here then is the view from the other side.<br />12 Monkeys is the story of James Cole (played by Willis), a committed mental patient suffering from &quot;mental divergence&quot;.  In his mind, he is a time traveler from the year 2035.  His world of the future has been devastated by a virus that wiped out most of the population in the late 1990s, forcing human kind to dwell in enormous, dark and hideous underground bunkers.  In this future he is charged with traveling back to the past and discovering the origin of the virus.  Cole transitions from past and &quot;future&quot; several times in his quest to seek the source of the virus.  In the end Cole loses complete touch with reality and imagines himself in love with his psychiatrist (Stowe) while they work together to save the world.<br />If you pay close attention you will notice similarites between the past and future that can't all be explained away as mere coincidence.  For example, he is a prisoner in the past and future.  Five scientest sitting behind a long table send Cole off from the future to find the virus, and five psychiatrists sitting behind a long table in the present evaluate Cole's condition.  The guards from the past (one black and one white) bathe Cole in an eerily similiar way to the guards that bathed him in the future (also one black and one white).<br />Cole's vision of the future looks flawed and twisted.  The technology looks absurd and counter-productive (a metal ball of viewing screens?).  The dialouge of the scientests is..odd, to say the least.  Also, exotic animals are still alive and well roaming the streets of 2035 Philadelphia for the last 38 years.  Pay attention at the begining and end of the movie and you'll see what I mean.<br />Despite thisthere is more than enough evidence in the movie to suggest that Cole actually is a time travler and that the world is about to suffer a huge calamity, evidence that can't be explained by Cole's active imagination.  It's this superb balancing act between reality and fantasy achieved by director Gilliam that makes 12 Monkeys an excellent psychological thriller.
B00001R3GC|5.0|This is easily my favorite record.  I have worn out three cassette tapes (thank you to all of you who have discarded your tape collections - - I can pick up a tape at the used record store for $2.50).  <br />It rocks, it pulsates, it's sad, it's powerful.  Pure genius.<br />Best twelve bucks I have ever spent.  I highly recommend this record.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I saw Rear Window for the first time when I was about 12-13 years old.  Even though I didn't quite understand everything that was happening in the plot (Miss Lonely Heart, the newlyweds, etc.), the suspense still got to me.  I remember trying to sleep one time after watching it, but I kept looking into the shadows of my room trying to find Thorwald waiting for me!  That's the thing I love most about the film.  With one beautifully detailed sound stage and some excellent acting/directing, Hitchcock scared me more than any other movie I'd ever seen (included at the time the Alien movies, The Shining, etc.).  Now I'm 20 and I've seen the movie many more times and have come to appreciate every one of it's nuances.  Sadly, it has disappeared from stores and rental shops in past years.  That's why I was very happy to learn that the restored version was to be reissued on DVD! I was lucky enough to find a movie theater near me that was playing the restored version, and it looks absolutely wonderful.  Even if it weren't for the great extras (production stills, script(!), production notes, trailer, and a documentary) it would still be a great buy.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|I just wanted to comment on the Special Edition version.  <br />After viewing the original version DVD, this version simply puts it to shame!!<br />The special features are just great... Going &quot;Behind The Scenes&quot; with the Secret Service is a nice long segment on how they operate.. Included is a segment on &quot;Catching the Counterfeiters&quot;, which goes into a lot of detail on the new features of U.S. currency and on how to spot a phony bill... Throw in the actor interviews &amp; deleted scenes, and on top of it all, an outstanding film, well, you just have a wonderful DVD that is a MUST HAVE for any collection.<br />Highly recommended!!!
0375501851|3.0|Well, when I read about this book in the NY Times Book Review, which decided it was one of the best books of the year, I immediately short-listed it for an Xmas present.  Well, I must say, I have received better Christmas presents.  No, not the Fine Young Cannibals CD, it wasn't that bad, but this novel was definitely overrated.  I have read quite a lot of the reviews here and they echo my feelings.  I was let-down.  Newsweek loved it, NY Times loved it.  Usually that's a good indicator.  Well, I didn't love it.  I think that Zadie Smith is a fabulously talented woman, younger than me and blessed beyond belief but at times it just feels like she's thumbing her nose at those with average command of the English language.  She is showing off.  I think she's long-winded and, although, like I said, very talented, I think she overreaches.  Someone else said that she didn't fill out her characters.  I'd agree with that.  I was really enjoying about the first 300 pages.  I thought the start was great.  But somewhere in there she got confused.  I couldn't tell what the focus of the book was.  Was it Samad and Archie?  At first it was.  Or was it Irie, who seemed to be the pivot for later events.  I found it hard to believe that such a prominent scientist as Chalfen (that whole Chalfenism thing had me chafing) would be so fulfilled and helped by a 17 year old???!!!!  Magid didn't exactly have the best genes.  And would a scientist of his stature need Irie to do his filing?  No, he would probably have a pro, a real trained secretary.  Now like others said, there's a lot to admire here.  She has a phenomenal command of English, a great ear for language and really, her prose is fantastic.  But I think she overreached in trying to wrap everything up quite so neatly.  I think that was her biggest mistake.  Her scope was too wide.  Someone before me said there was an &quot;embarassment of riches.&quot;  I'd agree.  If she had focused just on Samad and Archie's lives after the war and their lives (which was what I anticipated when we got through with the intro) it would have been excellent.  She is so talented that I will buy her next book too quite likely.  She is very talented.  But this one doesn't live up to the hype.
B00003W8NM|3.0|Do you enjoy feeling uncomfortable, unsettled, even disgusted?  Do you giggle when made to squirm?  Then this movie is for you.<br />When I saw Seven, I left the theatre thinking &quot;why was I put through that?&quot;  I wondered &quot;who enjoys seeing such pain?&quot;<br />Fight Club is like Seven in an important respect: it shows a lot of human bodies being mistreated.  In this movie, however, most of the people being mistreated _choose_ it.<br />UNfortunately, this movie is much more funny and entertaining than Seven.  It's even insightful about what people do when their life has no meaning or purpose.<br />I don't mind a movie that jars your everyday sensibilities for some important purpose, but Fight Club, as a film, is fundamentally concerned with a destructive and self-destructive individual.  The film blames his actions on a supposed materialistic soullessness of modern society (stupid old mistaken idea -- Yawn).  Then it makes light of itself by being funny.<br />Be careful whom you laugh with.<br />Simply watching this movie is a self-destructive act.  It is seductive and entertaining, while inciting hatred for good, productive people.<br />The movie itself is the cinematic incarnation of Tyler Durden himself.  It appeals to your inner criminal.<br />Sadly, it is extremely well executed.  The film is a technical masterpiece, worthy of study by future directors.  Great skill has been applied to dull your sense that there's something wrong with what the film is advocating: the destruction of health and wealth.  The final event in the film says it all.<br />Unlike the characters in this film, don't buy into the thrill of abuse.  Don't choose to be mistreated.  Don't see this film if you want to defend your life's purpose.  If you do, then -- like the men in the film -- you'll be sucked just a little further into someone's dimented, destructive, _purposeless_ fantasy.<br />Contrary to what the film implies, &quot;consumerism&quot; (concern with achieving values) isn't sucking out our souls.  What's doing it is nihilistic films like Fight Club.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I can honestly say that I had never listened to the Beatles before this album.  I thought that they were better suited to my parents generation, and never bothered with them.  But after seeing the album advertised on T.V., I heard alot of songs that I had heard in the car when I was young, and on commercials since then.  I decided to go buy it, and I was glad I did!  I really enjoyed this CD.  I don't know if the songs sound different from the original recordings, or if the album is not an acurrate collection of the Beatles work, but it was awesome for a first time listener.  I especially liked &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, and &quot;Come Together&quot;.
6304493681|2.0|i have to admit the animation is very fluid and the scenes are very detailed. But the story line lags and never really takes off. I sat through this movie thinking the story line would pick up along with the action, it never did. Not unless you have the 20$ to spend on this dvd, i would pass on this one. You would be better off buying a trigun episode.
0140186409|5.0|The word &quot;classic&quot; doesn't always mean a good book. But in this case, The Grapes of Wrath deserves the label. Being forced to read this book through an assignment, I started off with a bad outlook. After finishing the book, I found that my opinion had changed. TGOW has a great mixture of history and plot while being written skillfully and wonderfully. I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys the history of the Great Depression or Dust Bowl era; or to anyone researching biblical illusions in literature.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles 1 relives the most successful of the Beatles' several hits from 1962 to 1970. A very nice chronology that highlights what music fans have either loved or hated about popular music from years past.<br />There is really nothing new to add here, except that the most significant improvement in the recording technology I noticed was in &quot;Day Tripper&quot;. If you purchased and listened to Past Masters Volume 2 as I did back in 1988, you will notice a slight glitch in the song, as if a 0.25 second portion of the tape either &quot;twisted or thinned out&quot;. In The Beatles 1, this particular error is corrected.<br />All in all, the Beatles 1 will very likely have a little something for all audiences to enjoy. My best friend is not a Beatles fan, but even he praised it as an enjoyable CD.

B00000IAU3|1.0|This was one of the worst cds I've bought in a long time. I was very dissapointed, from the first song to the last (except for the two they play on the radio), every song was bad. Everyone says she the best kept secret, I wish it would have stayed a secret from me.
6301390725|5.0|A fantastic film. Just as good as Mary Poppins. Maybe even a bit better as there is quite an adventure involved. And kids just seem to love stories where there's witches, spells, baddies and  strange cartoon lands that real people can visit. I loved this movie when it first came out, and it was a favourite with my kids as they were growing up. I think the ending where the Nazi's are invading England and Angela Lansbury's character, who is a good witch, puts a spell on all the old suits of armour and sends them off to fight the Nazis, is terrific. To see the nazis flee in terror when they realize the armour is empty, is a hoot. This movie is filled with loads of magical moments...it's a treasure.
B0000073BG|5.0|Along with &quot;Turn of the Cards,&quot; &quot;Scheherazade &amp; Other Stories&quot; remains the finest moment in Renaissance's career.<br />Taking the same symphonic approach they did on &quot;Cards&quot; &quot;Scheherazade&quot; is easily the most ambitious album in the band's catalog thanks to the nearly twenty-five minute title track which is a retelling of Scherazade and 1001 Nights.  Each aspect of this epic flows into the other with grace and beauty that by the time the song ends it is difficult not to push the repeat button and go on the journey all over again.<br />But what is really amazing about the album is that the rest of the songs do not merely act as filler.  &quot;The Vultures Fly High&quot; prove that Renaissance could have moments of pop accessibility without sacrificing elements of the sound that brought them a devoted cult audience in the first place, while &quot;Ocean Gypsy&quot; remains the single finest and loveliest moment in their entire catalog.  If you are looking for a place to begin you Renaissance collection, &quot;Scheherzade&quot; and &quot;Turn of the Cards&quot; are the perfect place to begin.  Such a shame that the band headed into a slow, but steady decline afterwards.
B000000132|5.0|With &quot;Turn of the Cards,&quot; the Annie Haslam fronted version of Renaissance changed its approach a bit and as a result really hit its stride.<br />After a sound that was rooted in keyboards dominated &quot;Prologue,&quot; and &quot;Ashes are Burning,&quot; the band went with amore orchestral sound and their next two albums, &quot;Turn of the Cards,&quot; and &quot;Scherazade,&quot; excelled and became arguable the two greatest albums of the so called &quot;progressive rock&quot; movement.<br />Renaissance had always taken the genre in a more acoustic sounding direction than did better known acts such as Yes, or Emerson, Lake and Palmer, and this could be part of the reason they never achieved the same level of commercial success as those bands did.  But &quot;Turn of the Cards&quot; is a masterwork.  The orchestral touches only help to further fleshes out the strong melodic appeal of songs like &quot;Black Flame,&quot; or the stark, somber mood of &quot;Cold is Being,&quot; and they drive home the power on the nine minute closing epic &quot;Mother Russia&quot; a tribute to Soviet dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn.  Both stark and ornate, &quot;Turn of the Cards&quot; found Renaissance coming fully into its own, and 70's &quot;progressive rock&quot; never sounded so good.
B000006045|5.0|this cd is sooo dreamy. i love angel, and could M.A. get any better than with TEARDROPS. this is a MUST HAVE for lovebirds or if ya just want to relax
B000056K04|4.0|I must say, as a fervent DMB fan for the past five years or so, I was quite looking forward to their new album this past year. All the little reports that had been leaked out about it made it seem so quality, and then they decide to scrap the entire project and work with Glen Ballard, unfortunately. The songs on this album, I must say, do have great potential for live performances. &quot;I Did It,&quot; although one of the bigger letdowns on the album, could be quite good live, in fact. &quot;The Space Between&quot; conjures up the idea of &quot;Satellite&quot; and &quot;Lover Lay Down,&quot; two of the great Dave songs ever. &quot;So Right&quot; has perhaps the most potential of all the songs, with the typical Dave voice powering over the music itself, much like his live songs. This song is the real star on the album, along with &quot;Angel,&quot; and &quot;Fool To Think.&quot; &quot;Mother Father,&quot; and &quot;When the World Ends&quot; symbolize the true break from the atypical Dave recordings from UTTAD and Crash. The true infusion of the electric guitar along with the subtraction of the roles of Leroi on saxophone and Boyd on violin makes me wonder what Dave was thinking when he wrote these songs. Leroi and Boyd were such a successful part of what made Dave the greatest band on the planet, and now by subtracting that from the mix in such a great way can only mean bad things for the band. &quot;Everyday&quot; although a step in a different and not-altogether bad direction, does symbolize a change that not all new fans of DMB will enjoy. For true fans like myself, this album does have great potential. But for new fans, I would not recommend this being your first DMB purchase because the true power of the live aspect of these songs might not be as evident to you. For the true fan of DMB would realize how much potential these songs have for live shows, but others might now. Overall, I do have to give this album a positive rating because I do enjoy every song on the album, even &quot;I Did It.&quot; I just think about what could have been, with the older stuff for the new album, like &quot;Grey Street, Sweet Up and Down, Bartender, Diggin' a Ditch, #40, Grace is Gone, and Busted Stuff.&quot; That album could have been tremendous. I just hope that they continue to play those songs live in the future.
0345441184|5.0|This novel takes a look at the legend of Arthur and those around him from the eyes of the women in his life.  Anyone seriously interested in this legend would be incredibly foolish to pass up this novel.  It provides a new viewpoint that is remarkably different than all other tales I've read.  The characters are written so humanly, with human faults instead of as infallible legends.  As thick as this novel is, Mrs. Bradley's beautiful prose speeds the tale along without losing itself in overly ornate language.
B000056K04|5.0|When &quot;I Did It&quot; was released on Napster, I immediately went and grabbed a copy simply because it's Dave Matthews Band.  Dave Matthews Band: The band who has inspired many of my own songs, the band who has changed the way I listen to music; before them, I was really into bands like Blink 182...now I see the flaw in that.  Then I went out and bought the album because from what I had heard on Saturday Night Live, etc, it sounded pretty good.  I bought it and listened to it in the car on the way home, a little dissapointed with one aspect or another of each song.  Later the next day, I ripped the CD onto my computer so I could take it out on my mp3 player, and I've been listening for a couple of days now.  The more I listen, the more I like.  Since this is on the edge of being a rock/pop album, it's hard to find the musical genious in it, but it's definitely there.  Listed closer and you will find the same Dave Matthews Band as on such works of art as &quot;Before these Crowded Streets&quot; and &quot;Under The Table and Dreaming.&quot;  The only thing I miss is the jamming from the band.  But from what I hear, they improv in concert, so I'll be there to see them at Dodger Stadium!  <br />Buy this album and really listen to it.  As an artist myself, I have a belief that there is always inner beauty and genious in everything, so a listener should have to work a little to find the true meaning of the art.  I almost never write songs where there is a clear meaning, even with instrumental songs.  <br />Dave Matthews Band makes you work a little to find what this album is all about, so give them that satisfaction and just listen...
B0000560RV|5.0|This is great mood music. Beautiful, ethereal, glacial in a good way, evokes emotion without pandering. If Radiohead went New Age, lived in Iceland and made sure Thom Yorke didn't kill himself. This is it.
B000056K04|4.0|Now, I've read the 100+ reviews of this album, and it is clear that you either love it, or you hate it.  And I will tell you my opinion, I really like it.  I've been a hard core DMB fan for a long time, and have really grown to love the unique and incomparable music Dave and the boys have made.  This album is really great with the best lyrics and arrangements I've seen on any Dave studio album.  I implore all of you hard core DMB fans out there who dismissed this album after just one listening, to give it a chance.  Stop whining so much just because Dave is exploring and experimenting with his music.  Just because it is different, doesn't neccessarily mean it's bad!  Sure I was a little dissappointed when I never heard Boyd's violin, (hence the 4 stars, rather than 5),but I didn't throw the cd away just because of that.
B0000042H4|5.0|I don't pretend to be able to rate this Ring against others, since I haven't heard all of them.  Further, I don't need to criticize others in order to reassure anyone contemplating purchasing the Solti Ring that it is well worth the price.<br />The most interesting aspect of the debate about which Ring is best (if there's a right answer to such a subjective question) is that everyone who promotes another recording for that title always compares it to this.  &quot;Here's why I think Karajan, Bohm, Furtwanger, Clemens, etc. is better than Solti.&quot;  The fact is that the Solti recording is always the benchmark that even those who prefer other recordings find themselves using.<br />Gramaphone Magazine still rates the Solti recording ahead of all others and Wagner critic William Berger (See his Wagner Withour Fear) notes that it remains the standard choice.
0345440757|3.0|Tracy does have a more conversational tone in this book than what you might find in other baby advice books.  My experience with most of these books suggests that they make good sources and references and all clearly are generic in tone.  If you are looking for insight and advice, clearly this will be one among many books you already have by now.  A book can only go so far in preparing one for parenthood, especially when it comes to &quot;connecting&quot; with your baby.  <br />I think the book publicist(s) may have miscalculated on the marketing of this product.  Tracy and her views in print and on TV come off as patronizing-one reason for the slew of negative comments on her personally by many readers.  It seems like a lot of people are not taking too kindly any suggestions by the book people that Tracy will help us poor people figure out our kids-if we only read this book.  Some american readers may also get irked by her continuous negative references to how &quot;you yankees&quot; do it or when she belittles some practice as an &quot;american invention&quot;.   Tracy and her co-writer fail to put in an appendix of sourcing on things like where to get some items she recommends (e.g. haberman feeding system).  Lastly, I found some of her discussions a bit confusing with regard to the age of the baby.  It would be of help if later editions put in some indications in the tips with regard to age brackets.
B000056K04|4.0|It's unfortunate that so many music fans are so reluctant to experiment with the artists they claim to adore.  I applaud DMB for experimenting with a new sound.  Why does everyone want the new album to be a clone of Under the Table and Dreaming or Crash? I think this new album is excellent, if you are willing to go into it wanting a new sound and not hoping for new words to old music.  To those fans complaining about Everyday, I say get over it and learn to explore new music.
B0000057C5|5.0|If you're into metal or hard rock, buy it, you'll love it.  If you're not into either music genre, be open-minded and buy it anyway.  This album borders on perfect -- Rammstein plays tight, has outstanding rythym guitars (little lead guitars), super keyboards that complement the bass and drum work (the drummer is excellent), and the singer has a unique, commanding voice.  Don't worry if you don't speak German -- it's the music that makes this album incredible.  Who cares what they're saying?  These guys jam and kick tail.  Their first album, Herzeleid, is just as good and also worth buying.
0767817486|5.0|I have seen this move about 6 times, and it always leaves me thinking for several hours. As a film maker, I understand the need to avoid political troubles by pointing fingers directly, so dramatization becomes more of a tool to vividly depict the true beneath. Although I understand some of the reviews who, somehow, felt offended by &quot;Hollywood&quot; style of presenting the information, it is important to remain impartial. No body likes other people to judge our country, our customs, our problems, nonetheless, they do not become any less embarrassing. The film depicts real aspects of a Turkey prision. There is no sense of mercy simply because criminals are not judged by the prison staff but rather the actual judges. The guards just have to &quot;live&quot; with the traditional barbarian customs because that is the way it has always been. Picture and music adds a brillant element of remorse, nostalgy and hopelessness in all the appropriate moments. I think this is one of the best films I have seen.
B000053GTF|1.0|I anxiously awaited this release, but found it disappointing.  Her voice is outstanding.  There's just no disputing her talent as a musical performer.  Unfortunately, her music videos are, well, very very lame.<br />This DVD really lacks the emotion of her 1995 Colour of My Love Concert DVD.<br />If you're only going to buy one Celine Dion DVD, make it the live concert -- not this collection.
B000002C25|4.0|This is a good album, although certainly not up to the band's masterpiece, Morning Glory.  There are plenty of memorable tunes on here and big fans will find plenty to their liking.  Unfortunately, the same can be said for some of the lesser material.  Just about everyone will find at least a few tracks they don't like, as well.  The hit singles are all fine musician craftsmanship.  &quot;D'you Know What I Mean?&quot;, though seven minutes long, is good enough to make is seem like it flows straight through in four.  &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and &quot;Don't Go Away&quot; are the ballads, both beautiful and the latter almost stands up to &quot;Don't Look Back In Anger&quot; on their prior album.  The epic &quot;All Around the World&quot; does drag on for a few minutes too long, but I do appreciate the vocals and the overall build-up quality.  Bands just don't use that kind of instrumentation anymore.  Not to any commendable degree, anyway.  Couple these great tunes with some really great, straight-forward rock tunes, &quot;My Big Mouth&quot; and &quot;I Hope I Think I Know&quot; (these songs have been slammed a lot in past reviews, which I don't understand because I think they're awesome!) and you've got something resembling a decent album.  The title track is also a good tune, although being thrown between two of the band's best singles it often gets overlooked.  And the reprise at the end would have sounded a lot more refreshing if &quot;All Around the World&quot; had appeared much closer to the beginning of the CD.  Be Here Now may not be a masterpiece, but sometimes you just have to take something for what it is.  Personally, I think the good material far outweighs the bad and if you really have to you can just program your player to skip over the few misteps.  Recommended.
B00003CXPC|5.0|Billy Elliot is an amazing movie about a boy growing during the 1984 coal miner strike.  He has a special talent for dancing, but is struggling to participate in dance classes because his family is opposed to it, calling it &quot;for poofs&quot;.  Eventually his dance instructor convinces Billy's father to let him audition for the Royal Ballet School.  This is a feel good film, but lacks the cheesiness of most feel good films.  The title character is played by Jamie Bell, who was selected in a search of over 2,000 other boys.  He won a BAFTA for Best Actor for his performance in Billy Elliot.  Julie Walters, who plays Billy's dance teacher, won a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress.  I strongly recomend this movie to everyone, although there is some language which may be inappropriate for children.
B000056K04|1.0|I have listned to the Dave Matthews band Since there first Independant release Remember Two Things.  In this album I can not find the band that played on those first albums.  The only thing resembling the band is the beginning od when the world ends and everyday, but have no fear the band manages to screw those up not more than 15 seconds in.  I did it, is a joke, the music coupled with the video now in heavy rotation on MTV sadly enough makes the band ,perhaps on of the most talented in the 90's, look no better than the backstreet boys.  What's next pyrotechnics, and dancers on stage at concerts.  I will simply file this album under the horrible mistake category, and hope there next realease will be better.  If this is the first Dave album you bought, They were good at one point, don't let this top 40 sell out material get you down there will be another album.
1573221562|4.0|Affinity is no Tipping the Velvet (TTV), which is brilliant.  Since I read TTV first, perhaps I was expecting the same depth of character development, descriptions of Victorian enviornment &amp; culture.  I raced through TTV and was hungry for more.  Not that these aspects weren't developed in Affinity, but the scope was much smaller.  Perhaps it needed to be to create the macabre feel of a supernatural tale of deception? This choice by the author perhaps dragged the book's pace down.  I didn't feel as much for the characters or their plight as I did in TTV.  For me Affinity was Margret/Aurora's story.  Her fragility (and whining) made me crazy most of the book but what a great/sad character.  Selina was hard to know. Perhaps the distance was necessary for a charater who proved to be so deceptive.  I didn't care about/know well/interested in many of the lesser characters either (just the opposite in TTV).  Often the plot dragged for me and I found myself skimming sections, saying &quot;I guess this is a 'scary' part.&quot;  Some sections seemed overdone/drawnout; not as engaging as I felt the author was attempting to make them.  I kept waiting for something suspenseful and thouroghly engaging.  The last two chapters provided that: a good, ending to a good book.  It was somewhat worth the trip but the destination was much better than the journey. Affinity is a good read, just not great (like TTV). <br />With all that said, Ms. Waters is still an important writer.  She writes about the lives of women from such a place of honesty with a keen perception of herstory and awareness of the Victorian socialization of women.  Affinity did attempt to show the pain of the characters' confining social roles (women in prison (imprisoned) as reality and methaphor) &amp; how life beat down their bodies and spirits, in some cases to oblivian. Ms. Water's: please keep writing about lesbian women's lives.  I did like the way the women who were lesbian (married and not) where drawn: the author not hiding their sexuality but having it be an aspect of their character like other aspects of their character.  Ms. Water's doesn't make anyone's sexuality out to be the end of their experiences or actions.  She also doesn't ignore the social &amp; cultural forces that impacted lesbian women and all women for that matter.  It's so important to have this reality represented in such a sophisticated &amp; truthful way.  Bravo.
630027179X|4.0|First , I love this movie. The locations, costumes and production values are first - rate. It does a good  job of &quot;telescoping&quot; events which take decades to explore in Mort D'Arthur. The armor,though fanciful , has a heaviness to it  and a great design, and looks well as Knights fight, eat , swim and make love(!) in it. Some of the performances , are first rate- though marred by overdubbing. Nicol Williamson and Patrick Stewart are standouts- although I'm not sure whether I liked Stewart because of his perfomance or just because he's Patrick Stewart. I think the battle of Camlann is particularly good , as well  Percival's encounter with Morgana and Mordred. Now  to some not-so -good  things in this movie. First the music is incredibly overblown- the suddenly swelling music in scenes of passion almost seemed comic , as if the score was mocking the characters. I think the filmakers would have been better served with an original score rather than classical music.  Unless carefully chosen( Woody Allen has a good knack for this) Classical music in movies tends to battle with the visuals rather than support it- the classical music composed to stand on it's own and fill in  it's own emotional blanks.  However the&quot;Carmina Burana&quot; is right on and rousing. There are also several not-so -special effects, including the Lady of the Lake and Merlin's imprisonment in the diamond Some of the perfomances are dreadful. Liam Neeson, so great in other movies, is the gooniest Gawaine imaginable- grunting dumbly and looking like he took one too many hits in the head on the tourney field-this coupled with his ignominious death-strapped  mostly naked to a horse during the Grail Quest is a sad showing for one of Arthur's most noble Knights. There is a lot of needless bellowing throughout the movie- as if the actors are trying to come to terms with the out-size legends they are involved in. And Guinevere , though beautiful, seems lost in her doe-eyed  acting.<br />And yetwith all this, it is a stunning movie. Arthur and Mordred battling in front of a blood-red sun, young Arthur pulling the Sword from the Stone , Arthur and Guinevere's marriage, Merlin's defeat of Morgana, Percival's escape from the tree-the air of magic and destiny throughout the story. This film  brought the legends to life for me.<br />For some other stand out Knight and fantasy movies- see Conan the Barbarian, The Knights of the Round Table(for a very different version of Mort D'Arthur), El Cid( the best trial by combat ever put to film) ,and two versions of Ivanhoe(Robert Taylor on the 50's and Anthony Andrews in the 80's)
0380778556|5.0|I have seen this film numerous times and listened to the book on tape.  I love being swept away to a mansion on the side of a rocky sea side cliff.  I loved imagining waking up in the morning and having nothing to do but stroll the grounds and choose menues for the day's meals.<br />A scene that strikes a cord with me is when the girl tells Maxim how she is alone in the world.  Her parents are dead and she has no siblings.  Before I got to that part of the story I wondered just how two people could come together so magnetically then I understood.  They were both alone in the world and really did need each other.<br />Had the story taken place in modern day times the heroine would have been advised to &quot;get a job.&quot;  Through the story we witness this girl's growth from a young girl into a women.  I agree with the other people who say the ending seems a bit forced and really leaves you wanting more.  For one thing since they are so rich why don't they just build a new home instead of wandering from hotel to hotel?  It makes no sense.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Yeah, it took forever to get this thing out after the colossally-successful BIA, but, still, this is one great album.  Why did it tank so bad sales-wise?  Got me.  I just like the music.  Bluesy, rootsy, dark, steely, a little sinister actually.  Love it.  Remastered adds slight improvement in depth and resolution but you'd need a good hi-fi system to tell.  When's the next album coming out?  Anyone there?
0385121679|5.0|The Shining, in my opinion, is Stephen King's best novel.  Don't decide to not read the book because you've seen the movie.  The book is much better.  It's not just better, it's almost a different story.  The movie gives the impression that Jack Torrance is psychotic from the beginning; Stephen King's novel is about a loving father - excepting one incident - that turns psychotic throughout the story.  If you enjoy stories that make you leave on a light in your room at night, The Shining is a must-read.
0812589041|5.0|Ender's Game is a full 5. Infact i would give it a 10000000000 if i could! Ender's Game is about a boy named Ender Wiggin who gets taken to Battle School to train to become the commander of earth's fighting spaceship fleet to fight the buggers. He Later gets sent to Command school. In command school Ender gets taught by Mazor Rackhem the  guy who won the first bugger wars. This book is wonderful in the catagories of Sci - fi and Fantasy! You should definentally read this book. Another thing is this book has a parallel and 3 sequels to it. They are also great books!
B000002AH7|3.0|Although this is a nice album, I can't understand the reason for so much hype around it. All other Gil Evans/Miles Davis collaborations are by far more interesting than this proto-classical experience. All in all there not so much more in it than the original &quot;Concierto&quot;.
0345440757|5.0|Wow, what a book!! I am a 'New Breed' Health Visitor here in the UK in Cornwall. I have been nursing for 22 years, but did my Health Visiting degree 3 years ago after the birth of my two children as I felt mums were being given mixed messages from health professionals and I felt I had little support and no guidance entering into the world of 'babydom' I read your articles in the Mail on Sunday and immediately ordered your book. It arrived two days ago and I have hardly put it down! What is so amazing is it reflects exactly the sort of Health Visitor I am and advocates the parenting skills I do to my clients. Well done Tracy, your book is the most inspirational I have read in my whole career and I wish you every sucess Yours sincerely Georgina Swallow BSc RHV RGN
014100018X|5.0|I read this book based on a recommendation from a good friend.  The girl has good taste in books.  It was a wonderfully relaxing read all the while being full of interesting twists and turns. (how can I love it when the priest is not a priest but a mayor?!  That just changes everything...)<BR> I love the dichotomy between the &quot;witch&quot; (she'll never admit to it) and the priest (he'll never admit to anything) at Lent, no less.  It just doesn't get any better than this.  <BR>Harris's style of switching between the two points of view and how it reveals certain bits and pieces at certain times creates wonderful pacing for the novel.<BR> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something to read that is both enjoyably relaxing (and not taxing on the brain) and still has a wonderful plot full of interesting twists and turns and tidbits.
B000056K04|5.0|While the song that is supposed draw people to this album (I Did it!) is a little disappointing (it's growing on me), I find this album hypnotic and addictive. Starting with &quot;When the World Ends&quot; with its shapely musical passages and continuing all the way to the upbeat &quot;Everyday&quot;, this album has a lot new and different aspects which I feel other DMB albums had lacked (especially &quot;Before these Crowded Streets&quot;). I am a fan from 1993 and a lot of what got me excited about DMB back then is present in this album. While held in check, I think Boyd Tinsley and Leroi Moore were used extremely effectively.<br />This album is fresh and very satisfying. I was a little skeptical about it - hearing the song on the radio, but I think it would make an excellent addition to anyone's music collection.
B00004W3MS|5.0|...I lie alone 20 meters under the oceansurface and hold on to projecting corales. The ocean seems lifeless but suddenly a enormous creature float over me, a ray.  The sun castes it`s beams through the water and shines in it`s ventral while it swimms around looking at me. Suddenly the curiosity takes over, and the huge creature flies over my hiding-place without sign to change course, I look right into the planktoneating throat. It swims over my head and suddely everything gets dark. Only the rays graywhite surface is barely visible. As a carpet it lies over me and I get filled of the feeling that it want to protect me from all the malice in the world.  I can glimpse the sun again behind the rays tail. My luck is complete...<br />...It`s been a long time, a very long time since I have heard suck a soulful record as this. So longing but still infinite beautiful. This is the voice of the blue ocean, in their music Sigur Ros portrayers beautiful og dramatic submarine landscape. On   you swim under the icecold polarice while the seals sings their wistful song and on Svefn-G-Englar you are in caribien ocean, swimming with dolphins and corales. The Vocalist sings on a mix of Icelandic and his own fantasylanguage who he calls Hopelandic. And thats just waht Agaetis Byrjun is, filled of hope, longing and a sober beautiful optimism.
B00003CWNR|3.0|There is much to like about this film, a fine score, terrific cinematography, and a warm, humane sense of forgiveness at its core... but ultimately, it falls short due to the mismatched pair of actors at the center of the film--sorry, I am pretty good at leaving cynicism at the door for movies (loved The Natural, for instance, despite its flaws)but I could not buy Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron's characters together... ultimately, this pairing prevented me from accepting this world that was offered, otherwise I'd raise it to 4 stars
B00004STPT|4.0|After seeing the film I heard about Hans Zimmer and I listened to clips from the score,to buy it. I thought it sounded pretty well,but in fact,I`d expected a better soundtrack for a movie like Gladiator. The two first tracks are very bitter and not so good,but fortunatley very short. Then they burst into the climatic &quot;The Battle&quot;,which is one of the best tracks on the CD,as it features the infamous battle theme and many other themes. It is a long track too,about ten minutes,so that`s a 5-star rate track. The following tracks are filled with solo vocals,which I don`t like very much,although the fit good in the film. &quot;Patricide&quot; is excellent and very well-scored. I also like &quot;The Might of Rome&quot; with the action music that gives me the picture of a prehistoric landscape and the mighty choral works at the end. If you want a mixed track,then Barbarian Horde is perfect,as it begins with the gladiator theme and then goes into a mighty action music that ends with the battle theme as he wins. And the following track is so sad that I sometimes want to cry when I listen to it. The disc ends with three tracks that repeats the mighty main theme with female vocals,that sings a song in gaellic I think. So,it is a good score but it could have been a little bit better (fortunatley,there has come a new CD with music from this movie,so I will buy that and hear how it sounds...)
B00003CWPR|2.0|I won't attempt to add much to the conversation, other than to say than to say that I admire Kubrick, but don't admire anything about this film... the scenes with the masks, the dialog when cruise is asked to remove his clothes, is only one example of how poor this thing really is, and if it wasn't a Kubrick film I would have stopped watching right there....save your money
0425170349|5.0|This book is one of Clancy's best by far. Very descriptive and entertaining as well. The book read fast considering the size. I found myself not being able to put it down. Clancy didnt over do himself with too much dialogue, but i did find myself wanting to read about more missions. Clancy kept the book exciting, Intriguing and to the point, plus explaining important topics about mission essentials was detailed and not over done. If you're not familiar with this type of job, Clancy makes it very understandable. I too would like to see a movie about special operations, like some of the reviewers have mentioned.      Tom Clancy is the only person that i would vote for to help with a real-world special ops type of film.
B00001SIES|5.0|If you like Thom Yorke of Radiohead, you'll like the lead singer of Muse.  My husband introduced me to Muse not long ago, and I fell in love with them almost instantly.  The songs are creative and musically sound, very well-written and mostly upbeat with a driving undertone.  The vox are a Yorke-style wail (without being in the least copycat-ish) while at the same time rich and subtlely complex.  Listen closely and you'll notice a truly individual vibe from Muse; I can't wait to hear more from them.
6305180261|5.0|Every single Guns N'Roses fan should get this one. It has videos from their early days of their debut album &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; all the way up to their album &quot;The Spaghetti Incident&quot;. You can also see their trilogy of videos which include videos such as &quot;Don't cry&quot;, &quot;November Rain&quot; and the epic track &quot;Estranged&quot; and a few rare videos that were barely shown on TV. And for last, here is another reason to get this video: because they are Guns F%ckin N'Roses!!!
B000002BPS|5.0|This album has to be the best Offspring album ever. Even though Smash is good, Ixnay On The Hombre is the best. It's got songs that when I feel down, they cheer me right up,man. The five songs I think that are the best on this album is The Meaning Of Life, All I Want, Way Down The Line, and Gone Away. I highly recommended this to anybody who wants to listen to The Offspring for the first time.
B00005214X|5.0|An album that many of us have eagerly awaited, this wonderful reissue of George Harrison's &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. Right off the bat I have to say how great the remastered version of this album sounds. The chief complaint about the original CD was that it was burdened with excessive tape hiss and sounded flat. The reissue sounds amazingly vibrant and alive. The packaging is cool also with the set coming in a small box that opens like the original vinyl LP set, and the CD's come in individual slipcases. The booklet that's enclosed features all of the song lyrics prints, as well as photos that were used for the poster that came with the original album and the &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; picture sleeve. The newly colorized cover might not please all fans but it definitely shows George's subtle sense of humor is very much intact. Aside from all of that, there is the music... Great songs like &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, &quot;What Is Life&quot;, &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; and &quot;If Not For You&quot; is what truly makes this an unforgettable album. There is a new version of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and previously unreleased songs like &quot;I Live For You&quot;, and &quot;Let It Down&quot; which are nice bonuses.  Supported by an all star cast of fellow musicians including Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Klaus Voorman, Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Bobby Whitlock, Dave Mason, Alan White, Bobby Keys, and Badfinger(whew!!!). Hearing this new reissue was like hearing it for the first time all over again. Truly a rewarding experience.
B000056K04|5.0|While I concur with some other reviewers that this album does not have the jams that past albums have, it more than makes up for this in the power of the lyrics. The ability to capture the complex emotions of relationships (both with families and with lovers) is sorely lacking in today's music and DMB has proven themselves again in this arena.<br />And for those who feel that a change of direction is a bad thing I challenge you to listen to &quot;October&quot;, &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind&quot; and tell me that one is better than the other.
B000000XCH|5.0|Being a professional musician I have many influences. However, no one more so that John Fogerty. Being in the most overlooked band of the late sixties, John is now being &quot;rediscovered&quot; and no better place to start than with his CCR days!  There are very few albums/cds that I can listen to from beginning to end and this is one of them. Not a filler to be found. From start to finish, John shows you why he has been around so long.  Under the shadows of the sixties more prolific guitarists: Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and Songwriters: Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, John Fogerty is usually forgotten. However, after listening to his work on &quot;Ramble Tamble,&quot; and &quot;Who'll Stop the Rain,&quot; and pre-Clapton &quot;Before You Accuse Me,&quot; you will not doubt that CCR was the best American band of the sixties!
B000058983|3.0|I know this album is praised far &amp; wide, but I personally found it a difficult &amp; not too rewarding listen. I've always loved &quot;Alone Again Or&quot;, a magnificent single by any standards, and its flip side, &quot;A House is not a motel&quot; is a compelling track as well. But the rest of this CD just doesn't cut it for me. Maybe I was expecting more music like those first two tracks. I just found most of the rest of it too oblique and weird. A couple of the bonus tracks are interesting, such as &quot;Wonder People&quot;, but I don't know why they claim the extra version of &quot;Alone Again Or&quot; as the single version, which it is not. I have the original single and this is not it. Perhaps it is the promotional 45 version. It is also referred to as an &quot;alternate mix&quot;. So much confusion. Much like this album. There is absolutely no mention of Arthur Lee's incarceration, or the fact that this project did not receive his endorsement. Maybe if the Rhino people were less inclined to pat themselves on the back for issuing this &amp; more inclined to give us the facts, we would all be better off.
0345440757|5.0|your book is AMAZING! as tired as i am after a day with my 3 month old and my  two year old, i just had to read your book, its a wonderful book with great  insights! i really love it!  i've recommended it to a few mums and mums to be.  thanks, Millie
B000056K04|5.0|This album is faaaaabulous. It took about 12 listenings to finally get the feel of it the new sounds, but it was well worth it. Contrary to many comments, I think there are many &quot;hooks&quot; on this release that can lodge in your head for days. I think the highlights are the following: &quot;When the World Ends&quot; is one of the catchiest tunes. It's a sexy little number has an unforgettable R&amp;B backbeat between the choruses (Stefan's bass is very prominent and awe-inspiring on every song). The imagery is riveting and the sheer fun of hearing the whole band go &quot;Your legs don't work cuz you want me so, you just lie spread to the wall...&quot; is worth the album price alone. Additionally, Dave's voice, which is smooth and has amazing range on every track, seems to morph into those of other distinctive singers throughout the album, and in this tune, at times his voice sounds a lot like the appealing drawl of Soul Coughing's M. Doughty. &quot;The Space Between&quot; is a classic and catchy love song that will probably appeal to people of all ages. Some of the lyrics are truly beautiful, like &quot;The space between your heart and mine is the space we fill with time.&quot; &quot;Dreams of Our Fathers&quot; has a great opening riff, kind of power-rock Def Leopard (in a good way), driving, intelligent, rythmic lyrics a melodic chorus. In the middle at the &quot;Rain on me&quot; part, it seems as though Dave somehow channeled Eddie Vedder with all the awesome angst-ridden glory comparable to Pearl Jam's &quot;Black.&quot; &quot;What you Are&quot; will surely please fans of &quot;The Last Stop&quot; and possibly &quot;Don't Drink the Water&quot; from BTCS. It's an epic and intense song with a middle eastern flair and a charged, gristly, occasionally erotic, chorus. &quot;Sleep to Dream Her&quot; is phenomenal and quite different from the other songs (they are all distinct, but this one especially so). The turns of phrase (&quot;I know I'll miss her later. Wish I could bend my love to hate her. Wish I could be her creator. To twist her arms now&quot;)are not only clever, but they rhyme and are puntuated by Dave's tinny plucking of the electic guitar and Carter's interesting drumming pattern. The chorus on this song affords more instrumental meandering of LeRoi's gorgeous sax and Boyd's haunting violin. The whole song has an intriguing and vaguely evil-lullaby feel to it. &quot;Everyday&quot; is the old-school DMB song on this album. The acoustic guitar returns and the has an irrisistable beat and gospel influence that creates the happy feet, throw your hands up in the air and rejoice feel like &quot;The Best of What's Around.&quot; I think it will be an incredible, tears-of-joy-jerking show closer and the song you're most likely to catch yourself singing in the shower.
B00000G3PA|4.0|I debated how many stars to give this movie.  Reading back through the other reviews, the consensus seemed to be  3 stars or less.  Because I liked it more than the other reviewers did, I am giving it four stars.<br />This movie reminded me of &quot;Deep Impact&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot;.  I mean, they even called one of the shuttles Independence didn't they?  However, I have to say that I truly enjoyed this movie.  I even might have cried at the end a little (so sue me).  I won't go into specifics of the movie, because, really, all you need to know is, a meteor is crashing to Earth, and will or won't they save it.  Of course, it's predictable, how else could it be?<br />I liked the fact that the movie didn't completely bore you right from the beginning.  It started our fast and remained fast.  Usually.  At times it was slow.  It is, after all, a long movie.  I don't know that I could have sat through it in the movie theater, but that's what is great about renting in your home.  I liked the interaction between the characters, and I enjoyed Bruce Willis' performance, as well as Ben Affleck.  Predictable as well, but I didn't go in expecting an Oscar worthy film.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I would see it again.  However, I think that $25 is a little steep for a DVD, particularly this one.  Because I had a rented version of the movie, it didn't have any extras except the trailer and Aerosmith video (*yawn*).<br />If you are expecting something deep and meaningful, this is not the movie for you.  Otherwise, you might enjoy it.
0345440757|1.0|I saw that Dateline story and I was INTRIGED to say the least.  I have a baby who sleeps with us and was looking for a nice easy way to change that, I thought that her book would be the best way to do that. I RAN out and bought the book,... read until about page 100 and through the book down and haven't picked it up since.  I'm a breastfeeding peer counseler and so much of what she says is wrong and even harmful to breastfeeding. I'm even bringing it up with the local breastfeeding task force.  Now I have a book that I wouldn't even give away. I wish I could of given this a negitive star review.
B00005214X|5.0|I remember when I purchased this album when it was first released and the impact it had back then. I have just purchased this new release and it is as I stated too beautiful to ignore. It will rock you and also move you to tears. This is an album that is a must for all music lovers. Spoil yourself and purchase this cd as it is timeless.
B000056K04|4.0|Kudos to Dave Matthews for following his creative instinct and not making another album intended to be just like the ones before Folks, this is a risky move- but instead of staying with the status quo (which is what selling out really is) Dave wanted to play (gasp) an electric guitar- I hope people are aware that electric and acoustic guitars are still guitars- they just have different tonal characteristics and feel.  As a guitar player I can tell you how refreshing it is to have a change of pace to get you back to writing, playing, and being creative.  You have to respect the fact that a musician needs this to keep going to make music that they are pleased with- not just to provide a product that is what the fans dictate.  Would you have been happier with Tripping Billies- part 2?  Dave's other music was great, no doubt about it- but understand that musicians are heavily influenced by the &quot;been there, done that&quot; disease.  Did you ever think that Dave Matthews may even listen to hard rock on occasion- he may even sit down and crank out a Metallica riff (as a guitarist I can tell you that this is common- one day you play acoustic, the other you think you are Eddie Van Halen)- The moral- don't put DMB in a box and not accept anything diffent than the past- Last, I think this album has some killer &quot;grooves&quot; where the band is more cohesive and playing the same &quot;song&quot;- not all doing their own thing.  Focus on the music and the songs and don't dissect the production, instruments used, etc..
B000056K04|4.0|I took off today so that I could give a really good listen to the latest Dave Matthew's Band CD.   <br />It reminds me of the first listen I gave to the Beatles &quot;White Album&quot; in that  I had to listen to it several times before I could appreciate the genius of  the album. <br />My first reaction was that there was too much chord repetition.  Also, I  don't think I have ever heard Dave's voice double-tracked while he was  singing.  Not a bad thing, just different.  It also seemed to me that the  violin &amp; sax solos were somewhat deliberate &amp; gratuitous and not as  spontaneous as in the past. <br />OK, so what's the bottom line?  The bottom line is that so many artists get  caught up in a rut and forget that change and evolution is good.  A good  example is Bob Dylan.  He began his career as a folk singer with just an  acoustic guitar and a harmonica.  When he came on stage at the Monterrey Pop  Festival in 1965, he sported an ELECTRIC GUITAR and A BAND!  He was  practically booed off the stage.  He went on to sing &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot;  which was to be his best-known song.  This is so reminiscent of the latest  DMB CD.  Once you accept the fact that Dave is moving on to another level of  musical technique, then everything becomes crystal clear. <br />As good as this CD is, it falls just short of the 5-Star rating, coming in with 4 1/2 stars.<br />So to all of you DMB fans out there:  please join me in celebrating a fresh,  new sound that will undoubtedly serve to attract more fans into the DMB fold!
158234082X|5.0|Just when you thought it was safe to go to a restaurant! Compelling reading, I could not put it down. Totally absorbing, characters that leap out at you.  I will never eat kingfish again, nor fish in New York on a Monday. Not for the squeamish, but it has the ring of reality.
B000056K04|5.0|Fans who liked the Beatle's &quot;I want to hold your hand&quot; probably didn't like &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot; Following this edict, the new DMB album is a remarkable achievement. From the opening track, &quot;I did it,&quot; down to the last heart pounding seconds of the last song, the album reeks of pure originality and, more important, growth; a fact that too often drips over the side of cupped hands. Thank God for giving Dave Mathews the vision to rise above the expectations of his fans and in the process raising our taste levels too. On Everyday, you can hear DM's influences much clearer. The sound is more refined. There is no &quot;What would you say&quot; on this album, which is a blessing since that song ... With Everyday, the DMB has successfully distanced itself from the ..., shoot-pool-and-drink-beer crowd and have pleasantly intruded into the intelligent, Leonard Cohen, Cultural Mainstay crowd. Congratulations.
0446677450|5.0|Very inspirational and entertaining to read.  I was able to apply some of the ideas mentioned in the book to increase my wealth.  However beware:  This book will entice you to purchase more of Robert's books, games, and view his web site.  This is not a bad thing, just a word of caution. Suggestion: Try out the ideas in this book before purchasing additional material.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the best album I've picked up in a long long time. It's rare to find a cd where every single song rocks. I can listen to their songs over and over. Intense sound, good melodies, and a better mix of rock/rap fusion than stuff that's out there now. as a bonus, the lyrics aren't pointless. I love Linkin Park! You can get your angst out by listening to this band. Can't wait for their next release!
B000056K04|3.0|Let's just get one thing straight, this isn't a BAD album. It doesn't compare to any of Dave's previous work but you could do much worse this year.  I forced myself to listen to my CD for two days in a row.  I tried hard to make it grow on me, just like Before these Crowed Streets did.  I have found a couple songs that I really like, namely, Dreams of our fathers, Everyday and Angel isn't too bad.  I just hope these songs are better live, and Dave stops repeating the hook and lets Leroi and Boyd do there thing.  Well, until I get to see them live, when's that new Springsteen CD coming out? There's no way Ballad could screw that one up.
B0000009SI|5.0|This is great stuff, even all these years later.  Excellent band and songs.  During this era, Frank was doing some jazzy arangements but there's still alot of rock influence here too.  The recording is a little on the dull side, which means you have to crank it up a bit to get the detail.  See if you can find the secret message.  Yellow Snow was a pretty big hit for the band but to me, Stink Foot, Cosmik Debris and Apostrophe' were the best part of the record, the crux of the biscuit!
B000002J1C|5.0|This is typically considered to be the first great Yes album, and great it is. Besides being a classic of the progressive genre, it's also a blueprint for building complex, ambitious rock compositions while never losing sight of listenability and &quot;the hook&quot;. In between the graceful solos of Steve Howe and the acrobatic bass of Chris Squire, one has to savor the folky, evocative melodies sung by the ever-incomprehensible Jon Anderson. (Why is it spelled &quot;John&quot; in the liner notes?). The three long tracks here really stand out - rocking concert standard 'Yours is No Disgrace', adventurous epic 'Starship Trooper', and the closing classic 'Perpetual Change'. Howe's guitar piece 'Clap' is jaw-dropping and 'I've Seen All Good People' remains a popular radio track. For those new to Yes or to prog in general, this is not a bad introduction at all.
1878424319|1.0|I was disappointed by the shallowness of The Four Agreements.  The book reads a little like a study guide to deeper truths, and seems rehashed to appeal to the simpler audience.  Although there are kernels of truth in this book, I was left with a &quot;where's the beef&quot; feeling!
B000002IKR|4.0|Testament's debut album betrays a strong Metallica influence, with the result that parts of it sound pretty generic. But even the least impressive sections are still solid thrash, and when it gets seriously heavy ('Over the Wall', 'Burnt Offerings', 'Curse of the Legions of Death') it stands with the best of furious speed metal. I would note that the production is not quite as good as it could be; some parts seem excessively muddy. But most of the time it's clear enough to discern the fast and precise guitar playing and even the occasional catchy hook. Fans of 80s thrash metal should enjoy this one.
B00003IPFK|5.0|this movie,or mini-series,is one of the best i have ever experienced.once you have seen this,it becomes a part of you.the actors,the script,direction,settings,characters,all just amazing..i was skeptical at first..for i do not usually like westerns,but this is not just a western.it deals with relationships,life factors,romance,and death.robert duvall,tommy lee jones and the rest of the brilliant casting is the best casting job i have ever seen..i can not recommend this movie any more than i do now..it is a long one,but well worth it...even the smaller part actors are such an additional masterpeiece to this movie..just wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!
0684800713|5.0|This, friends, was the single book that so fatefully launched Ernest Hemingway's amazing and long-lived literary career. As such it is as close to being a legendary book as they come, yet some seventy five years after its initial publication, it still offers a story that is also surprisingly fresh, personal, and memorable. For all of his obvious excesses, Hemingway was an artist compelled to delve deliberately into painful truths, and he attempted to do so with a style of writing that cut away all of the frills and artifice, so that at it s heart this novel is meant as a exploration into what it means to be adult and alive. Thus we are introduced to Jake Barnes, a veteran of World War One, now forced by his wounds to live as a man without the ability to act like one, forced by impotence to forgo all of life's usual intimacies, and all of its associated life connections for which he so yearns. At the same time, Jake attempts to live a life of meaning and purpose, one crammed full with activity, work, and friendships. Yet it is within this network of friendships and connections that he must confront his painful circumstances.<br /><br />Enter his true love, the feckless Lady Ashley, and indeed the plot thickens, for we soon see how Jake's physical affliction has painfully affected several others. Ashley loves him, but needs a virile man who can give her the physical love she needs. While Ashley is a woman of uncommon beauty, she is also virtuous enough in her won way to want the one man she truly loves to be her lover. Like all of us, she wants most that which she can never have, and so she returns to the source of her own dilemma time after time to Jake, her emotional match, the one man who cannot give her the mature emotional love she craves. So they are condemned to circle around each other, even while some of their friends and other members of the in-crowd interfere, compete, and seek Ashley's affections around the edges of the continuing affair.<br />What we are left with is a modern tragedy, one in which the characters must somehow resolve the irresolvable.<br /><br />Yet for all this emotional turmoil and existential `sturm-und-drang' of the so-called &#34;lost generation&#34;, people drowning in the moral anomie and circumstantial wasteland created in the gutters of their own endless wants and needs, it is most often Hemingway's imaginative and spare use of the language itself that wins the reader over. Unlike his predecessors, he sought a lean narrative style that cut away at all the flowery description and endless adjectives. In the process of parsing away the excesses, Hemingway created a clear, simple and quite declarative prose style that was truly both modern and revolutionary. What one encounters as a result is a story seemingly stripped to its barest essentials, superficially more like the newspaper man's pantheon of who, what, where, when, and why, and yet somehow transformed into a much more accurate and imaginative effort, one leaving the reader with a much more artful account of what is going on. One reads Hemingway quickly, at least at first, when one learns to slow down and drink in every word and every detail as it is related. For me and for millions of others, the true genius of Hemingway is to be found in his artful use of language. This book was Hemingway's first truly successful foray into the world of letters, and the result changed the face of modern fiction.  Enjoy!modern tragedy, one in which the characters must somehow resolve the irresolvable.

B00003CXN4|5.0|This film is not only a masterpiece, but it also contains one of the finest performances ever captured on film, and that is by Benicio Del Toro.  His portrayal of a Mexican cop torn by loyalties is absolutely flawless.  He and Soderbergh cut down his dialogue to a minimum in order to bring out his facial acting ability, and the variety of emotions that Del Toro conveys in just a simple look prove that he is a master at his craft.  When I saw this film, I was reminded of another flawless supporting performance by Robert De Niro in The Godfather Part 2.  Del Toro's performance equals if not bests De Niro's, which I consider another of the finest film performances.  Benicio Del Toro makes it look effortless, which makes him one of the great ones.
0393316041|5.0|This book, in its chatty style, shows us the life story of Richard Feynman as told by himself to a bongoeing friend. It shows how one man's intelligence can be totally exceptional. By standard IQ tests Feynman never got very high (see the book), because his genius works along different lines and IQ is a lousy standard to begin with. It shows how Nobel-prize winning science work can be fun, can be a discovery and can take you to Japan etc. Very entertaining, especially the part where Feynman personally hacks the safes in Los Alamos!
0425107469|4.0|Watchers brings the childhood &quot;bogeyman&quot; to life!  An engrossing and terrifying read that nearly kicked me out of my seat!!  I could not put this book down.  To tell the truth, however, during the parts when Detective Lem and the other policemen were involved, the suspense in the plot took a sudden downfall. I was clearly disappointed, but made it my goal to skip the &quot;annoying&quot; parts and finish the book.  As a result, the remainder of the novel truly made up for the &quot;boring&quot; parts.   Koontz has a way of causing the reader to feel sympathy towards the characters.  I even felt sorry for The Outsider at times!  If you're looking for a suspenseful novel, then Watchers is what you are looking for!!
B000059LGC|5.0|The novel Death On The Nile ranks as my favorite of all of the Christie novels I've read, and so I was hoping that this movie was faithful to the original material. I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed.<br />The performances of the many actors are great. Simon MacCorkindale's portrayal of Simon Doyle is wonderful, and Angela Lansbury as Salome Otterbourne is very entertaining. Maggie Smith and Bette Davis as Miss Bowers and Miss Van Schuyler, respectively, have some wonderful scenes together and have great chemistry. David Niven as Colonel Johnny Race is great and makes for a good Watson to Poirot. Jack Warden as Dr. Bessner and Jon Finch as Jim Ferguson, while don't have a ton of screentime, still portray their characters perfectly, and of course Peter Ustinov as the great Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is great.<br />The scenery is beautiful. The scene where Simon and Linnet Doyle are climbing the pyramid is simply breathtaking.<br />The extras on the DVD are pretty good. The 24-minute featurette &quot;The Making of Death On The Nile&quot; is interesting, and the interviews (both in French with subtitles) with Peter Ustinov and Jane Birkin (who plays Louise Bourget), while not extremely interesting, are still a nice addition.<br />There are a few flaws in the movie. The largest one is the fact that they cut out Tim and Mrs. Allerton. For those of you who have read the book, you'll know that cutting out Tim Allerton changes a few important things. Cornelia Robson is also cut out, as well as James Fanthorp and Signor Richetti (which again changes a few things). While I did like these characters a lot in the book, during the movie, these characters were hardly missed.<br />The movie runs approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes, and despite the PG rating, has some slightly graphic violence in it.<br />I would highly reccomend buying this DVD, however, I would suggest reading the book first.
0679879269|1.0|By his own admission, Pullman attempts to make a case for the destruction of God. He uses his talents to enter himself into a most precarious position by pitting himself against the God of the universe and his own wish to sell books. His agenda is to attempt to discredit Christianity and therefore should never be likened to C.S. Lewis.
0893860220|5.0|His wisdom is clear.  He reminds us to look within, and to notice the noticer and remember our Divinity.  Here's one Q &amp; A<br />Q:  You are giving a certain date to your realization. ... What happened?<br />M:  The mind ceased producing events.  The ancient and ceaseless search stopped - I wanted nothing, expected nothing - accepted nothing as my own.  There was no `me' left to strive for.  Even the bare `I am' faded away.  The other thing that I noticed was that I lost all my habitual certainties.  Earlier I was sure of so many things, now I am sure of nothing.  But I feel that I have lost nothing by not knowing, because all my knowledge was false.  My not knowing was in itself knowledge of the fact that all knowledge is ignorance, that `I do not know' is the only true statement the mind can make.  Take the idea `I was born'.  You may take it to be true.  It is not.  You were never born, nor will you ever die.  It is the idea that was born and shall die, not you.  By identifying yourself with it you became mortal.  Just like in a cinema all is light, so does consciousness become the vast world.  Look closely, and you will see that all names and forms are but transitory waves on the ocean of consciousness, that only consciousness can be said to be, not its transformations.      In the immensity of consciousness a light appears, a tiny point that moves rapidly and traces shapes, thoughts and feelings, concepts and ideas, like the pen writing on paper.   And the ink that leaves a trace is memory.  You are that tiny point and by your movement the world is ever re-created.  Stop moving, and there will be no world.  Look within and you will find that the point of light is the reflection of the immensity of light in the body, as the sense `I am'.  There is only light, all else appears.
B00003CWTI|1.0|This movie sucked worse than an old Hoover vacuum cleaner.  My God, what did the director think he was doing?  <br />Now, I know there are a lot of pseudo-intellects out there who see something deep and apocolyptic in this film. To them I say get off the drugs and try reality.  This stream of unconsciousnes crap is the worst of a very poor year in the movie industry.  The notion that Cruise was nominated for this is ludicrous.  <br />The great climax has power only in its ability to turn ones's stomach.  That the director took three hours to tell this tale shows how sadistic a person he must be.  Half the people in the theater left when I saw it originally. Trying it a seond time with two carbon enhancement, didn't help either.
B00001NFCY|1.0|Normally, I don't like writing reviews for cds on this site, but after reading some of the stuff that people had to say about this album, I had to respond.     First of all, I have read many reviews that try to make people who know that Creed is a horrible band look bad by saying stuff like &quot;What are these people thinking?&quot;. And then, the only reason they give as to why Creed isn't bad is &quot;They rock&quot;. This is a typical response from someone who doesn't know much about music. My impression is that many Creed fans don't know much about music at all. I could be wrong, but when I see a kid writing a review that claims their guitarist jams 1000 riffs in each song, I have to sit back and scratch my head. Anyway, my point in this is to explain why Creed is a bad band, so here it goes.      First of all, they have absolutely no originality whatsoever. Their singer is obviously trying to mimic Eddie Vedder's(Pearl Jam's singer for those of you who don't know) voice, and doing a bad job at that. He has no vocal range at all and because he is trying to change his voice to sound like someone elses, it sounds quite off. Also, he even takes lyrics from Pearl Jam. &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; is a lyric in a PJ song called &quot;Given to Fly&quot; as is &quot;Faceless Man&quot;. &quot;Given to Fly&quot; was released right about when Creed was probably sitting down to write &quot;Human Clay&quot;. Musically, once again, nothing more than a mock grunge band from the early 90's ie Pearl Jam, early STP, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. While I will admit that they have a decent guitar player, his songs are quite simple, so those of you who are saying that he is the next Jimmy Page or something are quite mistaken or ill-informed. His hooks aren't memorable, which they are supposed to be, but annoying and plain.(For example, the hook in &quot;Higher&quot; makes me never want to listen to music again because its so annoying.) Finally, Creed does NOT know how to write a good ballad. &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; is supposed to be an emotional song, but is actually anything but. The lyrics are so cheesy and obvious, not to mention, the opening guitar part is almost identical to that of &quot;Release&quot; by Pearl Jam. It's airplay is sickenly comparable to that of the current boy-band trend and Britney Spears. Finally, because of this, Creed has really sold out with this CD. Their other one actually had a pretty good song on it(One), but they didn't mature at all on this record.    Keep in mind before you send me your &quot;Creed Rocks&quot; hate mail, to try and actually come up with an agrument that proves mine wrong. Thanks for checking out my review.
0515127485|3.0|When I first began reading Archangel (my first Robert Harris read), I was captivated.  The opening scene set by Harris is incredible and really draws you into the story.  At first I couldn't put it down.  Then, a little over 3/4 of the way in, I couldn't pick it up.  Harris blew it by revealing the books mystery too early. Don't get me wrong, all in all, the book was entertaining.  The concept behind it is very intriguing.  However, all the suspense and action throughout the book is brought to a head too quickly.  This leaves a lull between when the books secrets are unlocked and the finish.  Harris did manage to script a small twist in the end, but it was a day late and a dollar short. All in all, I would recommend this novel to anyone who is into historical/alternate reality type novels.  It is interesting and reads very well.  However, be prepared to be slightly disappointed at the end.
1573226521|4.0|Book review:  `The Beach'    By Alex Garland         Joanna Jones 13.3.01<br />A book I read recently was ` The Beach'. I found it a very interesting stimulating novel that captured my attention. Living in the country in which the book was situated in, having been to many of the places it mentions, gave me clear visuals of the different places. I can recall having many of the same thoughts and feelings as the main character in this book. Many of the things he did I can imagine myself doing if I was in his situation. I found his character very easy to relate to.  A guy in his early twenties, independent, in totally different circumstances to what  he's used to being in. It inspired me the way this book was put together, the places and the different types of people you meet along the way as a back packer.  The author had obviously back packed through  Thailand at some point, to have had the kind of thoughts that people experiencing a new country for the first time have: culture shock ;people from all over the world trying to fit in with new situations when in a country like Thailand, which is of high tourist attraction.  I thought the book went a bit slow and was kind of drawn out, but it's one of those books that has a lot to say for itself. It has many details that need to be explained to be able to convey some kind of feeling to the reader so he/she can picture the different scenes. I like the way the story was planned out and the way it was very much reality but managed to squeeze in some imaginative thinking also. This book has a very unique story line unlike anything I have ever heard of. I would definitely recommend this book to people who are into a bit of an adventure and don't mind a bit of gore. I would recommend it to ages 12 and up depending on the maturity of the person.
B000002MQ9|5.0|&quot;Within the Realm...&quot; remains in the pantheon of my CD collection.  The first minute of the opening track pulled me irretrievably into goth/darkwave.  I married the woman who loaned it to me.  I think she said &quot;yes&quot; just to get the tape back.<br />It isn't New Age - it's Dark Ages.  Brendan Perry was the Frank Sinatra of goth, with his soothing tenor flowing over medieval, operatic pop.  Lisa Gerrard - well, just read the other reviews.  She must have at least a two-and-a-half octave range.  <br />Dead Can Dance was (They broke up in 1999) almost as good as Lycia at changing environment through sound.  Throughout this album, you're walking alone through 15th-century castle halls at twilight.  The sheer yearning Perry brings to &quot;Xavier&quot; rivals fellow Irishman Van Morrison's rendition of &quot;Motherless Child.&quot;  &quot;Cantara&quot; is, of course, a primo booty-shaker if you're dancing in a room full of candles with amber hanging thick in the air. All the songs have that echoing, cinematic quality that works so well in dark music.  Like most DCD albums, there are no lyrics.  For the murkier songs, you can find at least one website that has their lyrics.<br />&quot;Within the Realm of A Dying Sun&quot; harkens to a night when &quot;gothic&quot; was an actual historical period, not just graveyard chic.
6305903182|2.0|This is trailered as the part in which &quot;all bets are off&quot; and &quot; there no more rules&quot;. Forget it, it follows all the rules and doesn't break one. After a fantastic opening sequence, it never quite reaches the same pitch again. The first two are still great, but this has no guts at all, you are more likely to be scared eating an hot apple pie. Wait for TV, Tape it, watch the pre-credits sequence and the cameos from Carrie Fisher, Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, and dump the rest.  It's not scary, it's not violent and it's not funny.<br />Try Cherry Falls - that's far more fun
B00004XONN|3.0|I love \\"Pablo Honey\\", and adore \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" but \\"Kid A\\"? The jury is still out on this album. I love Radiohead but \\"Kid A\\" was made out to be the savior for all artists and bands that aren't Limp Bizkit, Creed, and Matchbox Twenty, and failed to a certain extent. A lot of critics were worshipping this album when it first came out. Obviously they were brainwashed by the hype. What really disappointed me is that this album is as pretentious as pretentious gets but so was \\"OK Computer\\". I think the difference is that \\"OK Computer\\" succeeded artistically while \\"Kid A\\" is half-baked.<br />\\"Kid A\\" has none of the brilliance of \\"OK Computer\\". There is a glimmer of hope with the sparse track \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" which reminded me a bit of \\"Exit Music [For a Film\\". I can almost hear a bit of drum and bass in \\"Idioteque\\" which I really liked. \\"Optimistic\\" is also good. Other than those particular tracks, \\"Kid A\\" (...)has failed at the artistic level of \\"OK Computer\\".
B00000163G|5.0|THIS IS THE GREATEST RAP ALBUM OF ALL TIME. I really shouldn't have to say more than that. I have always been a Tupac fan, but that has nothing to do with my oppinion. Ask any REAL O.G. what the best rap album of all time is, and they won't hesitate to tell you All Eyez On Me. Every single person I know agrees. EVERY SINGLE TRACK IS GOOD. How many albums do you have that you can play all the way through without hearing at least one mediocre song? What about a DOUBLE DISC ALBUM? That's what I thought. I have had this CD for years, and I still bump it. The tracks are layered deeply and inticritly, and the lyrics are unbelievable. I don't know how Pac did it, but it's insane how much skill he came with on this album (every album of his, but this is the longest). This sh!t changed the rap game forever - you think JayZ is tight? DMX? LUdicrus? ANY WEST COAST RAPPER? They're all trying to be half as good as Tupac Shakur, and not coming 10% close. Think for a second&gt; 2pac was the ORIGINAL THUG. He started it. You think your favorite rapper (whoever it is) is a thug, or claims to be living Thug Life, just remember who started it, Pac had it tattooed on his stomach, and an album of that title. Tupac was/is the most intelligent, most skilled, hardest working........GREATEST RAPPER OF ALL TIME, and this is his best work, and the best work of any rapper, EVER. If you don't believe me, read the track list, I gaurantee you that you've heard most of the songs on this album already, and love them. This album won't be topped unless Tupac himself rises from the dead and goes back to the studio. PEACE

B00002E23E|4.0|I like this DVD. I also have the CD, and musically, it's a pretty mediocre performance. The band sounds tired and I have a lot of better sounding bootleg shows from that same period in Zeppelin's career. To make matters worse, Madison Square Gardens isn't known for being all that acoustically happening. Fortunately, the live footage is tight and the video remastering is well done. You get to see how they reigned on stage, and that does add quite a lot of impact to the tunes. The audio crew gets it dialed after the first 15 minutes, and from there on, it's a decent-sounding show. I could do without the band's personal fantasy sequences, simply because I want to see more of the musicians doing their thing. But, hey, it's always a hoot seeing Bonzo doing anything. And the first time I saw a light-sabre in Star Wars, I thought of this movie. <br />If you never saw them live, view this DVD and you get some idea of what made them such a colossal impact on rock. If you like Led Zeppelin then this is a must-have disc.
0385335482|5.0|As soon as I saw the title of this book, I knew it was for me!  This book is hilariously addictive!  The only thing is that it is set in England, so references to stores and calculations of her finances in British Pounds didn't quite make as much of an impact - I would've been able to relate to her adventures just a tad bit more if she were shopping at Macy's, Bloomies and Sax!  Other than that, I sincerely loved this story.
B000002UWF|5.0|Come on. You gotta love this guy. The first time I saw &quot;Jungle Book&quot;, I fell under the spell of this happening music. Louis Prima blended Jazz, Swing and Jump music with his irresistable personal charm. This is one of those CDs that I keep giving to people as a gift. My mom loves it, my friends love it, and those kids on the Gap ads seem hip to it, too. Everyone who hears him play says &quot;Oh, is this that same guy?&quot;. Yes indeed. He jumps, jives and wails. He's just a gigolo. And he will always be the king of the jungle swingers.
6305265666|5.0|I am a huge fan of fairy tales, and this has to be one of my favorites.  I thought that the scenery (filmed on location in France) was absolutely breathtaking and (most) of the acting was superb.  I think (although many would disagree) that Drew Barrymore seemed uncomfortable with her role.  She sounded incredibly awkward using a British accent.  But besides to that, Dougray Scott (Prince Henry) was truly extraordinary.  By watching the movie you can most definitely tell why he was casted as &quot;Prince Charming&quot;.  There's something about him that you just can't put your finger on...he has become another one of my favourite actors (Ioan Gruffudd, of course, being the first).  A definite must-have!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies ever made!  Fight Club tells the tale of an insomniac who is losing his grip on reality.  Then, he meets Tyler, and that is when all hell breaks out!  The naration given by Edward Norton is powerful and haunting, and it makes the suspense and terror seem that more realistic.  This is the kind of movie where you cannot tell the story to others too much without giving the whole movie away.  The ending is one of the best I have ever seen in a movie since Usual Suspects.  This is a powerful movie which will make you believe that chaos can end all existence.  I think EVERYONE should see this movie.  It is gruesome and violent at times, but it's worth it!  It's a shame that I can only give it 5 stars.  It really should be 100 stars, or even more!  Fight Club is without a dobt one of the best movies ever made!

B00004XONN|3.0|I have read many fascinating reviews of Radiohead's fourth album, Kid A.  Most were quick to praise the album.  Some went as far as calling it a masterpiece.  I have also read a few (Very few) reviews which bashed the album as being Radiohead's weakest album so far.  As far as I'm concerned, they are both right.  One of the biggest complaints that critics have had with Radiohead was that they often sound derivative of their influences.  This album is no different, alternately conjuring up ambient eletronic artists such as Plastikman and Aphex Twin, as well as Miles Davis' fusion albums.  The keyboard and guitar tones in particular, sound like their lifted right out of Bitches Brew.  Still, in other tracks, we find Radiohead trying their hand at full fledged electronica.  Make no mistake, this album is, by far, the best example of a rock band attempting electronica music.  (That doesn't really say much)  However, when compared to the innovators of electronica (Massive Attack, Orb, Brian Eno, LTJ Buekm, etc), Radiohead's attempts sound somewhat pedestrian.  A few of the tracks such as Treefingers and the title track, just don't jell; even after repeated listens.  It's not &quot;challenging&quot;, it just doesn't sink in.  And often the band just sounds too artsy and self indulgent for their own good.  It is interesting to see how many people were so easily impressed by this album.  After the success of The Bends and OK Computer, many rock fans placed Radiohead on a pedastal; claiming them to be the greatest rock band of their generation.  So when Radiohead released this somewhat puzzling album, instead of listening to it objectively, they quickly convinced themselves that it was the year's best. (In the same way that Pink Floyd fans convince themselves that Atom Heart Mother is a great album)  One reason may be that most rock fans are not familiar with ambient music or jazz fusion.  For them, Kid A may sound incredibly original and imaginative.  In addition, their isa mindset among indie music fans that if a band sounds obscure and has no hooks or melodies, then it must be good.  (If a great band makes a weird album, it must be a masterpiece, right?)  For all of it's weaknesses, this is still a fairly enjoyable album.  Yes, it's derivative, but that doesn't mean it's not fascinating to listen to.  THe National Anthem, Optimistic, as well as Idoteque rate as some of Radiohead's best songs of their career.  And you have to hand it to Radiohead for being so ambitious when most bands are content with recycling the same old formulas.  Ultimately, this is an album of a very talented band exploring a new direction.  Sometimes they falter, but their is enough good music in here to be worth purchasing.  A flawed album, but with some excellent moments.
B0000508U6|4.0|This, Coldplay's debut album, has been attracting almost too much attention in music circles as of late and most of it is deserved. That said, this really isn't any kind of revelatory album, but it IS a nice collection of heartfelt tunes in these alienating days of information overload where everyone seems to be starved for fresh sounding music and melodies. Chris Martin's vocals fall in amongst those of Dave Matthews, Thom Yorke and the unearthly trill of Jeff Buckley. Unfortunately he frequently lets his voice fall into lazy (croaky) disrepair (someone get that man a throat lozenge!), particularly towards the end of the album. Still, outstanding songs like &quot;Don't Panic&quot;, &quot;Shiver&quot;, &quot;Spies&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;High Speed&quot; make this money well spent when the alternative is the &quot;artistic&quot; garbage currently clogging the charts.
B000006045|5.0|As a fan of all sorts of genres, perhaps the biggest compliment you can give to an album is that it can be enjoyed by people who aren't even familiar with it's genre.  I still remember the first time I heard Miles Davis' Kind of Blue.  I was not a fan of jazz music at the time, but after I heard that album 3 or 4 times, I was hooked.  I had a similar experience with the Clash for punk music.  And obviously, both are landmark albums.<br />Massive Attack's Mezzanine may not be such a landmark album (Blue Lines was), but I can still place it in the same context as the two albums I have just mentioned.  Why?  Because this is electronica music that anybody can enjoy.  And while purists may call it selling out, I say it's a work of pure genius.<br />Okay, now that I got that off my chest, let me say that this is a fantastic album.  A huge improvement from Protection.  No, they do not break any new ground, but it is thoroughly enjoyable.  In my opinion it is Massive Attack's most consistent album yet.  And certainly their most focused.  With Mezzanine, Massive Attack have created a bleak, seductive, urban soundtrack.  Each song is filled with a dark paranoia.  Although Tracy Thorn doesn't appear here, Sara Jay and Elizabeth Fraser give fantastic performances that will leave you saying, &quot;Tracy who?&quot;  Elizabeth Fraser in particular is absolutely amazing on the sublime &quot;Teardrop&quot;, which is to Mezzanine as &quot;Unfinished Symphony&quot; was to Blue Lines.  There are also fuzzy guitars throughout the album.  The opening track &quot;Angel&quot; is a near perfect blend of rock guitar and trip hop.  <br />Needless to say, this is one of my favorite trip hop albums.  It draws me in, every time I listen to it.  Even if you're not a fan of trip hop or electronic music, you will still find this a rewarding album.  After hearing Mezzanine, you'll understand why Massive Attack is called &quot;the coolest band in England&quot;  Well worth you money.
068484267X|5.0|I see a lot of the reviews use the words sad or depressing to describe this novel.  I wanted to let everyone know that you smile or laugh a lot as well.  Yes, Frank had a VERY hard childhood, but some of his memories are precious and wonderful.  Frank, as only a child can, was able to enjoy little moments in his life even during the worst of times.   I would like to add; the people that are upset because readers might believe that all of Ireland was like Limerick should realize that we are not ignorant.  This novel describes certain classes in a certain city on certain lanes.  I never read in this book that Mr. McCourt was describing all of Ireland.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Now I know you read the title of my review and you're thinking I'm some kid who's just raving about his favorite band.  But please, don't stop reading!  You see, I am a big music geek and aspiring music afficianado.  Yes, I listen to almost every genre, including electronica, jazz, heavy metal, indi and classical music.  And my music collection is ridiculous, (almost 1,000 CD's).<br />But in my collection, there are only a handful of albums that I absolutely love, and continue to listen to over and over again.  Joy Division's Unknown Pleasure is one example.  Coltrane's A Love Supreme is another.  And yes, The Clash's London Calling is one of those albums.  It is simply a joy to listen to.  <br />Make no mistake, this is not just a punk album.  It is not nearly as abrasive as their seminal debut album.  Instead, you will find the Clash tackling many different styles and genres.  From the opening rock anthem of the title track, the reggae of &quot;Revolution Rock&quot; and the rockabilly of &quot;Brand New Cadillac.&quot;  And even the slower numbers such as &quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot; and &quot;The Card Cheat&quot; are classic.  But perhaps what's more amazing is that they tackle those genres extremely WELL.  All of the songs are catchy and memorable.  This is one of the few albums where I can say that there are no bad tracks.  <br />THe Clash's London Calling is not hype.  There is a reason why it is on so many TOP 100 lists and people's Desert Island Disc Lists.  It is absolutely ESSENTIAL for any music fan.  Believe me, you'll be glad you purchased it.  From one music fan to another.

0062502182|4.0|What better way to encourage someone to follow their dreams!  Paulo Coelho has written a beautiful and inspiring story with a wonderfully powerful message.<br />Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy, is told by the King of Salem that the reoccuring dream he has been having can be fulfilled, that it is his destiny to travel to the Egyptian Pyramids to find his treasure.  What seems like such an impossible thing turns into a quest to realize his dream, or Personal Legend.  And so the journey begins...<br />Santiago meets many people along the way--some who want to help and some who only hinder.  Readers will be uplifted by Santiago's determination and surprised by the outcome in his quest to follow his dream.  Although not a life-changing story, it does put a new perspective on the importance of goals and aspirations and having the courage to meet them.  Recommend this for a quick day or weekend read.
B000000WFU|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS CD BACK IN 1996 AND I WAS DRAWN TO THE HAUNTING VOCALS OF MIRIAM STOCKLEY.  ON LISTENING TO THE ALBUM YOU WILL BE LURE YOU INTO A DREAMWORLD
0345403959|3.0|I enjoyed this book, as it brought back a lot of the memories of the Belgariad and Mallorean which I'd read 10+ years ago and enjoyed tremendously.<br />There were a few inconsistancies between this book and the original series, especially with the character of Belgarath himself. I'm currently reading &quot;Polgara the Sorceress&quot; and find the same true there. In the original series, Belgarath is THE legend, the eternal man, almost holy in many cultures. In this book, you finally see that despite being 7000 years old, he's still a little slow and requires almost constant input from &quot;the Necessity&quot; or Aldur to be able to do anything. Seldom does he do anything clever on his own, and he frequently depends on the stupidity of his enemies (Torak, Urvon, Zedar etc...) to succeed.<br />This destroyed some of my image of the character and it's just due to lazy writing. I get the distinct impression that most of this material was written before the first series of books (in proto form anyway) just to give background to this one character. This is fine, but it takes a lot of work to make a character intelligent, and you just don't see this here. A 7000 year old man should have unique perspective, be enormously clever and outwit practically everyone. That would have been too hard to do however, so you have to see the 7000 year old man who's pretty much just like everyone else. It succeeds in the first book because Belgarath is rarely the main character and the story isn't told directly by him (i.e. first person).<br />Still, if you liked the Belgariad, you really can't fail with this book, most of the history is at least somewhat entertaining, especially the initial calling of the diciples of Aldur to the Vale. I found that most interesting.
B000056K04|3.0|I was looking forward to the new Dave Matthews Band album.  I sort of hoped that its content would be more like Under the Table and Dreaming than Before These Crowded Streets:  UTD was all about jamming, great guitars and grassroots.  BTCS was a little sleeker; it sounded to much like a studio album.  My favorite Dave Matthews CD is his live one with Tim Renoylds.  I prefer Dave's live sound to his studio sound. <br />This is why Everyday is such a letdown to me.  It has two major problems.  The first is its production.  Instead of getting down to the soul of DMB (that live sound I love so much), the band and their producer opted to make this album as produced as possible.  All the sounds are smoothed over and clean, as opposed to the twangy guitars on earlier albums.  As if to clairfy my point, Dave plays an electric guitar for the majority of the album.  While I'm not saying electric guitars are bad, Dave's electric is much cleaner and sleeker-sounding than his acoustic. <br />The other problem is the songs.  Apparently Dave wrote all the songs by himself in a matter of 12 days.  If he took more time to perfect them, they would undoubtably been better.  However, what shows on the album are half-developed songs that heavy production has tried to fix.  Some people might not notice, but Dave fans probably will. <br />The album really isn't all that bad, it's just that it's different from DMB's other material.  We've come to expect a natural sound from them, but all we get on this album is lots of production.
B000005IU2|5.0|In one word, Ferocious.  Funhouse is perhaps the seminal &quot;proto punk&quot; album of all time.  It's true that you can train a monkey to play these songs, but the power is undeniable.  Iggy hoots and howls incoherently, while the band drunkenly bashes out the riffs.  Perhaps what's most intriguing about the album is that the formula seems so simple, yet it has never been matched.  While the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion or Monster Magnet may do damn good Iggy impressions, they are just not convincing.  It seems more like fake posturing than genuine insanity.  When you hear Iggy scream throughout Funhouse, there will be no doubt in your mind that he's a few screws loose.  This is ugly, noisy, glorious, garage rock at it's best.  For all of Dream Theater's technical &quot;virtuosity&quot; they can only dream of rocking like this.

B000031WD9|1.0|The hollywood trend continues...that is to say the pandering of film to lower the tastes of film going audiences. This masturbatory mis-adventure about guys who continually objectify women seeks to say that a male adolescent's brain is located too far south of his cranium. The disturbing aspect of it all is that the film was so popular among teens that it seems like a whole-sale endorsement for ignorance. Do you get the fact that what we watch determines little by little who we are? As Hollis Little Creek says, &quot;Be careful what you advertise on your t-shirts, people might just think that's who you are...&quot;

0811826848|5.0|This book transcends its overt purpose of being an anthology of the Beatles.  <br />Anyone who loves the music the Beatles gave us will find much rewarding material here.  Those who want to know about how success can be accomplished in popular music will be riveted.  Those who like to look back on popular culture in times past will have a happy trip.  If you just love exciting photography, there is much to attract you to this volume.  I found myself singing the Beatles' songs to myself as I read the text and looked at the illustrations.  That was the best part!<br />To me, the most thought-provoking part of this book was its rags-to-genius quality.  The Beatles were unlikely candidates to become leading musical innovators.  Most of them were so poor that their families lacked indoor bathrooms when they were growing up.  None of them could read music.  The combined number of music lessons they had was less than ten in total.  They could not afford musical instruments.  Their families could not afford to subsidize their careers.  Yet they were observant about the new, in contact with what moved their hearts, listened intently for better music, and worked with a never-ending frenzy to fulfill their passion for the music.  It's vastly more heartwarming and fascinating than any rags-to-riches story ever can be.   <br />I had never understood John Lennon's complaints about the &quot;packaged, predictable&quot; Beatles until I read in this book about the type of band they were while evolving their style.  Particularly in the Hamburg gigs, they were more like a jazz combo that played rock and roll.  The music was free form, and they stretched some songs into being as long as an hour and a half.  <br />In fact, their commercial success was a tremendous tragedy for their artistic success because they were probably at the edge of developing a whole new musical genre that would have become the dominant one today.  I'm sorry it never happened.  I feel even more sorry for them, in realizing that they knew what they lost and must feel it very deeply.<br />I was also moved by the story of their tempestuous friendship.  These guys went through tremendous stresses, strains, and deprivations together.  They fought, they disagreed, they slugged each other, and they appreciated each other.  Yet, there was a strong enough pull towards each other that allowed the group to continue through its amazing journey, despite the difficulties.  To have had such friendships, even if they are eventually lost, must be an amazing experience.  Few will know this closeness in their lives.  <br />I came away from this book with a new appreciation for the Beatles.  Before this book, the Beatles were all about (for me) how they sounded and looked, and how I reacted to that.  Now, I see them as being role models for important aspects of human experience that we should all appreciate.  <br />Before closing, I do have two words of caution.  This book is very open about the major and minor vices of life.  As such, this book could make the wrong impression on adolescents.  They don't need too many new ideas about how to rebel, and this book could be read that way.  That's not what the Beatles were doing, but a 13 year old could see it that way.  <br />Second, as revealing as the book is, more is ultimately still hidden below the surface than is revealed.  These young men knew a lot of pain, and that pain was an important source of their brilliance.  Don't be offended that they did not share more.  It was probably very painful to share as much as they did.  <br />I would like to give the editors major credit for developing a successful dialogue style in the book that included quotes from John Lennon.  It must have been the dickens to read through all of his many quotes, and to weave them into material comparable to what can be developed in a simple interview where the others could be aware of what each other said.     <br />&quot;Take a sad song, and make it better.&quot;
0312243022|5.0|Cunningham has done what regretfully few writers are able to do:  written a thoughtful, interesting, deep, easy-to-read masterpiece that is enjoyable on multiple levels.  He writes as if he is singing, or writing poetry; on almost every page, there is a gem of a sentence which is just food for thought for hours.  For example:  &quot;Then the feeling moves on.  It does not collapse; it is not whisked away.  It simply moves on, like  a train that stops at a small country station, stands for a while, and then continues out of sight.&quot;  Or:  &quot;If they both survive long enough, if they stay together, they will watch each other fade.&quot;  Wonderful.<br />You do not need to know Virginia's Woolf generally, or her novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; in particular, to appeciate this book.  I've been assured, however, that reading Mrs. Dalloway only enhances the experience.  There are multiple parallels between the two books.  This book examines -as did &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; - one day in the life of three characters.  Each one's day, as it unfolds before us, could easily be its own short story.  Cunningham's genius, however, is the way in which he ties together the three individuals into one novel.  Watch for the Hitchcock-like ending.  I don't want to say what it is (it would be like telling the end of a movie to someone about to enter the theater) but read the last chapter carefully.  If you want to discuss the ending, or what the Hitchcock piece is, drop me an e-mail.  (I missed it the first time around until someone pointed it out to me).<br />All in all, this novel examines, in strikingly beautiful language - love, and life, and fear, and insecurity, and sanity, and marriage, and parenthood, and relationships.  There is something in this deeply textured novel for everyone.  It follows three women at three different times - the 1930s, the 1950s, and modern day - as they seek to understand their lives, their futures, and themselves.  The manner in which these women react to life is truly extraordinary.en react to life is truly extraordinary.
0307165485|5.0|I had this book when I was about 4 years old and I just have to buy it for my son who's two.  This is the best book for pre-schoolers because it has tons of different stories for short attention spans.

B000001FLA|2.0|YAWN, SNORE! Those are the thoughts I had when listening to the regular songs. There all that &quot;evil in the night-never in the day because day is less frightening&quot; feel. The only thing that was good about them was the solos...THAT NO ONE CAN EVER PLAY! God, Yngwie, SLOW DOWN! MORE! MORE! SLOWER! SLOWER!, etc...<br />On the other hand, I loved the instrumentals. Crying was very nice, and it reminded me of Paco De Lucia. The Trilogy Suite really shows his skill, and his flamenco style. But, he does rip off Bach in one of the passages.<br />This album should've been his last. Oh Well.
B00003CXB2|5.0|The best Lean has to offer, and probably one of the best films ever made. Trouble is, it degrades as soon as you bring it home...this film was meant to be seen on the screen. It's nature has no pretense to be 'shot for tv'...there's no 'formatted to fit'...it shall never &quot;fit&quot; the home screen. One scene says it all...Cut to a shot of the desert, and on tv it will seem as though it is all you are looking at, on the big screen there's a difference---there's movement on the edge of the horizon which cannot be seen on the tv screen. The acting is stellar, the locations incredible, the story magnificent...and will all of THAT transfer to the home medium, yes, however small. The film edifies the human spirit...which is what we ask of all great film. See it...even IF it's on a dvd-watchman, sooner or later you'll find a way to see it as it was meant ('it is written').
B0000020C4|5.0|I was introduced to les Miserables by a friend who lent me the Symphonic recording a few years ago and i was left in absolute awe with that one. However, when I hired the video of the 10th anniversary concert to get some pointers on how best to perform On My Own for a vocal competition I had entered it had an effect on me that was a zillion times stronger than when I heard the Symphonic recording. First I renewed the video loan so I kept it for an extra week, I just didn't want to part with it lol but then I returned it and bought my own copy plus a copy of this cd. I've had them both for a year and haven't got sick of them yet! They still leave me awestruck. Colm Wilkinson is amazing as always in the lead role of Valjean and Phillip Quast - well what can I say he IS Javert. Ruthie Henshall as Fantine is a delight because as well as having a gorgeous voice she puts so much emotion into her part and it is always such a pleasure to hear this performance of hers. There's one downside, and that's Michael Maguire as Enjolras because he is a huge disappointment. I have heard him on other soundtracks and he has been great, but on this particular one I don't know whether he was sick or something, but he cracks nearly every high note. Michael Ball - the original Marius - has a voice like silk and he never ceases to amaze me just how wonderful he is in the role of Marius, and this performance is no exception. Judy Kuhn is lovely as Cosette and she brings some much needed life into a character that i have never really liked much because I find the whole perfection of Cosette irritating. With Kuhn in the role however, I can appreciate the part because of her talent. The Thenardiers are so funny, both of them and all their numbers are so entertaining! I also enjoyed the performance of Graintaire here. I'm sorry I don't actually know the name of the guy who played him, but I just have to mention that his solo in &quot;Drink With Me&quot; touches my heart everytime I hear it. As for the show stopper, well it was definitely Lea Salonga in the role of the heartbroken Eponine. Salonga is the most amazing Eponine I have heard and her duet with Michael ball, &quot;A little fall of rain&quot; is THE song of the show. It makes me cry every single time I hear it. Salonga and Ball are the perfect example of how two performers can compliment each other and make each others performances 10 times better. If you don't have a Les Miserables album, this is the one to get, although I hope you do get more :) I'd also strongly reccommend getting the video of this performance because it adds so much more that the cd doesn't capture.
0789723107|4.0|&quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; is an excellent book for those designing web sites. It's a great title, and a great motto for designing any type of technology, not just web sites. Krug calls it &quot;thinking&quot; when you have to stop focusing on your task to figure out the web site, even if only for a few milliseconds. <br />The book is very well written in an engaging, informal style that feels more like a conversation than a lecture (not easy for a book that is essentially preaching). The layout is wonderful and follows its own advice. Each page is designed to make one good point, and the gazillions of images are simple, clear, and effective in supporting the points. Although a lot shorter (by design) than Jakob Nielsen's &quot;Designing Web Usability,&quot; I found it provided a lot more specific, on-target advice -- both per pound and overall. Whereas Nielsen focuses mainly on page design and site design, Krug handles these as well as interaction design, which is missing from Nielsen's book. It has some good examples that you are encouraged to work through before looking at &quot;the answers.&quot; It's a good technique. He also has a terrific section that lays out exactly how you conduct a usability test, from greeting the person to interpreting their behavior. <br />Sure, there's a lot more to learn about good web design and about usability testing, and probably some people will object that he doesn't do justice to the complexity of these professions. But I think this book does a great job of pointing you in the right direction with a lot of good, solid advice and some encouragement. It's short enough that you're inclined to read the whole thing, and compelling enough that it might really affect your designs.
B00005A1VG|5.0|Errol Flynn is the REAL Robin Hood. This movie ranks right along other classics that stand the test of time. The swordplay and archery action are first rate. With none of the blood, guts, and gore of other Robin Hood films, this one will delight the whole family. You'll laugh with Frair Tuck, your heart will pound with excitement at the tournament, and you'll experiance the joy of love between Robin and Maid Marion. This is a great movie.
B000001FDQ|3.0|You know, I have some trouble listening to 3,000,000,000,000,000,0000 notes being played at under 3 seconds. But yes, there is some melody. Black Star has always been my favorite Yngwie song, and Icarus was a good instrumental. But, there's almost no singing on this album. I would like some singing. And not by that horrible singer on Now your Ships are Burned.
B000056N8X|1.0|First of all, let me say that I hate bad reviews.  Reading them bothers me when I think of all the hard works that goes into a movie.  Having established that, I still have to say that this movie is a stinker.  It is to the original Highlander, what Lambert's version of Beowulf is to the original Beowulf... somewhat of a mockery.  The original Highlander movie is a work of art.  The sequels, as well as the series, in my opinion, not only dilute the original story, but are inconsistent to an impressive degree.  Its like each one was wrtitten by a guy who had only heard about, but never actually seen the others.  In Endgame, the  beloved memories of the fierce Kurgan and good ole' Ramirez are once again trampled.  There is yet another &quot;ultimately evil&quot; enemy and, of course, Conner's 400 years worth of sword skills are totally inadequate against him.  Ramirez would be spinning in his grave.  Beam this one back to planet Zeist with the rest of the nonsensical junk.  Ouch!
B000002KP3|5.0|I would be surprised! This album should be at the very peak of any Bolan / T.Rex collection for the quality of music and it's importance to Marc's career. Some critics claim it is a pop sell-out compared to the Tyrannosaurus Rex material and yes they may be right, but who cares! There are countless examples of great Bolan lines right throughout the album and these are put to some great riffs (Jeepster / Get It On), great drums (Cosmic Dancer), great backing vocals (Flo and Eddie), good bass (Steve Currie) and good bongos (Mickey Finn). Tony Visconti's wonderfull production and string arrangements also add a tremendous amount to this great album. Electric Warrior is full of fun pop / rock tunes but still has the ability to enchant the listener and take them to other worlds undiscovered in their imagination. Marc's vocals are breathtakingly sexual at times and this sexuality is maintained throughout this album and The Slider. The album cover works perfectly (especially on vinyl) and ties the work together as a great piece of modern expressionist art. Is Get It On the greatest pop song of all time?
0780020685|4.0|I, in no way, consider myself a &quot;big&quot; fan of Japanese movies... I grew up on Godzilla, which I love, and have seen quite a few other popular titles like the Samurai trilogy and the more recent Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. This was my first viewing of a Kurosawa movie, and I must say I'm speechless. To begin things, I just wanna say, dont expect any fast paced duels, because they arent in this movie. What this movie does do great, is character development, I would have to agree that this movie has class, and you know all the characters very well by the time they finale comes around. For being a 3 hour movie, I found it to shoot by incredibly fast due to the way you get so into the story. The action does get pretty good for about the last 30 minutes, but nothing great. I like this movie because it looks more natural and less scripted like newer movies such as crouching tiger. I cant wait for the new Ran dvd to come out, and Im gonna check that one out! The only bad things I dont like about this dvd are the fact its not widescreen, and the audio is completely horrible, but its a old movie, so thats assumed.
B000056K04|1.0|I am one of DMB's longest standing fans. I appreciate what they were trying to do here, however I have found little to sink my teeth into on Everyday.  <br />Leroi and Boyd are MIA. (DMB appearance on SNL was hilarious with the two guys just *standing* there!). There are a couple of brilliant moments (mother father, If I had it all), but there is none of the passion, the incredible soulful lyrics that Dave is known and loved for.  <br />That combined with the great songs we know are out there (JTR, Grey Street, etc) is killing me. I thank god for the boot I have from last year and I look forward to the summer tour to hear how they will attempt to salvage this, but I am sorely disappointed. This one will likely get a few more plays on my CD player, then off to collect some dust. <br />Also, for all those who hate the Crash girls, I suspect we'll be talking the same game with the &quot;space&quot; girls this tour and every tour going forward. <br />Argh.
6304346107|5.0|I found this version to be much richer and more intelligent than that &quot;other&quot; Emma. Oh Excellent A&amp;E!
B0000507R2|5.0|Although it is not indicated on the packaging, owners of stanard (non DVD-A) DVD players can view the video for &quot;Carnival&quot; by manually selecting title &quot;2&quot; with their DVD remote.  The audio accompanying the video is 2-channel 48kHz 16 bit PCM.  I really enjoyed the new multi-channel surround mix for this title.
B00003CXA6|5.0|For anyone who wishes to study, and enjoys the wonder of truely inspirational people, the film Gettysberg is absolutely the film to own.   The directors verion brilliantly reveals the meaning of inspired leadership, true courage and demonstrates both the reasons why people fight and die willingly for a cause; and it makes clear the utter futility of war.  This film has it all: adventure, action, realism, horror, terror, sadness, success, mistakes, coincidence, and the peculiar vagaries of chance. It is a complete experience and all will find the tragic ending, which marked the end of Napoleonic style warfare, to be most moving and very emotional.  For the analytical what-if buff, there is the ultimate opportunity to imagine how history might have followed a different course but for the unbeliveably gallant actions of the tens of thousands who fought and died, and the truely inspired leadership of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the professor of rhetoric who undeniably saved the Union Army from absolute disaster by an act of exceptional military genius.  A fantastic experience.
B000056K04|4.0|While I'm still holding out that the sessions from Virginia will be released some day, I'll take this in the meantime.  Having watched the Charlie Rose special and read the Rolling Stone article before buying this album, I gained some perspective on the new songs.  While this album pales in comparison to my personal favorite Before These Crowded Streets, this is a solid album.  The songs themselves are probably some of the best Dave has written, namely I Did It, The Space Between, Dreams of Our Fathers, What You Are, Sleep to Dream Her, and Everyday. And, I can definitely appreciate the fact that Dave wanted to try something new.  However, I think that the band was somehow lost in the process.  After all, it is called the Dave Matthews Band.  It seems like Glen Ballard suppressed the band a little too much.  I don't think he should've stifled the jam elements so much.  God forbid a song should run over five minutes Glen!!  I think the album would've been helped had Glen let the band off it's short leash.  After all, the band is as much Carter, Leroi, Stefan, and Boyd as it is Dave.  I don't think Glen appreciated that.  If you let Everyday, What You Are, and Sleep to Dream Her run to six minutes or so, I think you would've had a more balanced album, which is what makes the first three albums such fun to listen to.  I can appreciate this album though, as a valuable learning experience for the band, and I hope they find a good balance between their jam tendencies and their rediscovered pop sensibility.  And, I can't wait to see what they do with these songs in a live setting.
0345440757|5.0|I saw your segment on Dateline, I ran to the store the following day and bought the last copy of your book, then spent the next 2 days devouring every page. What a beautiful gift! My son Jack has gone from sleeping on my chest to his crib in 2 days and is so much happier when he's awake because we're not overstimulating him anymore! I hope you're making a fortune because you deserve every penny!
0385484518|5.0|I rarely read non-fiction. I love fantasy and usually stick to that. But after hearing how this book changed lives and made people sob, i decided that I had to read it. Now, I'm used to these giant, 900+ page doorstops and when I saw that it was only just under 200 pages I was surprised. How can something so moving be put into a mere 192 pages? a. Because Mitch Albom writes incredibly well, and b. because his message is so strong. This book truly does change lives, I found myself looking at how I was living and how I could change for the better. That MOrrie could be such an unselfish, inspiartional person (after finding that he had Lou Gehrig's disease, he declared himself lucky!) blows my mind, and humbles me. This book should be read by anyone and everyone regardless of age or belief. You won't be dissapointed and I can guarentee that you will be changed.  Its that good.
0345440757|5.0|This book literally gave me my life, sanity and confidence in my ability to raise a happy child back!! I'm a 30 year old, college educated, first time, stay at home mom.  I don't care what anyone else says re: her credentials, what she did with her own children.  Her advice seems like common sense when you read it and digest it, but as someone who hasn't been around an infant in 15 years, I needed help understanding this tiny new being in my home.  Her advice on sleeping worked like a charm and took a two month old who couldn't nap unless he was on someone's chest to a 3 month old who will go to sleep on his own in minutes EVERY time!  Instead of an overstimulated, overtired baby who cried for 2-3 hours a day.  I now have an adequately rested, independent child who is joyful all the time we are together!  My husband and I feel like we can read and understand our child much better and we are all happier for it!!  As far as I'm concerned - she should have a national holiday named after her.
B000002KXV|4.0|Donald Fagen's first solo release is indeed a creative piece of work.  Elements of jazz and rock exist on this soothing piece of work.  A little bit overly synthesized in spots but certainly well thought out both musically and lyrically.  I have a slight preference for The Night Fly  and New Frontiers but all of the tracks are pretty solid if not down right spectacular.  A worthy choice it certainly is.
B00004YRQA|4.0|I have to say the gameplay is helped so much by this fairly inexpensive add-on that it seems odd (& maybe even dishonest on Sony's part) that it was not built in. With the card, which fits neatly & easily into a slot built for it on the front of the PS2, not only does the action flow more smoothly (such as the delay time for new levels of grahpics to load), but games can be saved for later play. It's a must-have, just too bad you have to pay extra.
0452282152|4.0|Okay...I'm not quite finished with this novel, but so far I can appreciate the intent of the author, which is to apply to literature the style of Jan Vermeer's paintings.  The story is very simplistic, very unlike Memoirs of a Geisha.  The plot is almost non-existant.  But what makes this novel worth reading is that you can peer into another place and another time.  The author also creates a very forthright, believable protagonist.  As someone who was raised Catholic, I'm also intrigued by that crucifixion painting in the bedroom.

B00003CXN4|5.0|It is refreshing to know that someone finally has the wherewithal to create a movie that accurately portrays the so-called war on drugs.  Steven Soderbergh has put together a masterpiece that, unfortunately, paints a grim picture of our society.  <br />A beautiful weaving of stories intricately shows that no positive end can come from any action.  Benicio Del Toro gives a gripping performance as a man that wants to better his country but realizes that his effort will be futile in the end.  <br />Catherine Zeta-Jones'  character undergos a metamorphasis of sorts throughout the movie.  In the beginning we see a woman that is ignorant of a situation and through unseen work begins to take the reins into her own hands, all in the name of greed.<br />Perhaps it is Michael Douglas's chracter that clearly understands the best that it is almost pointless to continue this war.  A scene that best summerizes this comes early in the picture.  He is on a plane surrounded by individuals from other agencies, asking for new ideas, for them to think &quot;outside the bubble.&quot;  Silence is the only reply he receives.  <br />The film is amazing to watch, often difficult at times.  The downward spiral of Douglas's daughter is almost painful at moments.  Similar occurances between storylines is just one example of the brilliant filmmaking.  Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman (reunited from Boogie Nights) are wonderful pieces in the film.  Cheadle is becoming one of the best actors in the business.  <br />Along with all of the performances one must not forget the message that is presented.  There is no way this can continue.  Too much money is involved in this business to ever let it die.  It is impossible search each person that enters this country each day.  It is impossible to patrol over 3000 miles of border daily.  This is like a damn that is slowly eroding; you can attempt to patch it up but another leak will come as quickly as the last disappeared.  Think of this from a different angle; if this war on drugs was won, what would happen to all of the government agencies, officers, judges, and jobs that are put into place or created to stop drugs from entering the country?<br />Hmmm......money.
B000056K04|4.0|This album is really different from the \\"Dave Matthews Band\\" albums we've come to expect.  It's not disappointing, just different.  All musical acts grow with time, and people who love the free-spirited nature of DMB songs that stretch on for infinity, may not like this album, but I found it highly listenable, and it's stood the test of time for me.  This album has a tighter, cleaner and more polished feel to it, but has lost that free-spirited flow that made me love DMB in the first place.  It's not my favorite album, but it's still far better than most of what's out there these days. <br />There are some great songs here...The Space Between, in particular has haunted my thoughts since the first time I heard it, and is a really beautiful song.<br />Sleep to Dream her is similarly beautiful, and frankly, doesn't every woman want her man to feel this way? The song is melodic, heartfelt, and the lyrics are simply lovely. Other great songs include I Did It and Mother Father, which has a great message and great sound.

B000035P7S|5.0|I love these wonderful movie since i first watch the film in my home town Ume in North Sweden 1958. Oh, what I loved the wonderful, beautiful Miiko Taka. I all ready own this film on VHS - in full screen. But where is Sayonaras DVD. This movie must be realesed on DVD very soon and in full splendor widescreen. The movie was filmed in Technirama. I look forward for this DVD. Many greatings from a big Sayonara fan.  Bert-Owe Ivland
B000056K04|2.0|People listen to the dave matthews band for touching lyrics and a sound that is like no other, this is achieved by the contrasting insturments and the way they blend together to form a piece of music that tops everything.  Everyday is trash, it feels like it was hastily produced and if i was boyd tinsley i would feel neglected just like his nonexistant violin.  Dave's lyrics just arent there to grab the listener and keep them happy.  Listen to Everyday, then throw on Crash and see how shitty this CD really is.  Everyday attempts to cash in on crappy melodies that have no real business being in a dave matthews album.  I am an old fan and this album just doesnt make the grade for me, it reminds me of Phish's farmhouse, in their attempt to go mainstream.  Its sad to see a group who rocks get away from what they do best.
0780631684|4.0|This is a very interesting thriller in some cases.  Devon Sawa plays a kid who gets a feeling when a plane he's on is going to explode.  He gets off before take off with a few people with him.  After that everythings a mess.  In Final Destiniation there's a theory that your death is planned and Devon figures out the plan.  Now everyone who got off the plane and lived are all starting to die in an order.  The one thing was that when a couple of people died it was like a comedy.  I laughed when they died.  That was quite interesting.  I'd recommend this movie to you but don't expect it to be a drama/thriller because it's not.
B000051S44|5.0|Of all the classic race movies out there this is probably the most minimalistic and puristic one. Don't watch this movie for the rudimentary love story (if one can call it that way). Don't watch it for dialogue - Steve McQueen does not speak more than a 100 words in this film I would guess. Watch this movie for the breath-taking drama that develops in the pictures, since in racing a picture says definitely more than a 1000 words. The camera work is outstanding, and the story is built in a very detail-minded, documentary-type style that matches the coolness of McQueens persona. We see his charcter develop almost entirely in his actions, in the powerful flashback to an accident a year ago that he reflects upon as he returns to the same scene on the same track. As he drives to the track, stops his Porsche at the scene of the accident and stares back into the past, we begin to understand what kind of a racer he is .We see the quiet, yet passionate rivalry between him and his major competitor for the title in the Le Mans 24 hour race and we see his equally quiet interaction with the widow of the fellow driver who perished in that fateful accident. While personal interactions are very subdued, the true passion erupts on the race-track and this movie  is superb in this regard. We see a generous and well-filmed display of the greatest prototypes and road-racers out there at the time. If you are a race-fan, you must see this movie, if you are not, you probably won't get it. As a race fan I give 5 stars.
0790734060|4.0|The movie Amadeus mainly pictures the fight of Antonio Salieri against God. Right from the begining of the movie, the audience sees Salieri complaining to God. He complains why God made Mozart a musical prodigy instead of him. He also complains why he became the son of a father who never encouraged or allowed him to play or learn music. Mozart was very lucky in this respect as his father found the ability in him, right from very young age and made use of his son for live-li-hood by making him sing for the court royalties. Mozart played the piano blind-folded to the surprise of royalties. Salieri had to wait till his father's death to achieve his ambition to be a composer. His hardwork, love and passion for the music enabled him to attain a position of a court composer. At no point does Salieri realises that his struggle and his success as a court composer involved the help of God. There are times in the movie that Emperor Joseph praises Salieri's work. Salieri regards the emperor's compliment but his inner mind was always obsessed with Mozart's genious work which made him unhappy all the time. He knew that his composition was no match to Mozart's as Mozart's music depicted the brilliance, beauty and the grace though people never really enjoyed or understood all his compostions. Salieri's hatred towards Mozart deepens when Salieri finds his lady love was attracted towards Mozart. He asks God why Mozart got all the luxuries of life and not him which almost took his lady love.    God does not give everthing to man. W. A. Mozart had the musical genius in him but his irregular and extravagant life style took the life out of him. He had huge debts and his alcholism supposedly killed him at the age of thirty five. On the other hand Antonio Salieri had a decent, regular life. But his obsession and enviousness towards Mozart ended him up in mental asylum. So better be happy with our God given gifts. Do try to improvise and succeed but never go to the extent of greediness.
B000056K04|2.0|Big Disappointment.  I've been a fan since the beginning, and have always had a little trouble getting accustomed to new albums.  There is always something different with each new album, but it was still Dave.  This is not Dave.. this is every other annoying rock band.  This is the kind of garbage you hear on that one radio station that sounds like the same song playing over and over again.
B0000524CY|5.0|I saw the Exorcist and read the book in 1973.Everything was cool until I went to bed and turned the lites off.Long story short the lites came back on and I kept my shoes next to me in case of a sprent out of the house.This cd version is no exception;well produced,excellent sound and after almost 30 years the lites will stay on again. Well done !!
B000056K04|4.0|While this may not be the best of the DMB albums, and is Dave Matthews Lite, Everyday does have the legs to stand on its own merrits. The album is completely listenable. It is a little on the tight side, lacking some of the looseness and freedom that we have grown accustomed to and probably cherish from DMB, While the album may not have songs that will become all time favorites, the likes of Crash, Crush, Cry Freedom, Satellites, etc. there is still the same, familiar Dave Matthews honesty and truth in the songs from Everyday. I really like The Space Between and Fool to Think. They are excellent lyrics and the hope is that Dave and Co. will do what they are famous for and make these songs into classics when they perform them live. These songs should be rambling ballads and not economical and efficient sound bites. I look forward to the live versions of these songs. Everyday reminds me of Before These Crowded Streets in that it took some time and several listening to grow on me. <br />If there is anything that I find troubling about Everyday is the collaberation with Glen Ballard. He may be an outstandingly successful producer and is probably very professional in how he works, but he did not take into account the tastes of the core DMB fans. For myself, I absolutely loved Dave's &quot;long songs.&quot; I appreciate a song that isn't afraid to be eight or nine minutes long because it has to be and is more effective for it. I enjoyed  the instruments solos that highlight the talents of the band. And while traditional DMB may not play to all of the Zero Attention Span, sound bite seeking public, there are some of us, most of Dave's fans that do have attention spans and will buy an album that lasts longer than an hour to listen to songs that we love that are longer than a sound bite. Dave and the band have always listened to their fans. It is all our hope that they will take the good that they learned from this experience with them to create better Dave Matthews Band Music.<br />A final word, Everyday is better than most everything else out there. We have been spoiled as fans of The Band, but it is no reason to write them off. They are still writing and make the best music today. What we can hope is that it will appeal to a wider audience who will be brought into the fold and will &quot;discover&quot; about the band what we have loved for so many years.
6302752337|5.0|I have got the movie poster in my home. Need I go on? Music is Steppenwolf, Byrds, Hendrix, and a really cool psychedelic tune by the Holy Modal Rounders called If You Want to be a Bird. This is the ultimate journey of unbound freedom in America in a tumultuous time(Assassination, Vietnam War, Civil Rights, Watts Riots, Cold War tensions). Wyatt and Billy are not involved politically in any of this. They are just out to enjoy a lost America that has been forgotten(also check out Zabriskie Point!)due to the establishment and the progress of mankind.Peter Fonda remarks in one scene &quot;This used to be a helluva good country.&quot;
B000002UAR|5.0|I am cheating - I am writing a review of Revolver as it should have been done.  It is well-chronicled how Capitol tore up the Beatles pre-Pepper catalogue stateside; fewer mention the damage the omission of singles from contemporaneous sessions (&quot;Day Tripper&quot;/&quot;We Can Work It Out,&quot; &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;/&quot;Rain,&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;/&quot;Penny Lane&quot;) did even to their British Parlophone albums from the mid-sixties.  If Revolver had been issued in the seventies or later, there's no WAY two great single sides would have been left off the album.  Ideally, I would put &quot;Rain&quot; on side one as the second cut, and &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; on side two between &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; and &quot;I Want to Tell You.&quot; There, now you have an even-more-masterful masterpiece centered in classical guitar-driven pop-rock.  The electric guitar sound they got on &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing,&quot; &quot;Taxman (awesome Paul guitar solo),&quot; &quot;Rain,&quot; &quot;She Said She Said,&quot; &quot;I'm Only Sleeping,&quot; and especially &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; is positively jet-propelled.  Byrds, eat your hearts out.  The songwriting is shatteringly good - Paul's timeless gems (&quot;For No One,&quot; &quot;Here There and Everywhere,&quot; &quot;Good Day Sunshine,&quot; the classic motown knockoff &quot;Got to Get You into My Life,&quot; and &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;) make this his finest hour.  John checks in with one of his best lyrics on &quot;Rain,&quot; which would have been one of the Beatles' coolest and best-performed (the best drumming performance of Ringo's life, great bass work from Paul, terrific guitar tone from George and John, and fine double-tracked singing from John) mid-'60s guitar songs even without them, and of course there's the mind-blowing &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows.&quot;  George's &quot;Taxman&quot; is hip enough to start off the Beatles' coolest album, and his piano-driven &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; dips capably into into Paul's pop-song patois.  Ringo sings John's much-maligned novelty song &quot;Yellow Submarine.&quot;  People would deal with this better if they accepted it as the acid-drenched piece of pop culture that it is, or if it were on the also-masterful White Album, which is stuffed with novelty songs anyway.  The melodic and harmonic invention here (e.g. the guitar riff in the bridge of &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;) beats every other Beatles album - naturally a difficult thing to do.  In fumbling towards the Pepper ethos, the band's experimentation led them to a gorgeously cool idiom of arrangement and performance (with the arguable exception of George's first Indian noodling, &quot;Love You to,&quot; but even that uses the grinding tamboura as a prototype for heavily-distorted guitar) that provides the template for all subsequent pop-rock in its own right.  Even though it's fairly psychedelic, it is much better-grounded in the Beatles' classic songwriting past than subsequent work, and thus stands the test of time.  And in the end, it's better than Pepper.  This album, in its style, songwriting, and diversity, is simply the most influential album of all time, whether it gets the credit or not.  If the single sides had been included, Revolver would be the undisputed champion of pop-rock albums.  Even without them (see VH-1) it might still claim that title.
B00003CWLF|5.0|I have just watched this Region 1 DVD two days ago, it had so much extra things that you can't enjoy in the normal cinema.  The view is superb!  The Director Commentary was excellent, he told you how exactly the whole movie was made in each scenes, very interesting to hear him tell you how he filmed it, and the honost review of some historical facts of this movie, and some funny incidents too, such as Jodie slipped down in one part. He also mentioned a lot of Jodie Foster's contribution to this movie. <br />Get to see the interviews of Jodie and Chow Yun-Fat, the two amasing stars of this movie. The special introduction to production and custome design, where the Oscar Nominated actually did justified on the two most important extra element of this movie.  <br />The deleted scenes were wonderful to watch, anyway, I think Jodie Fans would be interested to watch for the first time Jodie acted an old age lady.  Chow Yun-Fat fans would love to watch more of the charming king.<br />For those who do not want to listen to the Thai, only in this DVD Region 1 collection, you have a choice to select only English to view the movie.  Watch out on the DVD you get, in other regions DVD of this movie did not have all the extra features that I had mention, nor any of the pirated DVD would have that extra features too.  Get the Region 1 &quot;Anna and the King&quot; DVD for your collection.
0345440757|5.0|Tracy,  I hope you get this e-mail.  I want to thank you so very much for your book.<br /> I saw your interview on Dateline and the Today Show.  I than purchased your book. I was getting very frustrated that my son, Will, wasn't sleeping through the night.  He is seven months old and slept through  the night at 3 months and stopped. He would wake at least every hour.  I tried  the crying out method once and it was horrible and couldn't do it again.   So I was up every hour without picking him up, patting him back to sleep.<br /> Your explanation of the three stages of sleeping and to put the   baby down before the falls asleep was great! (I would give him his night time bottle and he would fall asleep while eating, then I would put him down) Since your recommendation to put him before he sleeps and to teach him to fall asleep on his own has been a blessing.  I have had a many full nights of sleep and so has Will.  THANK YOU!<br />Your advice has made this mother very happy and relaxed again.  (It has also helped our marriage, we were very sleep deprived parents)<br /> Again, Thanks!!!!!!<br /> I look forward to your toddler's book.<br /> Fondly, Mary Propst
0425173895|5.0|The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one of the best Agatha Christie has ever written.  When you finish it, you are just stunned.  I had to read it three times before I got over my amazement.  I loved ever minute of it.  It is a must read.
B00000G3PA|3.0|Over the past weekend, my wife and I actually got the opportunity to rent a couple of movies, sit down, and watch them!  (In a large family, such is usually NOT the case!)<br />Three stars for &quot;Armageddon&quot;.  We both enjoyed this movie for it's entertainment value.  (Frankly, I'm wishing I'd seen it on the &quot;Big Screen&quot;.)  Allowing for questionable science (this is Hollywood, after all, not MIT) we both felt that the first half of the movie was well-developed.<br />We were more disappointed with the second half of the picture.  What scientific credibility still remained, was stretched to the breaking point and beyond.  (For an asteroid with no atmosphere, that was one seriously strong wind!)  Also, too many disasters happened to too many people for the survival of any to be believable.<br />However, the special effects were outstanding!  No complaints at all there.  The relationships were developed in a reasonable fashion, and the scenes of prayer from various countries, cultures, and religions around the world was a nice touch.<br />But for such a movie to be effective, the science needs to be at least a LITTLE more plausible!  A far better movie could have been made from Jack McDevitt's &quot;Moonfall&quot;.
B000001Y42|4.0|I love Limp Bizkit's other two albums, but this one is probably the most meaningful. The new stuff is mostly sell-out &quot;look how cool we are&quot; songs. They need to make more music like this. It's loud AND deep! What more could you ask for? Maybe they could have added more songs and made some shorter. The last track, the nearly instrumental Everything, is an insane 16:20 long....if you take that away, the album's only about 45 minutes, not really that long at all.
0800103661|5.0|If you like inspirational movies with amazing characters  portrayed by incredible actors (Ethan, Jude and Uma;) complete with gorgeous cinematography and beautiful music, then I whole-heartedly recommend you buy GATTACA. This is one of my all-time favorite movies. This movie is compelling and completely engulfing to watch.<br />&quot;They used to say that a child conceived in love has a greater chance of happiness--they don't say that anymore. Ten fingers, ten toes--that is all that used to matter--not now. Now only seconds old, the exact time and cause of my death was already known.&quot; [This is referring to the main character Vincent/Ethan Hawke who later becomes Jerome, played by Jude Law.] Vincent was needless to say, an over-protected child due to his health conditions, especially his heart disorder which had a 99% probability of killing him prematurely.<br />When his parents are ready for &quot;a brother for him to play with&quot; they decide to use science and technology to their advantage and go to see a doctor/geneticist. They select hazel eyes, dark hair, fair skin, and &quot;extras&quot; such as no premature baldness or tendencies to violence or obesity. The parents ask if they should leave a few things to chance but the geneticist convinces them otherwise explaining by saying: &quot;keep in mind, this child is still you--the BEST of you. You could conceive naturally 1000 times and never get such a result.&quot; So the parents trust the geneticist and Anton is born-- a child finally worthy in the father's opinion, of his [the father's] name. But do &quot;perfect&quot; genes make one &quot;perfect&quot;? I love the way GATTACA makes the viewer think about this throughout the movie.<br />VINCENT: &quot;I don't know how to thank you.&quot;<br />JEROME:  &quot;I got the better end of the deal. I only lent you my body; you lent me your dream.&quot;<br />GATTACA in my opinion, proves that indeed &quot;there is no gene for fate&quot; and that the human spirit is stronger than any genetic code.it is stronger than any genetic code.
B00004XOWM|4.0|In my last review, I gave Chocolate Starfish five stars. Now, after some deep thinking, I realized that compared to the meaningful Three Dollar Bill, Yall$ and love story-telling Significant Other, (Think about it....) the songs on Chocolate Starfish are more of an attempt to become more popular rather than an attempt to make more great music. Just listen to songs like &quot;Rollin'&quot; and &quot;Livin' It Up&quot;. They're songs about how cool they are. Come on, they can do better than that!<br />The music starts getting really good starting with track 8, The One. The first half contains all the &quot;cool&quot; songs and the second half has all the meaningful songs. Come on, just compare &quot;Hold On&quot; to &quot;My Generation&quot;. They don't even sound like they're by the same band. And what's up with all the joint songs with rap bands? They did a song with Fear Factory on the first album, one with Korn on the second album, but now they're doing all this rap stuff. I like having one rap song in the middle of an album for variety, but they're going overboard. Limp Bizkit needs to make some heavy, meaningful songs, like they did with the first two albums. I hope they realize this before they make the fourth album.
0425107469|5.0|This is the only Dean Koontz book I have read so far, but I have to tell you it was a great book. The very first paragraph just grabbed me and I couldn't put it down. I have told everyone I know to read this book. The characters were so well played out. When i came to the end of the book I didn't want to put down, I just did not want it to end. I loved the dog Eienstein and I felt so much pity for the outsider, because he was so lonely and couldnt stand it. But anyway the book was the best book I have ever read I just might have to read it again.
6301208773|5.0|Everyone else has pretty much covered how great this film is. I just want to make an observation as to how this movie differs from other less realistic and subpar action films:<br />The terrorists didn't kill one another off. Why is it that in every action film the lead terrorist kills off his cohorts at the end. Oh, not only is he evil, but he's not a team player. In this film the bad guys are a team. They were smarter than the good guys. Hans, Marco, Karl, Tito, Jermaine...the terrorists have names and faces as opposed to Rambo style films where 50 people are shot down in five minutes. <br />Also, the DVD is great. I never saw this film in theaters and without that annoying PAN and SCAN, Die Hard is much more effective and exciting.
B00003CWTH|5.0|&quot;Magnolia&quot; is one of the best films ever made, period. I haven't enjoyed a movie so thoroughly the first time through, thought about it for months afterward, watched it again, and was even more astounded by it, ever. Given that it's three-hour running time may turn off the audience members with cases of ADD, but for those of us who stick around, it's a filmmaking experience like no other, driven by the kinetic energy of a director whose sheer joy for the art gives every moment on the screen poignant meaning and visual grace. &quot;Magnolia&quot; was written, produced, and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who uses the music of the under-appreciated Aimee Mann as a temp-track that underlines the entire movie, beginning with the opening to her song &quot;Deathly,&quot; and working backwards. Mann's music is always at the soul of the movie, starting with her jazzed up remake of &quot;One,&quot; getting under our skin during a brilliant montage of all the main characters singing &quot;Wise Up,&quot; and finally knocking us flat on our collective rears with her inspired &quot;Save Me.&quot; (She was robbed by Phil Collins at the Oscars) Yet, amongst all of the music from one of the world's most gifted musical artists, there are some of the finest screen performances of 1999. These performances, along with some fabulously bizarre cinematography from Robert Elswit, are what truly push the movie from its oddly engaging opening monologue to its final heartwarming smile. To describe all of the characters in &quot;Magnolia&quot; would take forever, and considering all of that has been kindly outlined by the folks here at Amazon, I won't repeat it. I'll just say that &quot;Magnolia&quot; contains some of the most originally written characters in the history of cinema. Tom Cruise is electrifying as Frank TJ Mackey, Julianne Moore is terrific as usual, Melora Walters (written with a hint of Aimee Mann insanity) is as jumpy as a grasshopper hopped up on meta-amphetamines, but she pulls it all off nicely, and Philip Seymour Hoffman always wins us over with his heartfelt performance as the nurse to the sickly Earl Partridge, played with devastating authenticity by the late great Jason Robards. And those are just my personal favorite characters. ... I'll say it again, this is one of the very best films I've ever seen, and working in a video store, I've seen a lot of movies. It's endlessly inventive, engaging, wonderful, heartwarming and breaking at the same time, with an endless supply of life being fed into it by one of the best directors since Scorsese. ..., but she pulls it all off nicely, and Philip Seymour Hoffman always wins us over with his heartfelt performance as the nurse to the sickly Earl Partridge, played with devastating authenticity by the late great Jason Robards.

B00004U30D|5.0|&quot;Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it, and my heart is just going to... cave in.&quot; ~Wes Bentley.<br />The first time I saw &quot;American Beauty,&quot; I was five minutes late. I had no idea what I was getting into. All I knew is that the actor who had gotten my attention in such great movies as &quot;The Negotiator&quot; and &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; was in the starring role, and that little kid from &quot;Now and Then&quot; had grown up and was showing off her chest. That was all I knew, all I expected. What I got was something much more than I would've ever expected from any movie: I got a masterpiece of such caliber that it quickly became one of my all-time favorite movies, ranking right alongside &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Army of Darkness.&quot; The movie was like a vacuum that sucked me in from the first frame I laid my eyes on. I laughed my butt off, I was saddened, and I came out of the movie having a completely different perspective on how to live life, because that is what this film is really about: Life. Not so much how to live as how not to live it. We aren't advised to smoke marijuana or develop a crush on our teenage daughter's best friend when we're 42, we aren't advised to have an affair with the local real estate king, we aren't encouraged to film things that are none of our business through our upstairs window, and we aren't encouraged to like or despise homosexuality. We are encouraged, on the other hand, to live life for exactly what it is, not to fake who we are, and to not get so wrapped up in the idea of our own personal success that all other priorities including self and family become less than secondary.<br />Carolyn: Lester, you're gonna spill beer on the couch. Lester: (Stands up, annoyed) So what? It's just a couch! Carolyn: This is a $4000 sofa upholstered in Italian Silk! This is NOT just a couch!

B00003CWL6|5.0|After it won the Academy Award, I had to see what all the hype for &quot;American Beauty&quot; was about.  The hype wasn't misleading; now it is my favorite film of all time.  The story centers around Lester Burnham.  He's living the &quot;american dream&quot; - nice house, nice cars, everything.  But he's bored senseless.  He's alive but he hasn't been *living* for decades.  After meeting Ricky Fitts, his new neighbor, he realizes this boy is everything he used to be and wishes he still could be; care-free, wise, in love with life and happy.  Another person changes his life - his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes.  He falls instantly in love with her and would do anything to have her.  And then he reaches his breaking point - &quot;I feel like I've been in a coma for about 20 years and I'm just now waking up.&quot;  He quits his job, tells his wife off, uses drugs, and wins over Angela.  He drops the banality of everyday American life - wake up, work, sleep, repeat - and becomes free-spirited.  This transformation is inspiring to say the least.  <br />Everyone in this movie is perfectly cast.  Kevin Spacey seems like he was born to play Lester, as Al Pacino seemed to be for Michael Corleone.  Annette Benning plays the cutesy, money-obsessed wife perfectly.  Mena Suvari is a good choice for an ordinary teen since she has starred in ordinary teen movies like American Pie.  Wes Bentley does the introverted Ricky perfectly.  Even Ricky's parents are played to the dot.<br />There's a lot of inspiring wisdow here that I hope even the naysayers recognize - &quot;This isn't life, this is just stuff.  And it's become more important to you than living.&quot;
6305308659|5.0|I very much wanted to watch this movie when it was screened in Singapore in 1998/9, but was prevented from doing so by my busy schedule. However, recently I had the privilege to watch this video on CD. <br />Beyond the simple and easily-understood plot, I find a disturbingly strong and genuine message in the story. It was in a conformist world that the 2 children Bud and Mary Sue found /helped find true &quot;liberty&quot;. Ironically, the liberty the citizens of PLEASANTVILLE was but a hoax conjured by social beliefs and refusal to accept changes. And it was easy to capture the message as the ignorant ones are still in B&amp;W (Notice when Mary Sue turned to technicolor, for those who are against the sex part of the movie...)<br />It seems natural and indeed it is, that every human being has a potential to discover their gifts to the fullest, yet may be conditioned to choose to bury them by lies which appear rosy. Under the façade? Only something less desirable. <br />Another aspect touched on which I felt was worthy of mentioning was the unsettling discontentment of people, because of the difficulties they face in an imperfect world, and try all they can to look for the long-anticipated UTOPIA, thinking that human effort would be more than sufficient to establish something long lasting and perfect. Well, no. The movie with its succinct message: People are stifled as a result. <br />The movie provokes interesting questions about life, yet at the same time highlights the impossibilty of utopias on Earth. In fact utopia-seekers are pretentiously denying their attitude of escapism. So to all looking for PLEASANTVILLE, stop looking, and learn to accept change.

0393317552|5.0|Anyone suggesting they could encompass all human history in a mere 400 pages should be  met with derisive scorn.  Diamond, against all logic, has accomplished this feat, and done it  admirably.  The question, 'why do white people have so much and black people so little?', is a  valid query of increasing importance.  In responding, he describes how humans developed  agriculture, domesticated animals and attained a sedentary life.  This change from a nomadic  hunter-gatherer society led to new diseases.  Immunity to them was later gained only over the  passage of time.  Utilization of natural resources lead to utilization of natural resources to  create superior weapons, allowing settled peoples to become imperialists, an anachronism  considered logically.<br />He anticipates the criticism of 'geographical determinism' certain to be raised, but his case  remains based on several grand geophysical concepts.  He starts with the idea that the East- West axis of Eurasia gave that region many advantages of temperate climate and easy  mobility, as opposed to the Americas' North-South orientation.  He continues with an assessment of the native  fauna of various regions for the likelihood of domestication.  Although little cultural is  discussed here, he describes how small bands of humans grew to villages then larger  agglomerations leading to 'kleptocracies' [a wonderful term!] in which wealth was no longer  evenly distributed.  Such a social structure led to the rise of nation-states which could engage  in greater imperialist enterprises.<br />While Diamond portrays humanity's movements around the globe, some aspects clearly  require further  explanation.  He stipulates that the Americas could have been populated in  less than a millennia.  What prompted such a rapid expansion if game foods were readily  available?  He describes the barriers to cultural exchange throughout Mesoamerica, such as  beasts of burden in the Andes never being merged with Mayan wheels and crops raised  successfully in one area being unsuitable in another.  What drove humans over the isthmus to  another continent?  Did people really move so rapidly over vastly differing environments  while losing communication with their points of origin?<br />In keeping to his broad-brush approach, Diamond avoids cultural issues until the Epilogue.  Only then does he raise Christianity and Islam as imperialist societies in contrast with other  cultures.  It was astonishing to discover that, in the last analysis, Diamond fails to answer the  very question that resulted in this book.  This is not a failure on his part.  He impressively  covers the 'how' of social structures and their impact on what seems to be a natural tendency  for humans to migrate.  Yet, his original question addresses European expansion to other,  already occupied, lands.  Having already absolved capitalism as the motivation, it is  surprising that he ignores the role of Christianity in European imperialism.  Diamond may be  forgiven for avoiding this issue since his analysis focuses on the environmental benefits  Eurasians enjoyed before beginning their global conquest.  But European expansion has had  such an impact on world cultures that motivation requires a more fervent appeal for  resolution than the mild query found at the close of the book.  Still, we can't address that  question properly without the background Diamond has provided.<br />His call for further study is welcome for many reasons.  Anyone involved in international  programs will find this book a useful resource.  It dispels many commonly-held myths still  held even by professionals who deal with 'Third World' countries.  A careful reader will see  questions posed in a new framework and take note of these to their benefit.  His description of  the vast ranges of human movement must now be considered in light of the world's current  trend to balkanization.  Now that we have nowhere to go, in what direction will that heritage  of continuous movement take us?  Read Diamond to provide the necessary background, then  ask yourself these and related questions.  It's well worth the time, and reading him is not a  strenuous task.uous movement take us?

I mean come on, a &quot;flipper&quot;?!<br />I gave the movie 5 stars but Warners 0 stars for their treatment of a classic.  Note to WB:  Dual Layer!!  Deleted Scenes!!

B000002AP1|4.0|Obviously different, but not necessarily better, than the original vinyl. Iggy's insistance on remixing this himself to keep the mix &quot;violent&quot; has resulted in a sound that is dense and fuzzy where it was once thin and tinny. Certainly, it's added some much-needed bottom end, but you'd be hard pressed to say it now sounds good. Or even close to good.<br />But then, it wouldn't really be Raw Power if it did, would it? Personally, I like the new mix, with its &quot;heys!&quot; and added guitar bits, and the fuzz does add some muscle to a lot of the tracks, particularly &quot;Shake Appeal&quot; and &quot;Death Trip.&quot; So caveat emptor: If you're buying this with the expectation of a techno-clean digital remix, you're in for a huge disappointment. But if you dig the primal chaos of the Stooges to begin with and want to hear this bad boy with some compression and bass tacked on, you can't go wrong here -- Raw Power indeed.
1573225517|4.0|I saw this movie on video about a year ago, and certain scenes kept playing in my head.  I happened upon the book at the library one day so I picked it up and didn't put it down until I was done.  It was even funnier than the movie (except for the telephone to the jaw and ensuing fight scene where I almost peed my pants I was laughing so hard).  The book has a laid back feeling that you can't find in a Hollywood movie (Heaven forbid!) and you can sit back, relax, and have a great time.  My husband and I create Top 5 lists all the time now, but ours aren't as cool since they all revolve around our sons.  Maybe that could be a good sequel for Mr. Hornby: Top 5 happiest moments since he married Laura.  But even if he did write it (no way he'd write a sequel, he isn't American), a sequel is much too Hollywood for Mr. Cusack, thank goodness.  It's a fun read.
B000056K04|3.0|come on people, im a fan of dmb, and the cd isnt what i expected.  i expected grey street, bartender, grace is gone etc.  but what i got was a decent dave cd.  Everyone is getting down on the band for sounding teeny bopperish (i know that's not a real word)  but they're supposedly doing what they want to do and what makes them happy.  if u've heard any of the 'old new songs', they were all depressing.  a little too mellow.  u could feel what dave was feeling in those songs.  he was depressed.  so when i picked up the new cd i found that he's obviously a happier man since everyday.  i get goosebumps when i think about what the guys can do to these songs once the summer tour starts.  All i can say is the new cd isnt that bad for old school dave fans.  let's just hope they steer clear of ballard for now on.
B0000069Z6|5.0|My sister gave my sons this video for Christmas.  I'll admit, I was a little apprehensive at first because my three year old has never been interested in watching anything on TV.  But he watches this at least once every day, sometimes more.  And can anyone imagine a very active 18-month old sitting still for 20 minutes?  That's what I get when I put this on.  My oldest son especially likes the Christmas aspect of it, he loves the holiday lights.  He also loves watching the Scottish snowman dancing in his kilt.  My youngest son always laughs when the snowman scares the cat.  I always enjoy listening to the music, it matches the motions perfectly, and the singing part when James and the Snowman fly to the north is beautiful.  I hope I can someday find the CD.  This film is truly a treasure, I just hope our video doesn't break from overuse.
B000058983|5.0|When this album was first released in late 1967 (Elektra), it seemed way beyond the pale, as though it had been produced in an alternate rock universe.  But just mention it to those lucky fans who were aware of it at the time and their eyes widen, their voices drop into hushed tones of awe.  &quot;Forever Changes&quot; was the breath of genius.  With time, more and more rock critics have come to share that view.  Even if you already own this album in another format, buy this CD.<br />The first CD version of this classic (Elektra/Asylum 1987) was typically nothing special in the audio department.  The next version, presented in full on the two-CD boxed set, &quot;Love Story 1966-1972&quot; (Rhino 1995), was dramatically better sonically - everything brought forward, especially the bass, with lots more detail.  However, although all the songs on &quot;Forever Changes&quot; were included (in indication of how highly regarded the album was), they were split between the two CDs.  The new, intact re-master is a real joy.  Although it may be hard for most listeners to detect any obvious sonic improvement over the &quot;Love Story&quot; boxed set (meaning only that Rhino did a great job on the boxed set), with a good sound system and a careful listen you can indeed hear greater detail.  Actually, it's one of the most impeccable sonic presentations I've heard on any CD.  The bonus tracks are a really nice addition, same high sonic quality, rounding out our appreciation for the original Love's final, brilliant recording sessions, from which &quot;Forever Changes&quot; was born.  The 24-page CD booklet is also quite nice, with lots of text detailing the history of Love and frontman Arthur Lee, and the genesis and production of &quot;Forever Changes&quot;, track by track.  Thanks, Rhino, for giving this masterpiece everything it has so long deserved.

I did, even though I thought they could have done a few better things with the plot.<br />Well, miraculously, they addressed my concerns in this DVD package by including a prior cut of the movie, with varying scenes and a (in my opinion) better ending. While this bonus cut isn't of high quality, it is still worth a fan's time to watch it at least once.<br />If you're not a fan of the Highlander theme, I can't honestly recommend this movie to you. But if you are a fan, then it is a must have.
B00000J2KY|5.0|Lolita is a very entertaining and charming film. Sue Lyon is perfect as Lolita, as is the very talented James Mason in the role of Humbert Humbert. The book of the same name was very controversial back in the early 60's because it featured a middle aged man who was obsessed with the pre-teen daughter of his girlfriend. In the movie version, Lolita's age was increased by a few years, but even with this accomodation, the film still became cotroversial.
0345440757|5.0|I have just about finished this book &quot;Secrets of the Baby Whisperer&quot;.  It's a wonderful book for parents!!  I am an RN working in a Newborn Intensive Care Unit in Anchorage, Alaska. Because we are caring for the premature/immature infant, we teach our staff and parents about &quot;Developmental Care&quot; for the infants in the unit.  Although the terminology may be a bit different, we teach staff and parents many of the same techniques for caring for their infant.  Such as watching the baby and his cues, talking to him before touching and while providing care, decreasing stimulation, swaddling, holding and comforting, etc. I could go on, My guess is a lot is common sense.  It is the one thing parents sometimes forget when they have a new baby, especially a fussy, crying baby.  This book was the first I have read that focused so accurately, at least in my opinion, on the baby and what his needs are, and that the baby can communicate those needs.  For the NICU community, Developmental Care has progressed through the years with Brazelton's Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale and Heidelise Als  Neonatal Individualized Developmental Care Assessment Program.  In the medical world doctors need scientific proof that &quot;Developmental Care&quot; is a benefit to the babies.  It is refreshing to read a book and see parents benefiting from that information without a doctor questioning if the techniques were backed up by scientific proof!<br />Suzann Julien, RN
B000056K04|4.0|Dave Matthews Band has a reputation for never-ending jams and out-of-control saxophone and violin solos.  Sure, this is the music that we have all grown to love, but wouldn't it be interesting and fun to have something new?          That's why we now have EVERYDAY, their newest album.  And while this is widely referred to as a &quot;radio album,&quot; its factor of entertainment nearly lives up to the band's success.          But don't get me wrong, after my first listening, my thoughts were &quot;this sucks&quot; and &quot;they're sell-outs.&quot;  However, after several more listenings, the music started to grow on me.  That's what's great about DMB: their VERSATILITY.  They have the talent to play on many colors without losing their identity.  And even though Ballard pushed the violin and sax into the background, they don't take away exceedingly much from this new, polished sound.            I would recommend EVERYDAY to both fans and people who are just starting to get interested in the group.  It's good to have this DMB &quot;mini-album&quot; to listen to if you don't have time to listen to their other 75-min cd's.  And believe me, after several listenings, you'll start to think, &quot;this is kinda' cool!&quot;

B00003CXN4|5.0|Tom Reynolds has already written a great plot summary so I will focus on the other aspects that make this movie the best of 2000.  First among these is the great acting.  Previous reviewers have knocked Zeta-Jones' performance, but I don't think I could disagree more.  I, like most, have not found her to be the greatest actor in the past (Entrapment, The Mask of Zorro, The Haunting *shudder*) but in this role she really comes through as the rags to riches, cocktail party wife who will do whatever it takes to hang on to her station in life.  She and Erika Christensen as the addicted daughter are the surprise rolls of the film.  Don Cheadle and Benicio Del Toro are great as always, conveying the conflicts and emotions of their characters perfectly.  Michael Douglas also shines playing a roll very similar to his billionaire in The Game: a powerful man whose notions of the way the world works are slowly being shattered.  <br />Soderbergh directs the huge movie perfectly, balancing these various life stories perfectly while never loosing the sense of urgency and purpose that drives the movie forward.  He shoots each story differently (Soderbergh was cinematographer too under a pseudonym).  And his use of lens filters and editing is nothing short of brilliant: from the deep blue of Douglas' Washington to the wind-blown yellow of Del Toro's Mexico, to the soft, richly colored world of Zeta-Jones's suburban mansion.<br />Overall this movie is everything you could want from a great film: a riveting story, great actors, and brilliant directing.
B000001GXJ|5.0|This recording is without a doubt DG's crowning achievement in their long association with La Scala. Are there relly any weaknesses? Cappuccilli has been rightly criticized for his lack of vocal coloring, but few baritones have understood Verdi as well as he, and he shows himself to be a master of the text. Freni is superb as Amelia, Ghiaurov and Van Dam wonderful as Fiesco and Paolo, and even Fioani shines in the character role of Pietro. Anyone who hasn't heard Carreras before his illness in the late 80's should listen to this to see what all the fuss was about...here he is in his his absolute prime:golden voiced, full of youth and ardor with a ringing top. All this led by the great Abaddo in glorious sound! This is surely one of the greatest and most consistant Verdi recordings to date!

B000056K04|3.0|The songwriting was a lot better than before these crowded streets. But it came at the expense of the terrific instrumentals. It seemed like Glen Ballard was trying to downplay that aspect of the band, because he is a songwriter and producer and doesn't have the jamming mindset. I think it was good that he added the structure that he did, but then they should have cut loose at least in some parts. This album really does not show their talents, just Glen and Dave's songwriting abilities. The songs are good, but if it had unleashed the talents of the band to back it up it could have been so much better. Ballard took some weight off the band's shoulders which is good. I hope they get back to their free form roots though, and take it to the next level.
0767821629|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Thirteenth Floor as a movie, but I should probably warn people who hear that it's &quot;like The Matrix&quot; that the similarities end after the basic concept of having a completely immersive virtual world. <br />Fortunately for TTF, this is a very good thing. Where The Matrix took a relatively good concept for a movie and threw special effects at it, TTF took a similar premise and chose to do more in terms of development. Indeed, special effects in this movie are fairly minimal, with far greater effort and detail going into modeling 1940s Los Angeles than camera tricks.<br />The plot is summarized in several other reviews, so I'll simply add my own comments. The movie has a fairly somber tone and a methodical pace. You'll probably see most of the developments well before they're revealed. However, I consider it a fallacy to believe that predictability is necessarily a bad thing. In the case of TTF, it springs from a very thoroughly fleshed out plot, which is a a nice contrast from random plot twists that are not uncommon in sci-fi movies.<br />Comparisons between The Matrix and eXistenZ seem to occur a lot with this movie, but while they do all share a common basic concept, they're really very different movies. eXistenZ is really more oriented towards the idea of an immersive virtual reality as a game, and The Matrix towards that idea as a method of oppression, but The Thirteenth Floor really takes the idea and tries to really establish a solid story with human drama that might occur given this technology/universe.
0930289234|4.0|If any one book can destroy the inherent prejudice against comics storytelling, this is the one.  A serious, beautifully written story that just happens to be a graphic novel - and one that takes advantage of the form to the utmost.  Moore actually clothes his literary ambitions in the costume of the super-hero genre, and then like all important Modernists he rewrites that genre from the inside-out.<br />This is a serious, speculative look at what society would be like if there were costumed adventurers fighting crime and the countries enemies, including one who does have super-powers.  The 'heroes' are people though, with faults that veer, dangerously, towards the narcissistic, the cynical, and the psychotic.  The graphic nature allows the story to be told within the context of a finely detailed and solid alternate world, with a social and political situation that has been created by the presence of the 'heroes.'  It also allows some tour-de-force storytelling, as a comic within the book parrallels the unfolding story, and is itself a masteful comic book narrative!  Also, a city intersection where much of the storytelling takes place is exacly placed, so that the visual narrative through time and space can be sighted along its different axes.  Brilliant craftsmanship.<br />The only flaw is that the conclusion lets some steam out of the tremendous suspense that has been built up, but it is apt within the world of the story.  This is a great choice for anyone curious about how high, and successful, a reach graphic storytelling can have.
630575067X|3.0|You could go on forever about the short-comings and flaws of the first episode in the Star Wars saga but simply put; this should have been a brilliant movie, it wasn't.  Hype and hysteria aside, the only real expectations this film had to live up to were the ones set by it's extrodinary predessecors; the characters, the engaging story and that elusive gem that simply makes a Star Wars movie what it is.  Yet this film falls short on all of these aspects, except the special effects,  which dazzling as they are, do not make for a great movie.<br />The spunk and attitude of Han Solo and Princess Leia is sorely missed, in it's place is drolling dialogue from strangely sombre and serious characters who you simply cannot relate to.  Little Anaking Skywalker is just too nice to become Darth Vader, a simple hint of wickedness would have been so rewarding to the viewer all too aware of what is to come.  Queen Amidala had so much potential, the talented Natalie Portman clearly tries to breathe life into flat lines and situations but there's not much hope.  Darth Maul's evil appearance could rival Darth Vader's breathing mask anyday, but the character itself is a waste from start to finnish.  Obi Wan Kenobi has none of the warmth brought to him by Alec Guinness, and Ewan McGreggor tries just too hard at the Englsih accent.  <br />The plot of Star Wars movies have always been simple but here Lucas goes in a different direction of galactic politics and trade disputes, a far cry from the pure simplicity of the ways of the force (midi-chlorians are a blatant example of this)<br />But at the end of the day, the special effects are breathtaking, from the exhilerating podrace to precision-cut execution of the 3-way lightsaber battle.  The screen gleams and sihines of colour from beginning to end, but it could be Lucas' new found obsession with computer effects that is tarnishing the concept of the film itself.
B00003BDXG|5.0|For me watching 'NBK' was like an enlightment because showed very clearly and from inside the system how screwed up and chaotical the &quot;modern&quot; society is. The final scenes by the sound of &quot;Burn&quot; from Nine Inch Nails simbolyzes theses new times. The riot scene is antological if not epic. It ilustrates the downfall of civilized society and the law of animals, where logic and feeling are replaced by the bloody and coward fight for survival. And because of the fact that 'NBK's message continues so shockingly and actual its a movie i recommend
B000059RL3|4.0|Some quick thoughts on the Deluxe Edition:<br />1) The previous &quot;deluxe edition&quot; of the album (the one with the slipcase and the David Ritz essay) still may be the ideal issue, although I've noticed the remastering on the newest edition de-emphasizes the bassiness of that remastering (of the released mix.)  Some may find this a step backward, but it's my feeling that this time around the technical team was aiming for a more &quot;authentic&quot; mastering - U.S. engineers watched the levels more closely in the early 70s! <br />2)  The Detroit mix begins and ends brilliantly; I prefer the title track, &quot;What's Happening, Brother&quot;, and &quot;Inner City Blues&quot; to the released versions; they have more grit and wit than the released mixes, and causes me to wonder if applying a given production strategy to an entire album is always preferable.  However, some of the material in the middle simply sounds unfinished, and the mix of Marvin's voices with the instrumental tracks can be uncomfortable. <br />3) If there's any single reason to buy this set, it is Disc 2.  Marvin was reportedly never comfortable in live situations, but his 1972 Kennedy Center show displays some remarkable vocal bits; and the songs sometimes benefit from the skeletally-rhythmic nature of the band's performance.  Marvin's pianistic skills are also highlighted, and the entire show sounds more like Trouble Man than What's Going On, which is interesting and, for me, a good thing.<br />4) The nascent &quot;Distant Lover&quot; is hilarious.

B0000256VK|5.0|Is there such a thing as the perfect 80s album? The Cure's &quot;Disintegration&quot; maybe. New Order's &quot;Substance&quot; perhaps. But I always find myself skipping a few songs on my way through those CDs. Not so with &quot;Avalon&quot; by Roxy Music. From beginning to end there's not a note, chord, or lyric that goes unsavored. It could quite possibly be the most perfect album of the decade, if not the century.

0783219172|5.0|The Frighteners harks back to those wonderfully entertaining films of the 1980's where a highly polished plot, loveable (non-stereotyped) characters, dazzling special effects and a tongue held firmly in the cheek combined to provide movies that the whole family could watch and enjoy. But then, what did you expect from Robert Zemeckis, or Michael J. Fox for that matter, for whom this film is the high point of a tragically up-down career due to Parkinson's Disease. Obviously The Frighteners is for a slightly older audience, but it retains the childlike appeal of those 80's films without being childish. It even manages to poke fun at Twin Peaks, the X Files, Ghost, Full Metal Jacket and Psycho, whilst passing comment on the fashion-sense of the 1970's and humorously exposing the eccentricities of small town life, and being an engrossingly semi-scary movie at the same time. In short, it's got a bit of everything for everyone.<br />The star of this film is its ability to combine elements. There's an ancient mass murder, a lunatic asylum, a haunted house, a murderous ghost, an overbearing mother, a guilty daughter, a psychic investigator who can see ghosts, a recently widowed doctor, a woman-fearing FBI Agent, and a multitude of ghosts from all eras of history, yet it never bites off more than it can chew. An even better combination is in the actors; Michael J. Fox as the untypical hero is perfect beside the gorgeous Trini Alvarado as untypical heroine (she actually has personality); the regular Hollywood actors are brilliantly offset by cult oddball Jeffrey Combs in a decidedly non-mainstream turn of acting; Jake Busey once again proves he is a more than adequate replacement for the love-to-hate figure of Gary. Amidst high-spills, otherworldly encounters, psychic flashbacks and psychotic personalities, the humour and human element weave seamlessly in and out of one another, at once horrifying and hysterical. And for the more discerning viewer, the switch from closed to open form camerawork, especially in the confrontational scene between Combs and Fox in the Sheriff's Department, is a definite filmmaking plus to look out for.<br />What more is there to say? The Frighteners engrosses you, scares you, makes you laugh, has you gasping and cheering in all the right places, and is filled with so many interesting minor details (such as one ghost's electrocution scars) that you can watch it time and time again. Zemeckis has been quoted as saying: \\"Good directing is good writing and good casting, that's all!\\" The Frighteners is the only evidence you need to prove that.pen form camerawork, especially in the confrontational scene between Combs and Fox in the Sheriff's Department, is a definite filmmaking plus to look out for.<br />What more is there to say?

B00004T9UF|4.0|&quot;What is it in Itself?&quot; is a question posed by Hannibal Lecter to Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs, and it applies very well when attempting to review Eminem's controversial smash, The Marshall Mathers LP.  Sure, there's sadistic humor, deliberately offensive lyrics, cool hooks and a good mix of both dance and pure rap beats, but what's it all for?  Eminem is a fascinating artist because he lays his feelings out for all to see; the offensive opinions are simply the device he uses to communicate the dominating emotion of his life - anger.  That is why his music is so popular and so good, because it is grounded in an emotion that we can relate to, as well as an expression that we all know.  We all feel angry and we all vent it by blaming the world around us, and The Marshall Mathers LP recognizes both the personal and universal aspects of anger and blame, as Eminem rants against personal and societal demons viciously and with a great deal of talent.  Therein lies the most important key to enjoying this album; recognize the talent.  As with any message, the judgment of whether it is offensive or not is in the hands of the person receiving the message.  What cannot be debated, however, is how well the message is delivered.  Sit back and, if you can, turn off your reactions to the words and listen to the raw emotion and sheer talent displayed on the most influential (if not necessarily the best) album of 2000.
B000056PWV|5.0|Though it's unfashionable to say it, I'm not a big fan of Hitchcock. I watched Psycho, Frenzy, The Birds, Vertigo and Rope, and could not for the life of me work out why he was so popular, but then, after seeing it parodied in a `Simpsons' episode, I saw Rear Window. What, in the first five minutes, seemed a good 50's-era Hitchcock film became, within ten minutes, a good film, period. Rear Window is incredible in terms of acting, writing, filmmaking, everything. I've never liked James Stewart either, but in this film he is fantastic, and playing against Grace Kelly is a work of pure genius. Shot entirely within one room (except after Stewart has left the room, shall we say), it places the viewer in Stewart's position, trapped inside his two-room apartment, with nothing to do but gaze out of the window, and as such this creates an incredible level of empathy with the character. You feel his claustrophobia at the same time as feeling his compulsion to watch, and thus in terms of placing you within the film, Rear Window has no near rivals.<br />The beauty of this film is in the simplicity of its construction. A guy, a girl, a room, and an apartment building opposite containing what looks like a wife-murderer. Perhaps because there are so few things to watch, you watch ten times harder than you watch other films. Anyone who has any voyeuristic tendencies (voyeur meaning the pleasure of looking, without the negative connotations of Peeping Toms) will love this film, and based on the success of shows like Big Brother and Survivor, there are a lot of people out there who take pleasure in looking. But not only is it great to watch, the characterisation is exceptional; Kelly and Stewart are great as the odd-couple Jeffries and Lisa, and serial-massager Stella is a wonderful counterpoint full of home-spun philosophies and unintentional witticisms. As the film progresses and the originally sceptical Lisa and Stella both become drawn into Jeffries' voyeurism, you are drawn too, so that when, towards the end, the line between watching and acting is crossed, you feel the increased sense of danger and excitement that they do. But it is not a tense film; it is hailed as a work of suspense, but it is difficult to see it as that. Rear Window is realistic, compelling folk drama, plain and simple and incredibly addictive.<br />Admittedly, it's not everyone's cup of tea. I have friends who call it slow-paced and lacking in spectacle, but to me, every scene is imbued with some kind of hook that keeps you watching. Every character across the way has an evolving story, so even when the main story takes the back seat, you remain glued to the screen. As there can be unputdownable books, so this is an unlookawayable film. It is by far the best Hitchcock I have ever seen and is still better than 99% of films made today. To me, it is an asset to every film collection, regardless of whether you're into Hitchcock or not. You could definitely do worse than owning a copy of this.so that when, towards the end, the line between watching and acting is crossed, you feel the increased sense of danger and excitement that they do.

B000003TAR|4.0|There's not a single rational rock fan on earth who will not agree that Nevermind is one of the most pivotal and influential recordings of all music history.  However this jagged, vitriol, ear shattering grunge masterpiece may just eclipse Nevermind for its unrelentled harshness and shear attitude.  Korbain's songwritting is just as brilliant on In Utero than any where else (Pennyroyal tea, Heart Shaped Box, and Dumb all exemplify this).  The mind numbing force of the angsty rockers &quot;serve the servants&quot; and &quot;rape me&quot; are enough to make you wet your pants.  This album has all the indie street cred and edge of Sub Pop albums like Bleach, yet it has just the right amount of produciton refinement and songcraft that Nevermind contains.  This album is a soul shattering classic.  Not as important in the grand scheme of things as Nevermind, but it has to be the best example of what Nirvana was as a band and proof of Korbain's musical sainthood.
0792151712|5.0|There's a lot that can be said about Titanic. From a cold, objective viewpoint, it is not the best made film of all time. James Cameron's blue lightbulb returns with a vengeance, lighting up every night-shoot as it did throughout Aliens, The Abyss and Terminator 2. The acting is not the greatest ever, Leonardo Di Caprio emulating a Hollywood pretty boy and not the great character actor that I firmly believe he is. The music is syrupy and over-emotional. The script falls flat in far too many places to make a coherent whole. The computer graphics are just that: computer graphics. The cross-barrier love story is pass&eacute;. The incredible historical accuracy is blown by a poorly-timed middle-finger `birdy' gesture (not invented until years after the Titanic sailed). Cameron's stubby fingers that draw a gratuitously nude Kate Winslet are clearly not Di Caprio's. The final hour and a half's over dependence on special effects divorces you from the love story, so the ending does not move you. And, worst of all, it spawned an annoyingly gushy song. From a cold, objective viewpoint, Titanic is appalling.<br />From a warm, subjective viewpoint, Titanic is great. It is one of those few films that completely sucks you into its world and smothers you in every nuance of the story. In hindsight, you can slag it off all you want, but whilst you're watching it you forget you're watching a film, and you forget you're you. Your own life be damned, you care about Jack and Rose as if they are parts of yourself. It's as if you're wearing blinkers; you're so absorbed, you're on the Titanic and sailing onwards towards a fateful rendezvous with destiny. You want to be Jack Dawson, and you fall in love with Rose just as he does (unless you're a girl, in which case I'm assuming it's the other way around). It sounds cheesy, but there are so many people I know who claim that Titanic changed their life, and I'm one of them. Jack Dawson's `make each moment count' philosophy meant that I followed my dreams rather than doing a stuffy university degree course (English Lit and Psychology). It works as a painkiller too - any time you want to escape your own life, just watch Titanic, and for three hours nothing matters to you more than the poignant intrigues of two characters onboard the tragically-fated liner. There is no tangible reason as to why this film is so absorbing, given the objective viewpoint, but there is something there that prevents it ever getting boring and keeps drawing you back into its soporific world. Titanic is truly a monumental moment in film history, and a treasured classic you'll keep returning too.<br />Obviously, it depends on your viewpoint as to whether you'll like this film. I heard plenty of people saying it was an hour and a half too long, that the opening half of the film is nothing more than a chick flick and could have been ditched in favour of the last half. To those people I'd say: try and switch off your objectivity. If you open yourself to this movie, turn off all the lights, unplug the phone and watch it with a genuine sensitivity, it cannot fail to seduce you and charm itself into your favour. Unlike other films, it has that ability to convince you it's entirely real. It's an escapist's dream. So not only do you get a video, you get a whole other world. That can't be half-bad, now, can it?reams rather than doing a stuffy university degree course (English Lit and Psychology). It works as a painkiller too - any time you want to escape your own life, just watch Titanic, and for three hours nothing matters to you more than the poignant intrigues of two characters onboard the tragically-fated liner. There is no tangible reason as to why this film is so absorbing, given the objective viewpoint, but there is something there that prevents it ever getting boring and keeps drawing you back into its soporific world. Titanic is truly a monumental moment in film history, and a treasured classic you'll keep returning too.<br />Obviously, it depends on your viewpoint as to whether you'll like this film. I heard plenty of people saying it was an hour and a half too long, that the opening half of the film is nothing more than a chick flick and could have been ditched in favour of the last half. To those people I'd say: try and switch off your objectivity. If you open yourself to this movie, turn off all the lights, unplug the phone and watch it with a genuine sensitivity, it cannot fail to seduce you and charm itself into your favour. Unlike other films, it has that ability to convince you it's entirely real. It's an escapist's dream. So not only do you get a video, you get a whole other world. That can't be half-bad, now, can it?
B00003CWL6|3.0|Perhaps I'm judging this movie a little unfairly--that is, against the hype and excessive accolades it received rather than against only its own successes and failures.  It IS, after all, an entertaining, enjoyable film. But I would not call it a great film.  Enough has been said about the great performances--yeah, they're great, but....<br />It is a message film about middle age, suburban American life, and base materialism.  As a message film, though, it is very odd.  Lester Burnham,<br />successful executive, burns out, blackmails his boss, quits his job, and develops the hots for his teenage daughter's best friend.  <br />His shrewish wife, meantime, starts a romp with a local hot shot real estate agent, who turns her on not only to adultery, but to shooting, too, offering the cliched explanation that it makes him feel powerful.<br />Lester's daughter starts hanging out with the weird, pot-dealing son of the fascistic Marine (yes, THAT old cliche) next door.  The boy's father beats the tar out of him routinely, and with particular violence when he suspects his boy might be gay.  Not soon after, during a painful scene of misunderstanding that results from the boy assuring his father that he and Lester have been having sex (not true; he said it to hurt his father), the father makes a pass at Lester.  Yes, ANOTHER cliche:  the Nazi-like homophobe (who actually collects Nazi war relics!)  who is really gay himself! <br />And what about the other messages?  That the best way to deal with a difficult marriage, and life's disappointments is to quit your job, start smoking dope, and paw your daughter's friends?  Seriously?<br />The only normal, well-adjusted people in this  movie are Lester's gay neighbors (the other neighbors), whom we only briefly meet.  I  wonder...is this a message, too?
006092988X|5.0|I loved every page of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.  I finished all 483 pages in it in less then a week (which it really good for me.)!  It's diffentetly a classic, and you don't know what your missing it you pass up to chance to read it.  Through reading this book, it really made me thankful for all that I have and all that I take for granted it.  It made me feel really blessed. I recommend this book to eveybody!
B000056K04|5.0|When I heard DMB were coming out with a new album I was very pumped.  I've been a big fan through the years, and I thought that a new album meant some good quality music to listen to.  I had heard some things that were a little skeptical about the album, but I thought &quot;If it's Dave, it's worth exploring.&quot;  How very right I was.  I think that this album is some of the best material DMB have come up with, and considering the capabilities they have, that's sayin a lot.  However, I was reading some other reviews, and I couldn't believe the comments some other people were making!  I mean, when DMB come up with some new stuff you call them sell outs?  Isn't the whole point of music to broaden one's horizon and achieve a further grasp and knowledge about their capabilities?  If the people who wanted the old Dave back ran the music industry, then we'd only here one genre of music, because they would be so closed minded to change that when something new came along they would ignore it and stick to their old overplayed archives of overplayed material.  I myself am a musician, and hearing some of the stuff they play on this album has thoroughly impressed me.  Dav's guitar is still in mint condition as well as all the other guys.  I think that those who can't appreciate the sheer genius of this cd are probably just not developed musically themselves.  As for the jamming sessions in the other cd's, I admit that those are awesome, but I think a song can be just as good without them.  To summarize this review, I think I'll say that this album deserves recognition, and to all you people scared of change and all that stuff, I just have to ask you one simple question... If you think this stuff sucks, then why don't you try writing anything better.  I have faith in DMB, and hope that they'll have some more stuff out very soon, but in the meantime I'm fine with listening to &quot;Everyday&quot; everyday. (Pardon the corny joke)
052594527X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I noticed that some reviewers complained about the so-called lack of plot development, however, I think these reviewers have missed the point.  The novel lovingly and carefully uses the every day life of Griet, a girl who is thoroughly average in many ways, to provide insight into the age of Vermeer.  Moreover, the plot is not only about the creation of the painting, but about the coming of age of Griet.  Instead of finding the plot lacking, I found that it was full of the sort of suspense and intrigue that is contained in the mundane details of all of our lives.  I also especially liked that Chevalier did not attempt to give her characters a modern sensibility.  Griet's practicality and sense of her own reality anchored the book for me because they seemed consistent with the ideas of her time.  In perfect keeping with Vermeer's work, the book provides us with a main character who appears to be ordinary, yet possesses a glimmer of light.  In this case, Griet's &quot;light&quot; is her eye for detail and her strong ability to intuit the moods and thoughts of others around her.  My only critique of the novel is that Chevalier wrapped the novel up too hastily.  While it seemed correct that our knowledge about Griet would end as abruptly as it began (after all, a painting is but a glimpse), I was disappointed in the lack of a sense of who the adult Griet really was. Still a very enjoyable read.
B000058T5E|5.0|I'm Sure Glad I Had This Coming!<br />With Jeff Beck's new album, You Had It Coming, Jeff continues to show he is the god of guitar. And just two years after his grammy-nominated album, Who Else!  When you pop You Had It Coming into your cd player, get ready for a wild ride. 'Earthquake,' the first song, gets you pumped and ready for the rest of the cd. 'Roy's Toy', 'Dirty Mind', and 'Rollin and Tumblin' also sent my pants to the laundry. 'Nadia', however, is the climax of the cd. It is one of the best songs I've ever heard Jeff do. I believe 'Nadia' is right up there with 'Cause We've Ended as Lovers' and 'Where Were You.' When I first heard 'Nadia', I was stunned. I am totally impressed. Here's my favorite songs from 1-10 on this cd (1 being my favorite, 10 my least favorite):<br />1. Nadia 2. Suspension 3. Earthquake 4. Dirty Mind 5. Left Hook 6. Rollin' and Tumblin' 7. Roy's Toy 8. Loose Cannon 9. Rosebud 10. Blackbird<br />Over all, I am totally impressed and Jeff just keeps getting better and better. This album is right up there with 'Blow by Blow' and 'Wired.'
0451169514|5.0|It is by far Stephen King's best work of fiction.  This book has everything anyone could want in a book contained within its pages, from a love story, to gore, to humor and philosophical musings.  This is definitely Stephen King's best work.  It focuses on a group of 7 kids who fight a monster and then have to fight the same monster again 27 years later.
B00004SQQX|5.0|Cet album est la bombe!  For those interested in French hip-hop this is a must.  Shurik'n has proved his talents with IAM and now his solo album frappe a fond.  If you don't speak french and particularly Marseillais, you won't understand a damn thing, but the beats, choice of music and funky flow will suffice.
B000056K04|4.0|I am a hard core DMB fan.  No doubt about it.  I had the newalbum's release date written in my planner, I am in the fan club, andI refer to them as if I'm on a first name basis with all of them.Maybe I should be on MTV's &quot;Fanatic,&quot; but that's not thepoint.  The point is, I was predicting the new album's release to bethe real highlight of 2001.  I hated the fact that it had beendelayed, but I knew, save a natural disaster, that I'd make it toFebruary 27.  And I did, and I bought the CD the day it came out, andwhat did I feel?  Yes, folks, I felt disappointment.  Me, Dave loverof all Dave lovers!  And I expressed that to my fellow colleagues,until one told me, &quot;I didn't like the Radiohead CD when it firstcame out and now I love it, so why don't you give the new Dave CD achance?&quot; So, on that advice, I did so.  And what do you think isgoing 'round and 'round in my head now?  &quot;The space between, thewicked lies...&quot; and Dave's welcomed crooning day in and dayout.<br />What I am trying to say is that if you love DMB, you will givethis album a chance.  It's different, yes.  But did you want them tostay the same forever and ever and for all time?  Dave grew up,people!  That doesn't make him bad, that just makes his musicdifferent and makes the sound different.  He's still Dave, he canstill jam out like NO OTHER, and he's still one of the most uniqueartists of all time. If you want to resort to listening to the nasal,digitally-enhanced &quot;pop&quot; that this generation has come to(yes, Britney, we KNOW you're not that innocent), then go ahead, putdown your Dave CD.<br />However, I have a feeling that some of us AREready to grow up with Dave and enjoy the maturity and composure thathe put into this album.  And buy a ticket to the show this summer.I'm sure you won't be disappointed, even with the new album.  Davelive is DAVE LIVE.  You can't beat it.  The album is a small reminderof why we've come to love DMB in the first place.
0671656244|5.0|I think this is one of my favorite books!  I don't read a lot of sci-fi but this one I could read over and over again.  I just wish I had a copy.  This is one of those books that seems like a crime for it to be out of print.  I think just about anyone would enjoy reading this book.
B00000JY1X|5.0|i don't care what anybody says about mr. m's masterpiece. 'it's too long, too synthy, too this, too that'... the fact remains,  this is, in fact, a masterpiece. not only are the lyrics some of the most sarcastic, literary, and heartfelt that i've ever heard ( and often at the same time), but the music is inventive and surprisingly emotional for the amount of electronics that are utilized. this record helped me to sort out some issues in my life, and still inspires me after REPEATED listens. 69 love songs is definitely my choice for a desert island disc. be warned, though. some people 'get it' and some people, well... 'don't'! but, if you are part of that demographic that does, you are guaranteed many hours of pure bliss. thank you, steve...
B000002UR7|4.0|I left out a star, ONLY because I am a new Radiohead fan and I'm still attempting to &quot;get there&quot;. All I have to say is &quot;anyone can play guitar&quot;.  That's what this album is to me.  This album may not &quot;hold a candle&quot; to the Bends but how can you beat the catchy, yet non-mainstreamness of &quot;anyone can play guitar&quot;? You simply can't. I have SO much radiohead to catch up on, only owning their first two albums, I am terribly slacking on my Radiohead but I will get there.  Too bad this isn't sold on vinyl.....neither is The Bends for that matter...... Ah well.   I still have the knowledge that this is an incredible band with the egos to match but good music is good music and that's what you get with this album. Catchy, yes, but where were they expected to begin??
B000056K04|5.0|Dave has shown us a new side of himself in this cd and i think it is great! There is alot of controversy about this cd, but i think it is the best yet!
B000056K04|4.0|First, I think you should know I had a hard time deciding to give this album 3 stars or 4. This album is so different then all the stuff to some before it, the only way I was sure it was really DMB was Daves unmistakable voice. I didn't have very high expectations for the album, mainly because it was written in a couple of weeks. I was also worried about their switch of producers since highly admire Steve Lilywhite's work. Anyway, when I first got the album my first observation was the guitar. Not only does Dave play electric through almost the whole album but his style seems very different also. Once I got over this and the almost total lack of Boyd's ripping violin, I discovered some very well written songs beneath. They're catchy without being to commercial and often complex in their construction. I was dissapointed to see that just about the entire record is in 4/4 time since odd time signatures have been a staple of Daves writing (i.e. The Dreaming Tree.) But song's like What You Are, Dreams Of Our Fathers, and Angel are really great just the same. The only reason I didn't give Everyday a solid 4 stars is the fact that the lyrics are the same gibberish they've alway's been and so absolutely no growth like I had hoped they would.
B00000IQC8|5.0|i love any movie by kevin smith.  i had to go and buy all of his movies on dvd.  they all have some really great special features (except dogma which there is a SE being released soon).  and any movie with jay and silent bob in it makes it that much better.
068981528X|5.0|I was looking at this book in our school library when a fellow teacher leaned over my shoulder, read the title, and said, \\"Oh, no!  I bet this one is hysterical!\\"<br />She was right.<br />The obvious role-reversal of Wolf and Pig in the retelling of this old classic is sure to make any child giggle even before the book is opened.  Once you DO start reading it, stand back!  Three cuddly little wolves are sent by their mother out into the world to make their way (mom is painting her nails black and has curlers in her hair and tail--a very nice touch!).  The three wolves, in a departure from the original tale, borrow some bricks from a passing kangaroo and build a sturdy brick house.<br />All goes well and they're out in the garden playing croquet when the Big, Bad Pig comes sauntering along.  The wolves hid inside, won't let him in, and the Big Bad Pig tries to blow the house down.<br />He cant, of course.  The house is brick!  But, \\"the pig wasn't called big and bad for nothing.  He went and fetched his sledgehammer and knocked the house down.\\"  The illustrations by Ms. Oxenbury of the pig smashing the walls with a hammer while the wolves flee through a window is worth the cost of the book alone.  But, wait!  There's MORE!<br />They build a succession of stronger houses, each which is demolished by the pig (he uses a pneumatic hammer and dynamite).  Only when they try to change their tactics and make a house of FLOWERS does the pig change his ways and see how destructive and obnoxious he was.<br />This is a marvelous book, and no mistake.  There are probably a good 200 versions of the Three Little Pigs, many of which end with the grisly death of the wolf.  In the Three Little Wolves, not only is the reader immediately hooked on the role reversal of wolf and pig, but the text and illustrations are simply hysterical and the peaceful ending make it far more enjoyable than the original fable.  This is a book that should be in everyone's library!!
B000005RUX|5.0|I love this album, you have to have a live version of alive if you are a true pj fan, but somethings weird... just listen to dirty frank, then listen to &quot;give it away&quot; by the red hot chili peppers, hmmm...
B0000025RI|4.0|This is the most soulful Michael Jackson album since the Jackson Five. Thriller was a bit overplayed in the eighties, but &quot;Human Nature&quot; and a few other songs on this CD are eternal. If you set the fame game aside and listen to this CD for its inherent musical qualities, it still makes it big.
B000056K04|4.0|Yes, this is a different style of CD.  I had heard the first song from the radio, and by the middle of the third song I knew the CD had been an excellent purchase.  Dave as lover &amp; philosopher is still completely intact, perhaps just a little more aggressive than he has been before.  All of the songs still have the lines in them that you wait for so you can sing them too loud in your car.  I just hope I can get tickets for the Chicago show this summer!!
B00000I950|5.0|'Voulez Vous' rarely ranks highly with the late Abba masterpieces.  Maybe its versatility militates against the tonal unity that makes an album like 'The Visitors' such an overpowering experience.  And yet, this album features the lyrics that define the glitter/tears Abba aesthetic: 'I have a dream, a fantasy, to help me cope with reality'.<br />It is difficult to think of any reputedly Great album that boasts such a run of miraculous songs - the euphoric funk of 'As Good as new'; the love-as-crime-thriller paranoia of the title track; the death-wish masquerading as life affirmation of 'I have a dream'; 'the king has lost his crown', the kind of up-tempo ballad Abba patented; the saucy boogie of 'Does your mother know'; the Bee Gees melancholy of 'If it wasn't for the nights'; the 'Fernando' rehash 'Chiquitita', with its haunting, rag-stomp finale; the electro hysteria of 'Lovers (live a little longer).  The catchy rapture of 'Kisses of fire' brings the album to a satisfying, full-circle close.  <br />Even the bonus tracks, which on an album like 'the Visitors' blight the overall mood, are invaluable, the Michael Nyman echoes (or vice versa?) of 'Summer Night City', and the Bowie pastiche, 'Lovelight'.  Remarkable.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|This score blends more perfectly with its movie than any other movie I've ever seen.  Clint Mansell is a true genius.  Even standing alone, this score is brilliantly despondent.
6305910103|5.0|This was the first Star Trek movie I actually saw at an age where I could remember.  When I first saw it, it was broadcast on ABC, so it naturally was edited in a fashion.  It was also the first one I bought, and I can say it was probably the best buy I've ever made.  I've been watching Star Trek since before I was even in school, so the characters were quite familiar.  I have but only one complaint with the VHS/DVD copies of the movie.  That being that approximately 15 minutes of footage on the ABC version is NOT on the tapes or my DVD copy.  The action is great, the musical score is riveting, and doesn't follow the all is happy at the end trend of a lot of movies.  Mr. Meyer did an excellent job with this film, from little things like putting a real book--A Tale of Two Cities--in the hands of Shatner to a quote at the end of that novel in the movie's end.  And though the death of Mr. Spock was a bit off-putting, the film's crew couldn't have done any better if they hadn't included a bagpipe version of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; at the end.  It was enough to make a small kid--me, at the time--shed a tear.  The whole look of the sets, especially the subdued lighting of the brigdge, and the cave on Regula with all the plant life, were superb.
0553573403|5.0|If I had to sum this book up in two words, they would be 'A Masterpiece'.  The flow of Martin's writing allows the reader to go from character to character without becoming frustrated (at least, not too frustrated).  The story in itself is historical in our world; the tale is one of gripping reality.  Martin begins the book with a 'I've-got-you-now' prolouge, and proceeds to lead you around his world, allowing you to form your own assumptions and then completely astonishing you.  It's great the way the Martin spares the reader nothing; he captivates you with the harshness of real life, detracting from classic fantasy but somehow adding to it at the same time.  From Lord Eddard Stark to Princess Danaerys, he creates a story so poweful that the reader cannot justify &quot;the bad guy&quot; without seeming like a fool.  As the story draws you in, the better it gets.  Definately not one to be missed, I promise!
B00004TRD8|5.0|While the movie doesn't quite have some of the grittiness of the original, this is among not only my top 3 Schwarzenegger films, but one of my favorite of all time.  Several years ago, I had heard rumors of a newer, longer version of T2, but didn't put much stock in it, as a lot of such rumors didn't pan out.  Supposedly, one of the scenes mention was to be a shot of John's foster mother lying dead in a bathtub--obviously the handiwork of the T-1000--but it never came to pass.  I was pleased to see some of the added effects, such as the T-1000s inability to maintain his shape near the end, and it put to rest for me how it was you could tell which was Linda Hamilton and which was her twin sister, before the T-1000 was shot.  Rarely have I seen director's cuts that surpass the original and make it seem a whole new experience.  Only Aliens Special Edition and Star Wars did that for me.  And until this movie, I'd never seen a music video that could employ graphics from the movie as well--example being Guns 'N Roses' Axl Rose being evaluated as a waste of ammunition by the Terminator.  The movie is well-rounded, and I especially liked Sarah's comment about if a machine could learn the value of life, that maybe we could too.
068484267X|5.0|This book is fantastic.  It was recommended to my class by my British Lit teacher.  It led you through the hardships faced by immigrants coming to America.  The McCourts have to struggle to make ends meet, especially when drinking is such a predominant expenditure.  It gives great hope to immigrants as Frank was able to achieve the American Dream.
0525457585|3.0|Let me start by first saying this: The book is a lot different from the movie. As a matter of fact, the book covers BOTH movies, although it covers the first one almost exactly. In some ways I liked the movies better, and in some ways I liked the book better. If the best of both were to be combined, this book would have been really great. The first 200 pages of this book tells how Atreyu goes on his quest, how Bastian enters Fantastica. That part was really well written and moved quickly. But from page 200 or so to around page 300, the storyline seemed to get a little bit weak. Bastain is just romping around Fantastica without really knowing what he's doing or where he's going. If he wants to go to real world, why doesn't he just wish himself there? But then from page 300 or so to the end, the storyline picks up again--for the most part. The ending explains a lot of things that I've been wondering about earlier, but it doesn't explain everything. At least not in cut-and-dry language. Ende beats around the bush a little bit. What is the Neverending story? I think it's any story you read or something like that, but I'm not sure. Young children will probably love this book. Personally, my favorites are Robert Jordan and Robert E. Howard since I'm not a kid any more--I'm 20. Bastian is a really interesting character. At first you like him, then you hate his guts because he's so goody-two-shoesy, then you REALLY hate him because he becomes quite a brat. One final point, take note that there are 26 chapters and that each chapter starts with the next letter of the alphabet. Overall this was a good book, but mostly for younger people. Older people can still enjoy it, but don't expect bloody battles, hot romance, or anything like that.
0060194995|5.0|like ralph ellison and j.d. salinger, harper lee is known for one book, but what a book! ...the best southern slice of life story you'll ever read...how many other girls have as much wisdom and vision as Scout or are as precocious? ...all of the characters are memorable...when i have kids, i would like to name a daughter after a writer or a book character...scout would be a good choice...of course, atticus' courtroom speech rivals the lawyer's speech in richard wright's  &quot;native son&quot;  for sheer power and beauty...i have yet to see the film version of &quot;mockingbird. &quot; i hear it's good also... i remember taking this one to work, reading it during breaks and whenever i could steal a moment :-)
0790729725|5.0|A brilliant, ruthless account of crime and the perils it entails. Ray Liotta, in an Oscar-worthy performance, portrays a novice who is schooled by two mentors, played by Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro, in the game of bullying, smuggling, robbery and murder. The film charts the lives of the chief characters from a panoramic perspective, from the fifties to the eighties, and the scenes of violence have a mean, visceral, maliciously real, (as opposed to merely cinematic) quality. Martin Scorsese directs with a dazzling competence, developing some fascinating techniques of pacing and plot. An absorbing meditation on the underside of the American dream.
6305910103|4.0|The Movie I give five stars no doubt.   It was and still is the best Trek movie yet made.   The DVD though, is not exemplary.   The picture is extremely detailed and clean but overall is a bit on the dark side.   This DVD is best seen in a room with the lights off.   The sound, Dolby Digital 5.1, is not very dynamic.   This is not the fault of the crew who upgraded the soundtrack but rather it is this way because of the age of the movie.   The soundeffects for the lasers and photon torpedoes emphasized treble rather than base, and for most of the movie Horner's score surpasses the sound effects.   The only time you hear and feel the base is when the starships pass by.
B000002AZ8|4.0|When I first bought this CD, I put it in my stereo, listened to it once, and banished it to my shelf for 6 months. A few days ago I pulled it out and gave it another listen, and it was amazing. From the angry, dissonant Not for You to the beautiful Immortality, this album is amazing. It does have a few missteps, though--the strange accordian track Bugs and the last track, Hey Foxymophaldomama (I didn't spell that correctly). Although this album is truly amazing and contains some of Pearl Jam's best songs, overall, it's not quite their best (let's hear it for Vs.).
B000058T5E|5.0|This is a great album filled with grooves that put me in the mind of the funk from Wired...  nasty guitar tone from a man who is in a class of his own. Do I worship Jeff Beck? No. But he is a completely unique individual that can go places I dont think anyone else can. Concerning the tripe written in another review, Beck's guitar is not oversampled to the &quot;max&quot;. Frankly, youre hearing a strat hooked into a crybaby plugged into a screaming Marshall. The samples are barebones as well.... he couldve used my computer to write the drum tracks. Thats part of the beauty of this album.... this is raw, unadulterated Beck... Some of his best stuff in 20 years.....
B000002UA9|5.0|Almost everytime that a band releases their first record, the enthusiasm and the excitement can be felt around it the first times you hear it. With &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, though, that youthful spirit of non-expert, energetic and absolutely talented musicians has survived through the years, transforming the first album ever recorded by The Beatles (in 585 minutes) into a piece of joyful and cheering music that can be heard by any generation, extracting the same warmth and sense of quality that the people in the 60's saw in the talents of this band.<br />The power and the sparkling energy displayed through the songs of these innovative boys was quickly appreciated not only by the huge bunch of screaming fans, but also by the critics, who saw in themusic of The Beatles, beyond the social change that it could create, an important creative contribution, since they were transporting rock'n'roll, originally a part of the young culture, to the spirit of a whole country, and later, of the world.<br />The LP itself is quick and breath-taking since its starting, and can be easily enjoyed now by fans of any generation. Eight original McCartney/Lennon songs (the only CD which displays this credits and not the familiar &quot;Lennon/McCartney&quot; ones) form it, starting with &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, one of Paul's most notable rock'n'roll pieces, with a stunning bass part, and energetic lyric and a fun, timeless recording. &quot;Misery&quot; shows the sentimental side of John Lennon, who's perceived as the most-talented lyricist in the group, writing a melancholic song supported by the invariable instrumental basis and George Martin's piano; and also shining on &quot;There's A Place&quot;, maybe the first time he tried not to write a simple love song, but an introspective one, changing the traditional way of writing that rock'n'roll composers had at the time. It also contains the background of harmonies that would eventually become the trademark of the early Beatle recordings. &quot;Do You Want To Know A Secret&quot;, beautifully sung by George Harrison, is another Lennon number, this time an innocent and sweet love ballad about a boy who falls in love with a girl. This is a particular favourite of mine, and I think the strength of thissong lies in the luminous melody and the geniously arranged background harmonies. The rest of the originals were already known by singles: the different version of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and its B side &quot;PS I Love You&quot; (a McCartney number with great vocals); &quot;Please Please Me&quot; (the current hit with original and out-of-the-common lyrics) and its B side &quot;Ask Me Why&quot; (an unfairly forgotten Lennon/McCartney song).     The covers are so well-chosen that you can't reject them. John's rendition of &quot;Anna&quot; is better than Arthur Alexander's, as you can feel by the first his painful throat shouting for a girl he loves. &quot;Chains&quot; is a three-part harmony number written by Carole King and husband, and directed by George Harrison, who sings the lead part (although he's not credited!). Another chance for John to show his harmonica-playing, and another great song. &quot;Boys&quot; is Ringo's turn to sing, a song that really fits into his personality, and that shows The Beatles really seemed to be enjoying what they recorded. &quot;Baby It's You&quot; is another love ballad driven by John's dramatic vocal. &quot;A Taste Of Honey&quot; seems to be the weak point in the album, although is a good way to appreciate Paul early as a standard pop ballads singer. &quot;Twist And Shout&quot; is known by all because of its simplicity and John's destructed but amazing lead vocal George and Paul's tired but luminous background harmonies that made The Beatles' version to this american original a stand-out and brilliant live number.<br />There were many eras in The Beatles' early years. This record recovers their first-time attempts, with the inexperiences and mistakes, butalso with their indisputable talent.  I'm 18, and I think this CD can go through all the ages, and make a good impression. That's why the music of The Beatles is so important. The recording of this album was, indeed, &quot;a bundle of joy&quot; for them. They really enjoyed it, it was their big change, and they made it with all their energy and sense of humor. Buy it, and it will surely represent &quot;a bundle of joy&quot; for you too.
0061053147|5.0|Paul M. Sammon reveals an enormous amount of information in this book. Mr. Sammon was able to gain access to all ongoings on the set for a reason; he too had a vision as Ridley Scott did and the crew noticed. Sammon was on top of it, aware that this is truly an epic film being made. I'm anticipating his next book covering all Alien films. So I wait, flame thrower in hand...extra careful when I open the pages.
0140283587|4.0|This book is a coming of age story. The story's main character, Dave, decides to go traveling in India. Before the trip, Dave and his friend's girlfriend, Liz, have started to fool around and the only reason Dave goes to India is so that this arrangement can continue. As always in these kinds of books, Dave learns a lot about himself during this journey. Sutcliffe does a great job in describing the sights and sounds of India and also writes a great comic sequence in which Dave and an Indian from Britain, Ranj, go around with a stolen credit card and impress girls so that they can get laid. A great book to read if you want to relax.
B000059RL3|5.0|First this is the best thing Motown could have done with this work of art. The original Detroit mix is unreal since no outtakes exist this is nearest we can come to the making of this wonderful album. If these songs don't resinate with what's happing today what does. Marvin had something to really write about and say to everyone this is &quot;What's Going On&quot; wake up and realize where your world is headed. The &quot;Inner City Blues is still A problem, crime is increasing, poverty,ecology is getting worse,who really cares well we all should since this is our world. What this album sings to me is Faith and spirit and most important LOVE.
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|Scary Movie is a comedy spoof of past horror movies like: Scream, I know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense and The Blair Witch Project.  There are some really funny scenes in this movie, but many times they just are trying to make Cindy's breasts look like a man's rolly petrols!  That's where this film went wrong.  This movie had some pretty bad scenes- like James Van Der Beek- the special features in the DVD were better- the TV chase with the real life girl, The &quot;Liclac, Waffle, etc.&quot; and the alternate ending.  Sure this film does have it's laughs. But playing scary music while Cindy gets bumped in the head- and when she was shaving her tongue in the bathtub- COME ON!  Work with me Wayans' Brothers... Keenen Ivory Wayans' IN LIVING COLOR show had a little more better comedy than this did!  More of those safety/death signs and more Neo Back Breakers...  and Hi-Pie (Marlon Wayans) and more bottle knockouts with some more hives covering the head- you need more of those spoofs and it would have been funnier.  Road Trip was 10x better with comedy!!!  You need Tom Green for Scary Movie  2 and there better be a spoof on THE EXCORCIST and END OF DAYS!!!  Don't choose the bananna anymore!

6305014140|5.0|Ninja Scroll is the work of director Yoshiaki Kawajiri and was released in 1995. It is the story of Kibagami Jubei, a master-less samurai that wanders feudal Japan and hires his craft and his sword to whoever can pay-or whoever has a decent cause. He one day stumbles on the village of Shimoda, where the whole populace has apparently succumbed to a deadly plague and where a ninja clan has been recently annihilated by a demon. Stopping to rescue the only ninja left alive-a beautiful girl named Kagero-he unwittingly becomes part of a story that mixes shogunate politics, demonic warriors, a cachet of gold large enough to tilt the kingdom on its ear and the return of his most hated foe, Himuro Gemma. <br />The animation is some of the best I've ever seen. The colors are lush and full. The tone changes constantly and fits the mood perfectly. From the dark corners to the lit fields, the contrast in Ninja Scroll provides it with another layer with which to tell its story. As for the action, well, I wish all animes had action like this. Anyone who's seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon can tell you that the rooftop scenes are nothing compared to the ones found here. There you had two persons jumping, here whole clans of ninja leap into the air and face off against Jubei. You have some dastardly demons with strange powers-including their leader, Gemma, who cannot die. (The solution to this problem is both very fitting and very appropriate). The sound is also finally given its due. From the thunk of shurikens to the crashing of Tessai's sword through tree and ninja to the flapping of Mushizo's wasps, you can now hear it as beautifully as was recorded. The best scene for sound, though, is the fight between Jubei and Mujuru (the blind swordsman). All of a sudden, the sound Jubei makes becomes very important. The simple rustling of leaves and movement of grass becomes enthralling-because they could all lead to Jubei's demise.
B000056K04|3.0|The newest studio release from Dave Matthews and his motley crew of musicians is titled &quot;Everyday&quot;. The album marks the first time the DMB has recorded with producer Glen Ballard after recording each of their previous efforts with Steve Lillywhite.  It appears that Ballard was a big influence on the band -- he shares  the writing credits with Matthews and plays keyboards on the album.  Based on this information, I've renamed  the Dave Matthews Band to the Dave and Glen Ballard Band.  One listen to this disc and you'll find that Ballard's influence is hard to miss.  Matthews song &quot;Dancing Nancies&quot; asks the question &quot;Could I have been anyone other than me?&quot;  The answer to that question is proved to be a solid yes in &quot;Everyday&quot;.<br />  The opening track (and current single) &quot;I Did It&quot; is probably the most obvious example of Ballard's evil, meddling ways.  The song is over-produced and Matthews and company come of sounding like they're trying too hard to be different.  &quot;I Did It&quot; may recieve strong radio air-play, but not without some strong help from the record company pushing the single.  This simply does not sound like Dave Matthews.<br /> Don't get me wrong, there are some quality songs on the album that catch the DMB's original sound.  &quot;When The  World Ends&quot;, &quot;The Space Between&quot;, &quot;If I Had It All&quot;, &quot;Mother Father&quot; and easily the most classic-DMB song on the album, the title track &quot;Everyday&quot;.<br /> The choice of producer for an album is so crucial.  For example, Buch Vig produced the Smashing Pumpkins first two albums and Flood produced the rest.  Flood helped transform the sound of the Smashing Pumpkins and Glen Ballard is changing the sound of the Dave Matthews Band.  Some of these new songs are great.  &quot;Dreams of Our Fathers&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Fool To Think&quot;, &quot;Sleep To Dream Her&quot; and &quot;What You Are&quot; have either a more etherial feel or a more straightforward rock thing going.  Digitally enhanced vocals, keys, distorted guitars replace the Dave Matthews Band of old and sometimes it works and sometimes not.<br /> All in all, it's a pretty good album.  I'd be interested in seeing if the DMB continue to follow this new path.  We'll just have to wait and see if Dave and crew end up becomming a band other than themselves.etherial feel or a more straightforward rock thing going.

6303481272|5.0|alright for all lovers of anime, if you dont already own this you should. Ninja Scroll has phenominal samuri battles and loads of blood and guts. the movie stars a man who is very handy with a katana and in the first 15 minutes you'll learn this. the main charecter Jeiwbei, is an exellent warrior that kills lots of demons and devils , the plot is awesome and the art is great. buy this movie , it is worth it by far!!!!!!!
0441003257|5.0|Simply put, this is my favorite book. Enjoyable from beginning to (nearly) the end, Good Omens is just as the title says. From the first few pages, I sensed I would enjoy myself throughout the book's pages. It was as if Douglas Adams came out of hiding!<br />Pratchett and Gaiman combine to form a perfect combination. Although Gaiman is among my favorite creators of fiction (a friend and I own the entire Sandman series and have read every page of it), his solo work can easily be too heavy and self-interested. Pratchett, while funny, writes unsubstantial anti-logic, entertaining to read but slowly comes off as more dull than droll. (His only good book is _Small Gods_, in the same vein as Good Omens.) Together, an amazing version of Gaiman's work presents itself; it is lighter than, say, the dark _I Sold My Daddy for Two Goldfish_, but equally funny (and longer at that!).<br />The memorable aspects go on and on: the lost Anti-Christ, the Crowley's demonic car of Queen, Aziraphale's comforting bookstore, the Four Biker's of the Apocalypse, a hellhound named &quot;Dog&quot;, and two bumbling members of Hell's administrative branch.<br />If you were intrigued by the film _Dogma_, read this. Not only is it a sharper book, but it is more focused, funnier, and more rewarding. _Dogma_ was a string of sloppy mistakes. _Good Omens_ takes pieces of Gaiman's fascination with mythology, the very British humour of Pratchett, and creates a novel which rivals Douglas Adams on all counts.

B00002NDB1|1.0|THis Cd defis any explanation. How Harris and Murray allowed this to happen ? An uninspired singer, uninspired compositions, flat sound, the ridiculous &quot;Angel and The Gambler &quot; ( ten-minutes long repeating the same chorus .... , well, I'm out of words. Don't buy it.
B000056N8X|1.0|Now look, I understand studios have to make money.  Iunderstand that when a film does even reasonably well there must be asequel because it will make money, not because the film is worthy oreven able to support a sequel, just because of the money (ghostbusters2, Caddyshack 2) The quickening was terrible for many reasons, not theleast of which is, and I believe I have said this, There can be onlyone.  In the end of the first movie, and it was the end, finished,that's it now, make something else, Conner McCloud wins &quot;theprize&quot; and we supposedly live happily ever after, it was a verygood film, really good, but there was not, is not and never, ever willbe room for a sequel.  There could be only one.  There was only one.Everyone else had died or been killed.  Everyone.  Why? How?  andwhere for the love of God did all these other immortals come from?  Isthere a special immortal factory somewhere where they are churned out(a bunch of them are on motorcycles this time, ho hum) There are vast&quot;immortal cocoon&quot; type places now where they sleep Where didthey come from?  Who cares?  Evidently no one connected with this verybad and pointless sequel.  I truly wish whoever thinks up yet anotherHighlander movie will be beheaded as a public service.
B00000BKE0|1.0|DOn't worry, pals. Probable it wasn't Maiden who recorded this garbage, on of the worst metal albuns I've heard. Probably Steve and company were very tired and hierd some clones to do the job for them !! Thanks God Adrian Smith didn't feature in this &quot;thing&quot; ... Everything is cheap here: arguing that they were going back to their &quot;raw music&quot; tradidition, Maiden released a record without no production at all, no feelingm, where one of the songs &quot;Holy Smoke&quot;, is so bad but is considered the best of the album !!!! The new guitarrist, Janick Gers, was a bad choice to replace Smith. He can't play solos, amazing ... the whole album sounds fake.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This disc is truely the best of everybody's favorite band. They have digitally remastered the tracks and they sound great!!! I highly recommend this compellation. Fair warning, however, this is based upon the UK #1 hits not the US one (they are a little different) but is still great!!
B00003CXFV|4.0|I avoided Erin for a long time but was pleasantly surprised when I finally broke down and watched it.  Normally, I equate Julia Roberts with fluffy no-brain movies and I was so happy that a serious movie with a good plot was actually produced from her.<br />This story really grabs you and you truly feel for those poor people.  Roberts and Albert Finney give terrific performances.

B000000W5N|5.0|Here again, as with so many other recordings---&quot;Beggars Banquet,&quot; &quot;Let It Bleed,&quot; &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; and &quot;Some Girls&quot;---the Stones demonstrate just why they are the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band. &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (an ode to cocaine, lyrically disguised as praise for the beauty of black women) gets an instantaneous dance groove underway; &quot;Sway&quot; begins the spiral into druggy euphoria; &quot;Wild Horses&quot; (co-written, or at least &quot;Heavily inspired&quot;, by Marianne Faithfull) takes it down a notch, revealing some raw heartbreak; &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot; is perhaps the jammingest rhetorical question ever committed to acetate; &quot;You Got to Move&quot; dips into the group's bag of old blues tricks. Flip it over (if you have an LP) to side two, and &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; returns the listener to drug hell (this time, talking about heroin); as much of a drag as that is, the record recovers nicely with the honky-tonk satire &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; and the mystical, epic &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot;---which may actually be a love song directed at an actual woman, surprise! The band makes a major transition into its Seventies, jet-setting, big-money sound and sheen; Mick Taylor contributes some amazing guitar virtuosity here, on his first studio album with the band as a full-time player, but it mostly belongs to the Glimmer Twins, singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards, and to the greatest rhythm section in rock, bassist Bill Wyman and drummer extraordinaire Charlie Watts. It can't be said often enough: at their best, the Stones are THE best. This record should be played, loudly and quite often, and not just in my house.
B000056K04|3.0|This is a decent album, but sort of a let down for me personally from the past Dave albums that I love.  One thing that dissapoints me is the obvious lack of the band that made DMB what it is, or what it should be today.  Those band members are damn talented.. and they should be heard also!  I'm not too psyched about this new producer who seemed to be too intimately involved with all of the song writing.  I think he even plays keyboard on some of the pieces.  Aside from the bad points... this is a decent pop album, and still contains a DMB feel to it.  But, overproduction doesn't equal success, and that's what I see happening here.  I guess I just miss the intense beauty of the instrumentation from the good ole days.  Hopefully they will return to that in their next effort.  My favorite songs on here from first impression are Everyday, and Space Between (is that Peter Gabriel I hear?)
0553277472|4.0|Don't let the title of this review fool you, I really did like the book.  I quite enjoyed looking through the many layers (some obvious, others subtle) and I'm quite sure that I'll catch more when I read this book again.  One does not need to know anything at all about Greek, Eastern or Modern philosophy to read this book, although the more one already knows, the more one will get out of it.<br />Personally, I felt that the meditations on the role of Quality in reality started off very well.  This was a very good attempt at merging the Eastern and Western (or &quot;classical vs romantic&quot; as they are also stated in the book) modes of thinking into a single coherent thought.  Unfortunately, I felt that it fell slightly short of its goal.  Pirsig's world view would seem to add an unlimited amount of inherent facts to every object that exists.  Quality doesn't seem to me to have a single value for all things.  For example, a screwdriver would be seen to have very good Screw-Turning Quality, but would have very low Beer-Can-Opening Quality.  For every possible method, there would be a different Quality rating.  Instead of Pirsig's single combination between one subject and one object, you have all sorts of relations between an object and every possible subject.<br />Although I felt the reasoning didn't quite hold up, I found the train of thought to be an utterly fascinating one.  I very much like the idea of Quality being the relation of a mind with an object.  If nothing else, the book opens up a lot of room for meditation on the subject.  It's an interesting seed that leads the mind into all sort of passages of reason.  Even if you don't agree with his conclusions, it's a great place to start letting your brain flow.<br />The conventional story of the motorcyclist and his son, told in between the meditating, is rather enjoyable as well.  Pirsig's description of the open road is quite appealing and I found myself wanting to take a few months off and ride out into the sunset!  The passages describing the feel of the road and the differences between seeing something from inside a car versus seeing it from a motorcycle are quite good and although I've never been near a motorbike in my life, I began to understand the desire for the wide open spaces that he has.<br />The bottom line is that this is a very good book for anyone interested in philosophy, motorcycles or just well-written stories.
0425173895|5.0|WOW!  That was my conclusion when I read this clever book.  The Murder of Roger Ackroyd may not have the glamour of Murder on the Orient Express or Death on the Nile, but it more than makes up for this by the stunning ending.  Immensley enjoyable.  If you want to try Agatha Christie, try this one.
B00004RF98|5.0|What the reviewer below fails to note is that many older films were not widescreen originally, and that the rectangular shape of today's movies were a reaction to the growing popularity of television... ironic since TVs are now moving towards a rectangular shape because of the current desire to see widescreen movies in fullscreen.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This is a great album in and of itself but it's also an obvious milestone in the progress of the band.<br />Prior to this album, Van Halen had made a name for themselves as a young and firey band that would come off tour just to record their next album. They would go into the studio and pretty much nail the recordings in one take and six weeks later hit the road again. But with Fair Warning, they actually slowed down a bit to get the recordings as near to perfect as possible.<br />This album is probably the slickest, production-wise, of all of their albums. The atmosphere of &quot;let's party our a** off and record it too&quot; was forever gone, to be replaced with the quality that would finally get them on the radio.<br />Van Halen &quot;cleaned up&quot; very nicely. Hearing Eddie's guitar playing is like hearing it for the first time. His technique is finally defined on this album and everything about his playing that was eventually copied by every garage-band kid is upfront and center.<br />I think of this as a &quot;dark&quot; album, especially as the listening progresses from &quot;Mean Streets&quot; to &quot;Dirty Movies&quot;. &quot;Dirty Movies&quot; still grabs my attention during the choruses. Michael Anthony's bg vocals are based on minor notes and lends a very sinister quality to the song and it should. The song is called &quot;Dirty Movies&quot;.<br />Interesting historical-tidbit thing here. When the band was recording this album, the division between David Lee Roth (DLR) and Eddie was beginning. Evidently, DLR began to become buddy-buddy with Ted Templeman (producer) and was leveraging this relationship to succeed with his ideas. Frustrated, Eddie almost quit the band (imagine quitting your own band). Alex convinced him to hang in there and find a way to get his ideas into the mix. So alot of the solos and guitar fills on the songs were recorded by Eddie when he would go into the studio at 3:00 in the morning, long after the session was over and everyone was gone. When everyone returned for the next day, Eddie's ideas were committed to tape and it was hard to not use them. They were so good.<br />When you hear the solo to &quot;Push Comes To Shove&quot;, it's hard to imagine that someone wouldn't have wanted to include it in the song.<br />A great album in the growth and eventual demise of one of rock's greatest bands.
0898451299|5.0|I was lucky enough to pick up the old version of this book at a junk shop along with a couple other old Richard Scarry books.  This is now my 2 year olds favourite book, especially the section on road making and the wonderful Rock Cruncher (crusher). It is great as it presumes that kids might want to understand how things work, in a simple sort of way - many other books treat kids as though interesting stuff is left until when they are old enough to think! It is unfortunate that these books are not all being reprinted as I can see this one falling apart in a few years.
B0000017CA|5.0|The lyrics on this album are as good as any I've ever heard or read....very abstract and meaningful on many levels...Not to mention the very tight rhythms of the band and time and theme changes within each song.....

1559409002|5.0|I hesitate to use the word &quot;horror&quot; because as Boris Karloff pointed out, there is a distinction between &quot;horror&quot; and &quot;terror&quot; and this film definitely involves such distinctions. This is a &quot;terror&quot; film - a masterpiece of low-budget suggestion and fear, as opposed to the more disgusting gory motion pictures common today - an essential possession for anyone who cares anything about the genre that creates an eerie atmosphere and a sense of pure &quot;fear.&quot;<br />Perhaps the reason for this is that the director, Herk Harvey, found a truly poetic inspiration in the source of his story - the haunting Saltair resort, which has been cursed by fires and floodings since it was first constructed at the turn of the twentieth century. This DVD features marvelous additional material, including a segment of postcards from the era, which, seen from the vantage point of the 21st century, are so strangely evocative of the later &quot;dead&quot; atmosphere that Harvey capitalized on. Candace Hilligoss is excellent in evoking sympathy for the heroine trapped in a frightening nether-world, and the scenes where she visits &quot;The Pavilion&quot; are among the eeriest ever filmed in creating a vivid sense of the supernatural.
B000000HTM|3.0|I've listened to this cd twice and I don't get it. Did this band go out of their way to make the most complex listen for the human ear. I would rather listen to prog jazz. I purchased this cd based on other reviews as I had never heard or heard of Van Der Graaf before and am disapointed. Sorry but in this case majority doesn't rule.
B00000J7SS|5.0|This was the album that turned Jazz, and all of music, on its head.  Before this album jazz was in danger of becoming boring.  Luckily Miles gave jazz the wake up call it needed to permanently awake it from its slumber.  On this album Miles abandons melodies completely and instead opts for more rhythm based music where the chords are simply building blocks for dramatic build ups and mellow come downs. This album is so unique and timeless. Up until this point Jazz had gone pretty much as far is it could go until Miles took it to the next obvious place: Rock music.  Guaranteed to change the way we think about music.
B000002MG1|5.0|\\"Automatic for the People\\" is truly an amazing album.  From the opening chords and sullen monotonous rhythms of &quot;Drive&quot; to the haunting melody of the final cut, &quot;Find the River&quot;, Automatic is a true masterpiece.  To say this is the best REM album ever would be a bold statement.  But, along with &quot;Murmur&quot; and &quot;Document&quot;, this album soars above the already lofty heights of other REM albums to a new and different level.  <br />Your first listen through is like seeing Disneyland from the tram ride - you know it's going to be great, but you'll want to explore every part of it before you are finished.  You end up wanting to repeat songs but stop yourself because the flow from one song into the next is perfect and you decide to just repeat the whole album over and over.<br />The tracks take you on quite a ride, though not necessarily in an upbeat sense.  There are a couple driving songs on Automatic like &quot;Monty Got a Raw Deal&quot; &quot;Ignoreland&quot;, and &quot;the Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight&quot; but the larger beauty of this work lies in the middle ground.  &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; and &quot;Try Not to Breathe&quot; really define this album and, without doubt, the brooding but still hopeful melodics of &quot;Nightswimming&quot; will stir some distant, innocent memory in every listener.<br />To put it simply, listen to &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; and experience the magic of REM at it's eloquent best.
B000002UB3|5.0|For God's sake this is Abbey Road.  Why are you reading this?  Why don't you own this yet...Ok Seriously, this is the second best Beatle's album next to the White Album.  Its the Beatle's last, but its probably the nicest sounding.  You get the feeling from this album that they were able to, for a moment at least, suspend group tensions and work hard at producing an album as a band.  Like the White Album, Abbey Road contains a mix of raw pieces, Come Together, and more polished and produced tunes, Something.  What I love about this album is it depicts the Beatles at their instrumental best.  The guitar solos are sweet, the base lines are solid and flowing, and the rhythms are mesmerizing.  Abbey Road is not without its flaws however.  Maxwell's silver Hammer and Octopus's Garden are just downright silly and don't add much to the album, though its cool to here Ringo sing and the guitar on that track is kinda nice I guess.  Those to songs are exceptions.  Lennon and Harrison both shine on this album and McCartney more than redeems himself for the Maxwell mishap on the second side of the record.  The coolest thing about this album are the melodies on the second side especially Golden Slumber, Carry that Weight, The End.  Go buy this now before anyone realizes you don't own it yet!
B0000399WI|5.0|I have seen this movie about 30 times, mainly because TNT shows it every two weeks. Really good movie to buy, cause you will watch it over and over again.  this is the plot summary - &quot;Tim Robbins plays a banker named Andy who's sent to Shawshank Prison on a murder charge, but as he gets to know a life-term prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman), we realize there's reason to believe the banker's crime was justifiable. We also realize that Andy's calm, quiet exterior hides a great reserve of patience and fortitude, and Red comes to admire this mild-mannered man who first struck him as weak and unfit for prison life.&quot;  Overall I think this is one of the most entertaining movies of all time and has one of the best endings ever recorded on film.<br />A+
B000002KAT|5.0|Initially I was wondering whether I should give this five stars are not, but then I was like &quot;ah what the hell.  Its a pretty sweet album.&quot;  I don't really have much to say about it except it may be the best mellow out record ever.  When you hear it you just want to lay in the warm sun and daydream all afternoon.  Morrison's songs aren't too complicated, but they're really more of a canvas on which he paints various lingering images with his beautiful lyrics.  I like Morrison's other stuff so don't get me wrong, but to some extent its repetitive and overdone.  This is different.  What can I say except when you listen to it you'll feel really good.
B000002B2T|5.0|Bought this thing the day it came out and loved it, but I had since fogotten about it.  I downloaded a live concert from Napster the other day and just fell in love with the music all over again.  As has been stated by others, you're not going to find the hard rock guitar-driven songs typical of AIC, Pearl Jam, or the Screaming Trees - just an incredibly mellow album that should be in any Alt-rock, post-grunge collection.  Don't pass this one up, if only for the nostalgic value.
0783226888|5.0|A Brilliant film gets an Impeccable dvd release in this collectors edition. Crystal Clear sounds and visuals, Stacks of Supplimentary Materials, (including an alternate ending, deleted scenes, Directors Commentary and makings of) and... Come On, it has Bruce Willis.. BRUCE WILLIS, How much more prompting can ya need.<br />Richard Gere and Bruce Willis &quot;Face Off&quot; in this Thriller, Gere plays and Ex-IRA Sniper turned Convict turned FBI Hound dog. He is believed to be one of the few people on the face of the Planet who can ID the Jackal, a Cold-Hearted Assassin who seems to have set his sights on the US Government. Bruce Willis plays the role of the Jackal with a straight face, but we can still tell he is having a ball with the role. Richard seems to be enjoying himself too, as should the audience as the action builds and builds leisurely and cleverly to an Awesome Showdown between the foes. <br />Great Supporting Cast, Swift Direction and all the required thrills are here by the Bucketload. A Great Piece Of Entertaining Action.
B000035P7X|5.0|This poet is sensitive and sassy. He makes you comfortable then catches you off guard. His genius shines behind his very human texture. It's full of history and great music. You're going to learn a few new things about Dylan, no matter how well you think you know him. He cuts and heals in the same sentence. He takes you on a journey that not only amazes the viewer but, also, this young man still wobbling and finding his footing. He has a sophisticated coarseness with a wry and dry sense of humor. The film is not high tech, which adds to the storyline, remember, filming this behind the scenes event was long before our digital lenses and technology had more imput than the director. The commentary is excellent. The added footage is excellent. If you like Dylan this is a must, even if you don't have a DVD player yet, store in away until you do.
B00004XOWM|5.0|The scatological meaning of Chocolate Starfish &amp; the Hot Dog Flavored Water is obvious to anyone that's graduated junior high, but it stumbles over its punch line, winding up as bewildering, not offensive. But it doesn't stop there, since hot dogs and chocolate starfishes are metaphors, as Fred Durst uses them to illuminate his one topic, how nobody understands him. He occasionally frames his rage as us vs. them, as on &quot;My Generation,&quot; but, ultimately, it's all about himself. If the band supported him with sheets of noise, terrifying guitars, monstrous rhythms, or even a hook every now and then, Durst's narcissism may have been palatable, but the group pretty much churns out the same colorless heavy plod for each song. Since Bizkit has never relied on song or studiocraft, it shouldn't come as a surprise that neither is in evidence here, but the problem is they're fishing in a shallow pool. Previously, they had pent-up rage on their side, but here, the music sounds rote - when it gets louder, it signifies nothing, it just gets louder - and Durst can see no farther than his past year, dwelling on bad things said about him, dismissing somewhat justified criticism that he helped stoke the fires at Woodstock 99 with a round of the &quot;critics that don't get it,&quot; ands devoting a song to an attack at labelmate Trent Reznor. Some fans may empathize with Durst, but will it resonate? Everyone feels rage after being dumped by their significant other, but does everyone live in a world where they feel like they're attacked on all sides? Come to think of it, they do, but Durst's vision on Chocolate Starfish is so insular, it's hard for anyone else to come inside.
B00004XMVL|4.0|I had expected PITCH BLACK to be a cheesy, sci-fi movie of somewhat poor quality. I couldn't have been more surprised. It is obvious that the film didn't entail a huge budget (there probably would have been at least one familiar name in the cast if there had been). But some of the best films of all time are the ones that didn't have much of a budget (e.g. Rocky). PITCH BLACK isn't a great sci-fi movie, but it is better than most.<br /><br />The story was quite believable and does not deny it's homage to the classic ALIEN. The acting is wonderful and the cinematography and brilliant lighting (or lack of) that conceals the film's small budget (yet fits wonderfully with the plot) is pure genius. The movie kept me both in suspense and full of interest. PITCH BLACK is one of the most underrated movies of 2000. Like the characters in the film, perhaps the movie can finally find a way out of the shadows and make its way into the light of respect.
B00000IGGA|5.0|I have to agree with everyone, excpet for the one dude, and state that this album is beautiful. It is exactly what I expected and hoped it would sound like. <br />A friend of mine plays drums on Cold Water and I lovingly remember when he brought an unmixed copy to the little bar we were at and about seven of us packed into his car to have a listen. People were nearly crying. I knew from right there it would be a special record.<br />Mr. Waits really just keeps getting better and better with each release.
B0000060NF|5.0|As a bass player, Marvin Gaye's &quot;What's Going On&quot; represents the pinnacle of bass playing. James Jamerson's bass lines and grooves are superlative and demand repeated listenings. In my opinion, it is what makes the album so incredible. Any other player wouldn't deliver the impact or immediacy that Jamerson brings to the album. From the complex and dense parts of &quot;What's Going On&quot; and &quot;What's Happening Brother?&quot; to the relatively simple and melodic line on &quot;Flyin' High&quot;, Jamerson's parts perfectly fit the mood of the album. A must-have for any bassist who wants to listen to a genius at his peak.
B000008B01|5.0|20 years ago, at the Fremantle Markets in Perth, Australia, I bought a cassette that just had the title 'Musica Popular Brasiliera' by a musician called Joao Gilberto. I have been searching for this ever since, as it is one of the most beautiful collection of simple but fascinating songs ever made. The voices are magic ... a lesson in quiet perfection ... amazing. I have just found out that the title of the collection I have been listening to for so long is 'Aguas de Marco'. This is it.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Gza's second album is a true representation of hip-hop. It's not the kind of album that you would hear played in the clubs, you have to really listen to it for it to sink in. Gza displays a sharp, witty lyrical prowess with lyrics that stay fresh in your mind years after you buy the album. Rza's production fits the rhymes perfectly, and every joint will have you noddin your head. its impossible to pick the best songs, because they are all part of a whole. I wont tell you to get this, cus if you are a true hip-hop fan, you would figure it out for yourself.

0783117523|5.0|I loved this movie it was very good. And for all of the perverts out there Angelina Jolie gets naked for about 80% of the film.
6305609721|2.0|I love Star Trek but when the actors think that they know more about the audience than the originator, it gets ugly.  Here's a perfect example of why actors should be in front of the camera and not behind it.  No, comedy is not why the original series was so popular.  No, I don't want want to see the original cast members make complete idiots of themselves.  And no, I don't think that &quot;Save the Whales&quot; is a worthy topic for Star Trek to tackle.  Yeah, it's just a TV show but it was a good one and doesn't deserve this treatment.
B000002GYR|5.0|I've owned this album for ten years and have never tired of it. Classic Waits. Brilliant from the first song until the close. You need this one in your collection.
B000056K04|5.0|This album is a departure from what we fans normally expect from DMB.  If you expect a 'jam session' based album or a pop-rock, through and through, sound you probably should look elsewhere.  While I will admit some pop shines through, Everyday establishes Dave Matthews as a rock star.  I say Dave Matthews because none of the rest of the band really sticks out (which is my only complaint).  This album is a sharp contrast to their last studio album, Before These Crowded Streets, and does not continue in the never-ending melody of differing musical generas that is normally associated with the band.  The best description I have heard so far, is that this is a 'muscular'  album.  It truly is muscular, which is a new venture for the band.  Personally I like the feel of raw emotion it allows Dave Matthews to express.  While I love all of their prior work, I feel Everyday is perhaps their best work to date.  It firmly establishes Dave Mattthews as a serious rock musician and is a tell-tale sign of a truly matured rock sensation who is finally ready to show the world what he is capable of.
B00000IAU3|5.0|What an amazing CD! I remember seeing an interview with Dido on CNN, and I totally loved her music! Unfortunately, I could't get her CD here in Holland. Thank God she's finally getting the recognition she deserves! As for the songs: Right now, my absolute fav. is &quot;Hunter&quot;. What a great song! When you listen to &quot;All you want&quot;, you can just &quot;feel&quot; the story around it, just incredible. All the songs are great! It's a must-own CD for every music fan!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I've loved Dido every since I heard &quot;Thank You&quot; in the movie Sliding Doors.  I first got the soundtrack in 1998 or so and then I bought NO ANGEL as soon as it came out.  I'm so happy that her talent is finally being recognized.  To any one who is thinking about buying the CD it was the best $... I have ever spent.  It is well worth the money.  Not to mention all the songs are great. There isn't a single song that I don't like and I am so picky about my music. So if you are thinking about buying it you won't be dissappointed.
B000002A3T|3.0|(...) Well... it seems this album turns to be a little less than perfect. (...) Certainly its not a bad album, it has nice musical arrangements, good performing, and so on... But Pink Floyd always had that tiny, hard-to-describe mood in their compositions that it is practically absent here. Definitely, Division Bell is quite worse than its predecessor. (...).
019283519X|5.0|This has to be the most exciting detective book of all times. It combines all the elements required for a good detective thriller in the right proportions. At the start,Doyle introduces the element of the supernatural making the reader wonder whether the book will become a bit unimaginable. But it is handled very well by both Doyle and his hero-sleuth Holmes.<br />  Throughout the entire book the reader is kept on the edge of his seat,wondering what will happen when he turns the next page. One cannot but feel an icy cold shiver running through one`s spine during Dr.James Mortimer`s initial conversation with Holmes.<br />  &quot;Footprints? Man`s or a woman`s? &quot;<br />  &quot;Mr.Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!&quot;<br />  This element of horror is certainly lacking in other Holmes` books. Great read for any fan of detective thrillers.
B0000524EM|1.0|First of all, the commentary by ALEX PROYAS is NOT, I REPEAT NOT on this box set! Alex wants nothing to do with this set. Also, the so-called CROW CHRONICLES which was a behind the scenes amateur video shot by screenwriter DAVID SCHOW during filming will also NOT be on this set! This was a 90 minute video!!<br />Why you ask? Well evidently Miramax did not secure the rights to the chronicles before it was advertised to be on this set. Smart huh? Why isn't Alex Proyas doing the commentary? That's simple too, he wants nothing to do with this box set and Miramax in all their wisdom failed to ask him if he would do it before they sent out the promo material.<br />Now I ask you ... is this box set still worth the price of admission with the hour and a half Crow chronicles missing and the audio commentary by Alex Proyas, the film's director not on here? This is not too hard to figure out ...
B00004Z4WR|1.0|Gone in 60 Seconds was a horrible movie. I hated it. While watching this movie in the theatres, I actually went underneath the seat looking for all that popcorn I spilt for me to snack on to escape the horrible plot, acting, etc...<br />This movie stared Nicholas Cage as Randall &quot;Memphis&quot; Raines, an ex-car theft, his brother, Kip Raines played by Giovanni Ribisi, is trying to follow in his footsteps. Kip and his squad of unintimidating, punk, rough-em-up car baddies agree to a job where they're ridiculously expected to steal 50 specific cars for some really over-dramatic scary boss dude a.k.a 'The Carpenter' (scary, huh!?) .Anyways, they've got some ludicrously small amount of time for no good reason to nab the cars. But unlike the 'car theft legend' Kip's brother is made out to be, Kip himself ..... and screws up, and now his bro has to go steal the cars for him in order to get him back from 'The Carpenterrr'. <br />I don't know why that sounds so great, every line is overdramatic especially the big bad boss who sounds more .......... than evil to me, I mean he's British and loves making things out of wood and treats them like his babies. Another horrible mistake that you seem common in these bad action flicks it that there are things where it 'just happens to be there'. The part I am specifically talking about is the final chase scene (which is a beautiful blend of inconprehensive sense and pure stupidity) where Cage is in the LAST car he needs in the LAST few moments of his deadline and all these cps are chasing him and he reaches a part on his route to the warehouse with a huge traffic jam, and an empty car carrier truck 'just happens to be there' right smack in front of him, so he floors it up the truck's back and clears like a mile or so of traffic. That' realistic.<br />But if you're in the mood to either waste your money or waste your friend's money, buy or rent this today!
B00004ZB9D|4.0|I have written several reviews for this CD of greatest hits, hopefully this one will post.  What I like most about Lenny Kravitz is his style.  He's smooth and he most definately has charisma.  Don't have to be the greatest vocalist to be a successful rock artist as we all know.  Still I am pleased that I have added this rock CD to my collection of great music.  Usually Lenny has 2 possibly 3 great songs per CD so I bought the Best of Lenny knowing that it would be worth the purchase.  I was right.
B000002C1W|5.0|This album marks the returning of a so called rock dinosaur. Certainly it has very little in common with Dark Side Of The Moon or Meddle , but reasonabily speaking, who did really expect the band would sound like they did in the seventies? Certainly it is quite different drom The Final Cut, but take into account that five years had passed, and the band suffered Waters departure first and some kind of hybernation later. The album opens with Signs Of Life, who resembles Shine on. This is a truly Floyd masterpiece, along with both parts of A New Machine . Terminal Frost is an instrumental voyage through new dimensions -superb tenor sax by Scott Page!- On The Turning Away is the sad piece that wets our eyes. If I have to mention a poor track, I would take Sorrow which after its outstanding guitar intro, that seems to be preparing us for better, it falls down to a mere rhythm-chorus song that, for worse, lasts 10 minutes. A final letdown that fortunately do not ruin a very very good Pink Floyd returning work.
B00005214X|4.0|No doubt that the four Fabs, using tracks from  their post-Fab years, could have made one GREAT album that could easily rate with anything they did as a collective. None of the Fabs really made GREAT solo records; let's all be very honest with ourselves here.<br />George said he had been sitting on a wealth of material that could not find the light of day, due to the intense competition of John &amp; Paul.  George decided to let it all hang out and fill up 3 albums of songs written while still a Fab.  Three albums is too much!  All Things Must Pass would have made a GREAT single album.  We will never end this argument here :)<br />All we can do is ask why in the world Georgie reworked &quot;My Sweet Lord.&quot;  It is awful and embarrassing.  I cringed when I heard it.  But nowdays with a CD player you can program your own version of this classic album.<br />One hopes Paul will not go back and diddle with &quot;Junior's Farm.&quot;
B00004WPAZ|5.0|St. Germain innaugaral album has broke ground in the arena of down tempo house and acid jazz. The splendid dj in the group is accompanied by a seven piece jazz band that turns out some of the most melodic grooves in the biz.  The groups label, Blue Note, has found a pure gem with this completely original album.  This is a must have for all of you experimental jazz and funk collectors.  You won't be dissapointed.
0553296981|5.0|A young girl by the name of Anne Frank writes a very touching diary of her life in the holocaust.  She lives in West Germany, were she goes to school.  She has many friends and really loves her family.  Her dad is nice to her, but her mom and her sister, Margot don't really appreciate her.  Germany was ok, until a nasty man by the name of Adolph Hitler brainwashed a large group of people to hate the Jews. Anne's dad had a friend that promised to move them to safety if this had happened.  So, they were forced to hide in an attic of an office building, which was hidden off by a bookcase so no one would now they were there.  They called this their secret annex.  They were brought clothing, food and personal items by a very nice group of German people.  Anne's family was moved in to hiding with another family, in which they did not get along too well.  They had to keep from using the bathroom, or talking because someone below would tell they were up there.  To them, this was the best place they could be at time of hatred and massive killings.  They all had to either co-operate with each other, or die.  I suggest that everyone should read this exceptional diary written by a girl in the tragic holocaust.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|For most great artists, it is absolutely essential to hear their hit singles in the context of its original album.  This is because the albums themselves stand up as individual works of art.  <br />Lenny Kravitz, however, is not one of those artists.  Throughout his career, he's been criticized for aping his heroes of the past (Hendrix, Marvin Gaye, etc).  And for the most part, his critics are right.  Even his last release, &quot;5&quot;, which sounded deceptively modern, followed the same formula. If you took away the loops and electronic flourishes, it's still the same old 70's hard rock.  (It's embarassingly revealing that his remake of the hit 70's song &quot;American Woman&quot; doesn't sound much different from many of his other hit songs) But despite his short comings, he is quite talented at recreating classic rock.  And he has managed to record several catchy hit singles as well.<br />All of this makes Lenny Kravitz the perfect candidate for a Greatist Hits Compilation.  You wouldn't want to spend loads of cash on his individual albums since most of them are rather uneven.  Chances are, you just want to hear his hit singles anyway.  Thankfully, they are all here.  Unfortunately, the songs are not in chronological order.  However, that doesn't cause much trouble since it's all the same retro classic rock anyways.  There is also a new song included, &quot;Again&quot; , which is quite a catchy number.  On the down side, the second half of the album can be somewhat tedious.  (It seems Lenny didn't have enough hits to fill an entire album)  &quot;Mr. Cab Driver&quot; in particular is awful.  <br />This is a fantastic album for any music fan who just wants Lenny's hit singles and doesn't want to waste money on his individual albums.  In short, this is the only Lenny Kravitz album you need to purchase.
B000056K04|5.0|I was very upset at first with this CD.  It seemed like Dave lost his touch and a lot more by moving to the electric guitar and his first single &quot;I Did It&quot; is arguably terrible.  But after listening to the CD over and over (5-6 times now) I can almost say it's my favorite Dave CD EVER.  It's up their with Crash, quite the compliment.<br />I highly reccomend the CD for any Dave fan or anyone looking for the best music around.  &quot;I Did It&quot; was a bad choice for the single; it's the worst song on the CD, that should tell you something.  Pick this one up now and see him live.  You won't regret either.
B000056K04|1.0|I have loved EVERYTHING dmb has done until now.  i own every song the band has ever recorded. after listening to everyday, i have 12 songs too many! i do not have enough room here to adequately explain the sick feeling this album gave me.  this effort is simply dave matthews with some back up musicians.  gone is the meticulous interaction that was the magic of dmb.  this album sounds like some bad electronic music from 1982,  i have never heard anything so over-produced in my life.  i never thought i would say this, but i will never buy a dmb album without hearing it first again.  the illusion that i had of this band being more interested in the quality of their music than their commercial success has proven to be just that, an illusion.
630469654X|5.0|This film restored my faith in that medieval fantasy films can be great films.  Anyone else notice that the director is Richard Donner?  Lethal Weapon ring a bell?  I loved this film.  A dear friend showed it to me not very long ago, and I almost immediately went out and purchased it.  If you love swords, sorcery, and love that is forever this movie is for you. Matthew Broderick is great, I have never liked him better in any other film, maybe Ferris Bueller, but it's hard to decide in my mind.  Despite the big names Matthew steals the show in my mind.  He makes this movie with his witty dialogue and inspired performance. I only hope this film will one day inspire some else to make another film like it, but with out the cheesiness of something like Conan.
0375704027|5.0|For a story so simple and uncomplicated, I wonder why Norwegian wood continues to linger in my memory for so long.  I read this book four months ago, amidst a book binge that covered about a dozen books.  When all others have faded from my memory (it was a binge after all), Norwegian Wood still visits my thoughts once in a while.<br />Maybe it is the most romantic book I have read in while.  The writing and the translation are nothing short of elegant.  Up until now, I am still in struggle to find the right words for it.  Maybe it is so real, it enters my realm of reality, as if I know this people, this IS the story of someone I know.  <br />Norwegian Wood was a great song even before I read this novel.  Now it is unforgettable.  It is a simple concept, take the lyrics of a song and build a novel around it.  And, yet the execution is flawless.  So much so that I can't get it out of my mind.  Both the song and the book.
B000056K04|3.0|what can i say? ok, this is not a whining session,i've got some good points here. but as a Dave Matthews Band fanatic for the past 7 or so years. i can only say that it wasn't exactly what i hoped for or expected. and i know that many people feel the same way, especially those of us who have seen this band live and felt its entire potential.  so you're probably going to hear some of the same things in this review, but i need to make myself heard. first off, &quot;I Did It&quot; is a catchy tune, great for radio play and a cool song for driving in your car in the summer,(kind of like &quot;Stay&quot;) grew on me, but it's not a favorite.  &quot;When the world ends&quot; is funky and fun, you can see a bit of daves wry sense of humor in there ( that is, if he actually wrote it)  &quot;The Space Between&quot; is probably my favorite. it is reminicent of &quot;Satalite&quot; and probably going to be the next on the radio. as for the other songs, well, i can see redeeming qualities in &quot;so right&quot;, &quot;fool to think&quot; and &quot;everyday&quot;  all in all though, the other songs just don't do it for me. and it breaks my heart to say it.  but honestly i think that i was looking forward to hearing the Entire  Dave Matthews Band.... and the amazing songs we heard this past summer... &quot;Grace is Gone&quot; &quot;Sweet Up and Down&quot; &quot;JTR&quot; &quot;Busted Stuff&quot;  &quot;Raven&quot; &quot;Bartender&quot; &quot;Grey Street&quot;  Don't get me wrong, im not whining about this cd....  i like it, and i give them a lot of credit for exploring new avenues.. ie.. dave on electric guitar, and the guys,with different instruments.  i guess we'll have to wait and see what these guys can do with it in concert... if they're happy with it, it should make a world of difference!
B00004SCX6|2.0|The album title speaks for itself...In her sophomore album, Britney Spears continues to dabble in the same kind of music as she did on her debut one.<br />Britney Spears is a confused person when it comes to her stand on music. What does she really want to specialize in? The bulk of the album is comprised of bubblegum pop songs, along with a few \\"mature\\" songs like \\"Stronger, You Got It All\\". But, the confusion begins when there are also a lot more childish songs like &quot;Dear Diary, Girl In The Mirror&quot;. From the start, it is already ridiculous to picture Britney Spears as a 19-yr old singing such childish songs!<br />\\"Oops I did it again\\" is a weak album musically, but more so vocally. Britney Spears tries to build her &quot;unique&quot; style of singing - she growls, purrs and even pleads. However given the inherent, limited potential of her natural vocal tone, her efforts have backfired instead. She simply doesn't have a natural, adult voice.<br />In a foolish attempt to make the CD sound more interesting, Britney Spears has placed some of her impossibly girlish chit-chat sessions with friends as interludes. Not that it was a bad idea, but the content of those chit-chat sessions were way too - &quot;cute&quot;.<br />A few songs are catchy and have good beats (e.g. Don't Go Knocking On My Door\\"). But the majority of songs are really forgettable bubblegum pop. The ballads are also missing in the soul factor. This is obviously one album that was rushed.<br />On the whole, &quot;Oops...I Did It Again&quot; is really suited for young children (not more than 12 yrs old). This is courtesy of the fact that Britney Spears has not left her Mickey Mouse Club legacy behind.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I'm tired of all of the Britney haters out there!  Britney is a good artist and I don't really care what you say about her.  She's an excellent performer (I've seen her twice in concert) and I like the type of pop music she puts out a lot more than the wailings of Christina Aguilera.  Britney's songs are catchy and the best song on the CD in my opinion is the remake of Satisfaction (and ... music critic agrees with me on that too).  When you get a record deal and go on tour and sell millions of copies of your debut and second album, then I care about your opinion.  But otherwise, leave Brit alone and let her millions of fans enjoy her work without your complaining.
0792842723|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the cinema I was a little jaded with the Bond series and I really only found the climactic ending to be impressive. But having bought the video and viewed it many times I would rate this one of the best Bond movies (along with From Russia With Love,Goldfinger,Diamonds Are Forever,The Man With the Golden Gun and Licence to Kill being the other best Bond movies). Yes Goldeneye initially seems to suffer from the over the top set pieces and some whimsicality of the Roger Moore era and it drags a bit after the openning sequence until Bond next encounters Alex Trevellyn but it's best scenes have dramatic tension due to good acting and interesting characters. Sean Bean makes a great villian, in all respects just like Bond but having a twisted sense of loyalty,namely to himself only, at the expense of everyone else to their unbidden detriment. The end fight scene is very well staged and the movie has been copied by others such as Mission Impossible 2. Some of the best Bond movies have this one to one confrontation e.g.The Man With The Golden Gun (Roger Moore's best outing as JB). The script is consistent and the characters mouth intelligent lines in keeping with their characters. St.Petersberg looks beautiful and the Mount Arceibo radio telescope was an inspired setting for the climax, although why on Earth Alex Trevellyn needed a huge dish like Mount Arceibo to just control a satellite in near Earth orbit is a mystery. Anyway, we shouldn't question these things in a JB movie-remember the non-sequitors in Diamonds Are Forever? Robbie Coltrane turns in a good performance as Bond's former Russian adversary and Dame Judi Dench could probably take the place of the real M in MI6 (watch out for Stella Rimmington's book). An enjoyable film.
B00004T8RK|5.0|This album doesn't have much potential for radio singles, and as most of you know, Pearl Jam doesn't care. This may be Pearl Jam's best album ever overall. None of the songs would make it in my top five Pearl Jam songs of all time (Maybe Thin Air), but this album doesn't really have any bad songs.
B00004T9UF|4.0|The Marshall Mathers LP brings a new cool feel to the genre that is sure to attract listners that previously steered away from the whole rap scene. The topics of this album, while violent, are very powerful and honest. &quot;Stan&quot; is the most powerful song I have heard in years and deserves some sort of award. Even people who don't particularly like Eminem will come around when they hear the mastery that went into the production of this fantastic album. I recommend it to anybody.
0671042858|3.0|It thought it was okay, nothing more.
B000059POY|4.0|This monstrosity has some of the greatest actors to ever grace a screen amongst its hallowed cast, Ringo Starr, John Astin (twice!!!!) and Marlon Brando as a tantric guru in a mobile caravan temple!!!!!  Ewa Aulin in the title role, tears up the screen with her wide eyed sexual innocence, but it is her co-stars that carry the film as each molests her in increasingly more absurd situations.  Dicky Burton opens proceedings as a pretentious University lecturer, with an ever present wind machine blowing at his scarf and hair(even indoors!!!!!), he very soon ends up lying face down in a puddle of whiskey - the biggest stretch any actor has ever made on film!!!!!!!!!!  Ringo Starr plays a hunchbacked mexican gardener, John Astin plays Candy's Father AND Uncle, Walter Matthau plays a gung-ho army commander(!!!!!), the list of famous faces in this abomination is endless!!!!! The fact that the plot makes absolutely no sence, is of little consequence to director Christian Marquand, who relishes the fact that he has a big name cast doing the most unbelievably OTT things, delivering inane/insane dialogue, and generally being as &quot;out there&quot; as possible. At all costs, get a copy of this film... if only to have a look at some of the greatest actors of all time making total and utter fools of themselves (well, you would exactly watch it for the plot, would you???!!!).  One of the greatest &quot;head&quot; films ever made!
6304639457|5.0|I first saw this concert on TV. I couldn't believe it. These people have gotten better with age! They finally seem to have grown up and are all getting along, clearing the way for perhaps their best performance ever! No cracking voices or off-pitch notes here. Christie, Lindsey, Mick - awesome! Like they never took a break! Great to watch periodically as a reminder of what music - and performing music should be like.
0671027344|5.0|I bought this book randomly and I was surprised at my selection. It was a book I could not put down, finishing in less than a day (with big breaks of course). With my schedule, that never happens. Steven Chobsky is a gifted writer and his characters are easily relatable to. The moment I finished, I passed it on to a friend who was truly moved. It is a powerful work by a powerful writer.
B000001GPX|5.0|There are innumerable versions of the Beethoven Fifth and plenty of the Seventh as well, but hearing Carlos Kleiber's versions it is as if one is hearing them for the very first time, they are that magical and electrifying.  Everything about these performances is flawless, the tempo, the dynamics, the ensemble, the sheer excitement.  After listening to the Seventh I just sat in silence for about half an hour, not wanting to even breathe, and the Fifth is just as good, sounding completely fresh even though one has heard the work so many times before.  Even if you have other well-loved versions, these are worth owning, and if you are looking for your first version, then look no further.
B00004XONN|1.0|Well what a load of .... I thankfully didn't buy this shambles of an album, because I had heard that many people thought it was awful. Having borrowed it from a friend, I can safely say it is worse than awful - it is diabolically bad. Starting off with a grating cut-up Yorke vocal in Everything Is In Its Right Place, imitating the Beatles in National Anthem (except the Beatles knew how to use discordant horns to effect - not irritation), and showing their know how to use play a note perfect G-major scale in Optimistic. Great work guys, you're so innovative and alternative aren't you? The only song that is bearable is How To Disappear Completely and even this Thom sings like he's half asleep. Musically this album is a dead duck, lyrically Thom rattles off meaningless lyrics - although many fanatics are sure to point to glimpses of absent genius amongst his drivel. The other reviewers only rate this album because it is a Radiohead album. If this album came from a 'no-name' group from Iceland, no-one would even listen to it twice.
B00003CXE7|5.0|THIS MOVIE SHOULD AND WILL WIN THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR. AWESOME IS THE ONLY WAY TO DESCRIBE IT.
B000024D4R|5.0|As a person who appreciates the talent and extreme effort that goes into the creation of a great album, I believe my opinion is of great value to someone who has made the decision to purchase a quality piece of music.  This album is truly a classic and, in my opinion, surpasses the bands previous efforts of Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here.  The guitar work is wonderfully creative and emotional,while the insightful lyrics and impecable musicianship of the band complements the total atmosphere of an incredible album that,sadly, can not be found in today's music.DO NOT THINK, BUY THIS ALBUM!!
B000000W94|5.0|Yes, you might call this a tribute album to Peter Green. And no, this isn't a half-baked effort to cash in on the fame of an aging guitar god. Well, not much anyway. Gary Moore idolized Green as a kid growing up in Belfast. Moore said he first saw Peter Green in 1967 when he had just replaced Eric Clapton of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. He said everyone was standing there at the concert with their arms folded like ok, Clapton's gone, let's see what you got. When he started playing, and the room started resonating with a depth of guitar tone that had never been heard before, Eric Clapton quickly became a distant memory, and Peter Green had a smile on his face like he was thinking &quot;it's my turn now&quot;.... Moore never forgot Peter Green, and a year later he formed a band called Skid Row. When Peter Green's new band Fleetwood Mac came to Belfast, this time Skid Row opened for them. After the concert Green asked to meet Moore because he liked his guitar playing. Moore nervously met his idol and they stayed up till the early morning hours talking and playing guitar. After that night they became good friends, and Peter Green got Skid Row signed to their first recording contract.... Gary Moore never forgot that favor, and he pays  Green the ultimate respect here. He captures the Peter Green guitar sound so perfectly on this album, that the first time I heard this I was shocked. He duplicates that special guitar tone and that little B.B. King like treble on the end of a note so perfectly, that it feels like the ghost of the young Peter Green was standing behind Moore showing him every blues riff. Everybody knows nobody can take the place of Peter Green. He could draw you in with his string bending, and then burn a hole in your soul with his solos. There's no hole burning here, but you will get singed a little. When you hear the songs like THE SUPERNATURAL, I LOVED ANOTHER WOMAN, LONG GREY MARE, and SHOWBIZ BLUES, you'll feel like your hearing Peter Green circa 1968 all over again. These songs are done with a lot of passion, and are very close to the real deal. Moore says &quot;Blues For Greeny&quot; is not a tribute album, but a big thank you to Peter Green for everything that he's given.....Amen
0553579908|2.0|The book was a weak follow up to a very promising first book.  It can be summed up as much ado about nothing.
B0000508U6|2.0|Hmm... let's see, how many bands have &quot;influenced&quot; Coldplay? (..did I say &quot;influence&quot; or reverse rip-off?) Coldplay is one of those bands that scores big with a catchy yet completely benign song like &quot;Yellow.&quot;<br />&quot;Yellow,&quot; is one of those songs that has absolutely ZERO to say about anything, means nothing, but has catchy riffs and decent vocals. The lyrics to &quot;Yellow,&quot; and just about every other Coldplay song on the album remind me of the &quot;sugar-coated,&quot; rhymes of The Lightning Seeds. I'm sorry, but singing sullenly sappy songs about stars and moons and everything else really doesn't make much of an impact on my life...<br />The album is a failure. A complete failure. I bought it, feel cheated, and gave it to my pathetic roommate. Also, in reading some of the other reviewer's comments on Amazon.com, I found myself insulted by their comparing (or attempting to distance Coldplay from the likes of Radiohead, which essentially is a comparision) music to Radiohead. <br />Radiohead is a far more compelling band. Hands down. Their lyrics actually make you reflect on the world and your life. What things mean to you and how society shapes the way you think, or are conditioned to think. Coldplay, on the other hand, just wallow away and wish for different things. <br />The music on this album is above-average and the lyrics are below -average. If you can imagine a boy-band like the Backstreet Boys singing these songs, which I totally can (but can't with Radiohead), then there's some issues with the lyrics. Because I can totally see them dancing around singing &quot;Yellow!!!&quot;
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the most historically accurate films of all time.  I noticed some of you didn't like this movie.  The #1 complaint seems to be historical accuracy.  Someone described the tiger scene as comical. Define &quot;comical.&quot; Do you not think that they did stuff like that in the Colosseum?  As a historian by degree, I think you'd be mentally and psychologically shocked by some of the atrocities that were done in the Colosseum!  True, Commodus did NOT actually kill his father, but what some of you don't seem to realize is that the number 1 rule of filmmaking is to ENTERTAIN, not educate.  This is especially true with period films (films that take place long ago).  Although some characters were actual figures, &quot;Gladiator&quot; is NOT a true story.  Here's a common-sense rule of life: don't get your history from cinema!  <br />For the rest who enjoyed this film, I don't think we should be surprised that &quot;Gladiator&quot; is nominated for 12 Oscars, including Best Picture.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is much more than an average book. It provokes deep thoughts usually packed away in the deep recesses of your brain. It explores a small Southern town through the eyes of a young girl, something more authors should consider when writin. Because she is so innocent, you get to see how much of a difference the world is when you are a child. You don't know about addicition or racism or corruption, subjects Harper Lee tackles with ease. However, when said subjects are thrust upon you, sometimes it takes a loving father to beak it down to your level. This role is played by Atticus Finch. He is about as wonderful of a character as you can get, with his stern but caring attitude. This book should be commended for its details, never overlooking anything, and its character development. To Kill A Mockingbird is a must-have for anyone.
B00003CXLG|4.0|I was a bit skeptical when I heard they were doing a live action movie.  I did not want to see it but my kids did.  So the Friday before Christmas, we ventured to the theatre where I was prepared to take a nap.  I told myself to remember it is a make believe story. If I wanted reality I could watch the News. Much to my surprise, I enjoyed the movie enough to go back a second time.  Jim Carey was magnificent.  No one could have done it better.  Ron Howard was fabulous.  Though the additional storyline got carried away, it worked.  The scenery was awesome. I loved Cindy Lou Who.  And the story about why the Grinch hated the Who's.  When it is released on DVD, it will totally become part of my Christmas Movie Collection.
0788811363|5.0|I have heard many people call this film stupid, or boring, or they say that they hated it, and once again I marvel at the subjectiveness of life. I LOVE this film. The film not only is gorgeous and haunting, but it sumptuously examins the complex world of human emotions in a very intelligent and provocative way. The love story is conveyed through the half-dreams of a dying man, and this lends the whole story a bittersweetness that is rarely captured on film without being cheesy. Meanwhile the film is held up by a cast of amazing charaters, and beautiful cinematography. Anyone with a taste for beauty, the finer side of life, adventure, and romance (in the old sense of the word) will love it too. Those who do not I feel have just plain missed the point, or completely lack imagination.
6305076995|1.0|I should start by saying I love Yes, have seen them more than ten times in concert over the years and have even had the pleasure of meeting Jon Anderson.  They're amazingly talented and they do a great show. Having said all of that, I wish this DVD represented that. Even though this original performance was great, the DVD was poor.   The movie that I saw in a theater so many years ago sure looked and sounded better than this DVD. Yes, it was shot in the early 1970s, but &quot;Woodstock&quot; was shot in 1969 and it looked a lot better than this. This print is not very good, there are scratches in the film they used to transfer it and the audio is muddy.  Sometimes the video is even out of sync with the audio.  Jon and the gang should have insisted that this get a lot more work or not even be released on DVD.  The only thing that sounded really clean was the video production company's opening animation that precedes the actual movie.  If you're a diehard Yes fan, you might enjoy having this, but it was not the great movie experience I remember.
B000058T5E|5.0|Guitar redefined.   I was well prepared from listening to the album &quot;WHO ELSE&quot; and seeing Him play in concert not long ago but my ear and my mind streach to grasp what he plays.  Each listen is a revelation.
0790743213|5.0|This movie is great.  It reminds me of a spider's web.  Everyone is tangled, but it is how they are tanglet that makes the difference.  I really like the music that is used to give it the murder-feel.  It also has my favorite actor Martin Landau!!! So, if you are looking for a movie with twist and turns see this movie.
B000059PR5|5.0|Gone........... This movie was a chilling reminder that at any given time, we could be Gone with one push of a button! A Nuclure War could happen again. This movie has some good special effects for the time frame it was made. If it were to happen this would be the the reaction of everyone. A Must See movie!!
B000001DTM|5.0|Definetely a masterpiece, but that's been said too many times already..What makes this album so great is the joy bono finds in singing these songs, it's like he already knew they were better than most of his work on the joshua tree..Bono goes deep, he's giving everything he's got on every song you'll find here..The edge is sharp as ever on performances like the fly..even better than the real thing and mysterious ways he's touching you like you've never been touched by him. there are no standouts on this album, or i must say that every track is one...U2 proved with Achtung Baby that they are the worlds biggest rock and roll band since The Who..I love(d) this album, if you like music, you're missing out on a big thing if you don't own this album
B00004W3MS|5.0|Following a 2-3 month ordeal to find this album at a reasonable price, I didn't know exactly what to expect upon hearing it. From reading other reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, Sigur Rós is compared to a myriad different musicians with styles that wouldn't seem to mesh gracefully. I think there is an element of all of these comparisons in Sigur Rós' music. In the primacy of my experience with this album I was reminded of Radiohead, then Godspeed Your Black Emporer, and in places of Vaughan Williams' string music.  Finally, I decided it was time to give up and just award them their own sound.  <br />Above anything else I'm sturck with a profound sense of innocence while spinning &quot;Agaetis Byrjun.&quot;  At an obvious level the seeming exuberance of this music is schmaltzy, cheesy, syrupy, whatever, but its all genuine. This left me not only guilt-free from liking it, but also wholly impressed. I think the remote origins of the band probably has a lot to do with the feeling their music evokes. I can't see an album like this being created in the musical fish bowl that is the US.  Because of the incomprehensibility of the lyrics, and especially the music &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot; has an unbreakable mystique.  Heartily recommended and Amazon has a great deal going on this disc considering its an import.
B00004RF98|5.0|In as few words as possible, to respond to reviewers below: In 1952 there were no &quot;widescreen&quot; movies and everything, including SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, was shot in the 1.33:1 ratio that was also used for TV screens.  This DVD is not pan and scan, because this is not a widescreen movie. You're not missing anything.
B00003CXSP|5.0|To anyone out there who preaches, &quot;Read the book,&quot; or &quot;Silence of the Lambs was better,&quot; you need to realize the Hannibal is a movie that is totally independent of Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal is designed around a completely different plot from the other film which so many talk about when Hannibal is even mentioned.       And about the book business, Is a book and a movie even remotely the same thing? How can you even compare the two.      A hint to anyone who has yet to see Hannibal, before you go to the theatres to see the movie (which I would encourage you to do) completely forget anything you remeber from Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal the novel. If you have never seen Silence or read Hannibal, all the better. Just enjoy the movie from start to finish, no more, no less.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I remember buying my copy of &quot;Tapestry&quot; and thinking to myself, &quot;why haven't I already done this?&quot; King's brilliant, timeless, wholly engaging music and lyrics have a galvanic effect on those it touches. It's almost as if Carole herself IS the piano, the music and lyrics work so well. As a 17 year old, I may not have the seniority to remember this disc from back in the day, but as a piano musician, I entirely worship the musicality. Perhaps the most enchanting song on the disc is &quot;Will you Still Love Me Tomorrow?&quot;, a deeply personal song with tremendous backup vocals (JT is there, listen for him!), fantastic band work, and totally singable, memorable lyrics. Where is this music on the radio? Why aren't children growing up today with Carole King as their hero, instead of certain unmentionable artists with names that sound like a small, double-lettered chocolate candy? I'm delighted that other teens have found a masterpiece in this disc, from what I see of their reviews. Buy the disc, listen to the words and feel the music, turn it up, and discover that real music can be loved by everyone. It's a tremendous work.
B0000025DD|4.0|I was impressed with this solo debut. I paid about $... at a local store for this CD, so naturally I thought it would be something crappy like Alice Cooper's _Freak Out_. Boy, I was glad that I was wrong. This CD is good. You may notice some familiar tunes on this CD, especially with the song &quot;Raise My Rent&quot;...the main guitar solo from this song (and some of the music...it IS an instrumental) was resurrected as part of the Pink Floyd song &quot;What Do You Want From Me&quot; (from _The Division Bell_), and I think another melody from the song was also resurrected as the bridge for the Pink Floyd song &quot;Keep Talking&quot; (also from _The Division Bell_). A very good CD!
0385484518|3.0|The author, Mitch, re-discovered his dying professor, Morrie, after sixteen years.  He started taking weekly lessons from his professor again.  Only this time, the lessons were about life, taught from Morrie¡¦s life experiences.  Beyond the wisdom and insight imparted explicitly by Morrie (such as intangible love and relationships over tangible materialism, do not be afraid to feel), also touching the hearts were the implicit values taught.  It showed us that a teacher¡¦s teaching could go a long way and could have a powerful influence on his students.  I find this particularly inspiring, as complaints that being a teacher does not have its rewards are not new.  It also showed us that wisdom grow proportionately with age, so do not be afraid to grow old!  However, how many of us could age so graciously as Morrie? This book serves a timely reminder to all of us, who are becoming older everyday.<br />I remember thinking to myself: Mr Albom, you are so lucky, so many of us do not have great teachers to begin with.  However, at the end of the book, you have earned my respect.  I have to admit that there are indeed great teachers all around us, but it takes a special person willing to spend the time, commitment and effort to find one and unleash the greatness.<br />I have to admit that I did not take to the book when I first started.  The cynic in me asked, isn't this stating the obvious?  However, upon finishing the book and having time to reflect on it, I find has indeeed touched and inspired me, in a subtle way.
0440234743|5.0|I think I honestly liked this book. Nate, a dishonest lawyer, is one character. This is a good story with more than a few tricks in the plot. Buy it. If you be then you can see how good this book is because it isn't that bad.    I'd read it fifty  times and a half. Chapters are interesting; story is well written. It's filled with oxymocrins and contradictions too for you philosophers, and a rant here...and a fish coming out of the river...<br />I don't know what to say about this guy. Five stars says it all.
B000056K04|4.0|No doubt The Dave Matthews Band has taken a step in a different direction with the release of &quot;Everyday.&quot;  But different isn't always bad.  Granted, &quot;Everyday&quot; is no &quot;Crash&quot; or &quot;Under The Table and Dreaming,&quot; but it's a solid album for a band trying not to get pigeon-holed into being known only as the world's greatest jam band.  &quot;Everyday&quot; tries something new by adopting a more studio sound than in previous albums, and I think it sounds wonderful.  While the album neglected to showcase Leroi on sax and Boyd on violin, that's not what the album is for.  That's what concerts are for; to allow those guys to go off for a seven minute solo, and the new songs off &quot;Everyday&quot; will offer ample opportunity for these fellows to jam.  One of the biggest complaints about the DMB's last efforts, &quot;Before These Crowded Streets,&quot; was that the songs were too long, in part due to elongated solos.  Where as &quot;BTCS&quot; was an uneven album unsure of which direction it wanted to go in, &quot;Everday&quot;, though taking a direction towards what many of you hardcore finds consider a sell-out, at least it decides which direction to take and takes it.  I myself enjoy the new sound, recalling the earlier stuff of Peter Gabriel.  I think it's a direction The DMB needed to go... otherwise this would have been just the same old thing.
014100018X|4.0|I don't think I've ever read a book quite like Chocolat before. The plot is fairly simple: Vianne Rocher, a wanderer with a young daughter, arrives in Lansquenet on Shrove Tuesday. Something about the village appeals to her, despite the looming presence of the Black Man, the local priest, and she decides to stay. Taking the lease on an old bakery directly across the road from the church, she opens a chocolaterie.<br />A chocolate shop. In *Lent*! Thus Vianne arouses the fury of Reynard, the priest, while at the same time gradually seducing many of the townspeople one by one with the delicious smell and taste of chocolate, and her uncanny ability to divine everyone's 'favourite'. Does Vianne have some sort of supernatural powers? Can she read minds? Harris never completely answers that question, but then the first-person narrative allows Vianne to reveal only as much as she wishes, and she herself rejects any suspicion of such abilities. And yet the Tarot cards are still ever-present, as are the strange dreams and visions.<br />Reynaud, the priest, whose own first-person narrative takes up about a quarter of the book, is another fascinating character. Overly self-righteous and determined to be in control of everything in the village, he takes immediate exception to *Mademoiselle* Rocher and her chocolaterie, and sees it as his mission to wean his flock away from her. But he has secrets as well, some of which are suspected by the old woman Armande (another fascinating character).<br />As Harris takes us inexorably towards Easter, it's clear that some sort of confrontation is coming between the old habits and the new, the dull darkness of conformity and the glad brightness of joy, and the priest and the chocolate-woman. But exactly what form does it take? You'll have to read for yourself.<br />Oh, and don't forget to savour the secondary characters: Vianne's daughter Anouk, Armande, Guillaume and his beloved dog, Josephine the kleptomaniac who is married to a drunked wife-beater, Roux the proud gypsy and many more.
B00001NFCY|2.0|Face it.  As music liteners our expectations have lowered <br />considerably.  9 years ago this is an important album.  But<br />it is NOT 1992 and unfortunately Kurt Cobain is dead, and <br />Pearl Jam has long faded from the scene..or so I thought.  <br />But it appears as if Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder has decided to<br />make a cheap clone of himself in Scott Stapp.  (I guess he<br />left out the part that writes original lyrics)  Creed is tired sounding<br />Not only due they borrow from one of the kings of grunge in<br />PJ, but they also imitate the band that was originally thought<br />to rip PJ off, Stone Temple Pilots. I originally liked Human Clay, <br /> that is until I got over my grunge nostalgia and realized<br />that I was listening to grunge &quot;wannabes&quot;.  I instantly put the<br />album down and picked up PJ's Ten and realized just how<br />better the original really is.  Creed isn't a bad band, just an<br />incredibly unoriginal one.  They are the true &quot;Corporate<br />Grunge Band&quot; making money off the creativeness of others.<br />If you are a real music fan and listener, DON'T BUY THIS <br />ALBUM!  If You want some real grunge from the masters chek<br />Nirvana's Nevermind or In Utero, or PJ's Ten and V.S.;  While<br />you're at it pick up Soundgardens Badmotorfinger, these <br />albums will show just howmediocre Creed really is.
B000056K04|4.0|If you read through the negative reviews of this album, you'll see that the biggest complaint from longtime DMB fans is that it is not what they expected.  And they're right.  EVERYDAY is a departure from the traditional DMB sound.  <br />But when you review an album, you have to disregard everything else that a particular band may have released before.  Otherwise, you risk incorporating a biased view into your critique.  This is what I think has happened to those DMB fans who do not like EVERYDAY.  It doesn't satisfy their yearning for a traditional sound so they believe it is garbage.<br />The same applies for those 5-star reviews by hardcore DMB fans.  While I actually love this album, I wonder if some of those reviews might be a little biased themselves, perhaps blinded by their love of DMB into parading this cd as the greatest album ever from any band, which is definitely stretching it.  <br />I guess this isn't really a review but advice on whether or not you should pick up EVERYDAY.  If you truly appreciate music, then disregard all of those reviews from longtime DMB fans, negative OR positive.  Look at what recently-introduced fans have to say, and then make your decision.<br />As for myself, I like this album because:<br />1. Most of the songs are enjoyable.  Every cd has a few subpar songs, so expect some from this one as well.  But again, a lot of good songs.<br />2.  Radio-friendly but sophisticated.<br />3.  I listened to it 4 times straight.  I couldn't stop.  That has never happened before.  Not even with my personal favorite cd, SIAMESE DREAM by SP.
B000056K04|5.0|Comparing to other albums, this is not the usual DMB. <br />&quot;Before There Crowded Streets&quot; was more into a fast pace &quot;city type beat&quot;.  &quot;Crash&quot;, of course was just plain awesome.<br />&quot;Everyday&quot;, is one of my new favorites.  It is a new sound to the DMB.  The songs are shorter, not to say that long ones were bad, and a little slower.  <br />It only shows the &quot;melting pot&quot; of music they have to offer.  The variety is just awesome.  <br />I'm sure this upcoming tour is gonna be kickin'.  To sum it all up, I encourage any fan to go out and buy this cd, if you haven't already.  And to all the people that haven't even heard of them, go out and see what you are missing.<br />I give this 5 stars not because i like it more than any other Dave album, but because i can can get used to the new Dave, along with listening to his classics.
0141301155|5.0|This book is so delicious I just want to eat it!  &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; might be in many people's eyes a story about morality but to me, it's a story about children and their love of all things sweet, sticky and delicious.  Charlie Bucket is the delightful boy (who is so poor all he gets to eat is cabbage soup) who finds a golden ticket in a chocolate bar he buys with money he finds in the street.  This ticket entitles him and a companion to enter the wonderful world of Mr. Willy Wonka, the most famous and mysterious chocolate maker that the universe has ever known.  Other competition winners include such heinous but wonderfully over the top characters like Augustus Gloop, the greediest boy in the world, and Veruca Salt, a spoilt brat whose father buys 10,000 chocolate bars so she can win a golden ticket.  These greedy children and their frightful companions get their come-uppance in various hilarious ways that will have you spluttering with laughter with every page that you turn.  Dahl's most famous creation in this book though are the Oompa-Loompas, a race of small people that Mr. Wonka has saved from extinction in the days when he traveled the world.  This is a glorious, glorious book, filled with amazing characters, incredible sweets such as the everlasting gobstopper for the child with limited pocket money, and the chewing gum that that is a whole three course meal in itself.  Your mouth will be watering throughout the story, and the river of chocolate will make you drool a waterfall.  A scrumptious book for everyone no matter what their age.
0446677450|1.0|I read this book in one day, not because it is so amazingly full of great ideas (it isn't), but more because it was simultaneously fascinating and horrifying.  Kind of like a train wreck.  The spectacle of Kiyosaki blithely trashing his own--in my view, very successful--father in favor of &quot;rich dad&quot; was the horrifying part.  The notion that there might be some unexamined emotional content to his decision to follow in the footsteps of &quot;rich dad,&quot; who by his own account is both arrogant and exploitative, remains just that: unexamined.  This despite the fact that the Oedipal drama in which sons want to (symbolically) kill their fathers is the oldest story in the book.<br />Many other reviewers have talked about how thin the book is on concrete ideas, and how badly written and repetitive it is, so I won't belabor those points here.  I'll just say that if you are looking for a way to bring your financial life into balance with your emotional and spiritual lives, or seeking to build weath in ways that don't exploit others (see Kiyosaki's rant against unions for an example of what I mean), I would stay far away from this book.  In addition to lacking substance and being badly written, Kiyosaki's cluelessness about his own motives leads him to espouse some pretty skewed values.
052594527X|5.0|Since art historians don't know much of anything about Vermeer, it's very interesting to see how this author tries to make him real.  Fascinating story of Vermeer's maid.  Definetly read if you're an art-buff who still wants a good fictional book to spice up your world of biographies.
0790730960|5.0|Oh, this movie is so sad! It really is! This is a fantastic movie simply because it isn't afraid to be all of the other things that the original &quot;Batman&quot; was, also: Funny, exciting, thrilling, haunting, dark, romantic, and endlessly clever. It also features three terrific performances from the three leads; Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight (Bruce Wayne), Michelle Pfeiffer looking hot as ever as the sleek and smooth Catwoman (Selena Kyle), and Danny Devito as the diabolically demonic Penguin (Oswald Cobblepot). And we can never forget Christopher Walken, playing Max Schreck (yeah, just like the guy who played Nosferatu), who is quite the fiend.<br />The film opens with a rather heartbreaking scene that sets the tone for the entire movie, which takes the lightheartedness of the Joker character in the original and tosses it right out the window. Instead, we have the emotionally scarred darkness of the Penguin, who was literally sent up the river like Baby Moses in a covered wicker baby basket on Christmas Eve simply because he wasn't a normal child born with five fingers instead of the shiny flippers he has extending from his wrists. Despite his ghastly, unsightly appearence and mangled people skills, we sympathize with the Penguin's plight simply because we would never wish what happened to him on our worst enemy. Sure, being sent up the river worked out fine for Moses, but Penguin is no Moses, and he is not on a mission from God. He's on a mission for a simple reason: Revenge. Revenge of biblical proportions by kidnapping every first born child in Gotham City, in honor of his own castaway status on Christmas Eve, more than 30 years prior. Meanwhile, we have the newly resurrected-from-cat-saliva Selena Kyle, who decides to try on a skintight vinyl suit with a whip draped around her feminine feline torso, desperate to avenge her &quot;death&quot; at the hands of her boss, Schreck. And amongst it all, Bruce Wayne is in love with Selena Kyle and trying to shut down the blatantly illegal operations of Schreck, trying to connect him to the Penguin, who he theorizes runs the Red Triangle Gang that terrorizes the streets. His hands are quite full as Batman, too: He is trying to stop Catwoman, is unaware of Selena's murder at the hands of Schreck, he knows that Penguin is up to something but can't prove it, and he is being framed. It's an amazingly confusing plot to explain, but it all works seamlessly through the carefully constructed pace of the film, for which I credit Tim Burton, whose direction is flawless, as usual. He keeps the characters interesting while making sure the background is just as visually stunning as Pfeiffer in that catsuit.<br />&quot;Batman Returns&quot; may take a few viewings to totally appreciate it, but you're astounded a little more each time. It's one of the best comic book movies ever made.down the blatantly illegal operations of Schreck, trying to connect him to the Penguin, who he theorizes runs the Red Triangle Gang that terrorizes the streets.

0446608955|4.0|Although it has been a few weeks since I have read Nicholas Sparks' novel, I have not forgotten any small detail.  The story of two young people so diverse created an unforgetable story.  Sparks uses a plain and &quot;to the point&quot; style to tell his personal story of love and loss.  The book is an easy read.  Once you start, it is hard to put down.  The story itself is so captivating that you want to finish the book once you read the first chapter.  Overall, I think that the book would be more likely to be well received by females as opposed to males,simply because it is a love story.  It is unpredictable and Inspiring.  What a Moving Story.
0790729652|5.0|I'm still not sure how to spell &quot;omelette.&quot; I think it's one of those stupid words with more than one spelling that's acceptable, but in any case, it all means the same thing. The English language is a confusing one, indeed. Why did I want to become a writer? I don't know, but I still do... I do it well for someone with limited understanding of exactly where the people who invented this language were coming from, I guess. Oh well, to the point... As is the usual with movies by the visionary Tim Burton, &quot;Batman&quot; just reeks of visual style, amazing set design, a great villainous performance, and at the center of it all, a terrific hero. This is the best comic book adaptation ever made, followed closely by its immediate predecessor, &quot;Batman Returns,&quot; &quot;X-Men,&quot; and &quot;The Crow.&quot; I'm really looking forward to what Sam Raimi is going to do with &quot;Spider-Man.&quot; Whatever happens, it'll be good, `cause that's just my pal Sam, but I doubt if it'll live up to the level the bar for comic book films has been set to, after a masterpiece like &quot;Batman.&quot;<br />Everyone knows the story of &quot;Batman.&quot; Billionaire golden boy Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered when he was just a kid, and he was there to witness their demise. In his grief, he vowed to dedicate a part of the fortune he was left, and the empire he took over, to establishing himself as a figure that would strike fear into the hearts of any person who even considered donning a ski-mask and going for an unexpected withdrawal from the bank. He became Batman, the dark figure that looms in the shadows of every murderer's consciousness, ever-threatening their life as a free person. As was expected by virtually every fan of the comic book series, Batman's first veray onto the big screen (discounting the over-acted Adam West version) was going to be against the Joker, and who could possibly play the Joker better than Jack Nicholson? Jack (an 11-time Oscar nominee) embodies the Joker in everyway, and his resulting performance behind the white make-up and red lipstick is astonishing. Michael Keaton was an unlikely choice to play Batman when the film was thought of being made, but oh my God, does he do the role justice! He is amazing behind the cape and cowl. He is Batman! How could Val Kilmer or George Clooney live up to such a dynamically portrayed Batman after Keaton left? Exactly, they couldn't! But the real star of the movie is its director, Tim Burton. His direction of his visual effects and set design is what makes this movie into the dark, atmospheric thriller that it is. The very close second is, of course, the maniacal Joker performance from Nicholson, who is given so many one-liners from the screenwriters that they must've taken half-hour breaks to stop laughing, thinking up this stuff. Their work is hard-fought for and well-done. I love this movie!

6301966015|5.0|Although Antonioni never made another film as perfect as &quot;L'Avventura&quot;, this is an undeniable classic for its intrinsic merits (the film-developing scene is one of the great set-pieces in cinema history), its unargued influence over other film-makers (De Palma doesn't count - ugh), and its unsurpassed depiction of one of Western culture's more memorable &quot;scenes&quot;. (And let us not forget the righteous middle finger it extended to not-dead-yet Catholic Legion of Decency by including a glimpse of pubic hair - the first, according to Amos Vogel, in any mainstream film.)

6300208591|2.0|Only its undeniable status as one of central relics of the Sixites (one that has held up as well as, say, the Nehru jacket) saves this dull, pretentious, massively over-rated film from the lowest rating. Maybe you had to be there, but I wasn't, and, judging from this, I'm not sorry.
079073804X|5.0|This is the best horror movie I have ever seen! Yes, I am a complete horror buff and I've seen a lot of shocking movies (Faces of Death, Cannibal Holocaust etc.) but this has probably shocked me the most. It's is a very scary film and will no doubt give you nightmares for months after seeing it. It's has excellent make-up, acting and great effects. I think the worst scene of all is either the 'Spider walk' or the scene where we have a close-up of her scarred and truly disturbing satanic face (after her head spins around). However, if you're looking for a gore film, then The Exorcist isn't for you. If your looking for something to scare the ... out of you then I would DEFINATLY choose this film!!!!!<br /> Anyone who's thinking about watching this film for the first time be warned - it is truly scary/disturbing and chances are you won't be able to get to sleep for weeks after!
0140013997|5.0|My only regret is that I did not read this book years ago, when Gerald Durrell was living, so I could tell the author how much I love his book.   The praises of  \\"My Family and Other Animals\\" has been sung by many readers.  What I would like to add is that Mr. Durrell has a wonderful gift for writing and observation.  His book takes us on a journey to the sun-drenched  island of Corfu, that for Mr. Durrell is a place near to paradise.  The natural world he is surrounded by fascinates him, and the reader, as we are introduced to the varieties of creatures that inhabit the island.  We come to appreciate the life that can be found in a ditch filled with water.  Then, there are the animals Mr. Durrell collected as pets: Quasimodo the pigeon, Ulysses the owl and the Magenpies.   This is to say nothing of his dogs: Roger, Widdle and Puke.  I only wish there could have been photographs in this edition.<br />Coupled with this are wonderful portraits of his mother, two brothers and sister and their sometimes eccentric guests, along with the people of Corfu they meet.  From the moment the Durrells arrive on Corfu, followed by a pack of dogs, their adventures are non-stop.  One wishes for the chance to have been on Corfu and be able to pay a visit to whatever villa they happened to be living in.    \\"My Family and Other Animals\\" is a book that you will not want to end.
B00004SCX6|1.0|What a pathetic album. This is track after track of pure bubblegum mall diva. The vocals are shallow and the music is more karaokethan instrumental quality..
B00004W55E|4.0|It took a  while for me to actually listen to this cd.  As with all of rachelle's music, you need to sit, be quiet, and actully listen to the words to get into her style of music.  Her music has a simple sophistication that is much needed today.  This is adult music.  A great CD to mull over with someone you care about.
B00004TVG7|4.0|I used to own the original LP of this revelatory recording. It had some of the best and most extensive liner notes I have ever seen, regarding the music on the recording, the way the performers decided to arrange and treat it, and the great variety of instruments that the ancient Greeks used. The liner notes of this CD are missing nearly all of this material. Thus, the listener is unable to follow all the nuances of how and why the performers &quot;breathed new life&quot; into this ancient and often fragmentary material. Sometimes they used silence, sometimes notes, sometimes dissonances to fill in the lacunae; and without the original liner notes, one finds it hard to follow where history ends and creativity begins.<br />Nevertheless, the rendition of this music is not as speculative as Paul Yost would have one believe. The notations used in the source material have their difficulties (one of which is that theory and practice didn't always coincide in the use of the notations); but there is no serious disagreement as to how the melodies should read, and the performers take care to draw on authoritative renditions. The reconstructed period instruments are well-made and have fascinating tone colors; and they are very similar to those heard on &quot;Music of the Ancient Greeks&quot; by Pandourion Records (which I recommend for a different treatment of the melodies). Of course one may always arrange these melodies in various ways, but the Greeks surely did no less (being attuned as they were to perfecting the *melos* or combination of words and melodies).<br />Finally, the Greeks were by no means the first to create a coherent musical art in the West. (Why do people always claim this?) The Hebrews beat them by many centuries, and the Egyptians and Mesopotamians before that. Greece was the pupil of these nations, musically speaking. I recommend &quot;Music of the Bible Revealed&quot;, also on Amazon.com, for a view of another form of ancient music, at once simpler and more harmonic than ancient Greek music, yet based on similar theoretical norms.

0399146253|2.0|I have really enjoyed Cornwell's books, although recently she seems to have Scarpetta spend entirely too much time whining for herself and bemoaning Lucy. In &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; Scarpetta not only does this to excess - it was tiresome, especially for the first half - but also exhibiting personal weakness in contrast to the strength we have come to know. And Police Captain Marino is portrayed as an intolerant slob; one can wonder how he continues to hold his position. On a positive note, this book tied in nicely with the previous book, &quot;Black Notice&quot;, which one should read first. All-in-all, I hope Cornwell gets off her downward spiral and soon will recover.
006092988X|5.0|I was assigned this book for a college English class. After reading the first chapter I was hooked. I couldn't put it down. I recommended it to all of my friends. Betty Smith brought Francis and the whole family to life for me. They tugged at my heart and showed me what my greatgrandparetns may have gone through. Thus helped me to connect with relatives I never knew and better understand what their children had to endure. The srtugle and the determination is strengthening. You beleive that what ever hardship you are going through it isn't as bad and you can make it.
6305078564|2.0|I'll limit my comments to the technical quality of the DVD transfer, which is, in a word, terrible. I do realize that material created for broadcast won't look as good as material created for theatrical projection. That said, DVD should easily carry studio-quality video, and this DVD is nowhere near that. It is gritty, squirmy, and unsharp. The BBC and A&amp;E can and should go back to the ?16 mm? film sources to create a new transfer that does justice to an otherwise-excellent production.
006092988X|5.0|I read this book for an English assignment and I loved it. I recommend it for anyone looking for a book that will touch your heart. This book brings the &quot;old&quot; Brooklyn, New York to life. It helped me to understand what was going on at that time. Betty Smith brought Frannie and her family to life for me and into my life. The book helped me to understand what my grandparents and greatgrandparents went through.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Finally, It's here and available. I've been waiting for this DVD for a long time and the wait was well worth it.<br />Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece, &quot;Rear Window&quot;, was painstakingly remastered by the team of Robert A. Harris and James Katz.  This is the same team that did a splendid job on &quot;Vertigo&quot; and they almost one up thier previous effort. The DVD has a special 55 minute documentary and in one of the sections they discuss how they went about the process of the restoration and the extreme difficulties they encountered in bringing this classic back to life.  <br />I can't begin to think of all the hard work and tedious hours of work they had to confront. Ahead of them was a daunting task of organizing and fitting hundreds of thousands of feet of raw footage, negatives, positives, and foreign transfers together in one coherant, unified film. In the interview, it was documented that the negatives were virtually untreatable.  It's a near miracle that they produced the quality that they did on this DVD.<br />There is one important point to make about this treatment and restoration of the film to DVD...It is not perfect.  The quality of the restoration is not as good as the job they did on &quot;Vertigo&quot;.  You will see some minor artifacts, medium to high grain resolution at times, and some mismatching of shots from high focus, less color saturation to slightly blurry focus but higher color resolution. Katz and Harris explain in the interview why they had to make certain compromises due to the lack of resources they encountered.  <br />But all in all the valiant effort and there is nothing that really distracts you from this spectacular and breathtaking film. After viewing this film you will see why Hitchcock was the grandmaster at &quot;pure cinema&quot;.  Hitchcock had a sixth sense in knowing where to put the camera at all times for maximum effect.<br />I can only think of 2-3 modern day directors that have this deep advanced intuition of camera placement, movement &amp; composition to create a purely visual experience for the audience. This is a very important responsibility for the director.  To know exactly where a camera is to be positioned for dramatic effect and the progression of tension and drama within a scene.  In my opinion, the two current directors that really stand out with this extraordinary talent are Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese.  <br />Back to the DVD...Buy it.  I strongly recommend the purchase. If your a Hichcock fan this is a must.  If your a regular movie fan you will see an excellent display of filmmaking at it's finest.
B000056K04|3.0|I have been a DMB fan from back when he was playing small clubs on college campuses.  His sound has evolved over the years and fans have grown with him.   His sound on this new album is a definate attempt to be more polished than the jam session type sound most fans have become  used to.  However, I don't think its as sudden a change as most think.  It has been a gradual progression from RTT, UTTAD, Crash, BTCS, and now to Everyday.   He's exploring and expanding himself.  It is true that the talent of the band members doesn't get highlighted as individually as some may like I personally enjoy very much this new album and can't wait to see him live.
B00001OH7U|4.0|1976 was the one of the major highlights featuring David Bowie music. He managed to create some great songs on this album; including the overlong but powerful Station to Station, the Greatest Hits song Golden Years, TVC15, and the light disco of Stay. Plus, Wild Is the Wind was on Changesbowietwo, the second Greatest Hits album. The least popular song is Word On A Wing, starting out good, but a little too uneeded.   All in all it's a great album that will shake the boots of most Bowie fans, as the Thin White Duke sings one of his most unspespected kind of album, a one that reveals his talents as a songwriter/performer.   Notice the cover of Station to Station (and Low) is a part from 1976's The Man That Fell To Earth (also starring Bowie as an alien).
B00003CX5P|5.0|Jezz, the movie wasn't that bad! I think many of the Star Wars fans had such high expectations for this movie, it was impossible for Lucas to live up to them. The special effects were incredible and the sound was simply amazing. I also thought it added a lot of cool little twists to the Star Wars history. The light saber duel and Pod race was worth the ticket price alone. I myself can't wait for the DVD to come out (if ever). So instead of nitpicking and finding as many faults about the movie as you can, try comparing it the other 99% of the movies out there. It won't seem as bad then.

B000056K04|5.0|I think all of you people reviewing this album need to step back and realize what you are!! This album is truly amazing! After I heard &quot;I did it&quot; I knew DMB was going in the right direction with better produced songs. &quot;I did it&quot; is a catchy single, but you must listen to this album all the way through to realize how Glen Ballard helped DMB create a classic album. DMB's other albums are good but I have a hard time listening to them all the way through. &quot;Everyday&quot; does not have this problem. I dont remember an album flowing so well that I can listen to it over and over and not get tired of it. &quot;Everyday&quot; just puts you in a good mood!! I think I could even dance to some of these songs! There are some great songs on here such as What You Are, The Space Between, Fool to Think, So Right, and Dreams of your Fathers. The electric gutairs are very creative and dont sound like anything out there. This album is well produced and the extra instrumentation by Ballard really compliments Dave's voice and the bands instruments.  The drums and gutair riff are awesome on Dreams of Your Fathers! I think the biggest reason why a lot of Dave fans don't like this so far is beacuse it is too produced, edgy and upbeat. They are not used to Dave's new attitude and lyrical sound as opposed to the laid back unproduced sound. The great producing creates a rich and full sound. Some argue that this album abandons DMB's original unplugged sound. Well, this is a studio album and I will go see them in concert to get the live effect. A lot of great bands experiment with new sounds but this time DMB found the prize and their new sound is for the better.  &quot;Everyday,&quot; is a return to the Romantic sound that started in the 80's with Pop/Rock and New Wave but vanished in the 90's with Grunge/Alternative. DMB returns the feeling of that era with a new fresh sound for other artists to learn from.

B000050XEI|4.0|Pop in any Enya CD, and you're pretty certain what you are going to get.  In reality, looking back at Enya's past releases, it seems that every release is the next chapter in the same book rather than brand new material.  This isn't really a bad thing.  Fans of previous releases will get more of what they expect, only this time the songs seem to be far more upbeat than before.  This album really breaks no new ground and is noticeably too short for the first release in five years, but those who have enjoyed what has come before will want to settle in for an undoubtably enjoyable ride.
B00003CXR1|5.0|My husband and I saw this movie in a packed theater on a Sat. afternoon.  I was skeptical whether my husband would think it a &quot;chick flick,&quot; but alas, we both loved it!  The movie is a beautiful passion that weaves its way through the village in need of grace rather than rules, and rules, and rules.  The actors are extremely careful to make all of your senses understand each one's portrayal of the intensity of need so waiting to be encountered.  That need being portrayed by the gteat actors as art--for the village and its people are emotionally painted as an impressionistic painting' therefore, they find grace.  This is an &quot;artsy movie,&quot; but it is a must, even when you didn't think you needed it!
B000050FEN|5.0|This is what a psychological thriller is supposed to be about. A movie all about atmosphere, mood and anticipation; the real horror is in our own minds created by our own fertile imagination - not spattered across the screen in gory shades of red. It's after the fact, after we've been thoroughly chilled by 'Seven' and are ponderously walking away, contemplating it's bleak message - it's then that we realize that we did not actually witness any of the murders. Our minds are the source of our own discomfort, we have disturbed ourselves. <br />William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), world-weary, seen-it-all, senior investigator on the homicide squad has seven (naturally) days to go until he retires. Eager, young detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) requested to be transferred to the division to work with him. Flattery?, not at all, and in fact they don't hit it off - Somerset a more cerebral thinking man's cop does not have the time to babysit Mills, or the patience to put up with his gung-ho attitude. This tension between the two principals is incidental to the story and is there mainly to allow Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) to act her role as peacemaker and more importantly, to place her in our minds as the one and only pleasant, happy and light presence in the whole movie (it's important at the ending). <br />The killer - 'John Doe' (Kevin Spacey) - is a real psychopath, sick, deranged and chillingly cunning and smart; always a step ahead of the detectives. He uses the seven sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and wrath as the motiffs for his crimes - and he IS very creative(?)in their execution. Even though it would appear so, it was not immediately apparent that the first crime was the crime of gluttony - a grossly obese man who, bound hand and foot, was forced to eat himself to death. The detectives simply knew there was a deeper meaning. After the second murder where the word 'greed' was spelled in blood, and with forensic evidence finding 'gluttony'at the scene of the first crime - Somerset shows why he is the brilliant detective that he is, and deduces that there will be five more crimes. Crimes of sloth, pride and lust take place with the detectives desperately but vainly trying to gues who, what, where and when as good detectives are wont to do.<br />Nothing however prepares us for the prelude to, and the execution of, the crimes of envy and wrath. The killer walks into the police station, blood dripping from his hands, confessing and giving himself up...it's over. Not at all. There is a purpose to the killers madness. He's about to conclude the sermon he's been preaching on sin, finishing the lessons to be learned. It requires all of us, the audience, Somerset, Mills, Tracy and 'John Doe' to be a part of one of the most shocking and numbing endings to any movie that I have seen in a long time. This movie is the definition of psychological thriller.
B00004T9UF|5.0|...<br />Eminem speaks truly from his inspiration, and this is definitely shown in the album. If you've ever listened to hip-hop before you know that much of what is said is done in lyrics which someone who wasn't knowledgeable in the culture wouldn't understand. In a way, this is kind of like a silent censorship of the music. Eminem, however, goes all out. Because of the &quot;nice, white-boy&quot; image that has developed he has become the opposite balance. When an artist becomes this offensive or controversial, it makes it even better in a way. It fulfills the opposite of what we've been fed all of our lives, but also it encompases the idea that singers and other mediums can sometimes say things that we cannot say in real life, and this is a great thing. Personal expression is the first thing we do when you have an idea, and Eminem perfectly captures the idea of fear and anger with crisp rhymes and lyrics that you will be able to relate to on some level, even if a part of you is recoiling at the graphic nature of the lyrics (but remember that all of the 'graphics' were generated by yourself, and not the music). If you read the lyrics of the songs on fan sites, you will also be able to see his talent. Rap songs tend to be very poetic, so the lyrics don't lose as much of what's in the song. I would suggest that you check out some of the lyrics before you buy this CD and see if you like any of them.le, Eminem preaches to his  audience that fame is a bunch of bull and he won't be a party to it, no  matter how much money or attention his music garners. He begs us listeners  to not take his angry innuendo so seriously, but his boy-who-cried-wolf act  is not exactly a comprehensible tactic. To sum it up, he's a clear-cut,  brutally honest individual who could give a damn if the whole world  despised him, so long as his daughter Haley grows up to be a well-adjusted  young lady. We praise you for your bravery, Em. Just don't make too many  people mad...
B000056N8X|4.0|The theatrical release of Highlander: Endgame was one of the most puzzling releases I had ever seen.  While the characters and concept were consistent with the TV show, the film itself seemed to be greatly lacking.  Almost soulless.  It was only barely decent.<br />With the DVD release, 12 minutes have been restored to the cut, and the quality of the movie has been changed dramatically.  The villain is more interesting, the characters are more developed, and the plot makes more sense.<br />It is actually a good movie.<br />The DVD package itself is also a great deal of fun.  Not only are there some interesting featurettes (including a very interesting 1-hour behind-the-scenes one), but there is an earlier cut of the movie, allowing one to actually see how the movie developed.  And, with a quaint trivia game included, along with some features for those who have a DVD-ROM, the DVD is more than worth the money.<br />As for the movie itself, it is a great relief.  While there is still almost no sense of continuity (continuing the proud Highlander tradition of disowning anything prior to it), the movie sticks to the original concept from Highlander I and stays there.  There are immortals out for the prize, and the immortality itself is half blessing, half curse.<br />It is also a joy to see Heather and Rachel, both of whom were ignored since the first film, once more playing out their roles in Connor's life.  The acting is very strong, and there literally are no weak performances.  The action is fast and furious, and the plot is gripping.<br />Still, I find myself wishing that there was some continuity laid down that the producers would actually follow.  At this point, the only way that somebody could follow the stories between all four movies and the two TV shows is with an interdimensional map.<br />But, all in all, definitely worth seeing, and definitely worth owning.
020161622X|4.0|Most software engineers don't have the opportunity to spend time with their colleagues and just talk about the craft of software development. While you can't have a conversation with a book, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas will talk if you will listen--and listen you should.<br /><br /> The Pragmatic Programmer is a collection of ideas, observations, and recommendations for software developers. Throughout the book, they highlight these notions in a set of numbered tips, about 70 of them, which are collected on a single tear-out card situated in the back of the book. Just reading the tips, without reading the text of the book, might make these  gems seem trite, empty, and obvious. But, they're not!<br /><br /> Many of the tips actually build upon previous ones, like  tip 4: &quot;Don't live with broken windows&quot;, which urges programmers to fix problems and clean up messes, and tip 20: &quot;Keep knowledge in plain text.&quot; With some books like this you can skip around--but this one is better read from beginning to end.<br /><br /> There is plenty of ideas to consider, agree with, and, perhaps, disagree with, too. You can also feel a little passion. &quot;Conventional wisdom says that once a project is in the coding phase, the work is mostly mechanical, transcribing the design into executable statements. We think that this attitude is the single biggest reason that many programs are ugly, inefficient, poorly structured, unmaintainable, and just plain wrong.&quot; Hooray for authors who take a stand and then back it up with well reasoned arguments!<br /><br /> Reading this book isn't a substitute for having that conversation with a colleague about the craft. But, The Pragmatic Programmer is worth listening to in the mean time. It is a good, solid, fun read.
0451191153|5.0|I first read The Fountainhead as a junior for my English research paper.  I was skeptical about such a large book, and my attitude toward reading it was likewise.  However, after reading it the first time, I could not stop talking about the intense philosophy Ayn Rand introduces with Howard Roark.  The idea of Objectivism, essentially the glorification of individual man's prominence, is intriguing and worthy of consideration.  I love the character of Howard Roark because he is the perfect example of a man who becomes successful despite the restraining presence of a society bent on the normal.  Our greatest historical thinkers were Howard Roarks: Galileo, Einstein, Newton, and the list goes on and on.  This book, although fictional, gives proof to the reader that mankind has the desire to move forward regardless of other people.  I see Roark not as a depressed and pitiful weakling who blames society for the downfall of man, but as a true hero among men.  He stands out because he does not fold under the pressure of the majority; he does not bail out on the obvious answer when he knows a deeper meaning exists.  Now, I am reading the book again, one year later, and I find myself underlining most parts of the book.  The story line is filled with true-to-life situations; social darwinism, society v. man, revenge, desire, lust, and every other symptom of life the reader could think of.  The Fountainhead is truly more than a classic, and it is worth reading time and time again.  The more it is read, the more the reader knows about the idea of Objectivism and how accurately it pertains to the life of mankind.  This is definitely a five-star reader, and I encourage everyone to give it a look.

B000002UAU|5.0|In the mid 1960's music had become what it is today, stale and unimaginative. With the release of this album, The Beatles, changed the course of music forever. Their use of electronic sound and orchestration, combined with the wizardry of George Martin, broke new ground and shook rock world to it's very core! Even after all these years, the music on this cd still sounds as good as the day it was recorded. If you are looking for great music, that you will want to listen to over and over again, give this disc a spin. Believe me, you won't regret it!!!!
B00000J7JO|5.0|In a book by Dave Thompson, Flea states &quot;All we ever wanted to do, is play music that comes from our hearts.&quot;  Once again the chili's have not let their fans down.  All 15 tracks of this masterpiece treat the listener to heart-pounding, finger tapping, lip smacking rhythms that only Anthony and the boys can deliver.  If you're a chili fan you must already own this disc, if you're not, buy it and you'll become one.
0385335482|5.0|I hate to compare to Bridget Jones because I think this book was much better.  Very fast moving and funny.  I think there is a little of Rebecca in all of us and I could relate to several situations.  The lighthearted story and amusing characters make this book very fun.  Summer's coming...great for the beach!
B00003CXFG|5.0|Pitch Black is an excellent sci-fi thriller.  As a matter of fact, I don't think it would be a stretch to say it's been the best since James Cameron's Aliens.  I've noticed a lot of acclaim for Vin Diesel's performance, which is well-deserved, but not as many people tend to mention Radha Mitchell.  She does deliver this film's best performance (just slightly above Diesel) and creates the most likeable character.  Plus, Mitchell is also simply one of the most beautiful young actresses I've seen in a long while.  Hopefully, more people will start giving her the credit she deserves.
068484267X|1.0|It has been a while since I read Angela's Ashes, but I still recall my rage at the way McCourt portrays life in Ireland during the depression.  Did he think his life was so different from anyone else's in that terrible time?  The Depression went around the world, and most of us did the best we could with it.  My wonderfully Irish parents did their best here in America, and we kids survived and became useful citizens.    <br />   McCourt had an alcoholic father -- that was reprehensible, but he also was a nasty little brat.  In my opinion, Angela's Ashes is a book of self-pity, self-obsession, and self-interest.  As a woman of Irish descent, I'm ashamed of a fellow Celt who could pewl and groan the way Frank McCourt does in this book.  He ought to be ashamed of himself.   <br />   The Irish people have fought the Brits for 800 years and haven't moaned and groaned.   McCourt happens to be living during a world-wide depression, and he falls apart.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  I'm Irish and proud of it; Angela's Ashes is a disgrace to anyone who has Irish blood in them.
B000002GZ1|5.0|Unlike the majority of reveiwers I did not come to the PBBB through the album - in fact I only just bought it. It is without doubt one of the greatest, the guitar work is better than live 60s English bands who could play (there were many who couldn't). I saw PBBB 2 or 3 times in London clubs - the time I vividly remember was the at the Ram Jam club in Brixton where they nearly took the roof off.This was '66 or '67. They were a big hit on the London club scene.<br />What has recently sparked my interest has been watching revival bands (the Yardbirds, the Downliners Sect) in and around Twickenham - one of the 60s hotbeds for English R&amp;B bands. Last week I saw Geno Washington and his new band (the Purple Aces) - this got me to wondering what the connection if any is between the club in Brixton and Genos original Ram Jam Band. Anyone out there know?
0312965788|5.0|This book is quite possibly the best book I have ever read! This book started out great and ended just as well as it started. Even though I am only 14 years of age, I still thoroughly enjoyed this book to it's full potential. All in all this book got the highest mark on my chart. If you like animal stories or just like a really good book you should read this one!
0380973464|2.0|If someone should ever ask me about Cryptonomicon, frankly I cannot imagine an answer better than &quot;Well, it's a very long book...&quot;.  It is my first book from Stephenson (and probably the last one) and my opinion is that a writer should be less presumptuous and should not release a 918 pages volume before being prepared to that.  The story is too fragmented, the plot - if any - is not tangible, and there is an evident intention to reach the 900 pages target. The same subject is covered in 1996 Robert Harris' novel, Enigma, in a better way.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I saw this movie when is first was released at the Critrion Theater in New York.  I was in high school at the time and I was overwhelmed by the film.  Seeing it in NYC on the big screen was an experience I will never forget.  The film is first rate and is probably the best film I've ever seen.  Peter O'Toole is excellent as Lawrence but it is the photography that gives this film its greatness.  No digital images or tricks here...it was all done the old fashioned way and it was done superbly!  I hope the DVD keeps the score intact..including the Overture.  Maurice Jarre's score is unforgettable.  GET THIS FILM!!  You will love it.
B00003CXSP|5.0|...I thought this film was brilliant and to see it with the eyes I viewed it with, you really need to displace it from &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot;  Comparing this sequel and &quot;Silence&quot; is like apples and oranges -- &quot;Hannibal&quot; isn't best picture material, but if you look close enough, you can see that its creators weren't looking to replicate the original (and what they did instead is unique and -- albeit gruesomely -- kind of inspired).<br />&quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was a crime thriller.  &quot;Hannibal&quot; is more operatic and over the top, but earns five stars in my opinion because it is operatic and over the top brilliantly.  My favorite published review of this film compared the original (gothic) &quot;Frankenstien&quot; film to &quot;Silence&quot; and its (campy) sequel &quot;Bride of Frankenstien&quot; to &quot;Hannibal.&quot;  Critics lambasted &quot;Bride&quot; for being funny and kooky rather than horrific like its predecessor was -- nowadays, the same variety of critics call &quot;Bride&quot; better and more original than its predecessor.<br />See &quot;Hannibal&quot; for its operatic elements.  It isn't a thriller/suspense/horror film, but rather a drama and a twisted love story about a Devil named Lecter looking for the hand of the &quot;bride&quot; he knows he can't have.
B00000064G|5.0|Upon hearing the song &quot;Pink Moon&quot; from the VW Cabio commercial, I went on an intense search for the artist and album.  I was really obsessed with this song.  Boy, was I surprised when I found out that this music was from someone who died in 1972!  I thought for sure that this was a contemporary artist, with flavorings of Dave Matthews, even Ritchie Havens, and the like.  Listening to this wonderfully, crafted music, I realize that instead of it sounding like other artists, other artists sound like IT!  <br />If you want great &quot;theme-type&quot; music, Nike Drake's music is well worth buying!
B000003C2S|5.0|congratulations, you found DEATH's &quot;spiritual healing&quot; on amazon...without a doubt, the best death metal album of all time.      this album is indescribably brutal. the production is amazingly clean, the drums are perfectly performed, and the vocals are convincing and extremely gutteral and intelligently controlled by vocalist/guitarist/founder/remainder/songwriter chuck schuldiner. i cant review the album track by track, because you'd get tired of me ranting and raving. SH is a solid album, all the way through. the guitar parts are catchy, strong, and very different...unmatched at the time, and even as of yet...no band, including various formations of DEATH have come close to recreating this succesful formula.        session man james murphy delivers an amazing performance as the cd's lead guitarist. i usually despise guitar solos but the lead trade offs between schuldiner and murphy are priceless...its a shame they no longer get along.       many DEATH records have followed, eventually leading up to the bands demise and being followed up by chucks involvement with his new project CONTROL DENIED. also at this time chuck is recovering from brain cancer that he recently had treated. my wish is that he will regain his health and be able to top the brutality of this 1990 classic.
6305232660|1.0|Don't be fooled by the similar looking cover, this is actually the adult German film about relationships.  While the &quot;impact&quot; is especially &quot;deep&quot; it is intensly boring, and the women don't shave their pits.  It's a slow paced romance between an uber-leftenant in post-WWII Czeczhlosclovakia, and a chaste young country fraulien.  Not bad if you like that stuff.
B00000AOTZ|5.0|the album is far-out!! it made the whole feel of the film more exciting..the last track is my favourite by Joe Walsh!!! i can listen to that song over n over..i love it!! :)
B00000IAU3|1.0|In a time when generic, uninspired rip-off bands are called &quot;fresh&quot;, &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;original&quot; it should be no surprise that someone would get around to ripping off Sarah McLachlan. Dido is that rip-off.<br />Her vocal style, the musical style, everything, is evocative of Sarah McLachlan. A pity, too, because she has a good voice and could stand on her own without resorting to mimicking a greater performer's style.
0688145078|5.0|We received this book as a gift when I was expecting our second child.  My son was just over a year and a half when we started reading it.  The pictures are simple and nice to look at.  Unlike many of the other &quot;sibling&quot; books out there, this one does NOT talk about feeling jealous or upset about the new baby.  We liked that - so my son was not thinking of sibling rivalry before the baby came!  We are going to order I'm a Big Sister for a friend of mine, based on how much my child has enjoyed and continues to enjoy this book.
B00004ZD69|5.0|In this review, I would like to do two things: 1-All of you people who dismiss this album as being uncreative and a repetition of the old theme-crescendo-theme-crescendo Godspeed trademark are blind to my second point. 2-This music is amazingly beautiful. It is profound. I don't mean intellectually profound, I mean musically profound. It isn't hard, it isn't new, but Lift Your Skinny Fists... capitalizes on the tricks Godspeed used on f#a#(infinity) and Slow Riot to make for a winning combo of two CDs and extremely beuatiful music. Honestly, I can't think of anything more to write. If you've ever been touched by music that has no lyrics and no real intellectual meaning, that just sounds extremely satisfying and beautiful, buy this and burn it for everyone you know.
B000006OAM|5.0|First, I would like to state from the very beginning that I had never heard of Natalie Merchant before, NEVER.  I'm a Jazz fan and sometimes listening to classical music.  I don't listen to pop and rock much.  This is just a personal taste of mine, with due respects for other forms of music.  However, I'm an audiophile and always keeping an eye out for good music and good sound, especially the newer formats such as Super audio cd and DVD audio.<br />One day out of the blue in the music store, I saw the Natalie Merchant &quot;Tigerlily&quot; DVD audio, so I decided to pick up the Tigerlily DVD audio as well as the regular cd version to compare to see whether DVD audio is worth the fuss.<br />Well, to make the long story short, I didn't find any significant differences between the DVD audio and the regular version; however, the Tigerlily cd blew me away.  Natalie's voice is so soft and innocent.  She just sings naturally and doesn't try to &quot;impress&quot; the audience with dynamics, speeds, vocal ranges, ad libs, embellishments etc, etc.  This is as good as it get from any talented singer folks.  I would listen to her over any Britney Spears or the like any time, any day (again, with due respects).  To tell you the true, sometimes I don't even know what she is singing about, but I don't care.  After that, I became a fan and purchased the Ophelia [HDCD] as well.  The recording in this one is even better.  I don't like that picture with the cigarette in the mouth, it ruins the innocence of it, but that's beside the point.  Truly 5 stars.
B00000IAU3|5.0|In a music world where real singers like Alanis, Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow and others are few and far between, I am absolutely overjoyed to know that we can add another to the small list.<br />My first impression of Dido was that she sounded almost too much like Ms McLachlan, but that being an objectively good quality, only amplifies itself by the fact that Dido still sounds very original. Though the music on this album is not written by the singer, they fit her perfectly. Dido's voice is beautifully sculpted, luscious of tone and perfectly tempered with coolness. All the songs bear repeated listening; they exude much artistry, poetry and musicality... my favourite is still Thankyou, which as everyone knows has been more than cleverly fused with Eminem's Stan.<br />It seems almost a shame that it has taken so long for Dido's album to reach the masses... but that seems to be a mark of greatness, since the best always take time to mature and always survive.

B00000DGUG|5.0|Alanis Morissette not only writes her own music, plays her own music, sings like only a real singer can, celebrates her every virtue and fault, glorifies every emotion, is spontaneity incarnated, and so... so.. liberating... words cannot describe the incredible artistry and talent she has.<br />SFIJ is the kind of album that grows on one. It contains so much poetry, musical colours, so much originality and power, emotion, spirit... that no one can possibly say he/she has understood its contents in two days, or two weeks, even two months. Now, almost 2 and half years since its release, I am still listening to it, and finding it high art. &quot;Front Row&quot; still kindles in my memory the power of her live concerts, the swirling delirium of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; in &quot;Baba&quot; still totally blows me away, &quot;Thank U&quot; is as beautiful as ever when it first came out, &quot;Sympathetic Character&quot; as full of dark atmosphere; &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; can still bring tears to my eyes, &quot;Joining You&quot; still makes me want to run and spin, and even Alanis' barely audible exclamation of &quot;wow&quot; at the very end of &quot;So Pure&quot; still makes me smile.<br />&quot;All Hail the Goddess!&quot; indeed!!!

B000002U82|5.0|If you have only heard of pink floyd, and don't have any of there albums, this is the one the one to start with. It sounds like it was recorded yesterday. If you are frustrated with today's &quot;rock and Roll&quot;, then pick up this refreshing album. It's one where you can listen to it front and back all through. There is not one crappy song. Plus, now that it is on cd, you can listen to it in its entirety without having to flip it over to listen to side two. It's music people who do and don't use drugs can both appreciate.
6304169558|5.0|It seems almost fashionable to say that you hated this movie. The reports I read of it said that you didn't feel any sympathy for the characters because they're storm-chasers, and thus they get themselves into the situations themselves - why the hell should we empathise with them? So, the first time I saw this film, true to type I hated it. Then, six months later, having completely forgotten what the film was about, I watched it late one night and loved it. And then watched it again in the early hours of the morning. And then watched it again the following day. Somehow, first time around, I had missed the beauty of the characterisations, and paid attention to the story and special effects, but believe me - the characters are the stars of this movie.<br />Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt are perfect playing opposite each other. From the moment the film begins you feel the sexual tension between them, and it is clear that these two people love each other but cannot live with one another. Whichever of the two writers (one of whom was esteemed Michael Crichton) dreamed up the idea of Paxton's new (and thankfully 3-dimensional) flame hit on a winning streak, because it introduces an interesting dynamic into what could have been just another droll special-effects movie. Two worlds collide, and you have that very primeval feeling of a man trapped between what he deems his duty and his true feelings - he wants to chase storms, but rationality says he has to settle down. Every moment Hunt and Paxton are alone together being weighted against the fact that Paxton's new partner is watching/listening/demanding attention lends the proceedings a tragic air that elevates `Twister' (forgive the pun) far above Jan De Bont's other films. That they know each other inside out yet are not together really pulls at the heartstrings. Anyone who disagrees with me should watch it again just for the scene in the rain on the hill when the second DOROTHY machine falls off the back of the truck. I'm not saying it's going to change your mind and make you love this movie, but the depth of feeling that goes into Hunt's character and the way that should-be husband Paxton deals with it is a truly phenomenal film moment. Far from having no empathy with the characters, I felt deeply for Hunt's obsessional quest to get over her father's death, and I related strongly to Paxton's character's attempts to put his destructive past behind him and move on to pastures new, despite loving that destructive past with all his heart. And, beyond Cary Elwes, there are none of the stereotypes associated with these sorts of movies; the supporting cast of talented character actors put `Twister' into a realm of its own.<br />So based on that, I think `Twister' deserves a second look. I'm not saying you're going to love it, but where this film succeeds where others (like `Species' and `Sphere' and `Speed') don't is in creating a believable sense of camaraderie in the characters, rather than allowing every character to fit into an easily labelled `star' or `support' bracket. Now I know there are many who will disagree, but I think this is certainly De Bont at his smoothest, Crichton at his most sensitive (not sentimental - completely different things), Hunt at her most expressive and Paxton at his most exuberant. And it's even got a Lisa Loeb song on the soundtrack - what more could you want?t saying it's going to change your mind and make you love this movie, but the depth of feeling that goes into Hunt's character and the way that should-be husband Paxton deals with it is a truly phenomenal film moment.

630196697X|4.0|The face of film noir wouldn't have been the same without the distinctive face of Richard Widmark who exploded into the genre with his memorably over-the-top performance as baddie Tommy Udo in 1947's Kiss of Death.  For my money, however, it's the underrated Victor Mature who really carries that film, although Widmark gets all the flashy scenes (his pushing of a wheelchair-bound Mildred Dunnock down the stairs is widely considered one of the cruelest in film history).<br />In Jules Dassin's Night and the City (1950) and Pickup on South Street, however, Widmark truly comes into his own with two of the finest film noir performances of all time.  The stage trained actor had added some substance to the flash.  You find yourself sympathizing with the callous Skip McCoy (Pickup on South Street) and nervous Harry Fabian (Night and the City) despite their bad qualities. There's an underlying vulnerability behind all the tough talk and rough gestures (the fact that Widmark looked so undernourished in the '50s may have also had something to do with it).<br />With the uncompromising Sam Fuller (Shock Corridor) at the helm and Thelma Ritter (All About Eve, Rear Window) in a scene-stealing supporting role, you can't go wrong.  An essential release for the film noir afficionado.

It is a masterpiece that showcases João Gilberto and Tom Jobim at the top of their musical creativity. All Jobim's compositions on this record became standards for musicians and listeners all over the world. Furthermore, João Gilberto's unique of way of approaching singing and guitar playing is a delightful and sophisticated musical experience. This CD had a major importance in introducing the world with \\"Bossa Nova\\", a new musical style. Getz understood the bossa nova concept, which is very clear in his beautiful solos -- where he also brings a jazz structure to the blend. It is a timeless piece.  Enjoy it.
B00000F14B|5.0|Quite possibly Robert Preston's portryal of Professor Harold Hill is the best performance by any actor in any musicical ever.  I can't imagine anyone else in the role.  He'd be a tough act to follow.  <br />Shirley Jones, who introduces this DVD, also is perfect as Marian-the-librarian.  <br />Being an Iowan by birth and a Hawkeye by the grace of God, I especially appreciated the humor in the songs, staging and screenplay.  <br />People who love &quot;live&quot; theatre will appreciate the film's many segments that have the look of a stage production.  <br />The story/production is fast-paced and will appeal to even younger viewers.  The film has been used successfully in upper elementary music appreciation curricula.<br />Ron Howard and Paul Ford both deserve special mention.  Both virtually &quot;steal&quot; every scene they're in.<br />Fantastic, Meredith Wilson's &quot;Music Man&quot; belongs in all DVD collections, alongside the shows by Rogers and Hart, Rogers and Hammerstein...
0385501005|5.0|I loved this book so much -- it was like someone had been inside my love life and was reporting back from the trenches, but in a funny and enjoyable way. I gave a copy to each of the last three losers who could have been my &quot;Mr. Commitment&quot;, but failed the test. They could learn a lot from Duffy.<br />This book is truly romantic, but not in the frou-frou sense. If you liked this book, you must definitely read Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf --  the definitive guide to the mind of a commitment-phobe who learns what he's missing out on. Both of these novels are some of the best contemporary writing on a subject that continues to fascinate me -- who knows for how much longer? Arrgh!
B00003CXMG|5.0|The DVD edition of Almost Famous comes out in exactly 6 days. I've been counting down for over a month. Infact, I bought my DVD player basically so that I could see the director's cut. I've read the original script and it seems that some of the best parts were left out of the theatrical release. The character of Penny Lane is like no other. She is the most strong willed yet vulnerable and naive person I've ever seen. Cameron Crowe has the gift to make you fall in love with every character in every one of his films. It is amazing how much you actually feel William's love for Penny. It reminds me of another Crowe film, &quot;Say Anything...&quot; That is just as sincere. Anyway,I will write a full review of the DVD on March 13. For those of you who have not seen this movie yet, consider yourselves deprived. It joins the top of my &quot;favorites&quot; list, along with The Sound of Music and A League of Their Own. This is definately a movie worth spending a little money on!!!!!!
6305827079|5.0|Being an ELVIS fan practically from birth, I just have to say this is the video I've been waiting for!  I own all of ELVIS' recorded concerts, and this one, is by far already my favorite! I do I love them all, however, this is the absolute best of ELVIS the Man!  His humor, charm, and talent is so evident in this video concert!  The concert portion is live from Las Vegas, which reveals Elvis the true entertainer.  Like most fans, I just want to get to know the Man behind the legend, and this video has helped to achieve that. If you are a fan, then you MUST see this!! If not, maybe by viewing this one you'll understand why SO MANY of us are FANS!  Either way it's just great entertainment for(early)Rock N'Roll fans.  Check it out!
0790739909|3.0|\\"All God's angels come to us disguised....\\" -James Russell Lowell<br /><br />When we think of angels, we think of light, power, comfort, healing, goodness, wisdom, loveliness and protection. We think of celestial beings who we think of with wonder.<br /><br />In this movie the angels are much more human, in fact, Nicolas Cage chooses to become human and gives up his immortality in order to be with his true love.<br /><br />This movie is terribly romantic and is a real tear jerker. The ending shows how wonderful it is to be human and to be alive.<br /><br />This movie is SO sad! Women will love it. I watched it with two girlfriends and we were all passing around the box of tissues!<br /><br />\\"If...we would cast the gift of a lovely thought into the heart of a friend, that would be giving as the angels give.\\" -George Macdonald<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

0783225792|4.0|If you're checking out this DVD, chances are your mind is already made up--you're gonna buy it, you know you are, and what a great buy it is!  Director Martin Scorcese's vision comes home with this DVD, featuring widescreen format. You get to see every inch of Las Vegas as Scorcese intended you to see it. Although the purist would say there's no screen like the silver screen, for those of us who don't own theaters, this will do nicely.  The colors are fantastic, the acting terrific, and the story great.  It also features a title design by the wonderful Saul Bass, who you might remember composed many titles for Hitchock, including films like Vertigo and Psycho. Here, the neon glimmer of Las Vegas is transformed into the place we always knew it to be--a purgatorial pit stop for the wretched sinner.  The immortal Robert De Niro leads this hot cast, including super pumped Pesci, and Sharon Stone.  Look for James Woods in one of his sleaziest, yet finest, performances. A hot soundtrack balances out the method swearing, and once again, Scorsese uses his camera and his beloved editor Thelma Schoonmaker to show the rise and fall of an American dynasty in the screen time of 2 hours and 59 minutes. I gave the film 4 out of 5 stars because of my never-ending quest to get studios to put more special features on their DVDs, which this DVD is sadly, misguidedly lacking.  Still, a dazzling piece of filmmaking not to be missed!!!
B00004TH83|5.0|The first time I ve heard her voice, I thought 'She's a singer'. What a voice ! This cd is fabulous ... And Lara is very nice, she's an artist !
B000056N8X|1.0|Let's face it, the first movie was the best and will never be equalled.  The t.v. series was also very good, and I liked it a lot.  But this movie was a waste of $6.  I don't think the editing could have been any worse, totally choppy, and cut in to the continuity.  As far as the acting goes, Adrian Paul looked lost, and Christopher Lambert looked to be in a great deal of pain.  (And what ever happened to Paul's character &quot;laying down the sword&quot; at the end of the t.v. series?) I would love to see a t.v. movie with Adrian Paul as Highlander, but please no more theatrical releases.
6302150930|2.0|If you have read Thomas Hardy's novel, you will understand that Tess's rape by Alec d'Urbervilles at the beginning of the novel is the lynchpin the  rest of the novel hinges on. Tess was revolted by this man, was overcome by him, left immediately, and bore his child, who subsequently died.<br />Everything after that--her shame, her angst about revealing her past to Angel, and most especially her murderous act--stems from this first act of brutality.<br />This particular adaptation shows Tess merely finally succumbing to the attentions of Alec d'Urbervilles, staying on 4 months with him, and then whimsically deciding to leave. Hardly motive for the rest of the story's development, and I'll debate this with anybody until the cows come home.<br />Watch it for the fine filmmaking, for Kinkski's beauty, but for heaven's sake, if you are doing a book report, DO NOT base your report on this film. At least read the first third of the book, and get a feel for how Tess's innocence was violated. The rest of the story will feel much much more profound and tragic, which it was certainly meant to be.<br />And while I'm at it, here's a tidbit to throw in (for you book report researchers). Has &quot;blaming the victim&quot; really changed all that much since Hardy's time?
B00000DGUY|5.0|As a beginning collector of CDs',I picked up this one after seeing a video of Dire Straits play &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; on VH1.  Mark Knopfler made that Fender guitar do everything but sit up and beg!  God, if I could play that good, I would quit my job and just go sit under a tree and play!<br />Back to the CD, It has the already mentioned &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, &quot;Private Investigations&quot;, &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, &quot;Walk of Life&quot; and 12 other great songs and it is well worth your money.  The only thing I would like more of is Mark's playing and may have to buy &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot; as I understand it is a winner also.
B000056K04|1.0|What a phenominal disappointment.<br />With this album, Dave has abandoned all of the things that make him the most original singer/songwriter/musician of the last decade and floated a collection of generic aggro-pop tunes that only a teenage Alanis fan could love.<br />Shame on you, Glen Ballard.<br />When I was 20 my brother asked me if there was a single Grateful Dead song out of some 300 recorded that I DIDN'T like.  I thought about it and realized the answer for me then was &quot;no&quot;.  I was completely and happily immersed in the whole Dead mythology.  The only DMB fans who will like this album are the sycophants who blindly and automatically worship anything and everything that Dave foists upon them.  They will convince themselves that Dave has bravely &quot;reinvented&quot; himself on this album, rather than realize that his creative juices have, at least for one album, sadly run dry.
0385474547|2.0|As an effective story, &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; frankly just doesn't work. <br />A friend of mine sent me this book stating &quot;Chinua will take you there.&quot; Where? After 200 pages, even after spending the whole book trying to develop the main character and make the reader feel for him, unfortunately I didn't feel for him like I was wanting too. Its almost like a good script with bad actors. Which takes us to the storyline- potentially potent stuff, especially considering it is based upon the colonization of Africa, but it could have been much more effective. Instead it sounds to me like an angst-ridden tirade, a thinly veiled emotional attack. Unlike Dee Brown's excellent book on the European invasion of America, &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; where we could really feel the plight of the indigenes as well as see the crimes of the invaders, in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; we are left with only a fleeting shock that doesn't stick because the story dooesn't stick (which in my opinion is a huge loss of an opportunity to tell the bigger story about the ugly conquest of Africa). <br />While this book is an excellent insight into the daily life of an African tribesman, Chinu's angst, which is easily discerned, seems really juvenile to me. Getting angry at the evildoers is a story as human existence, and its getting really, really trite. People kill people in Yugoslavia too, white people. Am I excited about reading the next book about that? Are you?
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD rocks!!  Linkin Park has real talent and has good clean music unlike Limp Bizkit Korn ect.  Some songs they are singing and the next second their rapping.  This is my only CD that I can listen to all of the songs without skipping any.  Buy this CD if you don't want to waste your money!
0805017305|5.0|This works from Dee Brown is a view of the terrible Nazi-Reich-like nature of the Westward expansion of Europeans through 'the New World', and the toll it took on the people already living there. This book should be a required history book in high school and college American History courses. Dee Brown did a great deal of research and traveled all throughout America to make sure he got the story from both sides- whites and Indians. Sadly, as a white American, reading this makes me realize that I should not be proud of my forefathers, but ashamed. But more importantly, it gives me a vicarious view of what the Indians went through (and continue to struggle with), in the name of manifest destiny.<br />What makes this account unique is that it is very scholarly while being very moving at the same time. As a whole, in a factual, heart-wrenching way Dee Brown has captured the Native American's attempts to survive genocide. When you finish, the title of the book will come back to you in a different way.
0618001905|5.0|As an historian and advocate of international human rights, Hochschild has written a work of history that reads like a novel and expands the memory of human race.  His association of Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; with the reality in Congo opens a new perspective for a classic that so far has been read as an allegorical of Freudian parable.  With occasional lapses of narrative and more than a few suppositions, this book has been criticized by the scholarly oriented as being &quot;popular history&quot; with novelistic touches.  The reader might in fact feel there is a void in terms of data and the information might be sketchy, but he will not be able to avoid been shocked by the content of this book.<br />King Leopold II was an intelligent man, deceitful, hypocritical, and deprived of morality.  With political dexterity he carved for himself a &quot;slice&quot; of the the African continent, created his Congo Free State and run it as a private corporation from which he enriched himself for 23 years.  Profits derived from the exploitation of ivory and rubber.  As a product of his time, Leopold played the same game as other European nations, when the prevailing racism and imperialism gave way to mass murder, slavery and genocide.  His colonialism might be considered the cruelest of them all (what scale is used to measure cruelty is an open question), with an estimated 10 million natives been killed, a &quot;cut and run&quot; method.  Using the media, he manipulated his way, convincing the world his actions were fundamentally humanitarian (put an end to the Arab slave market).<br />The story is told through several biographical sketches of the principal heroes (E.D. Morel, George Washington Williams, William H. Sheppard, Sir Roger Casement, and Hezekiah Shanu) and the villains (Leopold himself, his accomplices, and the unconscious perpetrators of all the hypocrisies).  The heroes fought to expose Leopold's crime and eventually forced him to recounce his rule overCongo.  His &quot;politics of forgetting&quot; (burning all his Congo State archives) was not enought to erase history.  A far-reaching consequence was the creation of the Congo Reform movement, a foreruner of Amnesty International.<br />The book exposes ample moral dimension:  how greedy men can ravage other people for their own well being, it counter argues any rationalization of slave trade be it by Europeans or Americans, and it focuses on heroism and depravity of human existence.  It is a tale as important in its own time as it is today because the sources of evil described by Hoshschild are still among us.  As stated by W. Faulkner, &quot;The past is not dead.  It is not even past.&quot;  And to quote Hochschild himself: &quot;For some 80 years -- first under Leopold, and then.. under the Belgian colonial adminstration -- the Congo had the experience of being plundered, for the profit of those overseas.  No one should be surprised that this was followed by more decades of plunder, at the hands of Mobutu and the multinational corporations he was in league with.  And let's not forget... slavery -- both indigenous and transatlantic!  Democracy is a prety fragile plant... and none of Congo's heritage has been fertile soil for it to grown in.&quot;

B000002AGN|5.0|About 5 years ago, when I was still in high school, I bought this CD after Dave Brubeck received the lifetime achievement award from the Grammys.  But after I brought it with me to listen to one day, some of my classmates made me turn it off, stating that teenagers don't listen to jazz.  I was emotionally downed by this that I sold the CD days later.  <br />It's taken me a long time to finally get over this shock.  But now, I'm a collegeman in a world with broader tastes and perspectives.  And fortunately, I've realized that there is only one person in this world who decides what I like, and that's me.  As the Sprite commercial from a few years ago said, &quot;Trust your own tastes, not what somebody else tells you is popular.&quot;  I was able to buy this CD back not too long ago, but I wanted it back especially for &quot;Take Five,&quot; which is my favorite selection on this CD.<br />And finally, as a jazz fan, this is one jazz CD that I'm proud to own, along with Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of Blue,&quot; &quot;Porgy and Bess,&quot; and &quot;Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy.&quot;
B000056K04|2.0|Yay for Dave Matthews for pulling himself out of a rut of depression by co-writing these 12 songs with Glen Ballard (of Alanis Morrisette's Jagged Little Pill success, amongst others). But his new sound, though musically credible, is under par. Not just for the lack of the &quot;Dave Matthews Band sound&quot; (the lack, on this album, of intense solos and acoustic mastery), but also under par for ANY band. Listen to this album with caution: would you think it was so great if it were the band's first album? If you'd never heard of the band or if you've never seen them live?  No, this is not a bad album. But even though it is something new for Dave Matthews, it's not anything new for me, apart from Dave Matthews' unmistakable voice sticking out of over-produced songs with simplistic melodies. That's something I haven't heard before.
6301942647|5.0|Once you'll see it, you won't be able to stop yourself from seeing it at least three more times just to grasp the whole imense esense of the film. A breathtaking, beautifully directed film with views you won't have the opportunity to see anywhere else, involving the fear of the 20th century, harmony, the circle of life, and fantasy.
0425107469|5.0|Watchers is by far my favorite Dean Koontz book.  I am truly a fan of his.  I have read all but a few of his books. I was in nail biting suspense as the dog rightly named Einstein, Nora and Travis are all pursued by a genetically engineered killing machine bent on the destruction of this loving and brilliant Golden Retriever.  The high drama and energetic pace of this book will enthrall you.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense and a descriptive exciting read.
B000005IU2|2.0|It makes me feel so... so.... feminine.
B000056K04|3.0|I have listened to the \\"Everyday\\" cd several times with the hope that its \\"supposedly infatuated Ballard magic\\" would get into my bones.  It hurts me from the deepest and farther corners of my soul to say that the more I listen to it the more disappointed I am.  Where is the band ?.  I can clearly hear Dave Matthews.  But where is the band ?.<br />Dave, I have been following your band since its beginning. I have absolutely every one DMB's recordings, including the concert videos.  I don't want you to get me wrong, and specially I don't want to sound like I'm bragging, but believe me when I tell you this, I know music.  I've been living, studying, playing, breathing music for longer than I can remember.  Because of that, I can confidently say that up to the release of \\"Everyday\\" the DMB was giving its listeners a music lesson.  I can tell you, because I know this for a fact, that even though they did, several top \\"artists\\" were afraid of playing with you guys on the same night for fear of being overshadowed by DMB's level of greatness.  DMB's sound was unique.  All of the players of the DMB are superb musicians.  Each individual's genius shines on DMB's previous material, but not on \\"Everyday\\".  <br />What I still can believe is the lack of Boyd's and Leroi's input on this recording.  Your should be ashamed, yes ashamed of yourself.  I sincerely hope they read this because I cant understand how they, two of the most important and influential components of DMB's sound, allowed themselves to have such minor rolls in this recording.  Dave, I am not the first to say this, and I am definitely not the last to say it, but you better outdo yourself on the live recording of this material.  Expand it, rearrange some of it, and for God's sake listen to your band's advice.  <br />Well now for the objective criticism.  Besides the obvious constrained feel and fabricated sound of the recording, as well as the shameful lack of Boyd Tinsley's and Leroi Moore's unique input, the recording is above average.  For many bands out there \\"Everyday\\" would be a breakthrough album.  However, for the DMB, it is the opposite.  Its not that it is bad, is that DMB's previous work was so outstanding, that this material should have not been released as it was.  <br />If the reader of the previous comments is a hard core DMB fan, you probably already own the album.  Maybe you agree with me, maybe you don't.  Nevertheless, you will not be able to live without it, so you have no other choice but to buy it.  However, if you just discovered DMB, buy it anyway, there are some glimpses of greatness on it, and it will lead you to their previous material.  If you start with the latter, you will surely become a hard core fan and eventually end up owning \\"Everyday\\" anyway.  So no matter which way you go you have no other choice.<br />However, one last word to Dave.  Don't think that because this album is selling as it is, you can lower your standards.  Your fans were your fans because of what you gave them.  The musicians in DMB are not there only because of fame and money, but because they truly love what they do.  You see, by shining as individuals they make a whole larger than the sum of its parts. <br />I will probably buy DMB's next album.  I know that DMB is capable of so much more.  It has proven that in the past.  Please don't let your fans down, \\"you are the best of what's around\\".
0525945636|5.0|Ken Follett pulls it off again with 'Code to Zero'. A story that has something of a favourite black and white movie feel to it. If you haven't read Follett before you're in for a treat - like his cousin bestselling English author John Templeton Smith - Ken Follett is a master crafstman.
6305433909|4.0|A very funny and refreshingly delightful comedy about a lounge singer turned nun named Deloris --who's been stashed in a convent for protection from a murderous mafia boyfriend. While captive in the convent, Sister Mary Clarence helps revitalize a fledgling church by providing her chorale talents to the resident vocal choir. Hilarious scenes and marvelous musical performances by the Sisters make this &quot;act&quot; one of class. Very recommended.
B00003CXE7|5.0|WOW is all I can say. What an intense movie, it's 2+ hour time just zooms by as you are entranced in a tale of fame and glory. I don't care what any critics say, this is a must own for DVD and movie fans. Crowe is amazing as Maximus. One of the best DVDs ever IMHO.
B00003W8NM|2.0|Fight Club is a very atmospheric, highly-stylized, complicated movie that deals with the issue of existentialism through the eyes of a nameless character deemed &quot;Narrator&quot; (Ed Norton).<br />I thought that the film was all-over-the-place thematically (trying hard to juggle itself between Camus' &quot;The Stranger&quot; and &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;), complicated, and ultimately contradictory. If the film was so much about antiestablishment, anti-consumerism, and anti-big business, then why did they advertise many name-brand merchandise in their film? For instance, IKEA had to approve of its name usage the film's script in order for them to use it. The film is so hypocritical. In addition, the film gets rather lengthy and dull after the first hour. I found myself turning off the film and doing other things. Fortunately, I returned to it and during the end it started to pick back up. On first watch, the film is very confusing, but once you watch it a second time or at least ponder it within your mind for an extended period of time you begin to piece things together in the very complicated plot.<br />I read a lot of reviews that said &quot;this movie made you *think*,&quot; of course this movie will make you think: what movie DOESN'T? Even if a movie is horrible, it will make you think, &quot;Wow, this is a horrible movie&quot; (or something along those lines), right? So spare me with that argument.<br />Also, I read a lot of reviews from people who completely agreed with all of the film's hegemonic beliefs and ideologies. The idea that we are all &quot;living in a time with no wars, we haven't had any major wars, therefore what is our purpose,&quot; and the tired, fashionable, Gen-X notion that we are all living meaningless, purposeless, lifeless consumer-driven, commercial, social-climbing lives. If you *really* believe this is so and stand completely behind these viewpoints, why don't you turn your COMPAQ computer off along with the SONY VCR or DVD PLAYER you used to watch the film, leave your 3 BEDROOM HOME, abandon your HONDA, and go to the woods, so that you can live off the land, smell musty, eat grapes, and get mauled by a bear.<br />Stop griping and complaining about the world being a &quot;horrible, meaningless place&quot; and do something about it. Make your life worthwhile: go volunteer, help out in the communities of those in need (like the inner city or even your own community), try to make a difference instead of sipping your STARBUCKS FRAPPACINO and watching films by overpaid actors and writers, while you sit on your duff complaining about how screwed up YOUR WORLD is.
B000053V7Q|5.0|My alternate title to this review was: &quot;My husband almost had to throw a bucket of cold water on me&quot;. Sorry, but I'm not made of cardboard. In fact, I should probably give sort of disclaimer right off the bat that I'm going to do my best to focus on the details of the new Special Edition DVD here, but I was seriously distracted from technical details because Elvis looks so scorchingly sexy in this footage. I'm not exaggerating, nor am I alone in my opinion here. By 1969 &quot;E&quot; had lost all the baby fat he had before and then some, was in the best shape of his life, tan, healthy, and confident. &quot;Thin as a rake and more handsome than 10 movie stars&quot; is the quote from a reporter that kept coming to my mind. Members of the Memphis Mafia said that around this time, they would frequently be looking for Elvis and find him admiring himself in the mirror and saying things like, &quot;(bad word), I'm one good-lookin' sonofagun!&quot;. Watching this movie, it's kind of hard to blame him. I better just move on to the actual movie here before I start really embarrassing myself, but I think the point I'm trying to make is that it's probably impossible for anyone to watch this DVD and not see why Elvis caused women to completely go out of their minds around him.<br />  OK, uh, anyway, this new edition is a must-see for anyone who enjoyed the first film. Since this hasn't gone into wide release as of this writing, we were lucky to find a rental DVD copy a few days ago. I'd heard it was great, but expected maybe 1 or 2 new songs or alternate takes and 5 minutes more of rehearsal footage, plus a better picture/ sound quality. We got WAY more than we had expected. This is just like a second (better, I thought) version of the movie. Most of the footage of the fans that went on too long in the first version is gone. I have to admit that some of the original interviews with babbling fans loaded down with every type of Elvis souvenir (and it if it was wearable, wearing it all at once) probably helped cause the stereotype most people have of Elvis fans as lunatics. I've had people (usually, they were born after Elvis passed away) look at me like they way they would at a member of a cult dancing around in an airport when I mention that I'm a big Elvis fan. This version might make those people change their mind, or at the very least, see why Elvis has so many fans in the first place.<br />  Instead of the fan interviews, and footage 'setting the scene' from the original film, there's plenty of rehearsal/behind the scenes footage. Most of it is new, and amazing. It also reminded me strongly of the section of the 68 comeback special (and also &quot;One Night With You&quot;) where Elvis jammed with his old band, just having fun. Again, I'm kind of fuzzy on the exact songs and the order they're in, (&quot;Get Back/Little Sister&quot; was probably the best) but most of it is not in the 1970 version, including him talking to the Sweet Inspirations and joking with the band.<br />The concert footage is amazing-words fail me, corny as it sounds. Even though it's spliced together using the best of 6 different shows (not that I would have minded sitting through all of them) the performance is so energetic and intense that I can't believe that Elvis did his act twice a night, 7 days a week. Biographers say that Elvis actually requested not to have a day off because he was having so much fun when he first started playing Vegas, and it's obvious from watching this footage that he was having the time of his life. Most of the patter between songs is different, and so are some of his interactions with the audience.  There's an extended version of &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; that's even more impressive than the other one, using alternate takes (they leave out &quot;I hope this suit don't tear up baby&quot;, and put in more of the type of dancing that, how do I put this politely, got him banned from the waist down in the 50's ). Just a complete show-stopper. You have to see it to believe it.<br />  Some of the extras include an extremely entertaining trailer that makes you want to watch the movie again immediately, and a pretty interesting &quot;making of&quot; documentary. Obviously, a lot of care and time was taken to produce this new version; this is not something they just slapped together at the last minute just to cash in on the popularity of special edition DVDs.  Elvis fans, you have got to own this-or at least see it ASAP, at which point you'll want to buy a copy. I still haven't picked my jaw up off the floor. At some points when you're watching the movie, it's hard to believe he's gone. But it's not hard to believe he would have been very proud of this edition.is politely, got him banned from the waist down in the 50's ). Just a complete show-stopper.

At some points when you're watching the movie, it's hard to believe he's gone. But it's not hard to believe he would have been very proud of this edition.
6305807086|3.0|BJM was a very disturbing and depressing fantasy film. I felt utterly depressed after watching this film. The reason I rented it was because someone recommended it as a &quot;good bud smoking movie&quot; (in other words, a movie you watch while under the influence of a mind altering substance). I don't do drugs, but this movie sure made me feel like I did. I felt all the experiences of a druggy: the highs and the lows. I felt highs during the beginning when I thought this was going to be a good and interesting film, and I felt withdrawal after discovering halfway throughout that it wasn't. Towards the end of the film, I was left pondering my own existence and my feelings of depression. I tell you, this movie definitely makes you feel like you're ON DRUGS. They should show this film to people who think they might want to take drugs (it'll make them change their mind real quick). But, if you are a marijuana user, I'll once again echo the sentiments of someone who recommended this film to me and say that it is, indeed, a good &quot;bud smoking movie&quot; and if you're not stay far, far away from it, unless you like films that depress you or make you feel suicidal.
039472903X|5.0|I understand and agree with Ogilvy's philosophy and he definitely was a man with a vision.<br />Please, if you are thinking of getting into Advertising do not take this book as anything more than Theory.  The Practice of the ad biz is a whole 'nother scary animal.
B0000541AM|4.0|The Warriors is a very exciting and action packed film. It's one of the best action movies I've seen. The Warriors is a highly-stylized, campy, dated, yet fun film about the trials and tribulations of a street gang making its way back &quot;home&quot; through rival turfs. Packed with violence, innuendo, and great music, The Warriors is very definitive of the late 70s. Lots of memorable characters --including the memorable female radio station disc jockey-- make this a fun, non-boring film. It makes you wish your nights were even half as exciting as theirs.
0440234743|3.0|Some of Grisham's earlier books were hard to put down.  This one wasn't.  It was still decent, but not his usual quality.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|What else can be said about a group that hasn't recorded together in 30 years? This is a fantastic collection of some of their best chart toppers. I only hope that the CD's title, &quot;The Beatles 1&quot;, means that there will be a second just like it. This is even better than the anthology series of CDs. This CD takes you straight to the hits. I highly recommend this to old and new Beatles fans!!
B000056K04|2.0|I don't have a problem with bands going in a different direction...in fact, I encourage it and think it's the best part about the dynamics of music.  That said, it's only a good thing if you're moving in a direction people have not gone before.  There are numerous complaints I have with this album, but the first is that while this is still Dave Matthews, I'm not so sure about the Band part of it.  Carter's lovely fills and complex rhythms are replaced by what might as well be a drum machine (and not the crazy, trancelike techno kind).  Leroi has a sax solo in I Did It, but aside from this doesn't even appear on the album until, like, song 6 or so.  Lastly on this, Boyd's fiddle is reduced to a crazy-sounding pluck instrument.  My next complaint is how ridiculously over-produced this album is.  Sure, songs like Digging a Ditch or Bartender, which both were going to end up on Lillywhite's album, are extremely repetitive (Digging a Ditch is the same chorus repeated for 3 minutes, Bartender sounds EXACTLY like Don't Drink the Water), but at least they still had the unique DMB sound.  Everyday feels like DMB trying to play someone else's music -- there're still points where it's clearly them, but for the most part it just sounds like all the other stuff you hear on the radio.  My final complaint is that even on this album, the songs sound the same.  There are about 6 songs that use the same chords and similar progressions (check the tabs) -- ugh!  It should be interesting to see if this album falls as flat live as it did in the studio.  Don't get me wrong, though, there were a couple songs that sound good (Everyday comes to mind), but for the most part, this album is quite bad.
6305531374|4.0|Jamie Lee Curtis makes a welcome return to the \\"Halloween\\" series, giving a terrific performance. Laurie Strode is now living under the name Keri Tate, and is the headmistress of a boarding school in Northern California. A functioning alcoholic, she's also the overprotective mother of a teenage son (Josh Hartnett)who wants his independence. Also on hand is suave school security guard LL Cool J and mom Janet Leigh, who turns up as her secretary-\\"Psycho\\" fans might recognize the car she drives. Boyfriend Alan Arkin tries to understand Laurie/Keri, and things are made abundantly clear on Halloween night as brother Michael Myers comes calling once again. Myers isn't especially scary in this installment, and his heavy breathing is missing from the soundtrack. Nonetheless, it will make you forget some of the earlier awful sequels. I do think it was a mistake for Dimension Films to save a buck and to use some of the \\"Scream\\" soundtrack (did they think we wouldn't notice?) and not more of the music from the first two films. Otherwise, far and away the best sequel since \\"Halloween II\\". The DVD cover boasts an audio commentary with Jamie Lee Curtis and director Steve Miner, but it isn't on the DVD itself...
B00004Y6NP|5.0|The album was great to begin with and now with it remastered it's just pure sonic bliss.  I still hate everything about MONEY FOR NOTHING except for that killer intro riff.  Or maybe it's just that everything else here is so blindingly brilliant?  I'd say buy it but you probably already own it.  If you don't, then this version leaves you with no good excuse.
B000051VQR|1.0|While listening to a news bulletin on our local video-station (Muchmusic), I learned that a member of the 70's group &quot;the Kinks&quot; claimed that part of Greenday's title track &quot;Warning&quot; was an exact copy of their song &quot;picture book&quot; off &quot;Village Green Preservation Society&quot;. Intriged, I typed in their name and clicked on the song to hear the sample, and found that the Kink's claim was... true. Although the rest of the song is quite different, the guitar riffs (sp) are exactly the same of both songs. Coincidence, I think not. Do I smell a rip-off. Might be!
0684853523|5.0|Ever since I was 12 years old, I've wanted to BE Stephen King--not him so much as a writer like him, exactly. I have always loved his writing style, and his every-day-people characterizations, but mostly I get lost in the story--which is just what he wants!<br />&quot;On Writing&quot; was like peeping through his windows &amp; seeing the REAL Stephen King, and being almost unable to believe anyone that rich &amp; famous could be so humble, so normal &amp; REAL, unpretentious and intimate. Somewhere after age 12 I gave up my writing dream, but it's always simmered at the back of my mind. I keep bringing it out, polishing it a bit, stuffing it away until a &quot;better&quot; time. Well, there's no better time than NOW, an hour every day writing towards my dream instead of dealing with email or surfing, I have all the tools &amp; now On Writing gave me the motivation &amp; inspiration I needed to follow my dream. Technically the book is an easy, intimate &amp; VERY personal read, King spills the beans on just about every aspect of his life, and includes the horrific story of his near-fatal accident &amp; how this book almost never came to be. I read the 1st part with relish &amp; much belly jiggling laughter that had non-writers lined up to read it after me. I read part 2 with a highlighter &amp; confess I went overboard, so much juicy knowledge for the reader to take &amp; use! It seems he gave up all his secrets but I bet there are a few he kept secret, though I couldn't even guess what they are. The 3rd part I read with a tissue nearby, highlighter long gone, like having a deeply personal discussion with a close friend and mentor.<br />I recommend this book to potential or existing writers definitely AND to non-writers alike! If you're like me, always curious about the man behind the book, you will NOT be disappointed &amp; maybe like me, you'll find a new respect for what some just call another horror author. King is anything but just another...anything.
B000056K04|2.0|Jerry Seinfeld defended his decision to end his sitcom prematurely by theorizing that performers should always leave their audiences wanting more. This is precisely the case with Everyday in that the songs are mostly catchy and listenable (albeit commercial and slick), but just when you are expecting a prolonged Boyd or Leroi solo, the music fades to silence. Then again, Aerosmith and Alanis aren't that big on violins and saxophones, right, Mr. Ballard? Michael Stipe was dead-on when he declared, &quot;damn that radio song,&quot; and unfortunately, we have 12 damn radio songs on our hands here. One can only hope that these songs are given more life and length on tour this summer.
0792842073|5.0|No matter what your feelings about the death penalty might be, viewers will find that this two hour film is a sensitive, thoughtful, and thought provoking look at the highest debated and controversial political issue of today.<br />However, what this film won't do (at least it didn't to me or anyone else I know) is alter one's opinions as to the righteousness of this punishment.  If you were pro death penalty (as I staunchly am) before viewing this movie, you'll probably remain that way.  And vice versa.<br />Under the tender guidance of director Tim Robbins, the cast and crew bring this emotionally charged story to life.  Far from being biased or bigoted, it is refreshing in its neutrality.  Views from each sides of this topic are presented and discussed deeply.  Remittingly unsentimental, it is a truly graphic and gut wrenching illustration of suffering and sickening waste of life, for there are no real winners in this story.  There are only losers.  How horrendously and horrifically sad that stark fact is.<br />Susan Sarandon won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in this film, and no wonder; she breathes vulnerability and compassion into a character who so easily could have been depicted as a pious bible basher.  She literally BECOMES Sister Helen Prejean, and one tends to forget that she is merely an actress playing a role.  That is how realistically convincing she is.  But Sean Penn, (seemingly in his element as a bad boy) as Matthew Poncelet, initially simply reeks of evil and barbarity, and such is his talent as an actor that he manages to imbibe into this seemingly unredeemable specimen an air of humanity and sympathy.  He dominates every scene in which he appears, and he deserves five stars, kudos, plaudits, and then some for this performance.  He too, BECOMES his character, and his performance as the creepy Poncelet is the most chilling and evocative portrayal of a murderer since Anthony Hopkins's magnum opus Hannibal Lecter from &quot;The Silence Of TheLambs.&quot;  In that instance, Hopkins deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar.  In this case, Penn was wrongfully deprived of the Academy Award that rightfully should have been his.
B000056K04|5.0|Yea. So a new studio CD, Davy? This has to be interesting you say. And interesting it is. Different is what this CD, Everyday is. <br />You will hear different things. Good things and Bad things I will admit. To anyone with a decent sense of hearing, this CD is euphonious. <br />If you remember the 80s (at all) you will say, &quot;Hey, Dave is not 80s.&quot; And you would be correct. Dave as we know him is a very un-80s album rock musician. He is a live-jammer as I like to call him. He attracts teenies and college dudes. Not baby boomers. What is this about?<br />Well let me tell you personally that while Dave might have done this intentionally (or not) it does not matter. He still preserves the Essence of Dave. It is still something you can marvel at everyday. <br />Dave and his mighty Band do a superb job making this album. It is stupendously delicious and exciting, just for its unexpectedness. <br />If you hail Dave, buy this CD or you do not respect his legacy. If you don't even know who the heck Dave is, buy this CD. It is something that will make you go out and buy Crash and Under the Table and Dreaming, and Before These Crowded Streets (His other albums). Just keep in mind what I have said. Although this is not the typical Acoustic, Violin, and Sax Dave, it is still breathtaking as Dave should be.
B000006NPY|1.0|In my opinion there is no question that this CD led to the downfall of the Smashing Pumpkins as we knew them.  After three years of waiting I was sure the the Pumpkins would be putting out a great CD and when I bought it I realized how very wrong I was.  When I bought their double CD, Mellon Collie &amp; The Infinite Sadness because of a friend's recommendation I only knew of them because of 1979, and Today which I had heard many times on the radio.  What I found out after hearing that CD was that the Smashing Pumpkins were an awesome band.  They weren't the best artists but their songs had that catchy sound to them that you couldn't resist.  I later bought Siamese Dream, which was another great CD.  It could honestly be said that the Pumpkins were my favorite band of the '90s.  So It seemed that Adore would be another great CD put out by the SPs, but it turned out that the band had abandoned everything that made them popular, Adore had maybe three or four good songs but the rest were nothing like vintage Pumpkins and the change wasn't for the better.  After hearing Machina-Machines of God I realized that the end had to be near because the band had lost its edge.  In my opinion Adore was the beginning of the end for this band.  Don't buy it unless you want to see what success does to some bands, and that is turn them into ego-driven bands with no soul.  If you want to hear them when they still made good music anything from before this CD is classic alternative music.
0767809246|4.0|Yes, &quot;Stand By Me&quot; is a very good movie.  I am only 14, so I can't say that it brings me back memories of my childhood.  But this is still a great movie.  It's about four 12-year-old boys who go on a 30-mile hike in search of a dead body.  The boys cuss, smoke, tell tall tales, and stick together as a team.  Let's just say that things get a little dicey, however, when the knife-wielding hoods of the town begin to follow the boys.  This movie is very funny (I can't stop laughing after the pie-eating contest, even if it was a little ribald), but it's also a touching story about friendship, too.  All in all, this is a wonderful movie.  <br />&quot;Stand By Me&quot;, however, is rated R.  In general terms, it is rated R for plenty of inappropriate, rude, and vulgar behavior.  These include crude language (e.g. &quot;Why don't you go home and .... your mother some more?!&quot;), smoking, offensive humor, and perilous situations, all of which involve 12-year-old kids.  This is why I rated it 4 stars.  I highly recommend it for fathers and no-less-than-14-year-old sons.  I wouldn't want to put any crazy ideas into the minds of any younger kids.
B000056MOD|1.0|I was going to give this movie a 3 star rating, but the more I think about it, the more annoyed with the film I become.<br />First of all, this film could have been a lot better had it just starred Adrian Paul (Duncan MacLeod), or had it been set in the past. Instead, they had to set it in the current era, disregarding (once again) the first movie. Of course, movie fans aren't the only ones facing potential disappointment, as even the series is disregarded in some instances. There are so many plot holes they should have given free Swiss Cheese with the video.<br />The plot is just ridiculous. There are so many ways this film could have gone, and they had to pick THIS way. Methos and Dawson (and the Watchers in general) are introduced haphazardly, with no real explanations given to why they are friends with Duncan. Plus, their on air time is so short there was really no point in having them on in the first place. The rogue watcher was practically a waste of time, although the film was so short that they needed all the time they could muster.<br />In this movie, Connor's mother apparently DIDN'T forsake him, AND Connor has been tortured his whole life by her death. Uh, okay. Connor also killed a guy named Jacob Kell, a member of his clan (he turns out to be the main villian). If you think for a minute, shouldn't it be Jacob MacLeod? Clans all bore the same name. &quot;I am Jacob Kell of the Clan MacLeod.&quot; Yeah, right. Thank you for that little plot inconsistancy, movie.<br />While the continuous flashbacks didn't bother me, there was so much (trying) to go on in this 87 minute movie that they weren't fleshed out enough to help the plot development like they could have.<br />Connor MacLeod was and still is my favorite, but I'm not really disappointed he died. Immortals aren't supposed to show their age the way Christopher Lambert did. Get the guy some makeup and a wig, okay? Damn he looked old. Anyway, the way he died was rather annoying. Connor and Duncan have both beaten the &quot;strongest&quot; or &quot;toughest&quot; immortal time and time again, and I don't think this loser Kell could have been THAT big a deal. The most annoying scene with Connor was the fight in the cemetary. Damn it, he was fighting like he had a hangover and paralysis.<br />Also, this whole thing about an army of immortals who don't follow the rules....I'm sorry, they would have been taken out a long time ago. Every immortal who follows the rules would have tracked them down and taken their heads before they even became powerful, simply because even the lowliest of immortal scum honor the rules.<br />This film was just plain awful. There was SO MUCH POTENTIAL lying in this movie. They could have gone in so many wonderful places, taken the series to new heights, pleased old fans and obtained new fans. Instead, they once again pissed off the movie fans, they annoyed the series fans with the inconsistencies (Duncan married, anyone?), and isolated any potential newcomers by offering a confusing and under-developed plot. Damn you, Panzer-Davis. This film actually managed to become as irritating as the second one was.ve both beaten the &quot;strongest&quot; or &quot;toughest&quot; immortal time and time again, and I don't think this loser Kell could have been THAT big a deal.

B000002H6C|4.0|Dyers Eve, in my opinion the awesomest metal song ever. One is the most musical metal song I have ever heard. The sound quality in the album was that way because they  wanted to do something different. Lars's drumming sucks rocks. He doesn't know what a musical phrase is. His beat consists of the basic standard rock beat. Nothing more, unless he changes it in another one of his misinterpretations of the melody.    He misinterpreted 90% of the melody in the album, he doesn't know how to make music on the drums. He figures the note played on guitar should have the corresponding note played on drums, so he plays exactly with 2nd guitar, as if he was playing guitar. It sucks. You may think it's a cool idea but it destroyed at least half the melody in the album and if he wasn't there the album would have better ratings.<br />He should have stayed a tennis player, he has no musical blood.<br />4 stars for the music, minus a star because of Lars.
0375703764|5.0|It's one of the most unique works of literature I've ever read - it's a challenging, at times difficult read,  and parts of it work better than others,  but it gets under the skin more than any book that I've ever read.  I turned several friends on to it and they experienced the same thing.  Some people (like me) think it's a masterwork,  others think it's an over-the-top piece of self-indulgence writing. Just an amazing novel.
B00003W8NO|5.0|This is a humourous story of a bunch of toys. They weren't anybody's toys but Andy's toys. How these toys loved being Andy's toys. Whenever there were occasions where Andy would certainly receive presents, these toys would send out representatives (the green toy soldiers-whom the other toys regarded as &quot;professinals&quot; for missions of such) with a toy walkie talkie (a wee bit too huge for these mini soldiers), to find out what kind of toys Andy receive.   On Andy's birthday party, a toy spaceman (Buzz) was given to Andy. Since the arrival of Buzz, Woody's (a toy cowboy)position as Andy's favorite toy was threatened. <br />One day, Woody planned to get rid of Buzz. He managed to send Buzz flying out of Andy's bedroom window. When Andy couldn't find Buzz to accompany him in the car-trip, so he picked up Woody instead. In the bushes near the car where Buzz had fallen into frm Andy's window, Buzz spied Woody being taken into the car by Andy. He followed. The two toys ended up fighting at the bottom of the car when the family stopped at a petrol station. They were so emgrossed in squabbling that they did not realised that the car was getting to leave until it was too late. <br />There began their adventure of finding their way back home to Andy. They two rivals had to work together and plan a safe journey back. <br />This is truly a masterpiece! I haven't enjoyed watching a cartoon soooooooo... much in a long time. The animation is really beautiful! And all those lovable toys... and the cute three-eyed aliens! <br />Anyone will certainly enjoy this show!!!
B00005631D|5.0|LOVE ISLAND, TAHITI HUT, ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA were among the hits that are included in this album. I used to have the LP (vynil record) in the late 70's when I was in the Philippines. Eumir Deodato is the total entertainer, the arranger, conductor, composer and the performer. His music reminisced my good old days, he is considered as a classical and modern artist. You will not be completing your collection without this greatest album by him.
B000056H5J|4.0|Well apparently Enya decided to give us Canadians (and a few other countries besides the US) one extra track on our cut of ADWR.  How nice of her.  If any of you in America live near the border I'd recommend taking one afternoon to just drive up here and pick up the 12 track copy if you're that much of a die hard fan, otherwise you're not missing much.  I like the extra track &quot;The First of Autumn&quot; though, it's nice.  Still I can't give this album a perfect score because it should have been a little bit longer.  My question is: Why didn't she put ALL of the new tracks she made onto her album?  She could have added &quot;The Promise&quot;, &quot;Isobella&quot; and &quot;The First of Autumn&quot;  to make a total of 14 tracks.  That would have been more respectable.  I love the album though.
B000056K04|5.0|&quot;Everyday&quot; is not normal DMB, but it's new and refreshing. Overall I think it is the band's most powerful work, but it does not contain their best songs. The entire album is overflowing with emotion and the songs (while they take a couple listens to get used to) make you feel them. If your a DMB fan go get this album, it's worth it.
B000002UAX|5.0|A white cover, double album, the beatles: great pop music in the most important year of the sixties. Almost every style of music is played here and you love it; yes, you love it because it is composed and performed with the feeling of the new born rock music (not rock and roll anymore). For my taste, Lennon steals the show with Glass Onion, Sexy Sadie and Happiness is a Warm Gun. However, when talking about the beatles, the shining of one member often means the shining of the rest: McCartney's tunes are great and his bass playing is superb. His vocals, as always: just amazing. Harrison becomes the great pop composer everyone needed with stuff like Piggies (dark wit) and Savoy Truffle (very rewarding listening, it makes you feel so good). Ringo sings a little and plays great drumming, making the songs go round. However, it is McCartney the one who gives you that drum-beating thrill in Dear Prudence (another Lennon standard). This is my favorite album.
0446677450|3.0|It would be interesting to poll the folks who say this book changed their life to see how many of them are rich in, say, five years. Not that many, I can just about guarantee.<br />But the fundamental truth that the author may have left out of his book is that rich dad's life isn't any better than poor dad's life, and lots of times it's worse. There's no life of leisure for the rich dad. Owning your own business or owning real estate that you rent out is no cakewalk. You work twice as many hours just to get it going. And if you're lucky enough to get rich, you spend half your life with lawyers, bankers, and accountants, making sure you stay rich. You spend the other half of your life worrying about your money, planning how you're going to make more money, and thinking people are taking your money. And those annual vacations to Europe? First you'll have to figure out how to make it a tax write-off.<br />I've been around rich people and I've been around middle class people. The quality of life is better with the middle class, no matter how many houses and cars you own and no matter how many vacations you can take.
B00004YA66|5.0|I didn't expect much of this movie but I was pleasantly suprised.  This movie actually touched me. This is something that rarely happens because I am usually into action movies like Predator and Die Hard.  I wish I saw this one in the theater.  I'm glad to have it on Dvd though.  The extras are great.
0446677450|5.0|Having read so many negative reviews, I felt compelled to offer up my own assessment.  I really did start to *see* money in a different way.  Too many of us work ourselves to death at a job we don't love so we can have money to buy stuff that's just more clutter in our lives. Others work hard to pay for necessities. Either way, it's so very easy to be stuck in the trap of fear that it could all be gone... that whole &quot;one paycheck away&quot; thing.<br />I saw Rich Dad as teaching him to build stability.  In his sequel, Rich Kid, Smart Kid, he says he waited five years after his Smart Dad's book to write Rich Dad. He didn't want to write it while his dad was alive and risk hurting his feelings, yet he knew that despite his Smart Dad's academic wealth, his lack of financial wealth always left him frazzeled.  The author's purpose is to point out that if his Smart Dad had understood the Rich Dad concepts, he'd have understood how to build a wealth that would've allowed him to pursue his Smart dreams without the fear his lack of money skills caused.<br />In his sequel, he is very complementary of his Smart Dad, because it was he who recognized that he didn't have the skills to help his son see his true gifts to fruition, and encouraged him to hook up with Rich Dad.<br />Everything he says is true. The poor will always be poor.  We all know people who see a $10,000 raise as an opportunity for a $20,000 loan, rather than $10,000 to invest on an income-generating property.  Because they lack financial astuteness, they don't know what to do with more money.  The poor and middle class are apt to think, &quot;If I just made $50 more per month, I could get a new tv!&quot;  And that's what they do. And then they think, &quot;Wow, if I just made another $50, I could get sattelite tv!&quot;  and on and on it goes.  They're always hoping for another morsel so they can get another thing, but they never feel confident in their financial stability.<br />This certainly isn't sinfulor bad, but for those who aspire to the freedom to pursue what they love, rather than being tied to a job that doesn't speak to their passions, this book is an eye-opener.  I see that the author has even set up a foundation to promote financial literacy to children. I don't think his motives are altogether self-serving as much as they're borne of a desire to see others prosper in the way he's learned how to do.
B000050IMG|3.0|This movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. The jokes were not really that funny, usually good jokes make your stomach hurt, this didn't. One thing it's definetly not for kids. When I bought it was given a U rating. it needs at least PG 15.
0763611883|5.0|It has great pictures, and the book is about a little girl named Lola who is a very fussy eater. Lola learns about fruits and vegetables. Her sister Charlie tells her that they are different things and from different places. Lola tries everything and ends up liking them all. I would suggest this book for kids under the age of 7.
B000002UVX|5.0|Every rock fan knows that Jimi Hendrix's three studio recordings are absolutely essential.  But I would argue that Band of Gypsys is just as important to own.  This is where you get to hear Jimi cut loose.  If you have any doubt of Hendrix's guitar genius, this album will quickly dispell that for you.  <br />First of all, the Experience do not appear in this album.  Instead, Buddy Miles and Billy Cox fill in for drums and bass respectively.  The two provide Jimi with a much looser, funkier rhythm section than the Experience.  As for Jimi, there isn't much to say...  All you need to know is that Band of Gypsys contains some of the best guitar work of his career...if not THE best of his career.  &quot;Who Knows&quot;, and &quot;Power to Love&quot; are two standout tracks.  But the masterpiece of the album is the 12 minute anti-war jam &quot;Machine Gun&quot;.  It's a song that has to be heard to believed.  I still remember the first time I heard it....I was floored.  The entire album is filled with enough passion and intensity to rival that of John Coltrane's Live at the Village Vanguard or Live at Birdland.  <br />It is true that there have been hundreds of fantastic guitarists since the death of Jimi Hendrix.  Many of them have much more speed and dexterity than Jimi.  Still others are university trained and extremely knowledgeable in music theory.  But I have yet to hear a guitarist play something as passionate and emotional as &quot;Machine Gun&quot;.  Band of Gypsys is well worth your money for that song alone.
0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess' finest work is not only a disturbing look into the future, but also asks intruguing ethical questions. I found Burgess'use Nadsat Language intresting, athough it is difficult to understand. Espically disturbing is the dystopian world Burgess invents. The book's combination of a socialist society and decayed western culture makes it an intresting read
6304057709|5.0|Wow! I am a true lover of Jane Austens work and I think this is a brilliant adaptation! I loved the entire movie. Next to the A&amp;E version of Pride &amp; Prejudice, I think it is my favorite movie adapted from a novel. It follows the book very well, and the artistic license which the director uses only enhances the story. And the ending...brilliant. To see Willouby on the hill at Marianne's wedding---every woman should feel vindicated at that moment. It is DEFINITELY worth buying.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|WOWZERS!  This album was a nice refreshing break from the mainstream on the radio!  Yeah, okay, so it's a little obvious these guys might be influenced by something like Rage Against the Machine (I think they even toured with them?) but it's good stuff for your ears!  The way they suddenly burst into a loud and chaotic mess of lyrics really grabs your attention and gets your foot tapping.  I was hooked from the first song I heard and it only got better.  You can feel the energy it took to produce this album in each song.  It's as if each song were an infant born unto the group one by one...it sounds like they REALLY dedicated themselves to this one. The lead singer has a distinct voice that really reaches to you and stands out from the music.  It's a masterful blend of ...well, everything!  They mix in some obscure sounds that really add to the ambiance and help form the character to each track making each one individual from the next.<br />&quot;One Armed Scissor&quot; is a great example of what to expect from this album and, of course, is currently being aired on radio stations here and there.  If you like that song, you should try the rest of the album...it's fantastic.  One of my favorite tracks is &quot;rolodex propaganda&quot; with Iggy Pop singing along in an erratic 'outta-my-face' kind of way. This song couldn't be more perfect!  Pairing up with Iggy Pop makes this song super-fantastic.  I can't get this one out of my head.  They tone things down a bit in the last track, &quot;non-zero possibility&quot;, in a melodic, almost lullaby fashion.  This album is chock full of a variety of high-energy stuff and shouldn't be passed up!  This band is slowly gaining notoriety around the country and I guarantee by the time they produce their next album they will be a household name.  With reference to previous albums I'd have to say each new album they produce will be twice as good as the last with the rate at which they are going now.
B0000029J5|5.0|Keb Mo (isn't that a much more memorable name than his given one of Kevin Moore?) is a great talent whose music defies categorization.  While he is usually placed with Blues artists, his music draws on many genres, including blues, folk, jazz and pop.  His sound is somewhat reminiscent of Taj Majal, but it is unfair to compare him like that, for his talent is too great to call him a copy of someone else.<br />I try to play his music frequently on my radio show, for he crosses many different lines and has appeal to a vast audience.  It is a shame he has not become more widely known.<br />I strongly recommend this album!
B00004LN16|4.0|I remember an AC/DC interview I read a few years ago.  I don't remember the exact words, but some cynic asked the band how they felt about having released 10 albums that are exactly the same.  And Angus replied, &quot;Actually we've released 12 albums that are exactly the same.&quot;  Well, I have not counted how many albums AC/DC have released as of today, but Stiff Upper Lip is....exactly like their other albums.  However, that is not such a terrible thing, considering there are few hard rock bands out there today; and even fewer who do it as well as AC/DC.  <br />The title track is as good as any hit single in AC/DC's extensive catalog.  And the other radio single, &quot;Safe in New York City&quot; is fantastic as well.  In addition, &quot;House of Jazz&quot; and &quot;Satellite Blues&quot; are two favorites of mine; both of them featuring tasty guitar work by Angus Young.  The entire CD is one great rock song after another.  <br />AC/DC has always been the band that reminded me that,&quot;Hey it's not rocket science, it's Rock n roll!&quot;  And that's often something I forget, especially after listening to a band like Radiohead or Godspeed You Black Emperor.  It's fun, energetic, and completely devoid of artsy pretentions.  I suppose the question to ask yourself is, &quot;Is this album worth buying if I already own a bunch of AC/DC CDs??&quot;  Well that depends on how tight your budget is, and how much you enjoy AC/DC.  But if you got the dough and you dig AC/DC i strongly recommend this Stiff Upper Lip.
B000002Q88|2.0|For me this album marked the second fall from grace for Kansas. Whilst Power marked a reasonably successful reformation of the band with a Kansas-ish rock sound, In The Spirit  Of Things saw Steve Morse take a much more active hand in co-writing with Walsh as well as  external writing influences permeating the album leading to a marked change in sound.<br />For me this album also marked the end of Steve Walsh as a singing force. For some reason his voice sounds broken, harsh and unable to span the incredible range he had once mastered - very unlike the golden voice we got used to listening to Song For America and Leftoverture. I have no idea if anything happened to Walsh but subsequent albums, such as Live At The Whisky, were to confirm he couldn't hit the notes he used to with that live album producing an embarrassing performance where Walsh tries to hit the notes in classic tunes and fails dismally. Can anyone tell me why???<br />The last thing anyone buying this album should expect is a classic sounding Kansas album - it is not that, especially with Livgren and Steinhardt still sadly missing following the band's original split and with Walsh's voice having deteriorated. <br />However, it is not without merit and Morse's influence is mainly positive (whereas the Elefante brothers influence was disastrous on Vinyl Confessions and Drastic Measures). Among the weaker tracks are some good songs worthy of the Kansas name such as Ghosts, Rainmaker, The Preacher and The Bells Of St James. Even one externally written track One Big Sky gives the band something worthy of their reputation to play. Unfortunately there are too many average and below average pop songs padding out the remainder of the album.<br />Overall its a reasonable effort but certainly not as good as Audio Visions - the last album made with the band's original line up and their poorest of that era. Unfortunately the site doesn't let me award 2 1/2* so a 2* it has to be. However, its certainly not just forcompletists.<br />Mild recommendation to buy.

B00003CXE6|5.0|Russel Crowe plays the main character, Maximus, a comander in the Emporors (I think that is how you spell it) army. The Emporor is growing old and does not have much time left, he decides to have Maximus take his place instead of his own son. He does not believe his son would make a good Emporor. Before he can make his announcement he mysteriously dies. Now the son is trying everything so that Maximus will not take his rightful place.Don't worry this all happens in the first 15 minutes so I am not ruining anything!<br />This movie is full of suspense, action, gore (uggg, they could have left that out) but I loved it, I really did! The actors did an amazing job! It is must see!
B000002Q7Y|3.0|Two years after Kansas had died an ugly protracted death, key songwriter Steve Walsh reformed the band with original members Rich Williams and Phil Ehart. Still missing was the bands other songwriter Kerry Livgren (who is replaced on guitars by Steve Morse) and the trademark Kansas violins provided by Robbie Steinhardt.<br />Like Vinyl Confessions and Drastic Measures this album is not classic Kansas in sound. However, unlike these two albums (which are simply terrible), it is closer to the original sound and is a decent collection of pretty good rock songs albeit without Steinhardt's trademark violin. <br />Anyone expecting a classic like Leftoverture or Point Of Know Return will undoubtedly be disappointed but anyone willing to give the new sound a chance will be rewarded, especially those familiar with Walsh's excellent solo album Schemer Dreamer and his other band Streets (formed when he originally left Kansas following the Audio Visions album). <br />It's certainly not Kansas best album, not by a long way, but its decent and certainly a lot better than their worst (both mentioned above). Most Kansas fans should find something they like on this album and at this price, less than a measly 6 dollars, you really cant go wrong even if there's only a couple of tracks that grab you. It's certainly for more than diehard Kansas completists.<br />Recommendation to buy.

B000006TZ8|4.0|After two albums of motown-flavored punk, this is where Paul Weller starts to branch out a bit. Moving from Pete Townshend influenced songwriting, Weller finds influence in Ray Davies' storytelling. 'English Rose', 'Billy Hunt', and 'Down in the Tube Station at Midnight' show more of a cerebral tilt, as opposed to the petal to the metal songs from 'In the City' and 'This is the Modern World.' From 'All Mod Cons' on, the Jam begin to show the variety in song style that was equaled only by their contemporaries, the Clash.
B00000J6AG|4.0|If you think about it, Play is a rather strange album.  I mean, what is it?  I can't really call it techno or trip hop.  It's not really dance or club music either.  Sure I've heard &quot;South Side&quot; played on rock stations, but it's not really rock music.  I suppose you can call it &quot;Electronica&quot;, but the album seems to have more accoustic instrumentation than anything else.  <br />I think that if I had to label Play, the word that most accurately describes it is Pop.  It's really just catchy, infectious pop music - only it's in the guise of electronic music.  No, it doesn't have the standard, verse-chorus-verse type structure of a regular pop song... but then again it does have quite a bit of vocals.  All of the songs contained in this album is accessible to practically anyone...not just fans of electronic music.  That's not to say that this is a bad album.  Infact, it's quite good.  And as long as you're not a Electronica snob, Play has enough depth to hold up to repeated listens.  You've probably already heard the catchiest singles here: &quot;Porcelain&quot;,&quot;Bodyrock&quot;,&quot;Natural Blues&quot;, &quot;south side&quot;.  But there are plenty of other interesting tracks as well.  &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Why does my heart...&quot; are both excellent tracks.  &quot;Everloving&quot; and &quot;Guitar flue &amp; string&quot; are two accoustic instrumentals which work very well. Perhaps the best compliment I can give this album is that it manages to be personal and introspective as well as accessible (which is not an easy feat).  Songs like &quot;Rushing&quot; and &quot;The sky is broken&quot; are both beautiful and emotional.  <br />If you were to call this album Electronica, than this may possibly the most accessible electronica album ever made.  And if my prediction is correct, the future of pop music will be seeing a lot of albums like Play.
B000050XEI|1.0|This CD is not worth the price. It is only 35 minutes long, half the time of regular CD's and at the full CD price. Just thought buyers should beware.
B00000JMQC|5.0|This movie was a movie that I so much enjoyed watching as a child and still do. Faruiza Balk did an amazing job as Dorothy Gale in her first movie ever. This movie had everything:great villains, beautiful scenery, great acting, laughter, chills, suspense, tears. At first when I saw that this movie was a continuation of The Wizard of Oz, I thought &quot;Oh great a sequel, it probably won't be good at all&quot; I thought that with many sequels they can't really live up to the first movie, but I was proved wrong. Return to Oz is amazing in every way. The villains such as the evil Princess Mombie was played to perfection by Jean Smart. Her acting was amazing, and even to this day she still gives me chills when I see her in this movie. The wheelers probably scared me the most and still do, just hearing their wheels squeak and their evil laughter frightens me, and the Gnome King is another great villain. It was nice to see some of the old Wizard of Oz characters return such as Scarecrow, the Tin Man and The Cowardly Lion and see new ones like Tik Tok, the Gump, Jack Pumpkinhead and Dorothy's companion in this movie Billina instead of Toto. If you loved Wizard of Oz then you will absolutely love this movie. Don't spend your money on some cheap, bloody slasher flick. Spend it on something worthwhile. Return to Oz is what great movie sequels are all about.
0451167716|5.0|The Godfather is a true classic and the first mafia novel of it's kind.  This is the book which spawned the muti-Academy Award winning movie of the same name and it's equaly as popular sequels.  This is the stoy of Don Vito Coleone the aging head of one of New York's five mafia familes.  The book also describes the lifes of the Don's offspring in an equally amazing fashion.  The Godfather has an array of unforgettable characters such as the Don's eldest son the hot-head Sonny Coleone, the singer/actor Johnny Fontane, and the infamous Luca Brazi.  The books also takes the reader to the depths of New York's underworld and to the beautiful Sicilian countryside.  The novel although extremely violent at times (it should be expected in a Mafia novel) is a must read for any Mafia fan, especially if you loved the movie.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Godspeed You Black Emperor! is one of the most interesting bands that I have heard in a while.  Their music defies classification.  I suppose you can call it post-rock, but it has little in common with other post rock bands like Stereolab, Tortoise, or Gastr del sol.  It's not quite instrumental rock music, but when they pick up the pace, it is exciting in a way that those other post rock bands seldomly get.  <br />If you haven't heard Godspeed You Black Emperor, let me describe it to you.  The band is made up of roughly ten musicians who play the standard rock instruments (guitar, bass, drums) as well as strings and horns.  Each song starts out slowly, usually with just a single violin with a subtle guitar accompanying it.  With each passing minute, more instruments come into the song.  In the meantime, the tempo and volume of the song is increased, building the intensity to an almost unbearable height.  Then, finally, the music reaches it's peak and comes crashing back down.  Each song is approximately 20 minutes, so you will only get 2 songs on each CD.  The most impressive thing about Godspeed's music is that it can be quite emotional and spiritual....in a way that a classical symphony can be.  <br />I have heard some criticism that the GYBE! always follows the same formula and does nothing new.  While there is some truth to that, let's not forget that most rock songs follow the same verse-chorus-verse type formula.  Also, I've heard people say that all of their albums sound the same.  They have a point too, but it's not so bad considering there are few other &quot;experimental&quot; rock bands who are as consistently interesting to listen to.  If you're bored with the current state of indie rock, or want to hear something different, i strongly recommend this album.  (You may want to consider purchasing one of their less expensive albums if you have never heard them before.)
B000053V8J|4.0|&quot;Blue Thunder&quot; is an experimental helicopter designed to be prevent or otherwise deal with any terrorist situation.  With its armor plating and rotary cannon, Blue Thunder (a converted Gazelle Helicopter) is no mere observer helicopter.  Also equipped with an array of sensors and a computer that can hack into anyting, and an engine silencer and its pilot can sneak the chopper's awesome firepower right up to the enemy before being spotted.<br />Roy Scheider is Murphy, a police pilot and shell-shocked Viet Nam vet, is given the task of field-testing the new chopper in hopes of getting it in service for the LA Olympics (this movie is circa 1982).  Never one to go by the book, and with the help of fellow flyer Lymangood (Dan Stern), Murphy takes the super-chopper on an unauthorized jaunt and discovers the dark secret of Blue Thunder's purpose, uncovering proof of a massive conspiracy to turn LA into a police state governed by a fleet of gunships.  When the conspirators - who include a sinister pilot (Malcom McDowell) who was also Murphy's Commander in Vietnam - realize they face exposure, they kill Lyman and set their sites on Murphy.  Driven to desperation, Murphy hijacks the machine, stalling for time until his girlfriend (Candy Clarke) can find the proof that Lyman left behind revealing the truth about Blue Thunder.  The police and the military pull out every stop to bring Murphy down - missiles, fighters and other choppers.  Murphy's solutions are pretty inventive, but you know that these are only previews for the big one - the major dogfight between Scheider and Macdowell over the streets of LA.<br />Blue Thunder is actually pretty smart, obscured though by how much fun it is.  The first half, before we see the super-copter show its moves, is wonderfully paranoid, with an eerie electronic score and wonderfully spastic camera movements (now ruined in countless episodes of NYPD Blue).  Schieder and Stern develope this great dialog (mostly ad-libbed) that keeps things flowing, Macdowell is great as the evil Colonel and Warren Oates - though underused - is also excellent as Scheider's boss.  The flight-scenes are incredibly choreographed and have yet to be surpassed (after nearly 20 years!?!?).<br />All in all, a great flick.
B000050XEI|4.0|Like most Enya fans, I waited (im)patiently for the new release. Naturally, I preordered it from (...) as soon as the button was on the screen.  I believe that most Enya fans are equally avid.  With such devotion, one hopes for better....<br />Don't get me wrong, the CD is quite good.  It is certainly not as magnificent as the previous two releases, but every cut is still pleasant and several are very good.  The problem is that, in a patently obvious attempt to squeeze bucks from fans, there are a number of versions of the CD; all of the other versions have more cuts than the US version (you've seen the other complaints about it being short, right?).  Several of the cuts from the other versions are CLEARLY among the best on the CD. (I see ... just started carrying one of the other versions).<br />Come on people, cut us a break. I wish I could recommend that you just wait until a full version was available, but they might do like they did for &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; and &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot; and release a composite CD with just a few new cuts.
B00003652Q|5.0|This album truly changed my life. I happend to see Marillion at the legendary Marquee in London by &quot;accident&quot;, and was totally blown away. I immidiadetly bought their current release Script... WOW what an experience. I was a Marillion fanatic from that day. I think Script is their absolutely best album. Songs like Chelsea Monday and Forgotten Sons are as close to religious experiences as you can have in music. The extra disc on this re-release is just that, extra, don't pay too much attention to it. It is disc no. one that is important.  I am still a die hard Marillion/Fish fan and engulf everything they produce, but Script is still my first and forever love. Dilly Dilly 4 ever
B00004TL21|4.0|Sleek, seductive, and Stylish.  Those are three words that you would never think of using when describing the new brand of heavy rock that's popular today.  Limp Bizkit...sleek??? nah.  Korn....seductive??  no way.  Linkin Park...stylish??  sure.  But those are three words that accurately describe the music in the Deftones' White Pony.<br />Don't get me wrong; it's still heavy music.  You're not going to pop this cd in your stereo and mistake it for Depeche Mode or New Order.  You may, however, find some similarities, since the band revealed that Depeche Mode was a big influence while making this album.  The fake, testosterone anger has be replaced by moody crooning.  And for most of the album, Chino sings rather than growls.  White Pony also has one thing that albums by other Heavy bands seem to lack.....melody.  The radio single &quot;Change&quot; is sublime.  But &quot;RX Queen,&quot; &quot;Knife Party,&quot; and &quot;Passenger&quot; are just as enjoyable.  <br />While this new brand of aggressive rock music is still relatively young, it's already been done to DEATH.  Taproot, Papa Roach, UPO, Linkin Park, Staid.......it's no different from the bland hair metal of the 80's.  Only back then, they were called Poison, Ratt, Cinderella, Trixter, etc. But even in the midst of the crappy 80's metal, there were a few bands that managed to retain some level of integrity.  And in today's world of dull aggro rock, the Deftones prove that there is still some talent to be found.
B000005H4I|4.0|I have no disagreement with the other writers about mr. Gordons awesome tenor power, but I would like to mention that Bud Powell is not really at his best anymore on this record. His very reason of moving to paris were his mental problems and problems with narcotics. From mid-fifties onwards he was never quite the same as in 49-50, wich I consider his best years. Untill his death in -66 his playing was at times just plain terrible. On special occasions, like this recording for example, he seemed to cheer up a bit and could at times give us short glimpses of the genius he once was, but other times... The reason Im making such an issue out of this is that had he been at his best, this record would truely stand out as a landmark. However on this record he was unable to play like he once did. Hence only four stars from me.
B00004TRD8|5.0|a great movie that opened the doors for Jurassic Park.  Not as good as the original very close though.  Basically the same idea as the original only instead of kill the mother its kill the kid himself.  Great special effects and the best special edition to ever be made.  Actors played their parts well the only flaw is; the original is based in 1984, they had sex in '84 which meant the kid was probably born in '85.  they have the kid as a thirteen year old in T2  making it the year 1998 yet they say the earth blows up in the year 1997.  Understand? there is more information in T2 that backs it up but other then that a must get.
0345347951|4.0|Childhood's End, a great science fiction work, asks some interesting questions of the reader. Does the human race really play a role? The answer is, they didn't live in vain, but in the scheme of things, meaning in the Universe and whatnot, we didn't play that much of a role. The Overlords had to intervene to keep them from blowing themselves up with neuclear weapons. This evolved the humans, making them into a possible source of a higher civilization. The Overlords, even though they are much smarter and advanced than the humans, envy them because the humans could evolve to the next level of life, which the Overlords could not.      Another question is are all possible alien civilizations evil like the stereotype determines? The Overlord civilization says this is wrong, but there is no way to find out.
6305364613|5.0|Though often overlooked, I would have to say this is one of my all time favorite movies.  The use of a modern setting with this classic tale make's not only a visual masterpiece, but a mix of poetic splendor that is often missing from the stage version.  I hope that anyone who comes across this movie will see it for what it is, not a travisty to the author, but instead a version that has opened the minds of many young people to this timeless tale of love, tragedy and chaos.  A true reflection of our fantastic, wild world.
0767817710|2.0|I've seen this movie twice and I only watched it a second time because I wanted to be extra fair in forming an opinion about it.  The story is pretty simple: Bloodsport with revolvers.  The actors are mostly there to pick up their paychecks (except for Russell, he does a decent job but that is far from enough to save the movie), and the screenwriter is 4.  In a previous review someone mentioned that Hackman gave a good performance...that is not true as far as I can tell.  He is in his default &quot;yelling old dude&quot; mode and it isn't all that interesting.  He didn't want to do Westerns anymore...even to the point that when Eastwood approached him with Unforgiven he refused...multiple times.  His lack of enthusiasm shows.  If you're feeling the need for some good Western action then check out Unforgiven, High Noon, Stagecoach, The Searchers, The Wild Bunch, Shane, High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, or any number of other quality Westerns.  Put this one low on your list.
B00004Z459|5.0|After i heard the single, &quot;one step closer&quot; on MTV, I was interested in this new rock band, especially after all the throw away, stupidly noisey new bands (Deadlights a great example) I was surfing through the cd pile in ONCUE when I found this cd directly behind the Limp Bizkit title. Since I'm not a big fan of the latter, I picked it up and bought it. After that, my ears were glued to the headphones. Some of the songs, In the End a great example, were something that sounded very inspired. If your looking for something to make your head bob, this cd is for you. If you're just looking to pump something loud and bass driven out of you're speakers, steer clear of this album
B000007NYS|4.0|Wow.  A great, influential recording.  A four and a half plus scoring, but such is not tallied here.  This is all-American in content and character, as her other efforts, including the great new &quot;Car wheels on a gravel road&quot;.  My 2 year old loves all of Lucinda's music and so do I.  &quot;Side of the road&quot; is worth the price of admission alone.  Leaves me speechless.  Nice that the new disc repeats it twice - never tire of it.  All those snobby critics aren't wrong in this case, she is truly great.  I wish her much success in the future.
0679879269|4.0|I enjoyed the Amber Spyglass, though I believe that Mr. Pullman  could have explained some things better. Like the bomb for instance. The only reason for that to even be in the book at all is to blow a hole in the Land of the Dead. Other than that I feel the story was rather good.            If you have problems with material which appears to be anti-religious you probably shouldn't read this book since all you'll do is remember the parts you don't like and miss the rest of the story which would be wrong. I have read a review farther down which explains it all much better than I can, but to save you from looking for it heres the basic point: The almighty in the book isn't really god; the DUST itself is. Think about it. It's everywhere, in everything, attracted to people even. In fact Lord Asriel is trying to save the DUST, and destroy the false-almighty and/or Metatron(which ever is really behind the evil). Talk about an inverted version of Paradise Lost.             Now there are plenty of things I don't agree with in this book (being Catholic and all), but none of these seem to be important enough to keep someone from fully enjoying this book, so long as they don't spend their time focusing on the controversial things.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This movie was so thrilling, animated, and full of adventure. If you want to see Dinosaurs, you got them! This movie is worth every penny in your pocket. Great story, great adventure, great everything!
B000001FXX|5.0|Natty Dread was an extremely important album for Bob Marley.  Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer had left the band and Mr. Marley was out on his own.  He delivered an album that painted a vivid portrait of live in the shanties in the ghettoes of Jamaica.  Many of the songs like &quot;Them Belly Full (But We Hungary)&quot;, &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;Rebel Music&quot; and &quot;Bend Down Low&quot; were a call to arms, songs that didn't asked for change, but demanded it.  &quot;Talkin' Blues&quot; takes its cue from Bob Dylan's early 60's songs.  Not everything on Natty Dread is angry, &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot; is a bouncy number about having a good time and the original studio version of &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; is a reaffirmation that as the line goes, &quot;everything's gonna be alright&quot;.
B00003CXFG|1.0|The trailer alone was a hell of a lot more entertaining than this contrived piece of drivel.  Not only was it devoid of suspense or any actual shocks (save for one right at the end), but it was so utterly, mind-numbingly BORING!  For the love of God, had the makers even heard of pacing?  Nothing happens for about an hour - just a bunch of close ups in the extremely annoying 'bleached' look.  <br />It is such a shame as some of the scenes have great potential (such as when Radha is trapped in the underground cavern), but alas, due to a horrendous and non existant score, the suspense is lost.  The only two redeeming features about this terrible waste of celluloid are A), Claudia Black and B), the fact that the downright repugnant actors get either chopped in two or beheaded in a rather gruesome fashion.  <br />I would not recommend this title to absolutely anyone, unless you happened to like the abhorrent 'Urban Legend' or the worst film I've ever seen, 'Star Wars: Episode One'.  In closing, I would just like to add that Star Wars: Episode One was *a lot* scarier than both Urban Legend and Pitch Black combined...

B000056K04|5.0|Dave Matthews has managed to produce an album that still contains the same poetry and sensuality of &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Under the Table&quot; albeit with a harder, more masculine edge.  The sound is a progression towards heavier rock and the final result is fantastic.<br />DM is great in live performances; this music will further enhance their concerts.  Play it loud!
B0000524E5|2.0|The usual Girl Goes To The Big City cliches, not as bad as what you'd expect from Mr. Bruckheimer, thanks to the lovely and charismatic Ms. Perabo and a nice performance from Mr. Goodman as &quot;Dad&quot;...still, a gal who aspires to write songs and has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY. That whole Whitney/Mariah thing, yecch.<br />The bar scenes have a certain energy to 'em, but the other coyotes apparently have no hopes and dreams (or personalities).<br />Here's hoping the adorable Piper will get a great or even better movie in the near future. I will definitely be following her career.
0790736926|5.0|In the movie, Ethan's (John Wayne) brother's cabin is attacked by Scar and his war party, and his family is slaughtered. Ethan is an Indian hater and he gets consumed with revenge after that happens. The daughter, Debbie is still alive. Ethan sets off to rescue Debbie but as the story goes on, his motives change. He wants to kill her because she has been 'ruined' by Scar. In his mind, she has ceased to be white. Ethan is joined in his search by Martin who is there to protect Debbie from Ethan.<br />My favorite scene is when Ethan and Martin are talking. In the distance there is a dot. Slowly, it takes human form and you can see it is Debbie. Ethan tries to kill her but is prevented by Martin. The Comanche indians come and Martin and Ethan have to run away. Martin still wants to rescue Debbie and Ethan wants to take her away from the Native Americans just to kill her. Will Ethan kill Debbie? Can Ethan overcome his racism?<br />Some people might say that the movie is bad because 'fight scenes' seem unreal or because it sterotypes Native Americans.  True, the fight scences are a little off but many westerns were like that back in the day.  About the movie being racist, just because Edwards is a racist, doesn't mean that the movie was meant to be racist against Native Americans.  If you use that logic, Schindler's List would be anti-jewish, Amistad is anti-black, etc.  I have read that the director in the past had used actual Native Americans in his other movies but he cast a white as Scar because he wanted to make the statement that Ethan and Scar underneath it all are the same and despite our difference, we are all humans.<br />The movie has great acting. The impression on Ethan's face when he thinks that Martha's cabin might have been attacked. It has comedy. Moes (think Dana Carvey doing his George Bush impersonation), the lovable idiot who just wants a rocking chair. Breathtaking cinematography. The final scene. The scenery. It has contradictions. Even though Ethanhates the Comanche, he knows a lot about them. He knows about their religion (by shooting out that Native American's eyes, he would roam forever in the afterlife), he can speak their language and he commits a scalping later in the movie. Laurie tells Martin that Martha would have wanted Ethan to kill Debbie for being involved with an Indian but Laurie wants to marry Martin and he is one-eighth Cherokee which I think makes him an Indian. Ethan thinks it is funny when Martin 'marries' Look but he is angry about Debbie and Scar. The story is complex. It deals with obsession, alienation, racism, hatred and forgiveness.<br />Some people might not like this movie at first but they need to look deeper into it. Things in this movie are not spelled out. I notice new things every time I watch it. It is a western and from the 50s which might turn some people off, but you should give this movie a chance. The Searchers is thought-provoking, raises questions and is very well-done.
B000056K04|3.0|I hope this isn't the realm in which DMB is travelling into because I'm going to see them this summer for the first time and I better not hear any of this type junk on stage.  I believe &quot;Angel&quot; was the best song on the album; in my opinion (which I stress), the rest of the tracks were attempts to slide DMB into mainstream as best they could, while still keeping the music somewhat traditional Dave Matthews Band style.  And trying to put tradition into mainstream has never worked and there has never been a better illustration of this trend than &quot;Everyday.&quot;  Don't get me wrong, I like it but just not near as much as ANY other DMB song prior to this.  I even like the &quot;drunk Dave&quot; song that floated around on Napster more than this album.  I hope the live versions of these songs make me like them more or else I may have to sell &quot;Everyday&quot; on Ebay.  Sorry dave, but I liked hearing Boyd, Leroi, Stefan and Carter just as much as I liked hearing you.
6304602944|3.0|Still one of my favorite bad movies, despite awful Harold Faltermeyer score and an ending that doesn't make sense to me after half a dozen viewings. Couple of good in-jokes from the two stars about past film roles, with a real star turn from Mr. Russell. Michael J. Pollard and Jack Palance ham it up nicely. They could've called this &quot;Over the Top&quot; if the title hadn't already been used for one of Mr. Stallone's truly bad movies.
B000056K04|2.0|This will no doubt be a readcord breaker in sales, but not because of its musical content.  This will probably be their last original release before they breakup.  I own every release from DMB, as well as many concert recordings, and this is by far the least creative.  It has been over produced and over hyped.  I have listened to it a dozen times and it still has not grown on me.  As other reviews have mentioned, it does not have much Violin or Sax and it was this that made DMB different and special.  If you like Top 40 style, buy it.  If you want true DMB, try Red Rocks, Live at Luther College, Under the Table..., or even Crash.
B000056K04|4.0|Dave Matthews Band's fourth studio album, with its beefy new sound, is very good. Is it disappointing? I suppose it is, a little. But &quot;disappointing&quot; may be a misleading word, because disappointing for DMB is better than what most bands can manage anyway today. <br />The bad first: For some reason (actually, it's because of some kind of dispute), DMB ditched their original producer, Steve Lillywhite. This is a producer that not only developed DMB's signature sound but also worked with other great bands like Phish and early U2. In place of him, DMB chose Glen Ballard, who worked on...well, No Doubt and Alanis Morisette. He has coated Everyday with technological drapery, more electronics, and overall a slightly more industrial sound. It's a lot thicker. This can be annoying. I found, a few times, that the songs on Everyday were a little too loud, so that any subtle musicianship and melody making was drowned out. This is indeed a tough transition to make, listening to a &quot;new&quot; DMB.<br />The good: Despite all that I just said about the producer, don't ignore the obvious: the producer can only do so much- it's the band itself that ultimately determines the quality of the album. So don't worry about Ballard too much- this is DMB, after all. And they shine through all the needless noise much more often than not. DMB are still skilled, and they provide many good songs here. 'I Did It' is a catchy song with a singalong chorus. 'So Right', 'Mother Father', 'Sleep to Dream Her', and 'Angel' are all very sweet, nicely instrumentalized pieces. These are the tracks where DMB's original style most asserts itself. It's very impressive to hear the combination of acoustics, interesting percussion, violin, and horns that appear in this album. <br />DMB is still one of the most unique, memorable acts in music today. And even though the new sound on this album sometimes seems to focus too much on sound and not music, DMB still saves the day. Let's hope next time they'll return with Lillywhite or someone who can at least return their original style to them. In other words, follow the example of U2, guys!
B000056K04|4.0|Ok, look, everybody has there opinon and some say its there best cd ever and others say its the worst, theres no happy median. well to tell you the truth, the cd is above average, but its no remeber two things or under the table. its a new sound you have to get used to. i cant describe it but once i got used to it i really enjoyed it. theres no solos like old albums more of meshing the instaments together and dave puts his heart and soul singing into it.but once again, its all about the lyrics, the metahpors and what dave speaks of, its great, definatly worth picking up a-sap.
B000008DA5|4.0|The Beach Boys found themselves at a crossroads musically in 1966 and Brain Wilson was the one leading the way. The release of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; baffled Capitol records selling only 35,000 records and leaving the public confused. It was not until years later that &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; would reach masterpiece status. Brian set out to record the follow up to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; a teenage symphony to God as he would call it. The album was originally called &quot;Dumb Angel&quot; but then later &quot;Smile&quot;. If &quot;Good vibrations&quot; was a taste of &quot;Smile&quot; well then we were going to be in for a treat but unfortunately &quot;Smile&quot; was never finished. The Beach Boys instead hastily released &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; to take the place of &quot;Smile&quot; and there are few tracks like &quot;Hereos and Villains&quot;, &quot;Vegetables&quot;, and &quot;Wonderful&quot; that were probably intended for &quot;Smile&quot;. &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; is a trippy little record that does not sound like a Beach Boys album but I think the experiment worked. &quot;Wild Honey&quot; was a getting back to roots album that features more a r&amp;B style to it. If you are looking for a Beach Boys album that is out of the ordinary then &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; is your pick, just listen to the boys and Paul McCartney munching on vegetables as the percussion on &quot;Vegetables&quot;. &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; may not be &quot;Smile&quot; but it will not disappoint if your into trippy music.
078322608X|4.0|sometimes genius goes unnoticed. sometimes filmaking seems to fall into a trap of visual cliches and odd knots and twists. not this one.<br />I have never liked Bruce Willis greatly, and am not know to be an ardent admirer of Brad Pitt but this film made me turn my head. If not for anything else, this film should be seen for the performances of these two actors alone. I just wonder why this sort of performance and its caliber was not seen after this movie by these stuck-in-hollywood-character actors.<br /> Pitt deserved the Oscar for this in the yearly race the film was in ,more then any other actor and I never though Willis had acting chops like this one.<br />Terry Gilliam, the odd animator from &quot;Monty Python&quot; is clearly one of the most ingenious and clever directors I have come across in my film watching years. Choosing very odd films for his pallete, a sort of genius lurks behind his films, especially this one.<br />Without giving the story away, if you like intelligent, dazzling sci-fi sans flashy stuff, you will love this, an original film inspired from &quot;La Jetee&quot; which is great in its own right and also a must see, this movie is not for the popcorn-munching-soda-drinking moviegoer.<br />Some movies require an audience to see them as a work of art and this one is on the list. It comes close to taking itself seriously but stays behind the line and delivers a very promising way of sci-fi ideas,action,processes cleverly.<br />A must see. highly recommended.
B000056K04|2.0|This album was written half by Dave, and half by Glenn Ballard: THE PRODUCER!  This is why the rest of the band sounds like they are just studio musicians.  Usually the band writes their own part, but on this one the part was written for them.  Overall this album is O.K., but I was very disappointed by the fact that Dave finally sold out...
0790744295|5.0|This Movie has several different shows in one tape! Some scenes are really Creepy! For instance! Imagine beinging a neat freak and having white everything so you can see a spot or speck of dirt! Then you get Roaches!!!! Ewwwww!!! Stephen King's got some imagination! If you like this you might also like! Creepshow 2 and The Twilight Zone Movie! Both are very good! Scary!!
B00003003R|5.0|Some of the songs on the CD's have more energy than the original studio versions. &quot;Pretty Tied Up&quot; is amazing, so is &quot;Out Ta Get Me&quot;, &quot;Dust n' Bones&quot;, &quot;Nightrain&quot;  and &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;. Axl's voice sound's almost robotic on Rocket Queen (a good thing). Don't Cry is mesmerising. PLUS you get the track &quot;ITS'S ALRIGHT&quot;, a cover, which you don't get on the standard 5 albums (I love it - more emphasis on the vocals and piano). My favourite GNR song, estranged, is sung a little harshly, but you'll appreciate owning two versions of the same song. At first I was a bit put off buying it, because of the distracting cheers at the beginning of each track, but it helps you to relive the experience.<br />Unfortunately, they took most of the songs from appetite and only 8 songs from BOTH use your illusion CD's (30 songs)!!  Some really good tracks aren't on here: &quot;Civil War&quot;, &quot;One in a Million&quot;, &quot;Coma&quot;, &quot;14 Years&quot;, &quot;Double Talking Jive&quot;, &quot;The Garden&quot;. What you do get is a superfluous piano intro on November Rain; Axl sounding drunk while whistling the tune of patience; and also Sweet Child o' Mine isn't sung as well as normal.  I'd reccommend Live Era to anyone who owns GNR's other albums (lies, appetite, illusion I &amp; II) and wants more. If you just want to buy this as a compilation CD of GNR's best tracks, get one of your nerdiest computer friends to burn you a new customised CD and you can have any tracks you want.
6303402348|5.0|What can I say about this movie?  Nothing bad that is for sure.  Tom Hanks really out did himself in this film.  He was definitely perfect for this part.  He really caught your attention throughout the whole movie.     It starts out as him just being a young boy living with his mom who is played by Sally Fields.  He has a learning disability and is fitted for braces on his legs.  Because of all of these things he has wrong with him he is treated differently by everyone except on little girl.  Which in the movie becomes his best friend and at some point more than that.  Her name is Jenny and she goes through a lot of different things with Forrest.  After school he goes into the army, to try and show people that he really isn't stupid, as he says in the movie, &quot;Stupid is as stupid does.&quot;     He ends up falling in love with Jenny but she doesn't really feel the same way about him.  Although, she loves him as a friend, she doesn't feel that it could ever be more than that.  They end up gettin together one night and she ends up getting pregneant and names the baby after the daddy &quot;Forrest.&quot;     Towards the end of the movie some pretty sad things happen to him in his life.  Things happen to people that are really close to him, but he doesn't let that get him down.  He looks at it just like the famoust quote from the movie, &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.&quot;  I believe this because you never know what is going to be in the center of the chocolate, just like you don't know what the next day is going to bring you.   I reccommend this movie to people who like films that get way down deep inside your heart and make you look at life in a whole different perspective.  If you haven't seen this movie I reccommend you go and rent it.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|That anyone at all found this movie funny is sad.  That America rushed to the theaters in drooling droves is enough to make you want to call it quits.  Sure, it's raunchy.  Sure, it's over the top.  But the jokes are also unfunny, completely unfunny.  They run the full gamut from totally uninspired gags to rip-offs of preexisting totally uninspired gags.  That's the true sign of a comedy utterly devoid of worth: it can't even pick good jokes to steal.  This wretched, tired, hideous waste of celluloid could only be worth renting as a sociological study, or as proof that it's about time for God to end this misguided experiment we call humanity.
B000056K04|5.0|Dave Matthews truly knows how to make good music.  Once again he has come out with a fantastic example of him and his bands great musical talent. Songs range from funky to mellow. A very comparible CD to &quot;Crash&quot; Any Dave Matthews fan must buy this album!
0345440757|5.0|Being first time parents, my husband and I were overwhelmed with the arrival of our baby girl.  We found Tracy Hoggs' book extremely helpful in alleviating a lot of our concerns.  We applied her teachings along with our pediatrician's and lactation consultant's advice and we've come up with an excellent way of understanding and fulfilling our baby's needs.  There are a few mistakes in the information in her book, especially on feeding, but all in all, it was a great book for new parents who needs something simple and basic to help them out.  The acronyms EASY and SLOW were extremely helpful to us, as well as the tables on the different baby cries. I wish we got this book before our Moira was born and avoided teaching her a few bad habits but she's learned new habits in 3 days and at 2 months old, she's a perfectly happy &quot;Textbook&quot; baby.  An added bonus, my husband and I are no longer as lost as we first started - we're finally getting our lives back in order.  Like any advice, I suppose, you take what you can and use it when you can...this book is great and we're giving it to all our friends who are expecting their first baby.  I would suggest getting other books as well since the advice in this book is very basic and I think mostly addresses a new parent's worry and gives them back a little bit of confidence in themselves in the care of their child.
630027120X|5.0|This is one of those rare films that actually makes no attempt to 'tune up' the story.<br />It is a grim tale of human exploitation and the machinery of politics that enable it, set in 17th century South America.<br />The story is strung together on an equally grim existence, that of a fatally flawed character played by Robert De Niro who carries with him a guilt of biblical proportions.<br />This film has an  enourmous power, maybe two. It will either make you sad or mad (the 'I'm angry' type), maybe both!<br />A stunning score, by Morricone, gives moments of unimaginable pathos and excruciating penitence.<br />Watch it, but be warned, this film will not let you off at all.
014028009X|5.0|Aren't they making this book into a movie sometime soon? I think I was watching the previews for &quot;scary movie&quot; and I think that was one of the previews..or maybe it was on TV. I dunno. I was just wondering if anyone has heard this?
6300214826|5.0|Quite simply this film says &quot;the Vietnam war was totally mad and bad&quot;.<br />We travel with some soldiers doing there everyday job (killing), while they try to live like Americans in war zone gone totally mad.<br />Coppola (director) constructs a film which grips you from the opening sequence and takes you through a maze of amazing, blundered, spectacular war scenes that were this brutal conflicts signature. <br />An intense performance by Sheen gives us our path through this maze of a film. He has been given a mission to locate and 'terminate' (assasinate), a renegade American soldier, Col Kurtz (Marlon Brando). There is much to take in (indeed it is a film which may be watched several times without revealing all) and we emerge from it confused, saddened but definitely impressed with the horror that was the apocalypse that shadowed Vietnam.
088103052X|5.0|This is an amazing piece of literature. Lee takes a small 1930's Alabama town and introduces it to a problem that is very real in todays world. Through the eyes of a young girl, we see how this town deals with racism and the conflicts it brings about. The book tells of how a family's lives are affected by doing what they know is right. Atticus, the towns defense attorney, is chosen to defend Tom, a black man who is falsely accused of raping a white girl. Some of the white folks in town don't agree with Atticus' decision. To Kill a Mockingbird teaches us about values and conscience. How it effects our everyday life and other people. We see how racism effects peoples decisions, in this case, convicting an innocent man. This is a funny, yet thought-provoking story. I really enjoyed reading this.

6305307261|5.0|It is interesting to read the various reviews of this film. Those who give it 1 or 2 stars seem to have stumbled upon this film in their local video store under 'horror'. Anyone expecting a horror flick will be extremely disappointed, as this film reflects Dracula as Bram Stoker (a Dubliner, like myself) intended it, without actually recreating his work. The film is wonderfully atmospheric, right from the opening credits with it's chilling music. Interestingly, the film was made for $1m dollars, but is far better than Coppola's recent foray into this subject. The film was shot in Delft in Holland (near Amsterdam). Herzog won't be welcome back there, as the town council refused his request to release 100's of rats into the town. He did so anyway - at 6am - while Delft's council members slept! A wonderful film, well worth the money, ... .
6304626495|5.0|'Life Of Brian' is one of those rare movies which will probably still be a classic in 100 years, shown, praised and criticized at festivals, analyzed in universities, etc.<br />Of course it's about Christianity. And of course it is not blasphemic. In contrary, it is giving an interesting and very very relevant point of view of the historical, AND contemporary, aspects of religion, camouflated in satire.<br />Therefore, it is not only an extremely funny but also a highly important movie which you simple have to have seen!
0891416811|4.0|In my opinion, Currahee! is an incredible novel.  Never in my life have I read something so incredibly real.  The details that Burgett puts into this to describe the deaths and other horrors that he witnesses are amazing.  I had a hard time putting it down because there was non-stop action throughout.  It was one attack after another, and there were many suspenseful scenes as Burgett himself became close to being a victim of the war.  It was also very interesting to get an in-depth view of the constant training that goes into becoming a Paratrooper.  I knew that these guys had to work hard, but never did I even think that it was so tough on them and the physical activity was so incredible.
0385491026|4.0|Sort of an anti-&quot;Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;, &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; is the sometimes brutal, sometimes comical, and always truthful story of the nature of female friendships.  While Cordelia et al are a bit extreme in their cruelty, most women can pinpoint at least one comparable &quot;friend&quot; in their growing-up years.  And unfortunately, those are the expreriences that most shape adulthood.<br />Atwood again uses her unique blend of humor and emotion to craft a gripping novel.  Except for some problems relating the adult Elaine to the child Elaine, the characters are real and engrossing.  In addition to the surface story and its exploration of friendship, &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; provides an interesting commentary on feminism as both a movement and a lifestyle.  <br />One of my favorite Atwood novels - highly recommended for any fan of good fiction.
B000002UE1|5.0|My 200 CD player just got around to playing one of the best rock albums of 1970s, Grand Funk's \\"Closer To Home\\".    Grand Funk: Power trio blasting, stereo panning drum fills, vocal harmonies, bass lead lines, blah, blah, blah...    Todays music is so mechanized -  sampled bingo bastage nonsense. Compared this to raw original sounds, talented humans playing music. And talented they were. This stuff is very melodic, commercial, crowd pleasing and good!!!!!!!!!!!! .....And we liked it.     Must sign off now to dust off my 59 Strat in the closet and plug in to start jamming  and annoy the neighbors
B00003CXE7|5.0|I tell you now, this film is going to be a BIG contender at this year's Academy Awards.  The beauty of this film is its ability to move you.  The acting, the scenery, the story....  <br />It is rare that this kindof film come out of the hollywood woodwork.  And with the advent of DVDs this is a keeper.  This could also double as a reference disc for when you want to showoff your home system.  The visuals and audio are tops!  I SAY GET IT!  Just because this is one of those film you will always want to see over and over again.

0789723107|3.0|This is a great book, extremely well put together and has a lot of great insights, but it's ridiculously limited, especially for a book of it's price.  At only 200 well padded pages you can probably pick up the majority of the lessons in the book just by reading the customer reviews here, it is that short.<br />Krug spends most of the book covering only a few topics, navigation, home page design and user testing, but does so extremely clearly.  If you're an experienced designer then nothing here is surprising, though the satisficing chapter is very interesting. (you can read that chapter online though as luck would have it)<br />I would probably advise against buying it, save your money and borrow it for a day from someone instead.  However, the section on user testing is well done and might be worth the price of admission if you're planning on doing some and need someplace to start.<br />I hope Steve Krug puts out another book sharing more of his insights, I found them all very interesting and well presented, just terribly short.

6305718954|5.0|For me, STIGMATA was about the bringing together, and subsequent love, of the two main characters: the hip hair stylist whose inner conflict walks the line between good nature and non-believing, and the cynical priest whose quest for truth is his guide   ... Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne are nothing short of brilliant in their roles, and the  look and feel of dreary Pittsburgh adds highly to the atmosphere ... What pleasantly surprised me was the quality in chemsitry and subtlety between Byrne and Arquette, which elevated this film from very good to great .... Amidst chaotic circumstances, the two characters develop a genuine care, even love, for each other, which glows against the ugly wealth and materialism of the Catholic religion ... This comment on the value of real vs. fake and good vs. evil is just one aspect that elevates STIGMATA to 5 stars in my book ...
0553278223|5.0|Martian Chronicles is a series of short stories explaining the colonization of humans on Mars.  Bradbury takes issues concerning the 1940s and incorperates them into his novel.  Bradbury has the ability to create Mars in a way that makes you feel as if he has been there.  His characters are strongly developed and build strong relations with each other.  With each story in his novel he has a new set of characters with different kinds of personalities. He shows how each character reacts differently to life on Mars. It is almost like he was using his novel to make a prediction on the future of space exploration  and gives possible outcomes of the future. The book is extremely well written and that gives us an interesting possiblity of the future.
158234082X|3.0|Despite much of the time sounding like a 45 year old adolescent let loose in the candy store, this book has much to recommend it. The chapters A Day in the Life, Level of Discourse and Life of Bryan are thoughtful, well written, enlightening essays on life in the trenches of a busy restaurant, the patois of the workers, and the work methods and ambience of an alternative and much admired fellow chef. A general reader can learn much about food from this very enjoyable and easy read eg &quot; commercially available chickens, for the most part..are loaded with salmonella..&quot; as well get some excellent hints from a good chef eg baked fish recipe. He is perhaps vain, but refreshingly modest, prefers home cooking, and remains unimpressed by an individuals background at an expensive private school - character is just about everything, for a cook on line. And, lets face it, the cook's life is mainly about the senses - laughter, pain, smells, sounds,tastes and sights - that one does need a strong stomache for. These are vividly brought to life by Mr Bourdain.
B000059T1G|4.0|Here's a group who's record company chose to release cobbled together B-sides and haphazardly recorded live tracks to fulfill record contracts, and guess what? The result was better than 90% of what was out there at the time. This record was supposed to be the farewell album of Traffic when it was released in 1969. Steve Winwood was on his way to the ill-fated Blind Faith and Dave Mason was already embarked on his solo career. The version I bought in 1969 was on a record label which will go un-named here but which must have been on it's own 'last exit' with shoddy packaging and almost no information in the liner notes. This seemed odd to me ,at the time, because the previous year's release, the self titled &quot;Traffic&quot; ,was an elaborate and generous double gate fold record. I suppose I should mention that the music was awe inspiring too. Anyway when I bought this one, knowing that Traffic was a done deal ,I did'nt have high hopes but ,dadgum it ,side one had a Dave Mason song starting it off, then a couple of vintage Steve Winwood - Jim Capaldi numbers that would'nt have been out of place on the aforementioned &quot;Traffic&quot; album, and then just to top it off, Traffic are recorded in all their 3 piece glory of Steve Winwood Jim Capaldi ,and Chris Wood playing live on the unlikely and inspired choice of the Anthony Newley song &quot;Feeling Good&quot;. This is as close to jazz-rock as I ever want to get, but it works because the players are erring on the rock side of the line. A lot of folks ,then and now, dismiss this record as a throwaway, but I disagree. There is some hidden treasure here, and while I strongly recommend Traffic's second album, and their reunion album &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;, don't let this one fall between the cracks.And as it turned out, this was only Traffic's first exit.
B0000041DF|5.0|By far my favorite recording of Rachmaninoff's 3rd, Martha rips into it with such passion and strength, capturing our hearts with her rendition of this flamboyant and magnificent concerto, that displays a pianists virtuosity and allows for some wild showmanship. Those that became familiar with the piece from seeing the film &quot;Shine&quot;, should hear this performance ! Martha, with her stunning technique, plays it to the max.<br />On this CD you get an extravagantly emotional double bill, with a fabulous Tchaikovsky 1st as well. A melodic celebration of romanticism, it's here played with dazzling gusto.<br />These are live performance recordings from 1982 (Rachmaninoff) and 1980 (Tchaikovsky) and must have been quite a treat to witness, as her public appearances have been few and far between. She is peerless, a genius in all her glory, and as Bryce Morrison writes in his liner notes, &quot;Argerich defies even whispered comparisons&quot;.
B000056K04|1.0|This is a severely disappointing attempt from a band that is my #2 favourite of all time (U2 being #1).  Dave is here, loud and clear on his new electric guitar (what a mistake!)  The rest of the band seems to be on vacation.  I certainly don't hear the unconventional drumming of Carter, nor the excellent saxophone or the energetic violin of LeRoi and Boyd.  The songs are poorly-rhymed and hastily-written.  The electric guitar is overwhelming and nothing like the thoughtful acoustic of the old DMB.  The lyrics aren't the genuine and introspective lyrics from before.  If you ask me, DMB should have stuck with Steve Lillywhite.  There are some songs on this album that would have been good, if they were recorded by anyone BUT Dave Matthews.  As it is, I'm disappointed in the album, and can only hope they're better live.
0553106635|5.0|This book is one of the reasons I read.  When I received it in the mail, I read it like a demon, devouring page after page until the wee hours of the morning, and when I finished I was ready for another 900 pages.<br />The book is aptly named, as it chronicles the bloody civil war of the Seven Kingdoms, and it spares no one, least of all the reader.  Characters die, and some of them die pretty badly.  There's treachery, political machinations, magic, murder...I actually found my heart pounding at one scene in particular (I will not give it away, but you'll know it when you get there).  This book delivers everything the first two promise, and then it makes some promises of its own.  I'm left salivating for Book 4!<br />If you do not read these books, you are missing something great!
6305511055|5.0|I do not like to give away important information in my reviews regarding a story-line or specific contents. I feel that one can acquire this information from the Amazon posted reviews and other public reviews. I have never liked when people 'spoil the story' or the suprise of item I am about to hear, read, or view.<br />This is one such story that cannot be 'given away' instead I recommend that you suprise yourself with this amazing suspense film. Intellegent, suspenseful, realistic, and just plain great. This is a timeless classic. Treat yourself - end of discussion.
0440416027|5.0|I just finished reading Skellig today. It nearly made me cry. Out of a lot of children's books I've read I'd have to say that this is one of my all time favorites. A nice quick read.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I didn't know much about Moby or techno until I happened to catch &quot;Better Living Through Circuitry&quot; on cable. Mobysongs, a greatest hits collection, was the first CD I bought. Play is the second. Play is definitely more diverse than Mobysongs. I enjoyed the gospel and blues influences in Play. I seems like Moby is trying to bring something organic to the techno sound. The synthesis is interesting and enjoyable.
B000002BSV|5.0|I almost died last night around midnight. What happened was this: I was driving home, I switched on the radio, and caught the last few lines of &quot;Lazy.&quot; By Suede. In America. On ...... After regaining control of my car, I cranked the volume and milked that moment for all it was worth. You see, prior to that instant, I came from a land of No Doubt and Soundgarden. Of Pearl Jam and Sheryl Crow. A land where the radio stations do not play The London Suede at midnight, or at any other time of the day. Perhaps this could be attributed to the fact that most Americans have tended to prefer less subtlety in lyrics, less eccentricity in style, and more good ol' fashioned &quot;let-me-spell-it-out-for-you&quot; noise. In other words, Americans just didn't &quot;get&quot; Suede. But last night, to the gloriously indulgent tune of &quot;Lazy,&quot; something changed. Last month, Suede (known officially as &quot;The London Suede&quot; due to a legal snarl so ridiculous we shan't bother with it here) released their third LP, entitled &quot;Coming Up&quot;. Upon its September 1996 European release, the album entered the UK charts at #1. &quot;Coming Up&quot; is nothing short of a smugly stunning, glamorously heart-wrenching slice of pure genius. And to each fair-weather fan who jumped ship alongside Suede's former guitarist, Bernard Butler, it was a smack in the smirking face. Seventeen-year-old replacement guitarist Richard Oakes didn't merely fill Butler's shoes; he kicked them aside and helped bring Suede to a level not at all anticipated by even the most faithful devotees. This is not to say, however, that Suede wasn't always a brilliant band. Just one sadly overlooked in the wake of more &quot;mainstream&quot; Brits like Spice Girls and Bush. From day one, they refused to sacrifice their delightful originality in order to cater to the demands of the typically more &quot;commercial&quot; American market. Gulping down the entire 43 minutes of &quot;Coming Up&quot; is like taking the whirl of your life on an adjectival roller coaster. The album opens with a jubilantly explosive track entitled &quot;Trash&quot;. It is simply impossible to listen to this song and not revel in its enthusiasm for being young and wild and free. The ripe campiness of Brett Anderson's vocals, combined with an Oakes attack of musical wizardry, manages to deliver a track you won't mind having stuck in your head for a week. The mischievousness of &quot;Filmstar&quot; will steer you through &quot;Lazy&quot; with a grin that will suddenly drown in the numinous serenity of &quot;By the Sea&quot;. But don't dust yourself off quite yet. You've still to grind through the gutter with &quot;She,&quot; swagger through the glittery drama of &quot;Beautiful Ones,&quot; and churn through a womb of angst in &quot;The Chemistry Between Us&quot;. By the time you've reached the album's 10th and final track, you'll be spent just enough to drift peacefully through the intoxicatingly romantic &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Unlike too many of their peers, Suede has refused to sell out. Maybe this is the reason why for so long they remained strangers to American radio. For five years they've waited patiently for Americans to &quot;get&quot; it. This is why last night, I almost crashed my car; because I guess, finally, someone got it.
B000056K04|4.0|it's a good album.  no, really.  the best part, I feel, is how the band plays &quot;down&quot;.  what I mean by this is that they don't overplay, in particular the drummer.  there isn't a fill every two seconds.  it's really trimmed and straight yet not at all diminished as far as thought and creativity are concerned.
0767903854|5.0|This is a fascinating look at one of the most misunderstood places on the planet. You will want to pack your bags after reading Bryson's hilariously informative account of our neighbors Down Under. The Australians should be glad Mr. Bryson has flattered them (except in Macksville, where they probably hang him in effigy). He makes each decidedly different region come magically alive for the reader and you truly feel you are in the scorching Outback or strolling down the sun-dappled streets in Adelaide. My throat literally hurt from laughing at Bryson's descriptions of a hotel encounter with a snippy clerk in Darwin, another hotel literally thousands of miles from anywhere with the tub looking \\"actively infectious\\" and the lively, crude exchange between government officials in Australia's Parliament.(Our politicians have nothing on these guys.) His encounters with the decidedly nasty wildlife of Australia is priceless. I didn't know seashells could chase you. My friend in Melbourne learned alot he had never even imagined about his native country. I can't wait to read the book again, preferably on Qantas heading to Australia.
B000002H70|5.0|The Cure's best selling album, its single, &quot;Love Song&quot; reached the highest of any Cure song on the US charts...#2.  &quot;Love Song&quot; is a beautiful recording that Robert Smith wrote for his wife before their wedding; the rest of the album is gorgeous gloom and doom.  Along with their 2000 release, Bloodflowers, I believe that this is the best the Cure has ever done.  This was the first Cure album I ever purchased, mostly because of Love Song and the snappy dance hit, Fascination Street, but it is the rest of the album that keeps it almost permanently in my CD rotation.  The real strength of this album lies with the power of Prayers for Rain and Disintegration (goth rock), and the absolutely mesmerizing Plainsong, with its beautiful windchimes announcing its opening, and the winding, easy to sing along to, Untitled, that closes this masterpiece of an album. Buy this album and you'll never stop listening to it.
B000002J20|4.0|This Cd may not be the best yes has to offer but it is their most ambitious project and it deserves 3 stars just for the courage and effort. I hardly think many groups would even try something like this now and nary a record company would support it. By the same token the project may have been too ambitious and long leaving the songs wanting at times for intensity or beauty. Perhaps if they had compacted their best ideas into more smaller songs originally they may have approached the greatness of \\"gates of the delirium\\" or\\"awaken\\". Awaken from the going for the one album is just 15minutes long but it may be the finest 15 minutes you can ever hear. <br />Over all the CD is definitely worth the ... price tag.... The lyrics are intelligent and always thought provoking. I don'tknow if i'd call john anderson a great genius but he is obviously a very gifted, intellectually curious man. As a young man he was searching for some higher truth and translated his findings in song. Regardless what he may be reading at a certain time there are particular themes present. Nature, peace and brotherhood of man. The musisianship is as usual spectacular with dynamic bass and drums and wakeman's incredible flourishes and symphonic backdrops. The musical driver of yes is the incredible guitar of steve howe and this CD is filled with outstanding solos....
B00001U0DP|5.0|This film is GORGEOUS!!! It's brimming with so much faith that it drowns out all my energy-depleting negative elements! It's so alive, it never wallows in self pity, and the sun is always out there, shining bright! The Italians have a sterling sense of humor, the whole set-up is just beautiful, and all of its small mechanisms run oh-so-perfectly. Roberto Benigni is excellent, and Joshua is such a lovely little boy... I cried out of unrestrained laughter and then slowly, the sadness that consumes me...We all have a thing or two to learn from Benigni's character. This is actually one movie that deserves all of its accolades...where have movies like this gone to???
6305165912|4.0|The Big Lebowski is a comedy of errors. If not for a simple case of mistaken identity, The Dude would have kept on rolling. Instead, he gets caught up in a huge debacle regarding a kidnapping and tries to get repairations for his carpet. &quot;That carpet really tied the room together&quot;<br />The casting in this movie fits just right, and the story is a good one. The Coen brothers have turned the story of a bum into a winner. The lackadaisical attitude of The Dude really makes this movie. Most other characters would have made themselves pro-active to solve thier dilema, while The Dude just strolls through. It adds a nice element that Bridges plays well.<br />The Dude's attitude is well offset by John Goodman's potrayal of Walter. He's the over-the-top Vietman vet, who seems like he could just snap at any second, and on a couple occasions, does.<br />The middle of the road in this trio is Donny, who is a subtle guy that seems like he is the odd man out between Walter and The Dude. While Donny is in the movie, he' not really part of the story, and this throws a few laughs in for the audience.<br />The most powerful character in this flick is the one with the least time on screen. That would be Jesus. John Turturro does a superb job of adding a lot of laughs in a small amount of time by playing a bowler with an overt attitude, and a nice surprise that makes it even funnnier.<br />The plot is nice and simple, but The Dude can't seem to keep up with it until it's too late. This adds to the entertainment as he tries to get his goal accomplished, but is hampered by his lifestyle and by Walter.<br />Some will say this movie is a waste of time with no story, but don't let others keep you from a winner. If you don't like it, or didn't like it the last time you saw it, you need to try it again as it gets better with time.
B000002Q7Y|5.0|I credit this CD with getting me back into Kansas.... To me, POWER is a really good album - featuring some interesting orchestral interplay with the band on a few tracks, especially \\"Secret Service.\\" Was this what everyone was expecting? No. It's a lot more mainstream when you take into account that Steve Morse was involved, and where the band's roots are. But, considering what was going on in 1986, the album didn't seem completely out of place, and it probably was the right thing to do at that time for a band trying to re-establish itself. The resulting album - not perfect, but I really find myself struggling to give it less than 5 stars, probably because I REALLY enjoy Morse's guitar playing, and I think these are very solid, catchy songs. Just don't expect \\"Masque\\" or \\"Song ForAmerica.\\" If you can get it, pick it up... and if you want prog-rock-utopia with a modern twist, check out Dream Theater.
B000002KD5|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time, in my opinion. The music is timeless.  The sounds on this are some of greatest songs ever written. Try listening to this in the dead of winter(January-Febuary) in the middle of the night in the dark with a good view. Yeah buy this one if you like music genius.
B00004ZESV|5.0|Just buy it - you will not regret
B000002GVO|5.0|This album is one of the best I have ever heard. The lyrics of the song &quot;Hotel California&quot; are superb. This is a must-have album. It brings you to different worlds. It is purely, a masterpiece of all times. I would not grade 5/5 that easily, but this album deserves it 100%. I remember, when I bought the album, 4 years ago, I kept listening to it for 3 weeks. At least once a day. A must have for everyone's collection.
0684867621|3.0|Having been a huge fan of Kings' work for years, I was so let down by this book!  It starts out good and about halfway through it starts to get tediuous to the reader.  By the end, you realize there is so much more that could have happened.  This is the only book by him that I have not enjoyed much.  Everyone is entitled to a few let downs.  Come on Stephen!=)
B00002DEQQ|4.0|It's really great to see Tom Jones is still in action after all these years. I saw him in concert a little over a year ago, and he put on one heck of a show. The ladies still throw their panties at him! Very cool.&quot;Reload&quot; is a great Tom Jones album. He sounds like he &amp; his singing partners are all having a great time, and the whole fun feel of the album translates very well to the listener. &quot;Burning Down The House&quot; pairs Tom with The Cardigans, and the result is a very catchy version of the old Talking Heads hit. &quot;Sexbomb,&quot; an original tune, is one of Tom's most fingerpoppin' best. He &amp; Robbie Williams tear through &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot; with relish, Tom &amp; Cery's &quot;It's Cold Outside&quot; is a hoot, and the powerful &quot;Motherless Child&quot; is another great showcase for Tom's still-commanding voice. And these are just a few examples of how good this album is!Just one question: &quot;Reload&quot; is a huge hit in Britain and other parts of Europe, so **WHY** can't it get released here in North America? Absolutely puzzling. I'm telling ya, Tom Jones would have hit singles galore lined up &amp; ready for him over here if &quot;Reload&quot; ever gets a U.S. release. In the meantime, buy it on import. It's totally worth it!
0385486804|5.0|Great Book, easy reading...only took about a week...Last 3-4 chapters are the best....Hard to put down!<br />Krakauer's style is awesome...can't wait to read his next, &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;.<br />Author relates own experiences with Father and solo wilderness trek to that of McCandless as he searches for answers to the youthful and carefree risks we all take when young and naive!
B00004Z459|5.0|Let's just say that if you like any of their singles (One Step Closer, Crawling) and you haven't got this album yet, get it! I cannot believe how good every individual song on it is. They all are different in their own unique way but bond together to form this one great thing...there are no words to describe it, which is why you should listen to the whole CD for yourself to understand, and believe me, you will. Rapper Mike and screamer/singer Chester blend so well together, even though their vocals are at opposite ends of the spectrum. The music is also outstanding, one could easily mosh out to it. I was also delightedly surprised to see that their lyrics are quite deep and that they refrain from cussing. My personal favorite song is track 8's In the End, as it especially has that gut-wrenching yearning sound to it that most of their songs have, and I love that. Linkin Park has quickly become my choice band, I can't wait for more of their material. Sadly, their Hybrid Theory album is only 37 or so minutes long...and yet I can listen to it every single day and not get tired of it, so in my opinion it must be a truly outstanding album.
B00003CXRP|2.0|&quot;Castaway&quot; is what I consider a flawed film.  Sure,the moments on the island are wonderful, but it doesn't hide the factthat the plot and motivation of the movie is weak.  Tom Hanks is goodin his role (but has he ever been bad in a movie in the last decade)but the other actors in the film are delegated to underdeveloped minorcharacters.  They serve no more purpose than for them to just bethere.  It surprises me that this film is so hailed as a cinematicexperience.  The script is non-existent, the directing by RobertZemeckis, who has shown his extrodinary talent in other films, ismerely adequate, and an ending which strains credibility.  Perhaps thefilm's main problem is that it glosses over the relationships that TomHanks's character has with the other characters with short,unsatisfactory bookends.  For me, the film left me thinking there wasa greater film somewhere, but instead, I just saw a film that showedthe highlights.
B000056N8X|4.0|Several people reviewing this film don't seem to realize this film actually has nothing to do with the first film but is meerly a film based on the TV series where the Kurgan and Conner did not fight for the prize but it was just another Immortal duel! Geez comparing this to the first film is like apples to oranges. I loved the first film the subsquent sequals do not exist in my mind. BUT THIS FILM IS NOT A SEQUAL!!! If you watched the series and liked it, I did, you will like this film, I did. Is it great cinema? No. Is it the fabulous acting? No. But then neither was the series so get over it people and just see the movie for the fun of it as modern sword and sorcery camp! *SIGH*
6302968143|5.0|I looooove HOCUS POCUS! This is the best flick you could possibly find for a Halloween night. It's humorous and lighthearted, and can be pretty scary for kids under the age of 8. I'm 17 years old, and I still think HOCUS POCUS is the best Halloween flick. This movie is basically about the three Sanderson witch sistes who lived long ago in the 1600s during the Salem Witch Trials, in Massachusetts. Winifred, Sarah, and Mary want to make themselves look younger and more beautiful. So in the beginning, they create a spell that will suck the lives out of children who are more beautiful then they are and then they will receive all that beauty and youthfulness. Anyway, Thackery Binks is a young boy who lived during the time of the Sanderson witches. One morning when his kid sister, Emily Binks, runs off, he realizes that she's being hypnotized by the Sanderson sisters to go to their home in the middle of the woods so they can take her life. Thackery races off to rescue his sister, only to find that he is too late. The Sanderson sisters find Thackery in their house and attack him, turning him into a black cat forever, unless someone can break the spell. That night, the Sanderson sisters are found by the townspeople and are hanged for killing Thackery. The Sanderson sisters promise the townspeople that they will come back to life when someone lights the black candle in their home. Then 300 years go by and it is the present day. Max is a young teenage boy who moves with his family to Salem, Massachusetts from Los Angeles, California. On Halloween, his teacher tells his class the story on the Sanderson sisters, like she always does every year. Max, being new in town, doesn't believe the story of the three witches. Allison, a girl in his class whom he has a crush on, tells Max that the story is true, even though Max still doesn't really believe her. On Halloween night, when Max takes his little sister Dani out trick-or-treating, they end up going to this large house which happens to be the home of Allison. When he sees Allison, Max suggests to Allison and Dani that they all go to the Sanderson witches home - which has been turned into a museum - to see if the story his teacher told them really was true. Dani believes the story and doesn't want to go. But Allison agrees to it and then Dani, who has to go since their parents are at a Halloween party, agrees to go. They get to the home of the Sanderson sisters and find Thackery, who is still a black cat. Thackery tells them about the Sanderson sisters and Max, who still wants to prove that he is right that the witches don't exist, lights the black candle, bringing the Sanderson sisters back to life. Now, Max, Allison, and Dani are on a wild and hilarious chase to catch and destroy the Sanderson sisters before it is too late (which would be at dawn the next morning) and before the Sanderson sisters can suck the lives out of all the children in town. Bette Midler and Sarah Jessica Parker are excellent in this film, so are Omri Katz (who plays Max), Kathy Namijy, Vinessa Shaw, and a very young Thora Birch. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Halloween!
B00003Q438|5.0|I picked up this copy of The Abyss on a whim, really.  I remembered enjoying the film when I was younger, and was in the mood for something new.. so here comes The Abyss.<br />This DVD is fantastic.  There are more special features on the DVD then you could shake a stick at.  The movie works wonderfully on DVD, as most all of them do.  The added footage, as stated by another review before this one, really does change the entire meaning of the film.  It adds more thought to the ending of the film then the way it ended before.. and it helps give people a bit of perspective as to how our behavior here on Earth could be, and very well might be, viewed by outside sources.<br />Truly a great movie, and wonderful DVD.
6304414145|5.0|This movie isn't like most Hollywood flicks about ransom, it's actually completely different! The entire cast and supporting cast does a surpurb acting job. RANSOM is about an extremely wealthy, multi-millionaire, Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson). Tom is an airline owner, and his top priority in life is his family that includes his wife, Kate Mullen (Rene Russo), and one son, Sean Mullen (Brawley Nolte). Soon, an enemy of Tom Mullen and his gang are after Tom's money. To get what they want, which is about a million dollars, they kidnapp Tom's son, Sean, while the family is at a district science fair in their hometown of New York City. Tom and Kate are so desparate to find Sean and bring him back home that they will do just about anything in their power to bring Sean back alive and safe. All throughout the film, the guy who kidnapps Sean (I forget his name), tries to give Tom clues on how he can get his son back and where he is. The ending of this film may surprise some people, because it's definitely not the usual ending of a Hollywood suspense film. A must-see for any Mel Gibson fan and is very well-worth watching even if you don't like Mel Gibson. I very much enjoyed it!
B00004TRD8|5.0|Although my DVD collection isn't extensive, it holds enough that there's quite a gap between those which are exceptional, and those that fall short.  T2 'The Ultimate' certainly fits with the few exceptional DVD's that I've come across.<br />It's been many years in the coming, but it's certainly been worth the wait.  When T2 first came out, I was full of anticipation as I went to the movie theater as a young kid and saw it.  When I heard there was a new DVD coming out, I was just as excited.. and it didn't let me down.  The movie itself, on DVD, is amazing.. without a doubt.  The beauty of the picture and sound of DVD really helps keep this movie as it should be.  The added materials are outstanding.<br />There are quite a few full length (30 min, give or take) documentaries, 3 in total I believe.  The one I continue to go back onto is the making/thought process of the deleted scenes (which, wonderfully enough, can be seen as part of the movie, if you choose to do so, or you can watch the original) which add to the movie in countless ways.  It gives the movie much more depth, which I found enlightening.. it also adds more feeling to the final scene, and it adds some humor..  the smiling scene is absolutely priceless.<br />Without a doubt, one of the best DVD's that I've come across, and a must have for anyone who enjoyed the movie at it's onset, and certainly worth a look for anyone else.. especially those who enjoy action movies.
B0000027RL|5.0|I'm going to do another one of those irritating track-by-track synopsises that take so long to scroll past, so I'm sorry.  But if you would like to hear my opinion on my absolute favorite rock album, you might appreciate a detailed review.<br />To me, Pearl Jam are the perfect blend of an alternative rock band and a classic arena rock band.  They have loud, muscular guitars, and ravaged, honest frontman, powerful drums, and the most melodic and effortlessly skilled bassist in Jeff Ament that I have ever seen.  &quot;Ten&quot; sounds less fresh today as it did a decade ago, but that's due to the fact that next to Green day, they have inspired countless imitators who can't create their own sound.  (Green Day are nothing innovative, but they did bring out a slew of punk-revival bands.)  Much of Pearl Jam's distinctive style has been diluted by bands like STP, Hootie and the Blowfish, Matchbox Twenty, Everclear, and Creed. But none of them have the muscle, power, honesty, and integrity of Pearl Jam.<br />ONCE- A short, tortured tale of madness.  Vedder growls more than he usually does here, but this is just an intro for what's to come.  7/10<br />EVEN FLOW- The hypno-riffing perfectly blends with Vedder's angry lyrics about homelessness.  8/10<br />ALIVE- A masterpiece.  Everything that makes Pearl Jam great lies in this six-minute song.  Has possibly the best guitar solo I've ever heard.  10/10    <br />WHY GO- Love the drums.  Another angry song about madness along the vein of &quot;Once&quot;, but now we understand Eddie more, therefore making it more accessible. 8/10<br />BLACK- Another masterpiece.  Nothing catchy, just Eddie Vedder tearing open his soul as he cries for his absent lover.  I relate to this song 100%.  10/10<br />JEREMY- After &quot;Black&quot; fades away, we have silence.  Then, Eddie begins singing about being &quot;At home...drawing pictures/Of mountaintops...&quot;  Terrific.  10/10<br />OCEANS- I'm sorry.  This is painfully out of place with theanthemic sweep of the first half, and I can't get into it.  It has it's own beauty, but it just seems like a filler.  5/10<br />PORCH- Thankfully, they get back on track with their first great fast song, and I mean FAST! 9/10<br />GARDEN- Has a soft chorous, and finally rises to it's anthemic crescendo.   Good. 7/10 <br />DEEP- Terrific.  Darker and bluesier than anything else on &quot;Ten.&quot;  9/10<br />RELEASE- A wonderful close.  I do find the bonus track rather pointless though.  9/10     <br />Pearl Jam have made more challenging, and lyrically superior albums, but &quot;Ten&quot; tie it all together with it's revisionist take on rock.  If only they could kick those teenyboppers off the charts.
0792156684|4.0|Well, James Cameron surely viewed the movie Somewhere In Time to help him for the storylines!! But Somewhere In Time with low budget in 1980, is a more better TRUE LOVE and ROMANCE story than this movie and also to me a better movie. In Somewhere In Time, the love between Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymour (What a beautiful women in this movie!!!!!) is credible and the story focus on their love. Surely, the Titanic story would help any average scipt to be a success. To me, Kate Winslet is beautilful and delivered good acting but it is not her best performance.<br />Plus:<br />Somewhere In Time refers to 1912 too!!!
B00004ZB9D|4.0|Lenny Kravitz has always presented this problem: his music is firmly placed in the &quot;retro&quot; category, yet it is hard to relate to him as anything other than postmodern. In many ways his music evokes the spirit of the 90s (&quot;Fly Away&quot;, &quot;American Woman&quot;), which suggests that the decade was one in which pop music finally was able to reconcile the need to reinvent itself with full acceptance of its rock 'n roll roots. <br />Now we are looking at Lenny Kravitz' output in bluesy retrospection which is apt to make anyone wonder what it is they are being nostalgic about. This is especially true if you have already immersed yourself in his songs thrugh his ubiquitous similar-sounding CDs and innumerable clips on VH1, in which case purchasing this CD is probably redundant.<br />A fine collection of his best work, but of itself devoid of a niche that could elevate it to a compilation that stands as a work of art on its own terms.

0767835255|4.0|This movie, made in 1997 by Wolfgang Peterson, is probably one of the better action movies around. It is filled with a great introduction scene that immediately catches your attention, and the acting between Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman is fantastic. You really want to think that they truly hate each other. That's what you get from good acting. We haven't seen that in some time. Also, the action is truly amazing. You want President Marshall--Ford--to succeed and save his family.<br />The plot, as most already know, is about how the president's plane Air Force One is highjacked by a group of Russian radicals. The president is held hostage while aboard. <br />Glenne Close does a marvelous job as a woman Vice President, and overall, I think this movie is supurb. It is rated &quot;R&quot; for pretty strong violence and some blood, although it comes nowhere near than what is seen in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; or even &quot;The Rock&quot;. Also, there is some mild language, but nothing too severe in my opinion. I love this movie and am even considering purchasing the soundtrack that makes this film even better.
0345440757|1.0|An other in a plethora of parenting books that tells us that our instincts are useless and if we would only listen to the author's baseless theories and follow their \\"methods\\" all of our \\"problems\\" would be solved. <br />Ms. Hogg's infomation on breastfeeding is not only outdated but just plain wrong, her theories on infant sleep are baseless and unfounded, and she comes off as simply an other Ezzo \\"get that baby on a schedule\\" devotee. Has Ms. Hogg read ANY lactation or infant attachment information that has been published in the past 20 years?<br />As a Lactation Consultant and the mother of 3 breastfed, attachment parented children, I cannot read a book like this wihout thinking of all the damage it will do to the babies of parents who really beleive that their instincts are useless and that babies NEED to be \\"kept in line.\\"<br />It's just too sad. Skip this one, read Sear's and Sear's \\"The Baby Book\\" for REAL LIFE useful and compassionate parenting information. Get \\"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding\\" for ANY and all informative breastfeeding advice. Most of all, listen to your baby, she is NOT a horse, she is a small human with needs and feelings.<br />I can't help but feel afraid to take advice from a woman who was just \\"too busy\\" to raise her own children. The \\"Star's\\" children she was nanny to seem to be her only real world point of reference on what children are like. <br />Parenting books written by people who have actually bothered with their own children (Attachment Parenting by Katie Allison Granju, The Baby Book by William and Martha Sears, Natural Family Living by Peggy O'Mara and The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding by the Founders of La Leche League) are the books who really have the best information and empathy that anyone raising a child really need!<br />There are better written, better researched and ceratinly more compassionate books out there for new parents, save your money and buy one of the books listed above. Your baby may not be able to thank you in words, but if she could she would thank you for passing this book up.
6300215512|5.0|Easily one of the greatest films ever made! A perfect film in plot, cinematography, casting, editing....this film is perfect in every way! Gloria Swanson is wonderful as the lovestruck, tormented Norma Desmond. William Holden is equally perfect as the penniless screenwriter-turned-giggolo. There are outstanding performances by the supporting cast, particularly Eric Von Stroheim.  This film is entertaining from beginning to end.
B000002UA0|5.0|Just finished listening through the entire album, and I think this album is a must.  The levels of music that are explored on this album are nothing like any other Floyd album. &quot;Intersellar Overdrive&quot; combines some of the creepiest and most poetic musical Floyd moments that I can rhink of. The genius and horrifying reality of Syd Barret is realized after listening through this album.  If you consider yourself a Floyd fan and have yet to discover Piper, make sure you pick it up.
B000056K04|1.0|I have avidly loved DMB for years, and i don't know what i'm listening to here.  There's no song that can anchor me to any part of this CD.  I don't really know what to say.  <br />I drive to work and try and give this album valuble commuting time, but i find myself longing for the chaotic intro of Warehouse.  Or the grooviness of Crush.  Say what you will about old DMB- it was original &lt;reminisces fondly of Minarets&gt; <br />One serious point, over the summer tour Dave referenced songs like JTR, Grey Street, and the like as to be &quot;on the new album coming out this fall.&quot;  Were those songs scrapped with Mr. Lillywhite?  If so, bad move boys, bad move.  <br />On the &quot;DMB bootleg stock market&quot;, Summer 2000 tracks have been upgraded to &quot;strong buy&quot; from &quot;hold&quot;....  ha ha.
B00005AACC|4.0|As far as this movie goes, the plot was nothing great.  Actually, I thought it was kind of lame.  But the action sequences and the music in the movie totally grabbed me.  It was worth putting up with the plot to experience the action and score of the movie.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is a great album! I know everyone says that, and maybe there's a reason for it... The first few times that I heard this CD I thought it got really dumb at the end, but after listening to it a bit more closely it's awesome! &quot;I Don't Know You&quot; is one of the most awesome songs *ever*, he has got such a sexy accent and it's so noticable in that one! The message is great too. It's about how he's feeling awful for having not devouted more time and effort into his marriage. &quot;Chained To You&quot; offers a great beat and has really awesome lyrics! &quot;Affirmation&quot; is a really good song, and has mostly good lines {&quot;I believe the sun should never set upon an arguement&quot; or &quot;I believe that beauty magazines promote low selfasteem&quot;} but there's one or two I disagree with. Daniel says it's like &quot;I Want You&quot; on an adreniline rush. I'd tend to agree! &quot;You Can Still Be Free&quot; is probably my least favorite, it's kind of slow and just doesn't catch me at all. &quot;Gunning Down Romance&quot; is really awesome! And my all time favorite is &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;. This is like my life's theme song. Being only 15, this is the love song for me. I don't really know what to say about it, everyone's heard it {and if you haven't you *need* to **so** badly!} and it just takes my breath away. Darren does such a good job at putting feeling into his music, and Daniel has such a way with the music that you almost feel like you're melting into it. Some reviews have said that this CD is slow. That's what I thought the first few times I listened to it, but the more you listen, the better and faster it gets. The only &quot;problem&quot; is that they put the upbeat songs at the beginning of the album, then put mostly slow at the end. I think they should have switched the placement of &quot;The Lover After Me&quot; and &quot;Gunning Down Romance&quot;, would have made for a better ending. But definitely not a reason to stay away fromthe album! Keep up the *great* work guys, and I can't wait until you start working on a third!
B000000OSO|3.0|Perhaps a better title for Get A Grip could have been &quot;Ill Conceived Power Ballads and Other B-Sides&quot; due to Grip's lackluster content.  Actually, it would be unfair to criticise the album for its slower songs.  Aerosmith has a long tradition of releasing outstanding power ballads and Grip delivers three more.<br />The problem with Get A Grip is that it fails to deliver a line up of solid rockers.  Roughly half the album (for example: &quot;Flesh&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Walk on Down&quot;, &quot;Shut Up and Dance&quot;, &quot;Gotta Love It&quot;, and &quot;Line Up&quot;) is mildly enjoyable, though mostly forgetable.  Songs such as &quot;Eat the Rich&quot; and &quot;Get a Grip&quot; are decent rock songs, but neither is strong enough to match the intensity and catchiness of Grip's power ballads.  Though &quot;Living On the Edge&quot; holds its own as one of the album's best, it's unfortunately overshadowed by the rest of the cd's mediocrity.  The result is an awkward and unbalanced Aerosmith album where slower songs dominate the faster, more aggressive rockers.  <br />Overall, Get A Grip has enough highlights to keep it from being a bad album, but not enough of them to make it a great cd.
B0000508U6|4.0|I was first introduced to Coldplay by watching their video for &quot;Yellow&quot; on TV a few months ago. A few weeks later Yellow was the only song I'd hear on the radio. I really wasn't all that interested in Coldplay, but my sister bought &quot;Parachutes&quot; and one day she decided to play the entire CD for me. While I was already familiar with &quot;Shiver&quot; and &quot;Yellow&quot;, the rest of the album was a mystery to me. I had been told it was an excellent album, but I now wanted to find out for myself. So right now I'm listening to it all the way through for the first time. Here are my thoughts on each song:<br />Don't Panic: This song sounds so familiar (in a good way). Sort of a fast paced song great for a beginning to an album. Some of the guitar techniques used on this song remind me of U2. Chris Martin's voice is the highlight of this song.<br />Shiver: This song screams Jeff Buckley all the way. It's the way Chris Martin fluxuates his voice. The guitar, the style of the song in general, the vocals - everything in this song could have possibly been inspired by Jeff Buckley. My sister says this is the highlight of the album.<br />Spies: Haunting/echoey intro... very atmospheric, with an acoustic guitar. Chris' vocals are crisp and clear. Soon enters a funky bassline, echoing guitar. The general feel of this song is moody, atmospheric, yet the rhythm gets you moving.<br />Sparks: Intro of acoustic guitar chords... strong bass, slow, flowing song... your typical ballad.<br />Yellow: Chances are you know this song already as it's been played to death on the radio. &quot;Look at the stars, look how they shine for you, and everything you do, and they were all yellow&quot;<br />Trouble: Pretty piano intro... bass/drums/guitar join in. Just vocals over piano for the first verse... then the rest of the band joins in. So far it's a very soothing song. The lyrics suggest that it's a tribute to his mother.<br />Parachutes: Intro of simple vocals over a guitar. Slow-paced dreamy song... drums and jazz guitar enter afterwards. It's really hard to describe this song other than it's emotional while fully under control with that slow-dance, jazz ballad feel to it. For some other reason, this song also reminds me of a Jeff Buckley song. I'm guessing it has to do with the lead singer's vocal style.<br />High Speed: Slow, acoustic guitar chords start this song off. This song actually reminds a bit of U2's &quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress&quot;. Perhaps it's because of the guitar style in this song. This song's like an enchanting love song. Simple, yet beautiful.<br />We Never Change: Starts off sounding like a lounge piano song (ie: 3 piano chords and vocals). This is actually like a gospel jazz song! The guitar reminds me of U2 (again!) because of the various notes chiming in and out. But Coldplay use this style and make it their own.<br />Everything's Not Lost: Starts off with a nice little vocal. For some reason this reminds me of a Bob Marley type song without the reggae. I'm not a big fan of the oregon type instrument used. All in all, I don't think this was a great ending to the album. <br />But as for the entire album? I'd definitely give it more listens! There are some excellent songs on this album, but it has its fair share of slow ballad type songs. No, this is not your typical &quot;Brit-pop&quot; band. In fact, there's more depth to this band than most pop/rock bands these days. If you like U2, Travis or Jeff Buckley, I'd recommend this album for you!
B00003CXE7|1.0|I don't get it. Everytime I see one of these mega-movies they all look the same. The filmmaking style just bored me to tears. Talk about a formula. All the elements are just recycled from every other period action/adventure film. They lost me with the opening battle scene.<br />By the way, If you want to see a great battle scene with a wonderful score check out &quot;Ran&quot; by Kurowsawa. He turns the battle sounds off and turns up the score, for a truely amazing experience. <br />Everytime the action is indoors we get a cut and a close up every 4 seconds. No hold on the master shot where the actors are free to move within the frame. Terrible filmmaking (editing). I felt like I was watching TV with an overblown budget. Needless to say I &quot;walked out&quot; on this one early and never finished the DVD. I'd rather &quot;read the book&quot; and use my imagination.<br />I give it one star for the effort it took to stage the opening battle scene. But then again, most of it was probably computer generated. No soup for you! Zero stars.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This amazing director Alfred Hitchcock got the nod for 4 of AFI's (American Film Institute's) top 100 movies in 100 years (1998).  This incredible feat showcases &quot;Hitch&quot; at his very best !!!!  His greatest run began with his greatest movie &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), then Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959) and his most famous horror thriller, Psycho (1960) all on AFI's list.<br />Rear Window's cast was meticulously chosen and performed perfectly and flawlessly.  This movie is the perfect blend of story, cinematography, acting, music, drama, suspense and most of all COLOR.  Digitally restored masterfully you now can enjoy the artist pallet at its best.<br />In summary; An adventure magazine photographer (James Stewart) is in his 6th week being wheelchair bound from a broken leg in a 2 room apartment overlooking the courtyard of an apartment complex in New York.  Socialite girlfriend (the most beautifully photographed closeup sequence of Grace Kelly) tries to persuade the reluctant Stewart to be allowed into his high adventure life.  Along with his physical therapist (Thelma Ritter) the trio get involved in a peeping Tom scenario of the neighbors &amp; the possibility of a  husband (Raymond Burr) killing &amp; disposing of his wife?  The girlfriend and therapist become predators to find the body.  Stewart becomes the victim of the husband &amp; the rest is history.<br />This the greatest movie and Grace Kelly is absolutely gorgeous!!!<br />Plenty of backgound information and incites from &quot;Hitch's&quot; daughter Patricia Hitchcock.<br />You've got to see &quot;Rear Window&quot; and then you will want to see more of this directors work.  You can't lose with &quot;Rear Window&quot;!!!!!
0201633612|5.0|I felt the book was as clear and concise as possible.  It did a great job in quickly introducing me to patterns and is an essential reference in my collection.  The best part about this book is it's organization and use of Case Studies.  I am not a C++ or a SmallTalk programmer so Java examples would be nice, but this was released around 1995 so I can't possibly be critical of there choices.  I recommend anyone involved with software design read this.
0671004107|4.0|Contact is an excellent book!  Carl Sagan keeps you wanting to read more, as the Message suddenly streams in.  The Message contains plans for an intricate machine, which will take years to build, it took about a year to finish downloading for the plans.  After they build it, the have 5 people enter the machine, and they turn it on.  The travel through space and time (although they don't know that at the time).  They travel through what they can only describe as a Black Hole, and they suddenly pop out at Vega, the system that they were receiving the Message from.  As they orbit around the star, they see radio telescopes, and another black hole.  They are sucked into the hole, and pop out at another. This goes on for a while, until they arrive at the center of the galaxy.  Now this is where it gets a bit confusing.  They dock at the massive port, and they are in an area that is exactly like a deserted beach.  During the night, the races that are there somehow retrieve all of the information in their brains.  Suddenly, it's time to leave, they get back in the machine, and power back to earth.  On earth, it has only been 20 minutes, and all video evidence was erased.  Nobody believes them.  This was an excellent book, but because of the confusing end, I have to give this book four out of five stars.
0804115613|5.0|If I recommend only one book out of all the books I have read recently, it will be Fried Green Tomatoes at The Whistle Stop Cafe. It is a beautifully written story that is immediatley engrossing. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book. You owe it to yourself to read this charming, touching, beautiful adventure into America's past.
B000003S0B|3.0|Don't throw your vinyl version away yet unless it's unplayable.  This &quot;remastered&quot; version deleted 33 seconds off the end on the title track!  How could they do that?  I A-B'd the vinyl and CD versions, and the CD version wins only in better high end detail and the lack of surface noise (which Atlantic pressings had in excess).  The vinyl has a better low end (bass guitar and kick drum have a lot more punch).  When I purchase a &quot;30th Anniversary Edition&quot; that is 24-bit remastered, I expect a better sounding recording than the original.  Not here.  It was remastered at Chop 'Em Out Studios.  How appropriate!  Fripp chopped his own recording.
0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess rips open our minds, throws in an entire imaginary universe and sews it back together, leaving the universe with us forever in his style-driven novel, \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"  Burgess weaves the English language with Russian slang to create a fictional teenage dialect for our protagonist, Alex and his gang of \\"droogs.\\" These characters shock us with their extracurricular activities of raping women, beating up bums and exploring hallucinogenic drugs at the age of 15.  The crimes catch up to this villain that we want to hate, but can't. Alex takes the fall for his droogs and receives a 15-year prison sentence.  However, Alex's doctors have been working on a case study, \\"Ludovico's Technique.\\" They offer Alex an alternative of reducing his prison sentence to less than a year by participating in the experiment. Alex does what any 15-year-old would do and takes what seems the less painful choice.   Ludovico's Technique is an experiment designed to condition its subject to lose their evil tendencies and become the \\"perfect Christian.\\" This technique comes right out of Psychology 101. Dr. John B. Watson first conducted the experiment with a rat and a child in the \\"Little Albert\\" case study.  Although Burgess creates a new world, he leaves our imaginations to fill in our own world. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" will have the reader questioning the dangers of conformity, the roles of society and their own existence. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" should be read with an open mind. It took me two weeks to get past the first chapter, but once I did, I never wanted to put it down.
B00003Q438|5.0|I read this book (I think from the screenplay) before seeing the movie and was very disappointed when I did see it. Last night I watched the special edition and I could not believe what was cut from the theatrical release! I was really impressed with this ending as it did answer alot that was left out in the theaters. This was definitely worth buying!!!
B000001IQH|1.0|At first listen, this album sounded like every other piece of sold out &quot;punk&quot; music.  However, after I listened a little more carefully, I realised that this album was much more than that.  It is not only loud, unlistenable and annoying -- it is most definitely a true piece of hippie propoganda.  <br />These so-called punks think that they are rebelling at some corrupt system.  Yet, all they do is sit in a circle, smoke weed, and have sex all day.  DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM.
B000058T5E|5.0|Jeff Beck straps on his guitar again and effortlessly sounds tough as nails and hard as chrome.  Few artists can manage to sound dangerous on recording; take for example the guy from Limp Bizkit, screeching in a fakey voice about breaking someone's face, managing only to sound like a jr. high dork posing in front of his bedroom mirror.  Mr. Beck manages his tough sound the way Billy Gibbons does, by the deep experience of playing a guitar for a very long time and having a real handle on everything he does. The guitar hero goes industrial on this outing, and the results are thrilling.  Standouts are \\"Roy's Toy,\\" which burns away in a real, cool groove, and the remake of the blues classic, \\"Rolling and Tumbling.\\" Beck even has this old war horse snorting fire. Great album.
0060194995|5.0|This is Harper Lee's only novel.  Since she was at one time friends with Truman Capote, many have thought that he had a hand in the authoring of this great book, but that's not so.  Although Harper Lee has written other short stories, this prize winner came from her heart.  A semi-autobiographical story set in the South and modeled after her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama. The movie was also wonderful, but this book will be one you'll never forget.

B000001ELL|3.0|Dyasty has some great songs, but Revenge is the only real KISS album that hss been made since 1977.  I had great hopes for Psycho Circus, but it just isn't the same.
0767824571|5.0|... was right when they chose this as an essential video. This film was my first exposure to Monty Python- quite the film to watch when I was in high school just a few years ago. I have watched this movie over and over, and it doesn't lose any of its humor! Watch this, and you'll most certainly be a Python fan for life.
B000002JR8|3.0|I am pretty much in agreement with magicbow on this occasion: I purchased this album somehow believing that the epic style of their first albums had been combined with an introspective grunge format. Where I picked up these opinions is unknown. There are some good songs on this recording, but I could not name them as everything seems to sound the same. Their cover of the Sabbath song was an obvious standout, but it cannot lift this album above the mire. I suppose that with their little habits they couldn't keep up the greatness forever. I don't know if they made an improvement with .....Trendkill, but I didn't care for their latest at all.
B00000I07R|5.0|I've been a fan since I was nine, way back in the &quot;Runaway&quot; days. Didn't own an album til Slippery When Wet, which of course, there was no turning back from there. As groundbreaking as that album was, I still prefer Keep the Faith. I can not even explain why, to be honest. It's funny, because when it was released it took me months to buy it. I just wasn't interested for some reason. By the time my friend taped it for me, it was all I listened to in my car. &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; is their greatest ballad (the best lyrics Jon has ever attempted at writing, very surprising!), &quot;If I was Your Mother&quot; just simply rocks, it blows my mind every time I hear it. &quot;I'll Sleep When I'm Dead&quot; is too much fun. &quot;In These Arms&quot; is such a fantastic, catchy song. There are some throwaways- &quot;Woman in Love&quot;, maybe even &quot;A Little Bit of Soul&quot;. But it's still sooo much fun to listen to. Too bad they had to follow it up with a depressing dirge like These Days. If I'd have to put my favorite albums in order, it would be Faith, Slippery, Jersey (and I don't even LOVE that one for some reason), Crush (not a true favorite, but I'm glad to see them returning to the old formula), Fahrenheit and Bon Jovi (haven't listened to those two in eons though). These Days doesn't even make the cut. I find it unlistenable.<br />But anyway! This is about Faith. And it rocks.
B000056K04|3.0|Alright, this CD does have its perks. I was never a huge DMB fan, and still am not. I didnt even buy this, my friend burned her copy for me, because they arent a band I would generally spend money on anyways. But, I thought there were some upsides to it. Angel is a great song, its very sweet, and I prefer slower songs like that. I also like If I had it all, and so right. Those are very good. I hafta say,  I really like the songs that are slower, partly because my two favorite songs by them are Satellite and Dont Burn the Pig. And thats the type of music I like by them. I absolutely HATE HATE HATE the CD version of I did it, but I saw them on SNL and MTV, and its a really good song-LIVE. This CD is sorta a waste of money, at least for me, because they arent my favorite band, and I think in order to love this CD you hafta be a 'davehead'. But maybe thats just what I think.
B00000634J|4.0|If you were to interpret the title of this album according to its dictionary defintion - &quot;a story that has been passed down for generations, especially one that is presented as history but is unlikely to be true; a popular myth that has arisen in modern times&quot; you'd have a fairer assessment of John Lennon than EMI can possibly have intended. If ever a man's achievement has been blown out of all proportion then John Lennon's surely has, mostly because he did the decent rock 'n' roll thing and got shot. It's better to burn out than to fade away, you see.<br />This isn't to say that Lennon wasn't a collossal figure in the history of rock 'n' roll; only a clown would dispute that. But, by dint of their longevity, neither Paul McCartney nor George Martin achieved anything like Lennon's status, yet on any sensible assessment of the evidence they're entitled to be seen in exactly the same light. They, equally, were the Beatles. (Yeah, I know - and George Harrison was pretty cool too.) If ever the Lennon Legend may have been justified, then it was for his part of the Beatles trinity.<br />Nevertheless, this collection features no Beatles material. It is two thirds Lennon's songs in the five years between the Beatles' dissolution and his &quot;retirement&quot; from rock 'n' roll in 1975, and a third from that peculiar comeback-cum-post mortem effort, Double Fantasy.  For the most part, the reputed genius is hard to spot. Suckers, of which there are millions, fete &quot;Imagine&quot; as one of the pinnacles of achievement in twentieth century popular culture. It's a haunting tune, but the only pinnacle reached by its sentiment is that of hypocrisy. &quot;Imagine no possessions,&quot; sings John, captured on film behind a white steinway concert grand, in the hangar-like drawing room of his stately English Manor. And how could the same man sing with a straight face about the world living as one and on the same album deliver a hatred-infused open letter to Paul McCartney in the form of &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;. A petite failure in the self-awareness department, non?  Then again, genius and a lack of self awareness often go hand in hand. &quot;Mother&quot;, also hardly an exhortation for a love-in, stands as a bruising piece of self-dissection, but sits awkwardly with Lennon's famously distant relationship with his own son, Julian. (Given how enthusiastic he was in cashing in on his famous Dad, it's a wonder Lennon Jr. didn't record a song called &quot;Father&quot;.)<br />Where Lennon does earn some his legendary status, though, is the material from Double Fantasy. It's a shame it gets written off nowadays as simply a sentimental favourite. It was more than that: five years away from the game instilled in Lennon the faculty self-criticism so obviously lacking from his earlier work, and the result is a record completely at home with itself. But it's not the earth-shattering stuff that comprised Revolver or Rubber Soul. It's a guy in his dotage, which turned out to be drastically short.  So &quot;Legend&quot; is a unwittingly perspicacious title. But it is still a great sample of John Lennon, and as every collection should have some Lennon in it, it has to come recommended.tney in the form of &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;. A petite failure in the self-awareness department, non?

It was more than that: five years away from the game instilled in Lennon the faculty self-criticism so obviously lacking from his earlier work, and the result is a record completely at home with itself. But it's not the earth-shattering stuff that comprised Revolver or Rubber Soul. It's a guy in his dotage, which turned out to be drastically short.   So &quot;Legend&quot; is a unwittingly perspicacious title. But it is still a great sample of John Lennon, and as every collection should have some Lennon in it, it has to come recommended.
B000051VQR|5.0|when i first heard this cd i was impressed. the more you hear it the more it grows on you. infectious through from warning to macy day's holiday this album brims with spiky punk pop. a classic
B00004TFK3|4.0|Dolby Digital 5.1 makes me feel like I'm in the film. When the little weapon blast a truck, BOOM from front channel and back channel...I really love it. Mixing comedy, action, great simulation. You won't be dissapointed.
B000056K04|4.0|It's really unfortunate that I don't care too much for their Britney Spears remake &quot;I Did it&quot;.  &quot;Oops, I did it again&quot;  Anyway, I have all of Dave Matthews other album's, but I almost didn't purchase this one because I really didn't care for the single.  But I'm glad I did buy it, it really is the next step for the band.  I think the evolution of Dave Matthews Band's sound has been phenomenal, linear, and intuitive.  If you liked their later works, I really believe you will like this album especially after a few listens.  I do hope their next album slows down a little though, I miss their more accoustic, slower sounds.<br />&quot;When the World Ends&quot; - This is probably my favorite song on the CD right now (although I'm sure that will change eventually).  This is almost like two songs.  One song and then his bigger, older brother, interwoven into two by the careful hands of Dave Matthews.<br />&quot;The Space Between&quot; - Just beautfiul musicianship on this song.  Smooth and sensible.  Maybe he consulted Adam Duritz of Counting Crows for some ideas on this one.<br />&quot;Angel&quot; - Likely their next single.  Very cool sound, the slowest song on the album will be enjoyed by most of their fans.  This songs lyrics contain the same beautiful poetry you have come to love about his love songs.<br />&quot;Fool to Think&quot; - This song I'm not quite sure how I feel about it.  It's kind of like a 1980's and 21st century blend.  It's synth. sound he choose that is strange to me, but it's still a good track.<br />&quot;Mother Father&quot; - Just an interesting thought, and another great track.<br />The final statement is you are likely another person who already owns all of Dave Matthews Band's CD's and you are trying to figure out whether to buy this one or not.  I really believe that you should.  However, if you are a new Dave fan I would recomend picking up Crash and/or Under the Table first.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Sex and the City is one of my favorite shows, but I didn't get HBO until the whole first season was over. Thanks to this collection, I get to see the whole season whenever I want- without having to wait a week between episodes. If you are a fan of Sex and the City, then there's no question that it is worth it to buy/rent this collection of the first 12 episodes-- you get to see the ones you missed (or see your favorites again), whichever one you want, whenever you want. If you love the show, then just go ahead and get the whole thing on DVD- it's worth it.
B00004RF83|5.0|Yes, with the right ingredients, it could.  All those military coups going on in other countries and all the unrest in the world, you can easily assert...yes, it could happen here.  The unthinkable dread of a military takeover.  SEVEN DAYS IN MAY is more than a great film.  It is a reminder for us to take a minute and be thankful that a takeover hasn't happened here and hope such an event won't take place.
B000002HAF|5.0|Wow...I can hardly find words for this album!  The Pixies were one of the most brilliant bands to ever have graced the rock scene throughout most of history.  Sadly, many people have never even heard of them, yet they were major influences for most of the rock bands today.<br />If you want to buy ANY Pixies album, GET THIS ONE.  There is never a dull moment in any song, from the first to the last, the eerie yelps and screams of Frank Black accentuating the melodic and almost hypnotizing musical craziness.  The songs ROCK, and are so catchy, that it's almost hard to believe that the album is so good!  Usually you don't find such catchy melodies in such eclectic songwriting.  It's a find and a keeper FOR SURE.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I only have a few words to say other than ADDICTIVE.To all you idiotic knot haters you should be grateful that a band this heavy is taking it to primetime baby.shoving it up MTVS AS* and yours.people only hate them because their jealous of their originality and TALENT especially the vocals and DRUMS.people of all metal love should UNITE to bring down the hammer on the crap that MTV is shovin down our throats.I can tell all you RETRO&lt;RAP&lt;BLACKMETAL&lt;TRUEMETAL&lt;POWER METAL(or flower metal hm) that WE are slipknot and we aint going anywhere except deep inside you.SLIPKNOT is the future of metal call it what you will.LIMP BIZKIT aint.  BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR NEW SLIPKNOT  MUSIC REAL SOON.Then all you non believers will realize what just put the smackdown on your town.....
B000001EAQ|5.0|Sorry for all lovers of &quot;all you can't leave behind&quot;, but this albums is sooo much better. Lyrics that dig deeper in the human soul with haunting rhythms and dark music. It's chilling. It's far from happy-go-lucky stuff. It hurts. It confuses. IT'S GREAT ! The new album is flat, superficial and thus for the majority of people. Give me Pop.
B000002KGT|5.0|I have to agree with Scott from Australia. We are overdue for a remaster of this classic album. I'm actually quite surprised that a gold-disc was never made for this - when you consider that there was one made for The Eagles &quot;Hotel California&quot;, would only seem right that this masterpiece would be given the same honor. This is an album that will stand the test of time and never get old - it's just that good, always will be. It's high-time the Fleetwood Mac fans got what they have been waiting for - it's time to do this album right ..... it's time for a remaster.
0375703764|5.0|The people who gave this novel only one star make me laugh.  They are describing the exact reason why this book should be read and why I enjoyed it.  Was it work? Well, yes but it was also a lot of fun.  Read this novel to be challenged, frightened, intrigued, and entertained.  This is a truly amazing and unique piece of work.
B000002L9J|5.0|This is the best album of the very best group to ever walk the face of the earth. Unsurpassed vocals, lyrics and (beautifully jangly) guitars make &quot;TQID&quot; pop music's equivalent to the Mona Lisa, Shakespeare's complete works..<br />   You see how so many reviewers mention parallels between this album and their lives? That's because Morrissey sings about being human, loving, losing, mocking stupidity and surviving-- no mindless schlock or pompous emptiness here. So, if you want beauty and intelligence at once, congratulations: you've found it.<br />   As a closing suggestion, see if you can discover what &quot;Some Girls are Bigger Than Others&quot; is about; Morrissey spoke about it in interviews, and it may surprise you.
B000000ORX|5.0|Joni Mitchell's work is a stream of loving art, art that actually loves. 'Night Ride Home' is an imcomparable CD, easily on a par with 'Dog Eat Dog', 'Turbulent Indigo', and 'Blue'.  Mitchell's musicianship is like a night watchman, faithful and rare and so adeptly attuned.  Everything she touches, when she really touches it, becomes the gold of our lifetimes.  On this disc all the tracks are little wonders; title track, 'Come In From the Cold', 'Passion Play', and 'Only Joy In Town' are as fine as anything Mitchell's written.  Her musical art is so subtle, it gets overlooked, but so what!  Musicians know who and what she is, and what is genius.  That's too hearty a word for her layers of gifts, too rough a praise, but you get the picture... I was listening to the string ideas in the back of 'Two Grey Rooms' driving down the hill tonight-- what an almost Bert Kaempfert feel.  I thought who IS this woman, really? and how is it that her art is so fulsome, and plain wonderful?  Check out this CD and get some light for the night.
B00003CXP1|1.0|So we have another 'harrowing' film about drug addiction.  Yeah we all know a small percentage of users end up completely destroying themselves.  Yes, long term use of stimulants like diet pills and amphetamines leads to temporary psychosis.  Let's see some films about the long, successful lives many addicts lead and here's a radical idea - how about showing the reality that the majority of drug users live long, happy, fullfilled lives? The movie is well acted and well executed, but it is a pretense and a distortion of reality which would be fine if it was openly so.
B00000I8BX|3.0|This was my first fear factory CD, and it was enough of a taste I feel to decide on whether or not I want to buy anymore. The answer is no.<br />I was originally under the impression that Fear Factory had some Industrial roots. This is not so. Putting some faint computer blips with a filter in the background does not make a song Industrial.<br />There is nothing &quot;must have&quot; about the new songs on this limited edition, and Messiah and Concreto are practically the same song with different tempos.<br />My worst gripe about this CD however is the fact that at best when the singer is really screaming his lungs out, he sounds like he is wretching, and when he tries to be melodic he sounds like wakko warner from the animaniacs (Especially on the track timeless).<br />Just because the singer has a really bad cold I shouldn't dis any of the music though. For example, Timeless is an excellent song. It would have made a great instrumental, however it sounds to me like somebody forgot to tap on the singer's shoulder to remind him that he's singing a bit out of tune.<br />Which is true for about all of his melodic songs. He just sort of wails pathetically trying to hit the notes..
0792846303|5.0|I only have one comment.  Why is this film, (John Carpenter's 2nd best film - Halloween is #1 of course), NOT available on DVD?  PLEASE!  We are officially asking the powers that be - give this great film the DVD treatment it deserves...
B000000OU0|5.0|as a former musician this album is as good as it gets and I have played with the likes of chicago,grand funk,steppenwolf and many more.have even been around when joe walsh came out with the james gang.this is top shelf Eagles perfection,not to say other albums don't rate,quite contrary,each have their own distinct sounds but this is extra ordinary.whether you have others or seen live this CD is a keeper for sure.my efforts to percieve this kind of sound with my own band fell short.not by much but no cigar.this is most definately a must have for every music lover or enthusist.I listen to it anytime almost anywhere.Put simply:ITS GREAT
B00004SU5J|5.0|Listen, I just feel compelled to add my thoughts on this fantastic album.  Ludovic Navarre, on this sophomore effort, has brought himself and his musicans into a realm of real improvisational jazz without abandoning or weakening any aspect of his elec-tech house sound he became popular with.  The musicians are indeed ALL very talented and moderately exploratory.  The jazz and acid jazz purists may have problems with it on either sides, but this is only because they are not ready for it. Truly, this album is a fantastic example (of which there sadly are few) of the incorporation of two continents of music; here, jazz is given primacy but not to the detriment or exclusion of intelligent house grooves. People, the jazz of this last century is fundamental, but this is something altogether new, fresh, and now. It just pleases me that l. navarre has recorded this, frozen it (although it is no doubt alive), and documented it for generations to come. One can only hope others take the initiative to push jazz in such new and rewarding directions in the near future.
015626224X|3.0|I had to read five books for our English lessions. One of these books was George Orwell's &quot;Down and out in Paris and London&quot;. I already read his book &quot;1984&quot; and saw the play of &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. I really liked &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. &quot;Down and out in Paris and London&quot; couldn't reach the expectations I had after knowing the plot of the two other books. But the story was okay and the book was easy to read. The book became more interesting when I heard that Orwell shall have written about himself in it.

B000002KKX|5.0|At the time of this recording, the unphotogenic Cross was bearded and overweight -- hence the appearance of his flamingo logo on the cover, and not a single photo of the artist to be found.<br />But the music itself is glorious, and brings back memories of a wonderful holiday on the West Coast in 1980.  In a way, this album is the FM-friendly face of Steely Dan.  Many of the Dan's most illustrious session musicians appear on this debut, among them Michael McDonald, Larry Carlton, Chuck Findley and Vic Feldman.  And the whole album is produced by Michael Omartian -- he of the gorgeous Bosendorfer piano sound on KATY LIED.  This sound is brought back for the album's stand-out single, 'Ride Like the Wind'.<br />But the music is more pop than Steely Dan's.  It was in many ways the natural successor to Fleetwood Mac's RUMOURS.  If a US household owned one of those albums, then it usually owned the other too.<br />Cross never really took off over here, in the UK.  But that was entirely our loss.  This is a one-off classic.
B000002H97|4.0|When I started listening to Metallica, the Black Album is probably the first one that I bought.  Metallica has put a ton of good songs on this one, including Nothing Else Matters, Enter Sandman, and The Unforgiven, but some of the other songs sucked. For example, songs like Don't Tread on Me just didn't measure up to the quality of the other songs.  Sure, I liked this one well enough; however, it just doesn't compare to some of thier other stuff.  Definately worth buying if you like Metallica, but not quite five stars
B0000042MY|5.0|I play this soundtrack when I want to dive into an otherwise boring piece of work.  The tempo is fast, the music is loud, and the tone is  urgent.  Listening to the piece is like swallowing a shot of espresso: The music quickens your pulse  and sets you on the edge of your chair.  <br />Last of the Mohicans is great background music  for gearing yourself up to seize the moment --  even if the moment in question happens to be  9:05 on Monday morning, and the activity happens  to be paying your taxes.  Reading between the drumbeats, one comes away with a clear message: Hurry!  You're almost out of time!<br />I agree with previous Amazon.com reviewers that  this is one of the ten best soundtracks of all time.  I rank it up there with Michael Nyman's The Piano, Ennio Morricone's The Mission and Zimmer &amp; Gerrard's Gladiator.
080017948X|5.0|This is a perfect movie. One of my favorite line in this movie is, &quot;How do you know there is a tomorrow, there wasn't one today?&quot;. That line says it all. Bill Murray is stuck in Groundhog day and must come to terms with all his fault before he can get out. Andie McDowell is so beautiful in this movie, she act as the trophy at the end. This movie is a must see. It has everything, humor, tribulation, &amp; heart.
B000002G89|5.0|As with most of Clapton's albums, this has a good mix of blues and rock. The only thing that I can really say that is disappointing about these Clapton remasters, is that, unlike other remastered classics, we get no bonus tracks of any kind. I am sure that most fans would have wanted something extra to get their teeth into. And as a marketing move, it's a way for record companies to get true blue fans to fork out the money to replace their older copies if they are to get extra previously unreleased tracks. Maybe I should apply for a job there! But, that aside, this is a great album in true Clapton style. 3 songs are Clapton originals, and of course there is the Bob Marley hit &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; which introduced a lot of people to the reggae sound. Not a weak song on this album, but then again, this is a Clapton album. Recommended!
080017948X|5.0|This is one of those movies that I watched once and thought, &quot;Jeez, that was fun.&quot; I watched it again with some friends and caught all sorts of extra things. Each time I watch it, it gets funnier and funnier!<br />You have the take the whole thing as a fun campy movie. Bill Murray is great as his character goes from egocentric weatherman to caring individual. Sure, this bizarre timewarp just &quot;appears&quot;. Sure, much of Bill's motivation to change is that he just wants to escape the warp, not that he (at least initially) really cares about the people he's helping. But it's all in fun, and the bizarre things that go on are hilarious.<br />There isn't any great redemption in the movie, or mystic message ... it's simply a lot of fun to watch, to catch all the subtle ways things change as the day continually loops back into itself for Bill. If you ever feel like you're stuck in a rut, this is the perfect movie to help you laugh your way out!
B000002BFL|5.0|A lot of people were maybe disappointed with this album from the Boss. Well, it may not be like his previous albums, but that does not make it a bad thing. This is an album of depth and beauty. Of life and death, and everything in between. Many songs on here feature just Bruce's voice and guitar and/or keyboard. These are songs in the true folk style, that tell of how life is. And  something that Bruce has always done, is tell a story. This time around though, it's done in a quieter, more introspective way. A great album to sit back and relax to. The 12 page booklet comes with lyrics and a couple of photos. A meaningful album, and in my opinion, one of his best.
6305736650|5.0|I've got this on DVD and every once in a while I pop it in to spend an evening remembering why it is so incredibly special. The characters in it are as fresh now as when I first saw it, and their struggles are just as meaningful. You watch Rick go from a wry lover to a jaded man who tries to pretend nothing matters any more. Ilsa is torn between loyalty to the man who taught her to be a woman and her passionate love for Rick, who makes her feel like one. Every character has strong motivations, and is acted superbly.<br />The black and white might be a drawback in other movies, but here the use of shadows is amazing. The textures and depths come alive under the masterful hands of the cinematographer. <br />The DVD has a 'making of' which goes into a lot of the background and techniques, and also explains why the dialogue is so amazing. At least three sets of people worked on it, each adding in their own talents to make the romance real, the conversations an intellectual chess game, and the tensions high.  They wrote it as they went, altering the dialogue to match the characters, so they were almost developed 'live' as the movie progressed. <br />In the end, I think what appeals to me the most is that Rick made a tough decision to do what he thought was 'right' instead of what would be best for him personally. He had to send his love off with another man, knowing that it was the best thing he could do. Ilsa had to choose between two men that she loved for very different reasons. It's an amazing film about responsibility and maturity in difficult conditions, and one I will gladly watch over and over again.
6305280711|4.0|The second sequel to &quot;Die Hard&quot; takes a setting to urban California where Bruce Willis stars alongside Samuel L. Jackson, an easy-going businessman who renders to volunteer his services to assist John McClane(Willis) in stopping a Russian psychopath. <br /> &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; gives us a much more enjoyable nonstop actionfest. It was fun to watch Jackson and Willis flailing around frantically, saving not only their own necks, but the city's, too. Jeremy Irons portrays the Russian criminal, out for revenge and looking to settle a score. The Russian acts by way of telephone mostly, playing games with McClane and his partner, giving them math problems and all sorts of goodies that reveal how to stop explosions. Action sequences in this are top of the line; seeing Willis race with time instead of another person is enjoyable. The only major flaw was the accent of Jeremy Irons, which didn't strike a chord as a villain, nor did it sound sincere. Despite that, this is a real fun action/adventure caper to watch.
0790749815|5.0|This is definitely a DVD to have and to rewatch with friends and family. The story is familiar - a man is mistaken for a spy and has to get out of the mess without dying - but the acting and scenes are fresh and stunning. <br />It's pretty sexual for a film of its time - Roger has been married many times and has no qualms about seducing the beautiful young woman on the train. Not that she needs seducing - in the original version she meets him while eating, and says that she wants to finish dinner because she doesn't like to make love on an empty stomach. Not too bad for a first date!<br />The crop-dusting scene is famous and much-copied, as are several other scenes. It's the interpersonal relationships where this movie shines, though. The jealousy of the two men who both love Eva, the way that James' henchman is fond of him (and jealous of Eva) ... there are romantic pentagons in this film, never mind triangles. <br />The special features on the DVD are well worth watching, giving extra insight into the characters and the way the movie was made. Grab a copy for your home, and another for a friend as a present! It's a movie that you'll find something new in each time you watch it.
B00003CXDV|5.0|To me, this is one of the best comedies ever made, especially if you laugh at the fanaticism that Star Trek fans have.  This is both and homage to Trekkies and a joke made at them.  The cast is perfect and the acting is top notch by everyone, especially Sigourney Weaver as an aging sex bomb from the show with a hilarious job on the show.  However, the best character is Guy, or Cremember 6, who died on show in Episode 82.  He's damn funny when scary situations come up and some of his lines just make you laugh out loud.  The story is quite good for this type of fish-out-of water film, and the cast plays it well.<br />The CGI effects used in the film are quite good, but they never overshadow the actors or the story.  Most of the dialogue is right on track and the supporting cast is very funny, especially the aliens who model themselves after the humans.  They're incredibly funny to watch as they try to walk, talk, and act like humans.<br />If you like comedy with a satirical background, this film is definitely for you.  It's funny, smart, and quite touching at points, and you'll want to get every single one of your Trekkie friends to watch it with you so they can see how big of idiots they look at times.
0061092037|1.0|I consider every minute I spent trying to get into this book a waste of time.
B00004RJ74|4.0|From Dusk Till Dawn is a true genre breaker.  Right when you think that it's gonna keep going as a southern-style action film, it switches gears into a gore filled vampire adventure.<br />Robert Rodriguez shows that he is a truly brilliant filmmaker who knows when to change camera angles and quick cuts.  The entire film has a sense of urgency thanks to the fast pacing and off-kilter tone, and Tarantino's script is witty and full of great lines.  Every single actor seems to be having a great time with their respective parts, even though many are just fast, almost cameo appearances.  The movie is so incredibly well-paced that the two hour running time flies by and you're wondering where the time went.  The makeup and gore effects are some of the best in modern horror films because of how large and extravagent they are.  Every frame after the halway point is filled with gore and violence, and it works well because it is not too disgusting.  The violence happens to bad people, so you don't feel bad about watching it, which usually drags down current action fare.<br />George Clooney is brilliant in the part, mostly because you can see how much fun he is having by stepping out of his good-doctor part from ER and his boy scout Army officer from The Peacemaker.  Tarantino is pretty bad in his role, and someone should honestly tell him that he's not a good actor.  Harvey Keitel, however, chews up each scene he's in because of his intensity, which somehow seems to make his preacher character a little fake at first, but you still believe it because you like Harvey so damn much.  In my opinion, Juliet Lewis is wasted, mostly because her role is underwritten.  Her dialogue is strong, but not really engaging, so it detracts from her performance, which is still decent.<br />Overall, this is a great, fun horror/adventure movie with a few small twists and lots of humorous dialogue.  Each character has some sort of charisma that you like and Rodriguez's editing and camera work is almost genius.  If this film is truly a glimpse into the zombie movie of his near future, that one will be great.
B000002OTL|4.0|After seeing Pulp Fiction, it was almost immediately one of my favorite movies of all time, due to many factors. One of these factors is the music in the film, which completes the movie in every way possible. The opening scene with the diner robbery would be dull and unoriginal without the movie's theme song &quot;Misirlou&quot; performed by Dick Dale &amp; His Del-Tones. Also, the pawn shop ../escape scene would be incomplete if not for &quot;Comanche&quot; and &quot;Surf Rider&quot; performed by The Lively Ones does everything to finish off the movie.<br />This soundtrack is mostly made up of great surf music and 70's tunes, all mixed in with the most memorable dialogue scenes from the movie. The fast-paced guitars in &quot;Misirlou&quot; are a great way to start it off, and &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; is an excellent follow-up. Classic instrumental songs such as &quot;Bullwinkle Part II&quot; and &quot;Comanche&quot; add to the genius put behind this soundtrack. And, as said before, surf music makes up a good chunk of the album. &quot;Surf Rider&quot; and &quot;Bustin' Surfboards&quot; are among the most memorable. Putting on the final musical touches are classic soul songs such as &quot;Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon&quot;, which is Urge Overkill's awesome cover of a Neil Diamond song, Ricky Nelson's &quot;Lonesome Town&quot;, &quot;Flowers On The Wall&quot; by The Statler Brothers, and Dusty Springfield's &quot;Son Of A Preacher Man&quot;.<br />As said before, dialogue also makes up a lot of this soundtrack. The opening diner robbery, the &quot;Zed's Dead, Baby&quot; portion, Jules talking about how personality goes a long way, and the ever-memorable &quot;Ezekial 25:17&quot; are unforgettable scenes from the film included here. But the best by far is the &quot;Royale With Cheese&quot; dialogue.<br />The only thing left to cover is the question of why I praise this soundtrack so highly but only gave it 4 stars. It's only due to one song, which is &quot;If Love Is ARed Dress (Hang Me In Rags)&quot; by Maria McKee. Although it's not necessarily a bad song, and is probably well-liked by many listeners, it seems very out of place with the rest of the songs on the soundtrack.<br />Don't jump to conclusions about buying this soundtrack just because of the positive reviews you read though. Be sure to see the movie first, seeing as the dialogue and the mood of this soundtrack tie in perfectly with it. If you like the movie, you're more than likely the enjoy the soundtrack.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I must begin this review on my knees before the Sony Gods by saying \\"Yay, it is great!\\" Sony being the company they are has had the genius to make a memory card that can hold virtually all of your games (or a heck of a lot more than the old ones used to!) The PS2 is a monster for memory, and this little card does this trick with 8 fat MB of memory to store everthing from Armored Core to SSX, and then some. It is also much faster than the original and allocates the memory in a much more efficient manner, saving considerable amounts of time and space. Never have I had a glitch from a sony product, and this card is no exception - error-free and I have already packed it with saved games of everything PS2 I own (with over 6MB still remaining!). Yes, you could buy an off-brand, but why risk it? This will certainly satisfy your needs for quite a while before you must buy another, and the quality products that Sony makes are well worth the extra $$. And by-the-way, you cannot store PS2 games on the old PSX memory cards, no matter what people try and tell you!
0553275976|5.0|Tom Wolfe, an eloquent, if sometimes pessimistic, writer who deeply understands modern culture, wrote this massive, classic tale of greed, ambition and power. He casts the story of financier Sherman McCoy in the financial world of Wall Street, but includes the racial, political and economic issues of New York City in the early 1980s. Even 13 years after its publication date, this is still a gripping read. You can use this book as the starting point for reading about business culture from a fictionalized perspective. Or, you can combine it with Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker and The New New Thing, for insight from fact and fiction into the major episodes of greed and economic boom in the past 20 years. This undeclared trilogy examines the desire - not confined to Americans, though the books are U.S.-based - to achieve wealth at any cost. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book, all by itself, as a seminal volume in business fiction.

Never have I had a glitch from a sony product, and this card is no exception - error-free and already packed with saved games of everything PS2 I own (with over 6MB still remaining!).  Yes, you could buy an off-brand, but why risk it?  This will certainly satisfy your needs for quite a while before you must buy another, and the quality products that Sony makes are well worth the extra $$.
B000035P7S|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites! It should be required viewing for everyone - it deals with a lot of complex racial issues that are (unfortunately) still around 44 years later.  It proves that love doesn't know a color or a race.  Marlon Brandon was excellent in this film as well as the entire supporting cast - especially Red Buttons - his character's ultimate sacrifice for the love he so believed in. Excellent love story.
6302797586|5.0|My wife and I watched QB VII when it was on tv years ago, and have looked for it in video stores unsuccessfully.  We have told our now-grown children about this classic that introduced us to Anthony Hopkins, and we would love to own it.  But the price is outrageous!  We're watching Ebay-- but would love to see this available to a much wider audience.
B00003CX8J|4.0|As far as bringing comic books/games to the screen, this has to be the best so far. The filming, sound and acting are great. The only reason I feel I did not give it 5 stars is that I just finished watching \\"The Perfect Storm\\" the same day...and the acting does not compare... But if you like reading the X-men comic, you must have this film. The DVD gives you a lot of extras. And for a comic book, there is a very good story line. Wolverine's creation seems to need its own movie. Everyone else is born a mutant.... Of course the comic book as is the movie, is a statement on how the majority treats minorities they do not understand.
B000000W5L|5.0|Alright, some pillock called the Stones 'limited' and mocked them for using Berry derived riffs. Then he says that they couldn't make groundbreaking music like Floyd or the Beatles. TRANSLATION : THE STONES WEREN'T PRETENTIOUS. Well frankly I'm glad there was a band that didn't inject boring clocks and inane gibberish in their music! They wrote straight up good time music, and worked within their limitations to produce the best rock songs ever. The Beatles are a bloody pop group!!! Lennon could never pull off sounding dirty like Jagger did. The only thing LIMITED around here is that blokes musical taste.    'Exile' IS rock and roll. Like it or lump it, this album manages to sound dirtier and heavier than any heavy metal album, while remaining blues based. (Sorry Zeppelin were NOT that bluesy!!) Honestly I'm sick of Beatles comparisons. WEIRDER and more offbeat, does NOT mean better. It simply means more pretentious.
B00003CXE7|5.0|A friend told me not to waste my time watching this. Boy, was he wrong. I bought the DVD here from Amazon and have watched everything on the DVD within 2 days. Yes I even watched the movies with commentary. I loved it. WOW! From the great Battles of the Roman Legions in Germania to Morocco and then Rome. What an Epic. I felt like I was there...And no where is their a part where you feel you want to pause the movie. It is a non-stop watcher. You must see this...
B00004R99K|4.0|I am a fan of both Lewis Carroll and Disney, and as such, I can appreciate the merits of both the literary classic, and the animated adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. True, 'Alice' is not your typical Disney fare, and it is weak in being episodic and rather disjointed. Still, the film remains a colorful, tuneful, funny, high-paced, VERY imaginative rendering of Carroll's classic. The studio merged elements from both 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass' and some may object to the omission of certain characters. But the film succeeds on many levels, particularly the wonderful voice characterizations! I adore The March Hare and Mad Hatter, the Queen and King of Hearts, The Caterpillar and the talking flowers in particular. Adapting the verbal humor of the book to film was no easy feat, but considering the challenges, the movie holds up very well. I found the new DVD splendid, particularly the extras! Great fun to see the old Black/White films with Walt Disney, Kathryn Beaumont and Edgar Bergen. As for the film itself, the remastered color is amazing and the animation wonderful, particularly in Alice's facial expressions and human characteristics. I think the film is one of the best versions made and far underappreciated!

B000056K04|5.0|As a Scottish person, we don't hear much of the Dave Matthews Band in Scotland so this purchase was a stab in the dark.  However, it paid off.  Dave Matthews combines the sound of the Counting Crows with a band that likes to rock.  This album is so easy to listen to.  Every song on it makes me more likely to buy the old stuff of Dave Matthews and find out where it came from.  The 3 best songs on this album are &quot;Everyday&quot;, &quot;The space between&quot; and &quot;Fool to think&quot;.  A must buy by far.
B000000WZ4|5.0|&quot;Ultra&quot; catches Depeche Mode in the crosshairs of the gun, focusing on their greatest strengths. &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; is a gritty, coffee-grits, nails-on-the-chalkboard, grinding song which makes you want to grit your teeth and eat sandpaper. I love it. &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Insight&quot; are two of Depeche Mode's best songs ever. This CD is Depeche Mode beyond their maturity and into their wisdom, and its very impressive.
B000002P86|5.0|This is another fantastic way to experience one of the best musicians of all the times!This cd shows why B.B. King is considered the &quot;King of the Blues&quot;!And what another musical rythm put all of that great musicians together??Only the BLUES!!! We must hear this cd entirely many,many times!This music renew our souls and sentiments with rare intensity!! The participation of all the piano players  here is fantastic.Dr. John;Jools Holland;and the marvellous,fantastic presence of Jon Cleary,the best piano player still in activity!!! All of the other artists are representatives of what's the modern music best produced the past century!!A must have, not only for bluesfans!All of the people that enjoy rare musical moments need to purchase it too!!
B00000IPAX|5.0|I LOVED 'Cheshire Cat'.  I LOVED 'Dude Ranch'. I LOVED 'Enema'.  I'm not a punk fan.  I'm not a pop fan.  I'm a fan of Blink-182...And will be as long as they make goofy albums that keep you rockin' from start to finish.  If you've been thinkin' about buying this CD, go ahead.  Make up your own mind.
B000056N8X|4.0|To enjoy the Highlander movies you have to forget about Highlander 2, and call it a bizarre mistake. Highlander 3 went back to the original synopsis that &quot;There can only be one&quot; (immortal) in the world, and the series once again did away with that idea. Doesn't make much sense, but trust me - Highlander : Endgame, delivers. The action sequences have greatly improved. Adrian Paul gets the best of those whilst Chris Lambert walks in and out of scenes seemingly aware that his highlanding days are nearing an end. The plot is pretty much the same as ever - one nasty Immortal wants to kill all the others, but this time two immortals must team up if they are to defeat him. The scene is set for a fantastic series of action pieces with our heroes doing battle through the centuries. Paul and Lambert work well together. Fans of the series will note that Stan Kitsch character makes NO appearance. Overall the plot isn't great, but as a mixture of swords and sorcery, H : E is terrific fun - albeit more gory than previous outings. If you enjoyed the first Highlander, I think you'll find this compares favourably indeed. In fact I actually prefer this latest, and last, chapter in the Highlander legacy.
B000050XEI|5.0|When I was ten years old, my family and I went on a vacation up the coast and through the woods of Oregon and Washington.  All through our journey, there was this mystical, breath-taking music floating through our car.  The haunting melodies seemed to be written for the landscapes we were seeing-- waves crashing on the sand, yellow and purple sunsets.  Over the years, I would remember that vacation and that music, but I never would find out who was performing the music or where the tape was that my mother played in our car.  Three years later, I was in a dance recital.  The opening song of the show was &quot;Storms in Africa II.&quot;  I can't even begin to describe that performance and how beautiful the dancing was.  But to this day, I don't think it was the dancing so much... it was the MUSIC.  I ended up discovering &quot;Watermark&quot; in a pile of cassettes, two years later, when I was fifteen.  I put the connection together-- the music I heard at the recital and in the car was the same alluring music.  There I was, introduced to &quot;Watermark.&quot;  And what was I?  One word.  Hooked.  And suddenly, out comes &quot;A Day Without Rain.&quot;  Enchanting!  I am getting sick and tired of reviewers saying that Enya has done nothing new!  Come on, people, what do you want her to be singing... Britney's &quot;Stronger&quot; or what???  Enya has her own distinct style.  She sounds like very few singers in the music industry.  That's what makes her so charming-- both as a human being and as a musician.  She doesn't sound like a &quot;copy cat&quot; of some other artist.  I must admit, some of the songs on &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; have a very similar sound to some of the previous albums.  But who cares!  These songs are new.  Appreciate Enya for who she is and her unique style-- please don't critize every little thing she does wrong on each album!  The best song, in my opinion, on the album is &quot;Only Time.&quot;  Words can not express what this song doesto me.  I listen to it every morning to start off my day.  My next two favorites are &quot;One By One&quot; and &quot;Wild Child.&quot;  My least favorite would have to be &quot;Tempus Vernum.&quot;  It has that totally mystical charm, but I prefer the more happy songs (with a strong percussion) from Enya such as &quot;Wild Child&quot; and the previous sounds of songs like &quot;Storms in Africa,&quot;(&quot;Watermark&quot;) &quot;Carribean Blue&quot; (&quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;), and &quot;On My Way Home&quot; (&quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;).  Good work, Enya, on a job well done.  If you have been debating whether or not to buy this album, please go out and get it!  You won't be disappointed.  I wouldn't be surprised if you, too, will soon become another &quot;obsessed Enya fan.&quot;
B00000896R|5.0|Released by EMI Records, Ltd. except the U.S. and Canada by Hollywood Records.  Brian May makes it on his own on this solo outing.  My favourite song on here is \\"Wilderness\\".  My least favourite is \\"Slow Down\\".
B00000JY1X|4.0|I'll write a very short review because long ones always tend to be 90% rhetoric and silly anecdotes you don't really care about. So, there are just a couple of things that you need to know about this (marvelous) record:<br />1)It's great so buy it!<br />2)yes, there are fillers. You don't expect a three cds-work to be without, do you? Still most of the tracks are great and even the fillers are not bad at all...<br />3)Stephin Merritt is a genius (by the way, he's the guy behind the Magnetic fields moniker...)<br />4)You can buy each of the three cds separately. It would be a shame but you're free to do as you please...<br />5)did I mention the fact that you should buy it? ;-)
0446608955|2.0|I read The Notebook several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I found it to be a touching story of long love.  Though A Walk to Remember was an easy, quick read, it was less than believable.  The characters were superficial and I found it depressing as well as unlikely that Landon would have spent the rest of his life alone.  I'd be reluctant to read another of Mr. Sparks' books.
B000056N8X|2.0|Being a tremendous fan of the first Highlander film (especially as a Queen worshipper and follower of Sean Connery)The sequals have all been a disappointment, this one in particular.  I was hoping that this film could sort out the timelines throughout the series, but no, they have caused even more confusion - where on earth do the Canopy and the explanation about Aliens from Outer Space ideas fit in - and at that time where was Duncan?. Did they shoot the Continuity Director at the end of the first film? Haven't the writers and production teams seen the previous movies? If you don't try to connect this film with any of the others then it may have deservered 3 stars, but from someone who likes to make sense of a story, it was lucky to get 2.
B0000067L4|5.0|The song &quot;I'm So Glad&quot; alone makes this Cream's most important album.<br />On the subject of Cream everyobdy always says Clapton, Clapton, Clapton, but what made Cream great was Jack Bruce and his invention of a unique free-form flavor of rock music that exploded the song conventions of the mid sixties.  Bruce studied classical music at university until he was driven to drop out by the narrow-mindedness of his teachers.  But in school he learned a love of Bach's use of multiple melodies working in counterpoint--which led to the three-ring circus effect in Cream's music of Bruce playing interesting, dramatic, creative bass lines underneath Clapton's guitar solos, while Ginger Baker did interesting things on the drums.<br />Jack Bruce and Cream drummer Ginger Baker were also students of the free-form jazz and rock invented in the U.S. in the late 1950s and in the 60s.  They followed Ornette Coleman (see the album Friends and Neighbors--it came out later but it was the culmination of Coleman's &quot;Free Jazz&quot; style); they also listened to the Grateful Dead (who were influenced by Ornette Coleman as well--check out the Dead's Blues for Allah as well as &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen&quot;).  Cream influenced Miles Davis's free-form style (Miles's best stuff in this genre was on Live Evil and also On the Corner; it started with In A Silent Way and then Bitches Brew).<br />Clapton was a great musician but for him it's been downhill since this album Goodbye.  Before Cream was started, Clapton was in John Mayall's blues band (check out the wonderful Blues Breakers album), and Mayall made Clapton practise for 8 hours a day, which make him simply an assassin on the guitar.  When Clapton joined Jack Bruce, who persuaded him to use his expert playing in a free-form style, Clapton soared.  <br />This album shows their best work.<br />(When Clapton went out on his own and called the shots creatively, the work was just never as good as when he collaborated with thoughtful musicians like Mayall and Jack Bruce.)<br />Other great Cream: Disraeli Gears (a studio album), and Wheels of Fire (part studio album, part live album).<br />Another great album by Jack Bruce now out of print is the jazz disk Things We Like, with jazz guitarist John McLaughlin.  McLaughlin's best jazz album was Extrapolation, though many prefer The Inner Mounting Flame.<br />Ginger Baker is now out of a long hibernation and two great recent jazz disks from him are Going Back Home and then Falling Of The Roof.  They feature bassist Charlie Haden of Ornette Coleman's band (see above), as well as the best guitarist working today, jazz guy Bill Frisell.  Bill Frisell's other great albums are Have A Little Faith (starting with Track 9) and the cd &quot;Live&quot;.
B000058T5E|5.0|Stunning after the first listen. For those that want the three chord power rock of Beck Bogert Appice, this is not for you. For those that want a re-fried retro session with Rod (sing oot of pitch) Stewart, then this is not for you. If you are willing to let a guitar innovator have is way with his creativity, then YOU HAD IT COMING is for you. I first got this as an import from Japan in late November right after Thanksgiving of last year and I have been jamming it every since. I even puchased it again when it came out on Feb. 6th in America. Saw the tour in Atlanta on Monday, March 5th and was completely blown away by Jeff's mastery of the guitar. I am a little disappointed that the cd is only 36 minutes in length, but 1 minute of new Jeff Beck music is better than none at all, after all he has been known to keep us waiting (10 years in one stretch). I say to the Guv'nor, keep it coming Jeff. I also enjoy the alternate mixes of six of the tunes that I received as well. Must have for any true guitar fan for this new millennium. Strong cuts: &quot;Suspension&quot;, &quot;Loose Cannon&quot;, &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;, &quot;Nadia&quot; and &quot;Roy's Toys&quot;
0792839676|4.0|I'm sure we can all identify with Carrie White. This film is sure to bring up high school memories, about how it is to feel like you don't fit in, you're painfully shy, and you go home in the afternoon to a bunch of arguing. The difference here is that Carrie (Sissy Spacek) discovers she has the power to move things. Bullied by her religiously fanatical mother and her cruel classmates, she gets her just revenge on prom night. Great cast, including young up-and-comers Sissy Spacek, Amy Irving, William Katt, Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles, and Edie McClurg. John Travolta is a hoot as how Vinnie Barbarino might appear if he was even more of a dummy. No explicit sex but some VERY terrifying moments. A must for any horror collection.
0804106304|5.0|This is a story of 4 Chinese women who had immegrated to San Francisco. Each has a daughter whome she hopes to raise as a perfect American, while holding on to what they see as valuable Chinese values. Their daughters, in turn, have to dela with their mothers' demand, which sometimes seem totally foreign to the American environment they're growing in. Both mothers and daughter seem to be trapped between the Chinese and American cultures, and many of their dilemas deal with the need to find a compromise between the two almsot opposite cultures.<br />This cultural strain is just another burden in the already heavy burden of mother daughter relationships. Both mothers and daughters try to talk, or show their love by trying to help the other out, but both actions and words are misiterrepted by the other as something negative.<br />One of the strongest points of this book is that all 4 pairs of mother / daughter know each other, and this gives the reader a few points of view of each relationship, and how the older women treat the younger generation, and visa versa.
0375707972|5.0|This is one of the books that just embrace you in the time that story is told, with considerable amount of subtile emotions which probably has erupted only from author's private life. Life of Hannah is itself very interesting, but story of passion between young boy and older women which can be lock only in their private little own world is a sensitive story which last all life. Story explains in melanholic matter how early experiences are very important for adult life, no matter how long are lasting, just to have very strong emotional impact. The book says one impotant thing about our life, that little, tiny moments, matters in our life are important to us, on which we reconcile with each other.
B000001EXR|3.0|Apparently KISS tried to become something they weren't with this record: A dark, detuned, angst-ridden heavy metal band (like we didn't have enough of them in 1996.)  Frankly, this will be the &quot;forgotten album&quot; of the non-make-up years.  Most of the songs are largely forgettable (&quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Hate&quot;, &quot;Seduction of The Innocent&quot;)  However, there are a few standouts.  &quot;Master And Slave&quot; has a very nice riff, and &quot;I Will Be There,&quot; borders on touching.  &quot;I Walk Alone&quot; is Bruce Kulick's vocal debut, and it's not a bad track.  Sadly, the minuses outweigh the plusses.  You'd think that KISS would learn not to stray from what brought them to the dance.
B00003BDXG|5.0|I have never met a Stone film I didn't like.  But this is his very best.  Only Kubrick used to be the only director who could and did need violence to tell his story.  Now, Oliver Stone has joined that exclusive club.  NBK is beautiful in it's use as violence as a complete artform.  I highly recommend this Digifilm (DVD), that includes the deleted scenes (Ashley Judd's and Denis Leary's are wonderful), and a documentary on the making of the film where Woody Harrelson says he was the sanest person on the set.  Buy this now!
6305252521|5.0|\\"I was watching when you were born. I was watching when you took your first step. I watched you on your first day of school... You can't leave, Truman. You belong here.\\" Who is speaking here? It may be Christof, but the impression created is one so powerful that it could be said to be God speaking. It is hard to say how close the film itself is to reality, but terror and power have always been used for exploitation in the world. Christof illustrates this immeasurable power throughout the whole film, yet the most disturbing fact is that some can and will accept this. Indeed, some, such as Christof, seem to show a complete lack of morality for what they are actually doing - laughing at certain fond memories, which he has `shared' with Truman. He has become so engrossed in what he is performing, that he cannot possibly stand back from the situation and suddenly realise what has happened. Christof can find nothing wrong with the ultimate control he processes - he can control everything apart from Truman himself, yet there are endless avenues of exploitation to combat this, which he has implemented in Seahaven. This is made all too obvious when, at the end of the film, he is willing to make Truman die by using his total power over the environment. He instils a complete and utter terror in the viewer: the terror that this could be a reality.<br /> One of the most disturbing scenes in the play is when Christof is controlling Marlon, as if he is a puppet. Christof forces Marlon, who has genuinely known Truman for years, to betray his trust: \\"And the last thing I would ever do...is lie to you. I mean, think about it, Truman. If everybody's in on it, I'd hafta' be in on it, too. I'm not in on it, because...there is no &quot;it.&quot;\\"<br />The control possessed by Christof is much greater than first imagined. Is it perhaps possible that he may even control the lives of the viewers? Christof tells us that many viewers \\"leave him on all night for comfort.\\" Yet to contrive matters still further, Meryl is now unable to define her screen life from reality: \\"The Truman Show is...a lifestyle. It's a noble life. It is...a truly blessed life.\\" Does Christof really have complete control? There are points where it would appear not: for instance, when Truman sits on the beach and it begins to rain, there is obviously something wrong with the weather system. Neither can he control the real emotions of the actors - he can control everything they do; yet he cannot control their primitive emotions: Meryl breaks down in front of Truman, shouting \\"Help me\\" to the backstage crew, as well as breaking down when Marlon arrives, distraught about the \\"unprofessional\\" way in which she is being forced to act. It is these events that Christof cannot control that finally lead to Truman's sudden departure from the island.<br />When the viewer of the film is first presented with the viewers of `The Truman Show', the experience is one of great confusion. The concept of `worlds within worlds' is not one that is commonly applied to everyday thinking, so it is only when you have viewed the film for most of its length that the concept sets in. In fact, it is almost completely impossible to understand the film after a first viewing, as so many of the small subtleties are dismissed in the first viewing to facilitate some kind of understanding. Examples include the time when Truman is sent to Seahaven harbour by his employer to conclude a case on Harbour Island. It is unclear at this point that the very reason for his visit is to remind him of his fear of water. Another part of the film that is very hard to understand is Truman's obsession with Women's Magazines - we see later that he is collecting eyes and noses etc. to create the face of Sylvia, yet, even after the flashback to his time with her, it is still difficult to link with previous parts of the film.<br />The viewers (TV) themselves are very satirised, as they mimic a great truth in Western Society. The viewers (TV) have become so engrossed in the world of Truman, that they appear to lead no lives of their own - `The Truman Show' is always viewed at the bar with the waitresses; it is always viewed by the man in the bathtub etc. It is true that we are given only one view of these people, but I think that this is very intentional, as it highlights the growing reality of people becoming more and more engrossed in what are supposedly other people's `real' lives.<br />The vulnerability of people in this state of `living someone else's life', allows them to also be drawn in by a great deal of commercialism which is presented to them at regular intervals. There are no commercial interruptions in `The Truman Show', so `product placement' must be utilised instead. As the interviewer of TruTalk says: \\"Of course everything in the show is available in the Truman Catalogue. Operators are standing by.\\" The product placement in `The Truman Show' is, of course, very obvious, but it hard to know how much of an impact `product placement' would have on an individual who is so engrossed in the show. There are two very obvious examples: the `greatest hits tape' owned by the waitress and the `Truman cushion' which one of the old ladies owns.<br />It is at once obvious that Truman is slightly wary of what is happening around him, as the placement really is so obvious: everyday he is forced up against a billboard which advertises a different product each day (Kaiser Chicken/Fine Colonial Homes). To see this board, Truman must be standing very close to it, so that it is included in the shot of him. This is achieved by using two actors who will always stop him at the same point everyday, yet just the second time we see this happening Truman says: \\"Well, what a surprise,\\" with mild sarcasm, indicating the turbulent nature of events to come.
B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols are probably my favorite punk band.  The first Sex Pistols song I heard was Submission, and I went out immediately to buy the album.  When I first got it, I couldn't go an hour without getting a fix of Anarchy in the UK.  Even tho I haven't been really into punk for long (give me a break, I'm only a freshman in high school), I choose classics like the Sex Pistols, the Clash, or the Ramones over new stuff anyday (even tho some new stuff is good too).

6301208773|5.0|This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen.  Great explosions, funny one-liners, tons of well-developed characters...  It's got everything.   I would just like to state here my own theories as to why it's so successful.  First of all, and most importantly, this is perhaps the only movie ever to successfully bridge the gap between two distinct types of action movie.  On the one hand, it is a movie like &quot;Rambo,&quot; in which a lone, much put-upon hero must survive and prevail against astronomical odds.  On the other hand, due to the plot device of having Bruce Willis' character be in constant walkie-talkie contact with a cop outside, it manages to be a standard movie about two cop buddies, like &quot;Lethal Weapon,&quot; etc, in which one of the cops has a proverbial screw loose and the other one needs to try to keep him calmed down.  These two kinds of action movie, by their very nature, are usually mutually exclusive.  That's why the plot device of having the two cops in constant contact by walkie talkie is so ingenious -- it allows the movie to be both kinds of story at once.  I think that's one of the reasons this movie works so well.<br />The other unusual feature of this movie is the high frequency of scenes where a side character, who is somewhat outside the action, needs to use his or her wits to try to figure out what's going on in the plot.  This usually means &quot;how much information do the terrorists have at this point, and how might they use it to make (the character's) life totally miserable.&quot;  Sympathy for these characters, and trying to guess at their mental processes, has the effect of drawing the viewer deeper and deeper into the movie.<br />Anyway, this is just a really fun flick. I recommend it.
0316777722|3.0|Normally I write fairly long reviews, but for this book it's pretty simple, so I'll keep it short.  David Sedaris is at times very funny (the scene where he and his classmates attempt to explain Easter in French to a Muslim from Morocco is absolutely hilarious), but at other times it's like he's straining too hard, or maybe he just ran out of good material.  In one case he LITERALLY resorts to toilet humor (his desperate efforts to flush someone else's giant turd down the drain) for a cheap laugh. Overall, if you want some really funny moments, interspersed by long stretches of -- at best -- mild amusement, then buy this book.  If not, don't, and instead wait until David Sedaris &quot;write better book one day!&quot;
B000009QOC|5.0|While Danzig's sophomore effort from 1989, DANZIG II: LUCIFUGE, wasn't exactly as strong as the band's self-titled debut, it still managed to contain several standout tracks that remain among Danzig's all-time best. While the debut wasn't an immediate hit upon release, it succeeded in attracting a wider metal following (Glenn Danzig's previous bands specialized in punk) and establishing the band as one of hard rock's most promising new acts. DANZIG II also took more chances musically than its predecessor--while the majority of the album is rock-based, other styles are touched upon that were previously unexplored by the band. &quot;Her Black Wings&quot; remains one of Danzig's most evil-sounding compositions (especially its sinister guitar riff), and became a popular video on MTV's Headbanger's Ball program. Also included is the explosive album (and subsequent concert) opener, &quot;Long Way Back From Hell,&quot; as well as such other rockers as &quot;Snakes of Christ&quot; and &quot;Tired of Being Alive.&quot; But the biggest surprises on DANZIG II: LUCIFUGE are undoubtedly the tender, Elvis Presley-sounding composition &quot;Blood and Tears&quot; and the semi-ballad &quot;Devil's Plaything.&quot;

B00004ZAV3|5.0|Apparently, there was a gap in the Beatles' catalog, after all - all the big hits weren't on one tidy, single-disc compilation. It's not the kind of gap you'd necessarily notice - it's kind of like realizing you don't have a pair of navy blue dress socks - but it was a gap all the same, so the group released Beatles 1 late in 2000, coinciding with the publication of their official autobiography, the puzzlingly titled Anthology. The idea behind this compilation is to have all the number one singles the Beatles had, either in the U.K. or U.S., on one disc, and that's pretty much what this generous 27-track collection is. It's easy, nay necessary, to quibble with a couple of the judgment calls - look, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; should be here instead of &quot;From Me to You,&quot; and it's unforgivable to bypass &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; (kick out &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; or &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;) - but there's still no question that this is all great music, and there is a bit of a rush hearing all these dazzling songs follow one after another. If there's any complaint, it's that even if it's nice to have something like this, it's not really essential. There's really no reason for anyone that owns all the records to get this too - if you've lived happily without the red or blue albums, you'll live without this. But, if you give this to any six- or seven-year-old, they'll be pop fans, even fanatics, for life. And that's reason enough for it to exist.
B0000542DG|3.0|Well, if I could have I really would have given this movie 2 and a half stars but I scaled it higher instead of lower.....the first 20 minutes of the movie are the best....the middle seems a little to contrived and forced and the ending is nothing to write home about...not worth buying but ok to rent.
6303477259|5.0|The first time I saw this video was when my dad had bought it, and I watched it. I WAS AMAZED! The light and laser show was terrific, and of chorse...so was the music! They opened up the the powerful 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' which had an AWSOME opening to it! After that, they did the cool 'Learning To Fly', which had a VERY cool laser segment in the middle of it. Afterwards, they did a few cool songs from 'The Division Bell'. Then 'Sorrow', more 'Division Bell' stuff. They closed the first half with 'Another Brick In The Wall-Pt.2', then finished with the awsome instrumental 'One Of These Days'! First half of the show...COOL! Now, the second half....COOLER! The second half was a FULL live performance of 'Dark Side Of The Moon'!!! THE WHOLE THING! Floyd then finished the show with a powerful '3' encore finale! You heard right...'3' encores! The 3 finales were, 'Wish You Were Here'(performed outstandingly!),'Comfortably Numb'(the best version i have heard and seen...especaily David Gilmour's long guitar solo at the end!), and then finally 'Run Like Hell'(AWSOME!!!)! The show ended with a &quot;Big Bang&quot; (you'll see what I mean) Pink Floyd DEFINATELY blew the 'Delicate Sound Of Thunder' show OUT OF THE WATER! DSOT was still good, though. BUY THIS VIDEO IF YOU DO NOT OWN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I now have MY OWN copy of this video! IT'S WORTH IT!!!
068484267X|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I didn't understand what all the fuss was about. Then I bought the book and read it and understood. In life there isn't much difference between tragedy and comedy. The two outlooks come from the same source, the difference is that one offers some hope and the other doesn't believe there is any hope left to offer. Tears and laughter flowing from the same fountain.<br />ANGELA'S ASHES is like that. What the McCourt family suffered through was severely depressing (though most of the world was suffering just as much too) and reading about their trials makes one realize how lucky we are. One feels a deep sympathy for Frank and his family (except perhaps for his father). Yet, the story is told in such a way that it makes one laugh rather than cry. McCourt is honest and forthright and though I was disappointed (rather than amused) at many of his exploits, his story gripped me nonetheless. This book more than deserved the Pulitzer it won, but should you read it bring a hanky just in case laughing is too difficult.
6300215741|4.0|While this film really fizzles after less than an hour, you probably won't care because you'll be too busy watching lovely GRACE KELLY trying to make CARY GRANT her puppy.GRACE had charm,beauty,humour and class.Even HITCHCOCK got stuck in her web so that he forgot the script or maybe he did this on purpice for us.Thanks HITCH we appreciated.Costume designer EDITH HEAD had a field day designing the clothes here.Notice how CARY appears sort of tired in many scenes as though he could not wait to get to the nearest RIVIERA restaurant.TO CATCH A THIEF is really a recreation for a great director in the middle of his creative peak.
B00000IGGA|5.0|I never really liked Tom waits. He is my Dads favorite and he has all of his albums. He constantly listens to tom waits, so when he brought the new one home, My stomach churned. But surprisingly, I found this to be an excellent album. Every track is great (especially chocolate jesus). This album is so good I like tom waits now. I reccomend it to anybody who likes raspy voiced poetry. BUY IT!!!!!
0064471047|5.0|In this book 4 kids wonder off in to a nother world threw there wardrobe. They meet alot of strange and unusual characters on there journey. En evil witch turnes alot of the characters in to stone and the kids help get them back. This book isnt realy like any of the books i've read befor. It seems more like a kids book with all of the crazy characters but, people of all ages could enjoy this book.On page 12 of the book, the quote,&quot;How stupid of me! But Ive never seen a son of Adam or a doughter of Eve befor.&quot; This quote kind of lets you know that there are not many humans in Narnia. They refered to humans as sons and, doughters of Adam and, Eve. this book also shows you that even though they are animals they can still talk in english. This is a good book if you like books with unusual characters in it but, i you like serious, or realistic books this is not for you.
0399146253|5.0|I have just now finished this book, and was so thrilled with it that I wanted to review it immediately.  After reading the last book in the series (Black Notice) I posted a very negative review.  Perhaps my expectations were a tad too high, but I was very disappointed with the plot and the characters.  Dr. Scarpetta must at least have worthy adversaries, and Diane Bray was never that.  I found her and the whole 'loup garou' story so unconvincing.  Mercifully 'The Last Precinct' had a far more complex and intriguing plotline, and I was just on the edge of my seat the whole time.  And paranoid, wow, I was right there with Scarpetta, being suspicious of everyone.  I don't usually find her very human, but at last she became that way through her isolation and utter vulnerability.   Lucy didn't even annoy me the way she usually does, she's becoming an avenging angel of heroic proportions. I'm totally looking forward to the next instalment.  Can't WAIT to read about what the ladies at The Last Precinct are up to.  You go girls! But what's to become of Marino - where will he fit in to all this?  I'm fully confident that Ms Cornwell will lay it all out for us in splendid style.  Far from being a spent force I found her to be a long-term visionary with this book, and I take back my harsh comment that she had lost the plot.  Excellent book.
0451191153|5.0|This novel is not for the weak. If you are scared to look deeply into your heart and mind, if you are terrified of changing yourself and your life, do not read The Fountainhead, or anything else by Rand. But if you long for honesty and integrity, if you want to be proud of your achievements without guilt, Rand provides priceless inspiration.
0060977493|4.0|If you are looking for a novel that will capture your imagination and make you look at life in a whole new perspective, then &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; is the book for you. An interesting piece of information can be found in looking at the first few pages of this book. Roy dedicates her book in such unusual detail that is also found throughout the book. &quot;For Mary Roy who grew me up. Who taught me to say 'excuse me' before interrupting her in Public. Who loved me enough to let me go.  For LKC, who, like me, survived.&quot;    I am not a reader; it is not something I do for entertainment. But this book is one of the best books I have ever opened. I don't understand how Roy can word things that are usually overlooked to sound so important and magical. For example, she describes reptiles in a garden so that even people who can't stand frogs and insects would be interested to see what she is seeing. &quot;The wild, overgrown garden was full of the whisper and scurry of small lives.&quot; The phrase &quot;small lives&quot; really captured my attention from the start. Who would word a sentence that way? This book allows a person to look at the details; not to neglect or disregard the small things in life. In the beginning I believed that her great detail of the small things had a lot to do with the title. In fact, in reading the book, I discovered that it is mainly composed of very detailed small things that happen during the dramatic events of the book. Roy doesn't just look at the events themselves but the little things noticed by the characters while they are happening. In the middle of the book she uses small things again to convey a meaning that is important but not the main one I think she is trying to establish. &quot;And once again, only the Small Things were said. The big Things lurked inside.&quot; By reviewing this quotation anyone can see that it is so true. Everyday big Things, needing to be said, are replaced by casual Small Things. But, towardsthe end I found the true significance of The God Of Small Things. Roy puts amazing phrases all throughout the book, up unto the very last word, that link themselves to what the author will reveal in the end. The phrases and the detail can give the reader such anticipation that it is hard to put the book down. She gives readers just enough detail so they can understand what is going on but want to keep reading because they can't figure out the whole story. For example:<br /> &quot;That afternoon- while in the bathroom the fates conspired to horribly alter the courses of their mysterious mother's road, while in Velutha's backyard an old boat waited for them, while in a yellow church a young bat waited to be born- in their mother's bedroom Estha stood on his head on Rahel's bum.&quot;    For me, this quotation captures most everything the author creates to happen in the end of the book. This story is also made interesting when the author repeats certain phrases that pertain to the whole, but only seem like insignificant bits of information, like the Lemon-Orange drink man whom you discover in reading the book.  As I was reading and I recognized the repetition, I began to understand what the phrases are trying to portray.      It is also interesting to see how some of the Indian characters are striving to be more like the English. They speak English, and they admire the English (Sophie Mol, the cousin). She is described as &quot;loved from the beginning.&quot;  Roy makes some observations: &quot;Anything can happen to anyone&quot; or &quot;Things can change in a day.&quot;  These observations create irony when the characters express them and they are confirmed when the tragic events take shape.    Although this book is set in India and is full of tragedy, it is easy for me to relate.  This book did not change my life or anything to that extent, but it did open my eyes and helped me see a different way of looking at life's experiences. It also taught me how important and interesting the small things in life can be. In my opinion Arundhati Roy put so much passion and feeling into this book that anyone including myself is truly touched after reading it.    Although I admitted to not reading much I have read several well known books, none of which I could relate to as I can this one. You don't have to have tragedy in life to understand the young children's emotions, or the mother's rebellion. That is how Roy creates this book so everyone will be able to relate and have compassion for the characters. To me, this ability is truly amazing and I highly recommend Arundhati Roy's The God Of Small Things.

The content of the video is enough to end their relation.  The trip turns out to be a long one filled with lots of problems and challenges.  The funny bits are all other this film, from the part with the toast thats sent back under complaint to the sperm donation.  Road Trip is a film that must be seen by all as its so funny and contains a cast of young and upcoming actors/actresses of the future
B000056K04|2.0|Okay, I took everyone's advice and listened to the album more than once - I've now listened to it about a dozen times.  I've got news for you.  It still blows.<br />Dave - next time you have a cerebral meltdown, do us all a favour and just release another live album.  We were all much happier then.  <br />In the meantime, I'll keep clicking my heels and hoping that this was all just a bad dream.
B00005214X|5.0|Like most of you who probably had this album when we was fab-- er, when we were kids, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was one of those &quot;gotta have it&quot; albums. Sure, some songs are clearly better than others, and I don't think I played &quot;Apple Jam&quot; on vinyl more than once (admit it, you didn't either). <br />This album is every bit as good as you remember it.<br />As George says in the liner notes, ATMP is composed of a lot of the songs he wrote in the waning years of the Beatles. (Amazing that he decided not to record &quot;Not Guilty,&quot; though, until years later.) And what a busy boy he was!<br />Remember how thrilling &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was when you first heard it on bad AM radio transmission? Listen to it here in all its glory.<br />&quot;What is Life?&quot; An instant hit if I ever heard one--and it was.<br />&quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Let it Down&quot; are two of George's best moments ever. The inclusion of their demos is wonderful. <br />So, too is a great &quot;Lost Harrison&quot; song, &quot;I Live For You.&quot; Mixed so well you can't really tell that the drum track was recorded last year! I also like the recent additions that George made where necessary to some of the other demos. <br />Even the remastered &quot;Apple Jam&quot; (Johnny's Birthday, the only song on the Jam disk I ever listened to more than once, has been conveniently moved to first position in the song order of the jam) sounds like the guys were having a hell of a good time. <br />Dont pass judgement on the new version of My Sweet Lord until you listen to it a few times. It WILL grow on you, I promise.<br />Stop reading and buy this. Even the Packaging is cool!
B000002TQV|5.0|Anyone who listens to this album will take away with them a song or two that they just can't get out of their minds.  It has the ability to touch everyone who has ever listened and loved music.  It is alternative, it is rock n' roll, it gives poets a reason to exist and most importantly, it is a great collection of music.  Instrumentally, vocally, and lyrically, it has no weak points.      Some will argue that OK Computer or Kid A are better, and they can put up a strong argument.  Radiohead have,perhaps, established themselves as the best all-round band on earth, and continue to push the limits of everyone's rock and roll imaginations while selling millions of records AND maintaining their integrity.  However, this CD remains their crowning achievement.

B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Scary Movie has got to be the funniest film that i have seen this year.  After seeing Sream and I know What You Did Last Summer, its a refreshing change to watch a film like this.  From the opening scenes with Carmen Electra aka Drew getting killed to the twist with officer dewby the film is just so funny.  There are loads of micky takes from other films with the Matrix being one of them.  If you are a fan of teen flicks then this will be good to watch as its lighthearted and puts the other films in their place
B00004XONN|5.0|I read some of the other reviews on this album and I can't believe them..They give it 2's and 3's and call it boring and pointless...This album defines evolution in music..this album surely set a standard that will not be surpassed easily..I can safely say I've listened to this over 50 times straight through since I bought it..Every track is etched in my mind like a deep memory..there isn't one song on here I don't like..I would have to say that this album is equally as good as Ok Computer or better..They both have their own styles and feeling..All i ask is that if you don't like this on first listen give it a couple more tries...If you like different music then this is for you..Get IT!!!
B00004YW6I|5.0|I was very, very happy with this new release by PJ Harvey. I actually liked &quot;Is This Desire&quot; but was kind of put off by some of the album's more experimental songs.  It's not that I don't think PJ can pull it off, but she's so much more talented at writing rock songs or ballads, without sounding conventional or cliche, which is not easy these days.<br />&quot;Big Exit&quot; is one of the best songs I've heard by anyone, with a jangly guitar riff that makes you wanna put on your boots and hit the bars, clubs, whatever -- which is great considering the title of the song. &quot;Horses&quot; successfully shows PJ's more delicate side, while her &quot;duet&quot; with Thom Yorke is absolutely splendid and will definitely please Radiohead fans. I also liked the way the music, more often than not, makes room for her voice, which is one of the best in the business.  She can do the near-whisper to the howl better than most. <br />I'm telling you, this is one of those albums that people are going to look back on in 20 years, and be like, &quot;Jeez, that album never got the attention it really deserved.&quot;  This is just as solid as Rock gets.<br />There's also something about this album that is very 70s-like to me -- maybe it's just the cover.  :-)
B000003NA3|5.0|I received this set from my wife, and eagerly put it on my player. It was better than I ever anticipated. The playing was sometimes a cacophony sometimes melodious, but always sublime. If possible this band was underrated, they soared to heights previously unreached. And took Jazz where it needed to go, out in unexplored territory. Jazz had been a little mainstream, and had needed to be shaken up. And by who better than, the most intense band going?  If only modern players would take a few chances with their playing, Jazz would be in a far more progressive state than it is in.  The fact that Coltrane tried to explore the same tracks with different variations in the personel, say's to me; that the man  was on an almost spiritual quest for perfection, in his music. It wasn't always pretty but it sure was beautiful.

0782008372|2.0|The picture looks terrible, grainy, with specs flickering like it was a much older film. Sound in a Dolby Pro Logic system is terrible as well.(I understand this is not the case in a Dolby Digital system)I have other THX DVD's that look and sound fantastic, not this one!!!!<br />Don't let yourself be fooled by the THX endorsement it is not an absolute guarantee.
B000056K04|5.0|Different from any other Dave Matthews Band Cd, this is as they say &quot;fresh&quot;?  I like it a lot though.  Dave grabs hold of an electric guitar and does a fine job with it.  If you are a Dave Matthews fan or not, I would recommend it.  :-)
B0000067L2|5.0|&quot;Disraeli Gears.&quot; In my opinion the finest record from the Summer of Love, the year that included monster albums like &quot;Sgt. Peppers,&quot; &quot;Are you Experienced,&quot; &quot;Strange Days,&quot; &quot;Axis: Bold As Love,&quot; &quot;The Who Sell Out,&quot; etc, etc. This record is the epitome of psychedelic blues rock. Just look at classics such as &quot;Strange Brew&quot; and Cream's signature song, the immortal &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love.&quot; &quot;World of Pain,&quot; &quot;Dance the Night Away,&quot; and Baker's &quot;Blue Condition&quot; are superb, dreary, and stoned out. &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot; is Clapton's wondrous introduction to the wah-wah pedal. &quot;Swlabr&quot; (She Walks Like a Bearded Rainbow) is catchy as all hell, even though the lyrics are as incoherent as a Turkmenstani literature book. &quot;Outside Women Blues&quot; features a great riff and some great lyrics &quot;If You lose your money, great God, don't lose your mind/ And if you lose your woman, please don't fool with mine.&quot; &quot;Take It Back&quot; is a fine blues rock song. The only song I dislike on &quot;Gears&quot; is &quot;We're Going Wrong. (&quot;Mother's Lament doesn't really count)&quot; Bruce's voice is annoying and the song itself is boring.  This is a colorful record and the best mix of hardcore blues riffs and acid. Go Get It. NOW!!

Who would word a sentence that way? This book allows a person to look at the details; not to neglect or disregard the small things in life. In the beginning I believed that her great detail of the small things had a lot to do with the title. In fact, in reading the book, I discovered that it is mainly composed of very detailed small things that happen during the dramatic events of the book. Roy doesn't just look at the events themselves but the little things noticed by the characters while they are happening. In the middle of the book she uses small things again to convey a meaning that is important but not the main one I think she is trying to establish. &quot;And once again, only the Small Things were said. The big Things lurked inside.&quot; By reviewing this quotation anyone can see that it is so true. Everyday big Things, needing to be said, are replaced by casual Small Things. But, towardsthe end I found the true significance of The God Of Small Things. Roy puts amazing phrases all throughout the book, up unto the very last word, that link themselves to what the author will reveal in the end. The phrases and the detail can give the reader such anticipation that it is hard to put the book down. She gives readers just enough detail so they can understand what is going on but want to keep reading because they can't figure out the whole story. For example:<br /> &quot;That afternoon- while in the bathroom the fates conspired to horribly alter the courses of their mysterious mother's road, while in Velutha's backyard an old boat waited for them, while in a yellow church a young bat waited to be born- in their mother's bedroom Estha stood on his head on Rahel's bum.&quot;    For me, this quotation captures most everything the author creates to happen in the end of the book. This story is also made interesting when the author repeats certain phrases that pertain to the whole, but only seem like insignificant bits of information, like the Lemon-Orange drink man whom you discover in reading the book.  As I was reading and I recognized the repetition, I began to understand what the phrases are trying to portray.      It is also interesting to see how some of the Indian characters are striving to be more like the English. They speak English, and they admire the English (Sophie Mol, the cousin). She is described as &quot;loved from the beginning.&quot;  Roy makes some observations: &quot;Anything can happen to anyone&quot; or &quot;Things can change in a day.&quot;  These observations create irony when the characters express them and they are confirmed when the tragic events take shape.    Although this book is set in India and is full of tragedy, it is easy for me to relate.  This book did not change my life or anything to that extent, but it did open my eyes and helped me see a different way of looking at life's experiences. It also taught me how important and interesting the small things in life can be. In my opinion Arundhati Roy put so much passion and feeling into this book that anyone including myself is truly touched after reading it.    Although I admitted to not reading much I have read several well known books, none of which I could relate to as I can this one. You don't have to have tragedy in life to understand the young children's emotions, or the mother's rebellion. That is how Roy creates this book so everyone will be able to relate and have compassion for the characters. To me, this ability is truly amazing and I highly recommend Arundhati Roy's The God Of Small Things.
B00003CXFG|5.0|Pitch Black has got to be one of the most underated films of last year.  The film was good and the cast were mostly new actors which made the film better as you werent familiar with their previous roles.  The film is about a space ship that lands on a planet that has three suns.  The planet is inhabited with aliens that are afraid of the sunlight as it will kill them amd will only come out in the dark.  It just so happens that they land on the planet just as it is going to have to have a total eclipse.  (You dont have to be a genious to work out what happens next)  The plot is good, the effects even better, which means that it is a shame that so many people missed out on this film.  This film is definitly worth watching and not cast aside as it is not just another alien rip-off

I'm a fan!
B0000524E5|5.0|At first glance it didn't look promising,thinking it would be some dumb,sleazy PG-13&quot;Showgirls&quot;,but when I actually saw it I was very pleased and happy.Its about a young girl named Violet Sanford(played by the adorable Piper Perabo)who decides to move to New York City to become a sucessful songwriter.Unforturnatly, she can't get a break,she has massive stage fright,and loses her money.Desparete,she find out that a trio of beautiful young women(the Coyotes)make up to $300 at some bar.I won't spoil most of of the rest,but I can tell that this is the most fun,sexy and entertaining movie in the otherwise dissapointing 2000 summer movie season.Unless you're some tired,crabby movie critic who only likes boring artsy-fartsy mush,this is a must-see. PS:I'm in love with Piper Perabo!
0060977493|4.0|If you are looking for a novel that will capture your imagination and make you look at life in a whole new perspective, then &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; is the book for you. An interesting piece of information can be found in looking at the first few pages of this book. Roy dedicates her book in such unusual detail that is also found throughout the book. &quot;For Mary Roy who grew me up. Who taught me to say 'excuse me' before interrupting her in Public. Who loved me enough to let me go.  For LKC, who, like me, survived.&quot;    I am not a reader; it is not something I do for entertainment. But this book is one of the best books I have ever opened.

B00004X0Q0|4.0|At the Drive in's major label debut is quite an exciting affair.  Although they are considered emo-core, At the Drive in manages to escape with almost none of the negative connotations that most emo bands have.  I say &quot;almost&quot; because every song in Relationship of Command has redundant, indecipherable lyrics which is all too common in emo music.  However, the band performs the songs with so much energy and conviction that the lyrics hardly matter.  <br />If I had to describe the album to someone who's never heard At the Drive in, I would say they sound like early Fugazi fronted by Zack de la rocha of Rage Against the Machine.  While singer Omar Bixler doesn't attempt rap, he has a similar, shrill, quivering vocal quality.  Not only that but he sings with just as much enthusiasm and conviction as the Rage frontman.  Infact, the entire band is lively and energetic throughout the album.  Along with their single &quot;Pattern against user&quot;, some of my fav tracks are &quot;Arcasenal&quot;, &quot;Sleepwalk Capsules&quot; and &quot;quarantined.&quot; &quot;Rolodex Propaganda&quot; is a nifty one too, which features Iggy Pop!<br />I suppose the one complaint that I have is that Relationship of Command sounds a little too similar to the hordes of rap metal bands that flood the airwaves these days.  When you hear At the Drive in on radio immediately following Linkin Park, it's hard not too hear the similarities.  On the other hand, At the Drive in's music never sounds like fake posturing.  Nor does it have the stupid, &quot;Break Stuff&quot; mentality of bands like Limp Bizkit.  At the same time, they're not the usual wimpy, whiny emo either.  Ultimately, At the Drive in a perfect middle ground between aggresive hardcore and heartfelt emo.
B00004YW6I|5.0|This CD is what happens when a woman with a amazing voice sings incredible songs. It's not teen-pop, thank God, but instead of selling her soul to the industry, PJ Harvey has created a masterpiece that belongs in anyone's collection who knows anything about great singing and songwriting. PJ Harvey has a fascinating, captivating, and at times, haunting, style of singing. And it doesn't hurt that Thoem York of Radiohead joins her on a few of the tracks, as he is one of the better musicians in rock today. There are multiple tracks on this CD that are noteworthy, and I could spend all day writing about what a wonderful work of art this album is, but there's no need to do that. At the very least, borrow this CD and give it a listen, or do yourself a favor and buy it.
6305358613|5.0|ELIZABETH is NOT a stale historical costume drama.  If you're looking for a movie with all the intrigue of a good Mafia flick and a lead character as fascinating as Elizabeth Bennett in PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE, see this film!  I've had to go back for several viewings, and I'm as enthusiastic as ever about Cate Blanchett, the script, the cast, the art direction -- everything about this movie just plain works. I think you may find it irresistible.<br />Cate Blanchett is truly amazing.  A virtual unknown when Kapur selected her for this film, Cate owns the role all the way from the naturally beautiful, frolicking young Princess to the awe-inspiring, white-pancaked visage of the Virgin Queen.  Her expressive face is very easy to watch in all her moods.<br />I'm not comfortable with the term &quot;fictionalized&quot; when applied to this movie because the intent here is not to rewrite or depart from history at all.  In fact, this is a very convincing effort to deduce the methods and manner by which Elizabeth evolved to her ultimate power and glory.  I think they've done a spectacular job of connecting the dots and giving us, at least impressionistically, a look at the likely forces at work.<br />Again, this is not a costume pageant.  It's young and vital and suspenseful and very engaging.  The movie is lush and beautiful, but the film is all about human beings, motivations, machinations and the stream of life.  Blanchett carries the film along with ease, even in its most difficult passages, and is framed by a great cast as well.  Standouts for me included Jeffrey Rush as loyal facilitator and protector Walsingham, Kathy Burke as Cate's dying sister Queen Mary -- who worries that Cate will champion Protestantism but admirably refuses to execute her own sister without cause -- and the exotically beautiful Fanny Ardant as the conniving and bloody Mary de Guise.<br />I had to watch the film more than once to fully realize the point that this film makes regarding Elizabeth's re-invention of herself as the 'Virgin Queen' -- she did have a boyfriend, after all.  The dialog toward the end is quite persuasive in this regard, as events force Elizabeth to the conclusion that, as monarch of the people, male companionship can only bring weakness to her country, and so she marries England just as a nun marries the church -- for good (at least, in public).<br />ELIZABETH is a joy of a movie and I am glad to have it in my DVD collection -- a fine job of rendering by the way and some nice extra featurettes.  Mainly, it is a Cate Blanchett tour de force which establishes her as a major star, but it is also a triumph of the British cinema and an instant classic -- in fact I enjoyed this movie far more than the other period film released at the same time, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  Blanchett in ELIZABETH is a different cup of tea, and much more to my taste.  If you have any remaining doubts about seeing this movie after all the stellar reviews herein, I urge you to take the plunge and find out what everyone is raving about.  You are going to see much more of Cate Blanchett in future, after all.h's re-invention of herself as the 'Virgin Queen' -- she did have a boyfriend, after all.

B000002N2Z|3.0|I don't know how this compares to the rest of Deftones' work, but it didn't make me an instant fan - to put it that way. While the tracks are aggressive and well produced, none of the tracks really stood out from the rest except for the last one (hidden bonus track). Because the Editorial review mentioned Tool as a reference for the vocals, I must say that Maynard James Keenan's vocal efforts far surpass that of Deftones' Moreno. It was nothing wrong with this album, it's just that the songs sounded too much the same to me.<br />But for a debut album it's nothing to be ashamed of. Hopefully they grew on this one (but as I mentioned earlier, I haven't heard their other albums).
B000002AHM|4.0|Think accoustic guitars are wimpy??  Then you've probably never heard Friday Night in San Francisco.  I can't think of any other album with this much technical virtuosity.  The sheer speed of Al Dimeola and John Mclaughlin is nothing short of jaw dropping.  Paco De Lucia is no slouch himself, and is consistently tasteful throughout the album.  Although the 3 guitarists have incredible technical skill, I think what's more impressive is their seemingly psychic interplay with one another.  I doubt that the entire tour went as well as this, but on this one night, their minds were like one.  In certain parts, it can start to drag on, but this is still a fine album.  The one complaint that some people have about Friday Night is that it doesn't have much emotional content or depth.  While that may be true, I believe that this album was supposed to be a casual, light hearted event anyway.  And in my opinion, there are plenty of moments where the three guitarists choose to play with taste and restraint.  But let's not kid ourselves; most of us want to hear the fireworks and the excitement...and Friday Night certainly has plenty of that.  <br />Basically, if you enjoy spanish/flamenco guitar as much as I do, then I strongly recommend this album.  (If you liked this you may also want to check out Marc Ribot as well)
B00004XONN|5.0|Hands down, Radiohead's Kid A is the best album of the year, without question, and without debate. Anyone who thinks this is anything but a powerful album has absolutely no intelligence when it comes to well-crafted music. This album has more depth to it than all the music performed by teen-pop idols and icons since there was such a thing as a teen-pop idol or icon. Radiohead captured a vibe that, until recently, had only been captured by Pink Floyd. It takes more than just a couple of listens to a couple of tracks on this record to get a complete feel for the music. The whole CD is a flowing piece of work, and just idly skipping from track to track will never give the listener a chance to fully appreciate the craftsmanship involved, to say nothing of Thoem York's lyrics. That's a whole different level. York hit a vein of genius with OK Computer, and he has done it again, at an equally brilliant level. It's almost unfair, to have as much talent as Radiohead does.  This CD more than deserves a Grammy. If it doesn't, and a crap-band like Destiny's Child, or (God help us) N' Sync, then I will have lost all of what little respect I have for those who nominate and vote for Grammy Award winners. But I have a distinct feeling this album will still be the best available to Americans for a long time yet.
B000002579|1.0|Wow!  What brilliant album!  There's a reason why Da Vinci is on the cover... it's pure genius.  Just like him.  I don't know about you, but every time I look at the album I can almost hear him humming &quot;Carry On My Wayward Son&quot; to himself.  I know if he were alive today, he'd be honored they used him on the cover.  I bet Leo would have been a Kansas fan.  You know he would!  He was just as progressive in his day as they are today.  Sure, he was a remarkable scientist, thinker, and the very first Renaissance man.  Sure, in the 15th century he predicted many of the inventions only recently developed, like the tank, airplane, and the submarine.  But Kansas has songs like &quot;Father Padilla Meets the Perfect Gnat.&quot;  Need I say more?  <br />Just like Da Vinci, they're so far ahead of their time, their time hasn't even come yet.  One can only hope that by that time, a nuclear holocaust will have rendered the planet unliveable for eons to come.  That would rock!  <br />Think of it this way... how can Kansas not rock when its named after the most rocking state in the Union?  You know what I'm talking about.  Give it up for Topeka!
0529064847|5.0|This it the Bible translation (known as the NAB) that is used in the Liturgy of the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church (i.e.: first and second readings, psalms and the Gospel) in the United States of America (Canada uses the New Revised Standard Version - NRSV).<br />It is a very easy to read translation, and is truly a translation, as the scholars who compiled the New American translation did so from Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts. This is unlike other Catholic translations, which have often worked from the Latin text of the Latin Vulgate. In the foreword, it talks about how the oldest and best-known and supportable texts were used in the writing of this translation, making it one of the best historical translations you can find.<br />Since it is a Catholic Bible, it contains the deuterocanonical books, which non-Catholic's erroneously call the &quot;Apocrypha&quot; (i.e.: I say erroneous because apocrypha means hidden, and these books are far from hidden).<br />Each book of the Bible contains the history of that book. Such information included is who was responsible for writing the book (when available), the period in which it was written, and the purpose and intent of the book.  Along with this foreward, the each book contains extensive footnotes to assist the reader in understanding particular phrases and/or the historical context. It also contains cross-referencing material which will point the reader in the direction of other related scriptural verses.<br />As a pointer, this translation can also be found online by visiting the National Conference of Catholic Bishops at the United States Catholic Conference website.  You will be able to read the text there and decide if this is a translation you would want to purchase.  As a Catholic, I would highly recommend it to all other American Catholics.
B0000256KE|5.0|For Your Pleasure is an album that represents all of the popous excesses of 70's glam rock.  Everything from the bizarre band photos in the booklet to the psychedelic guitar freakout in &quot;In Every Dream Home a Heartcache&quot; make this album completely ridiculous and utterly fascinating.  This is Roxy Music's final album with Brian Eno, and it's quite possible that the making of For Your Pleasure was the catalyst for his departure.  While Bryan Ferry has written a wealth of peculiar, yet catchy songs for this album, Eno proceeds to put his stamp all over each song.  Listen to the repeating, phased out keyboards at the beginning and end of &quot;Beauty Queen&quot;.  Or the beautiful, ambient instrumental passage at the end of &quot;For your Pleasure&quot;  The combination of Ferry's pop song writing and Eno's experimentation is what makes this album so compelling.  <br />For Your Pleasure is easily Roxy music's most adventurous and experimental album.  As a result, it is also one of their best and most rewarding albums.  I strongly recommend it to anyone.

0679746048|3.0|In the book Girl Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen a young girl at the age of eighteen is put into a mental institution. It is actually a confessional book about herself. She is sent there because of a former suicide attempt. The doctors had diagnosed her with a character disorder. Susanna is deeply depressed and feels hopeless. She was only supposed to stay at McLean hospital for a few weeks, but those weeks turned into two long years. While she was there she met many different and intresting types of people. Pretty much all she ever did was go to therapy, watch TV, and sit around and talk with her friends. There are twists and turns and many unexpected things happen throughout the book. I recommend this novel because it is suprisingly funny and it is quite astonishing.
B000050IMG|3.0|This movie was so stupid it was funny.  Obviously it parodiesmany of the teen flicks.  You have to be in the mood to deal withsexual jokes, fart jokes, and other rude, lude, and crude humor towatch it.  I've seen a lot of guys complaining about the male nudityin it.  What's the big deal?  Women have been forced to sit throughmovies chock full of naked women for years.  Lighten up guys!  Themale organs shown were not even real.  There was a shower scene withsome bare butts.  So what.  Get over it!!  Some even said it deservedmore than an R rating.  Well, no more than 'Basic Instinct' and moviesof the like.
B00000J7J4|4.0|Maybe it's the guitar enthusiast in me talking, but I enjoy this album.  I bought it atleast a year ago, and I still pop it in the stereo every now and then.  No, it's not the landmark album that Abraxas was.  And no, it's not as musically adventurous as Blues for Salvador or Caravanserai.  But it's still joyous to hear Carlos' guitar.  <br />First of all, this albums isn't just a collection of collaborations with pop artists.  &quot;Da Le Yaleo,&quot; &quot;Africa Bamba&quot;, &quot;El Farol&quot; , and &quot;Primavera&quot; are all fine examples of Santana's trademark afro cuban jazz.  As for the collaborations, most of them work surprisingly well.  The Lauryn Hill and Everlast tracks are somewhat throwaways, but &quot;Love of My Life&quot; with Dave Mathews is a fairly enjoyable song.  Even the most famous singles, &quot;Smooth&quot; and &quot;Maria Maria&quot; are quite infectious.  Unfortunately, the jam with Eric Clapton, which may sound nice in theory, turns out to be somewhat lackluster here.  <br />To tell you the truth, I don't really mind what medium Carlos plays in.  It's just nice to hear his guitar playing.  You can say what you will about the songs in Supernatural, but anyone would have to admit that Carlos plays great throughout.  I recommend it for any Santana fan.  As for the guy who wrote that he heard the song &quot;Smooth&quot; atleast 10 times and didn't know it was Santana, all i have to say is......How could you not know it's Santana??  He's instantly recognizable!!  And that Smooth solo had so many signature Santana licks!  I only have to hear 3 or 4 notes and I know it's him.

B00003CXSP|2.0|I am not going to compare this film to either of the others that have gone before because that would be the wrong thing to do. Taking it as a stand alone film, in which the principal player is one of the most sinister characters in movie murder history, it was just very poor. There was nothing particularly wrong with the acting, the sets, the direction or any aspect of production really, it was just a bad story. With the potential of weaving a superb tale around Hopkins excellent character, it instead turned into a total wasted oppotunity. I had actually read the book beforehand and thought that the story was poor. Unfortunatly, poor books translate into even poorer films. Don't beleive the hype, see it before you buy it. It is very likely you will save your money.
B00000J7JO|4.0|... that it was only a matter of time before they released analbum like Californication.  While most of their other albums weredominated by frat boy funk punk, &quot;Around the World&quot;,&quot;Get on Top&quot;, &quot;I like Dirt&quot; and &quot;Right onTime&quot; are the only tracks on Californication that follow thatterritory.  The bulk of Californication is filled with slower, moreintrospective songs.  A few of the songs like &quot;Porcelain&quot;and &quot;Road Trippin&quot; are gentle enough to be folk music.&quot;Scar Tissue&quot; and &quot;Savior&quot; are two of the mostbeautiful, haunting songs the Peppers have ever written.  Both songsalso feature fantastic guitar playing by Frusciante.  While &quot;thisVelvet Glove&quot; and &quot;Parellel Universe&quot; really showcaseshis almost psychic interplay with flea. In the end, perhaps thebiggest surprise is Anthony Kiedis.  Who would've thought...He cansing!!  <br />John Frusciante's return has really helped the bandtremendously.  Especially after the disappointing One Hot Minute.He's a gifted, one of a kind guitarist.  I still ...  but I'm gladthat he's doing alright for the time being.  In short, Californicationis the Red Hot Chili Pepper's most mature album to date.  Worth thepurchase.
0140189378|5.0|Middle-aged Wilhelm las lost his sense of direction. He cannot find the means to support his wife and kids, who he recently walked out on, and is looking for pity and help from everyone that he can.<br />The premise may not sound that interesting but Bellow does an incredible job of showing how suppressing emotions come back to haunt us. Throughout this book, Wilhelm has several life-changing interactions with the other characters, and comes out a totally different person. These interactions are gracefully executed by Bellow, showing an amazing grasp of differing psyches and how they interact with others.<br />I don't want to give anything away, but Wilhelm's final confrontations with Tamkin and his father are absolutely amazing. If your interest can be held by an intensely personal journey (as opposed to a plot driven thriller), then this book may be for you. Once you've finished the book, just compare the opening paragraphs with the closing ones and you should get a hint of what you just gained. Doing so may even convince you to give it another go.

B000000H42|1.0|the input of gushing metalheads, &quot;consummate bassists&quot;, and other like-minded folks notwithstanding, Mercyful Fate and the incomprable caterwauling of living cartoon/frontman of countless bad voices King Diamond produced some of the most terrifically terrible music i've ever heard...i simply can't get through a single song without laughing hysterically...<br />skill of the musicians aside, these boys are amongst the most inept to ever press their thoughts to vinyl...the songs are so &quot;complex&quot; as to defy listening to them...the rhythm, riffing, melody, etc., all change continuously throughout each track until you wonder how these lads ever could remember how to play them...oh, that must be the evidence of their keen musicianship...<br />you'll howl along with King as he welcomes the &quot;Princess of Hell&quot; into his house...you'll marvel at just how abysmally bad (and funny as hell) music can be...you will NOT be frightened of the &quot;evil&quot; subject matter or in awe of the epic narrative...King and Friends adored the black metal story album (see the even worse &quot;Melissa&quot; LP), and the effect is about as riveting as the equally crap-awful Dream Theater concept albums with 25 minute songs in twelve parts (damn you, Rush!)<br />music that tries to be funny almost invariably is not funny at all, so the best laughs come from earnest efforts gone horribly wrong like &quot;Don't Break the Oath&quot;...<br />a classic, to be sure, but not for the reasons the other reviewers would have you believe...truly clueless, utterly charming in its ineptitude...currently iceland's own Vondur, featuring the estimable partnership of two gentleman named It and All, are vying to be the most ludicrously bad metal band in the world...<br />for heaven's sake (no pun intended) don't buy &quot;Oath&quot;, but if some &quot;consummate bassist&quot; wants to play it for you sometime, i dare you not to laugh your fool head off as soon as King hits his first high note...<br />Hail, Satan! (whatever, guys...)
0811826848|4.0|Everything the Beatles have done deserves 5 stars.  Well, almost.  I will always think of the Beatles as top notch, but there are a few songs here and there that I really don't like, and the individual members did make mistakes in their personal lives, just like all humans do.  But they still were and are the greatest rock group of all, and nothing will change that.<br /><br />I've been a Beatles fanatic since January 1964, so it's kind of tough not to give this book 5 stars.  All the other reviewers praise the merits of this book, and there are many.  But I want to focus on why I don't think it's top notch, and some of the reasons:<br /><br />1--It's too expensive with a $60 cover price.<br /><br />2--It's oversized, heavy to lug around and even hold comfortably when reading, and won't fit on any book shelf.  The pages are a heavy stock that will last, but the edges just invite paper cuts.<br /><br />3--Too many pictures are presented without specifications of when and where they were taken, or who is in the photos.  A lot of the layering and write overs are difficult to cut through.<br /><br />4--Reading the text, even though associated comments from the Beatles are drawn together to describe events, and the text is nicely assembled, there is still a disjointed feel to it.  It comes across more like a court record of related comments rather than a fluid narrative.  Part of this is due to the John Lennon comments.<br /><br />5--The John Lennon comments, taken from various interviews, sometimes fit in OK but the perspective is often sadly limited.  The three living members of the group of course have a big advantage by gaining perspective over the past two decades that Lennon never lived to realize.  It's anybody's guess what (and how) he would have changed or kept the same.  In the end, the Lennon comments are just like the \\"Free As A Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\" overdubs.  They're interesting and partly successful in their context, but it's just not quite as \\"real\\" in the end.<br /><br />6--It's late in coming and even though it's the first autobiographical volume, it is derivative. Maybe because I've been an intensive fan for nearly four decades, I just don't feel there's much in the way of new information in the book.  I have heard or read almost all of this before.  I would recommend other books from the past decades to most fans.  \\"The Love You Make\\" and \\"The Beatles Chronicles\\" or \\"Recording Sessions\\" are books I refer to frequently.  I doubt I'll be doing the same with \\"The Beatles Anthology.\\"<br /><br />Love the group, love the songs, but this book just doesn't live up to my expectations of what it could have been.
0783225849|5.0|PSYCHO, filmed in black and white, and directed by Alferd Hitchcock is a truly classic horror film. The film starts out with a woman named Marion Crane, who steals some money from her boss and goes out on the road to live the good life with her boyfriend Sam. But along the way, it starts to rain and Marion pulls over at the Bates Motel on the side of the highway. She meets the owner of the motel Norman Bates, who lives in the house on the hill behind the motel with his &quot;mother.&quot; That night, while taking a shower, Marion is stabbed by an old woman with a butcher knife. Murder, madness, and suspense follow shortly after that. Anthony Perkins gives a good performance as the disturbed Norman Bates. All in all, one of the true great classic horror films.
0694003611|3.0|The colored pages were harsh and reminded me of Van Gogh's The Night Cafe. Very acidic, sharp and unsoothing. Acid red and acid green are the dominant colors and they tend to vibrate and irritate our eyes when we read this room in a softly lit bedroom.  The alternating black and white pages are so bland and boring in contrast. <br />The story is soothing and simple but perhaps a bit too simple for older toddlers.  Our toddler lost interest in the book at age 2.
0062502182|5.0|this is such an incredible book. it puts meaning and life into words...how can language, which is completely constructed and contradictory, express such pure truth? coelho's way with words is incredible...do NOT miss out. read it soon. it will hopefully change and clarify things...
6305513406|4.0|Volume 1 contains two great early Star Trek episodes:  &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before,&quot; and &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver.&quot;  In WNMHGB, Kirk's friend and fellow officer (played by Gary Lockwood) encounters a presence that gives him incredible powers, making the rest of the crew little more than pests in his  &quot;new&quot; eyes.  Kirk must decide whether he can save his friend without endangering the crew.  &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; is a great cat-and-mouse game between Kirk and the hostile alien Balok.  These episodes look and sound better than ever on DVD.  Paramount has wisely released two episodes per disc rather than one, for which we can be thankful.  Sadly, however, there are no extras except for the &quot;Next Voyage&quot; trailers.  Like another reviewer, I wish Paramount and the Sci-Fi Channel could strike  a deal permitting the addition of the behind-the-scenes information featuring the actors and guest stars.  With these additions, the DVD's would no doubt fly off the shelves.  But, the episodes are so good, they probably will anyway.
0780622650|3.0|Some great action and special effect sequences but far to many plot holes.  Not a complete waste but don't pay full price for it.  By now there should be plenty of previously viewed copies in the bargin bin at your local video store.
B000055Y0X|4.0|I just got this and I must say I'm pleased with the package. The film is a classic so I'm not going to review it. There are 3 decades worth of that. You're interested in the extras and the quality. Extras: It's not perfection but it has its share of good stuff. A trailer, the interviews, the gallery and the talent files are alone an expected handful of goodies that should be on all dvds.  Just my opinion but that should be a law. The big bonuses are the 2 docs- Wonderful and insightful \\"Kudos\\"! My only wish would have been a commentary. Certainly there is some person who could add some insight during the film. Any volunteers? Quality: fine nothing spectacular but nothing distracting.  I would have loved to see it in the original widescreen though. Overall, if you love Kubrick click BUY now! If not it, still, is an exceptional DVD. My only wish is that all of Kubrick's films get this treatment or better. Then we can burn that Warner collection like the garbage it is!
0800141601|5.0|Ah, the knight in shining armor, doth thy Richard Gere play, and play he, his lady fair, well...Sean Connery is no slouch either.  Excellent acting and action packed movie... It has all the ingredients for a romance and enough action and war to keep any man busy watching, too. Hmmm, someone stole my video so alas, I am here buying another one. I have not met anyone who has seen First Knight that has not loved the movie. Enjoy. ~Teresa King
B0000508U6|4.0|I happened to catch part of the broadcast that the band did on KCRW a couple of weeks ago and liked all of the songs played.  I didn't get around to buying the disc until two days ago and am impressed and extremely happy with my purchase.  I like their sound, however, I want to caution them to avoid the &quot;always know it's (fill in the blank name of a band)&quot; syndrome.  All of the tracks are distinctive, but have a similar quality.  For now, I'll just say, it's one I'd recommend buying to anyone.
0375501851|5.0|Zadie Smith's deput is an astonishment, a privilege to read in this era of the endlessly declining quality of fiction and writing in general. The anatomy of Smith's writing is as follows: one foot in the East, one in the West, tongue in cheek, one eyebrow raised, eyes crossed, and a hand stretched out to the future. White Teeth is one of the funniest books you will read this or any year, and a well-paced story that enthralls from the first pages. It compares favorably with its Americanized counterpart, Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf; both are debuts by novelists I am certain will entertain us for years to come, and both are not just droll or amusing, but downright hilarious reading, while never straying from their stories. Terrific stuff.
B000002AHM|5.0|This album has been often accused of being too heavy on the chops and too light on the musicality.  While it can be argued that there is some merit to this claim, this album is still nothing short of amazing.  You can really hear that that particular Friday night in San Fransisco was something that doesn't happen too often and you genuinely feel glad that someone was there to recored to whole event.  The friendly guitar competition among DiMeola, McLaughlin and DeLucia really shows and each brings out the best playing from the other resulting in some incredible interplay and improvisation.  A must have for any guitar player... heck any music lover for that matter.
B00004XQ83|5.0|As someone who,in part,grew up on bluegrass music, this was a  refreshing change of pace from the ordinary we are used to listen to. When I heard &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;, I was reminded of the great bluegrass legends such as Bill Monroe and Johnny and Jack, and I love it. If you want to know what real country music was all about, I suggest this album. You will love it.
B000003S2K|5.0|simplicity in its own world is the most beautiful of things. This work of music/art is not for everyone and for some is an acquired taste. When I first listened to this, it made me wonder of how inane this is, a piece of music? not now though.<br />the first track uses only 6 chords and is so beautifully pleasing auditory wise that I can say it is the closest you can come to hearing your own imagination. speckled raindrops, sand dunes.<br />This Cd is a kiss in the wind, a wave on the feet, a whisper to innocence, this is music at its best in ways not known to many. exquisite and elegant,uncanny and sophisticated. it is a splatter of stars on a clear night. highly recommended for meditational purposes or deep relaxation.    I recently injured myself rather badly and have been stuck with a wheelchair, the only thing that gets my mind of my present troubles is this music. powerful and haunting. a must have .
0671027344|5.0|I read this book for the first time a few weeks ago after wanting to ever since it came out.  I was truly amazed.  I've read many books about adolescents seeing as how I am one, and I find them interesting.  I like to see how well I can relate them to my own life.  I'm a girl, and obviously the character in this book is a boy, but, none the less, it's easy to relate to him.  The way he captures everything he feels so effetively is one of the things that makes this book so incredible.  After reading it, I immediately gave it to my best friend, since I pass on all the good books I read to her.  This book can be read in a day or less-that's all it took me.  And I'm sure it'll be read again and again before it's put back on the bookshelf for good, if that ever even happens.  I advise anyone young or old to read this book because, even if you can't relate, it's still enjoyable in its humor and seriousness alike.
0671042858|4.0|Trisha - to say it rightaway - is not a character that is in any way too realistic. She is nine years old, has an understanding of baseball that is normal in a forty-year-old, reflects on her situation that is getting worse and worse like a mature and adult person, knows about survival and her metabolism more than any kid of her age. This is one side of the medal. The other side is much more positive. The book is really nerveracking. You can understand that someone gets lost in a vast ocean of trees and animals and evil spirits as it happens to Trisha. It is possible that search parties do not find a single person in this maze, and it is possible to fight for your life in an ordeal like this - even if you are only nine years old. Nature is your friend - but then it is also your enemy, it can help you survive and it can kill you. Even as an adult you would have to fight. You have to fight a merciless environment, and you have to fight yourself and the ghosts that try to kill you, the ghosts you imagine and those that haunt the woods, bears or real ghosts - who cares? So don't forget \\"a compass and good maps\\" as the master says. It may be vital.<br />A very good read, a genuine horror thriller.
B000003BF4|5.0|What a marvelous title for an album, \\"Get Yer Ya - Ya's Out\\" This to me has always been Charlie Watts album, he's even on the cover with his drum roadie. This album captures the dirty essence of the Stones in concert, you can almost hear the sweat streaking along the fret boards, and what an introduction to kick things off. \\"Does everything seem to be ready is everybody ready, ladies &amp; gentlemen the greatest rock &amp; roll band in the world, The Rolling Stones. With that the Stones were about to unleash a live performance that would be hailed as one of the greatest live performances ever recorded, the Stones breaking into a scorching version of \\"Jumpin Jack Flash\\". This was Mick Taylors first tour as The Rolling Stones guitarist, he was always a bit of a square key for a round lock, lets face it, he never actually looked like a Rolling Stone, but on this album the guitar solo in \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" is simply flawless, and on the two tributes to their inspiration Chuck Berry, \\"Carol\\"&amp; \\"Little Queenie\\", the boy wipes the floor. It is very different from a studio album, subtlety &amp; precision are gone, in their place you get roughness &amp; ferocity. The song \\"Midnight Rambler\\" is a good example, the studio version on the L.P. \\"Let It Bleed\\" is a stark, barren piece dominated by that sly old fox Jagger with his crafty vocal posing, in contrast the live version captured on Ya - Ya's is a heavy guitar - driven rocker that sends the audience berserk. As Mick Jugger tells the crowd before \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" \\"Charlies Good Tonight, Isn't He\\" well they were all good that night. Recorded in 1969 at Madison Square Gardens, Ya - Ya's is a brilliant document of a brilliant band on a brilliant night. Play it loud whilst drunk. Mott the Dog.
B00000BKI4|3.0|i am a major fan of the Rev--but this was a bit of a letdown.  one gets the feeling that the band is overly relying on all the orchestration on Deserters Songs on account of they have slacked on the songwriting end of it all.  there are moments of curiously beautiful soundscapes, particularly in the hazier dreamier passages, but, me, i would recommend that you get the earlier CDs and see just how much of Mercury Rev you can love because they make a mighty fine racket.  better records that came out around the same time (in the same genre) are THE BLACK WATCH &quot;the king of good intentions&quot; and THE FLAMING LIPS &quot;the soft bulletin&quot;
6305451591|5.0|This show is simply a wonderful classic. It has become one of my favourite shows. Not only does the show involves humour, it teaches history in a unqiue manner. Begnini has effectively utilised dark humour to produce a tear-jerking movie. He is able to address the disturbing history in a fun and amusing way. The actors and actresses are superb where i remember very clearly the scene where begnini's wife cries and her tears looked so real. Not forgetting the really cute son of theirs who is so hopelessly gullible and yet so smart at the same time. The music is also very nice and lyrical at times, making it a brillliant movie where music cannot be absent. I really recommend it as it has really left a very deep impression in me. Begnini Bravo!
B00003CXHJ|4.0|I have the DVD (Collector's Edition), and I enjoyed this movie very much.  The visual effects are great and so is the sound.  I especially liked the well-written script that keeps the watcher in suspense throughout this great movie.  The special features were a plus.  The reason I gave this movie four and not five stars is because the ending was not as brilliant as the rest of the movie.  I definitely encourage you to add this movie to your collection.

B0000029DD|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing.  The musicianship, execution, lyricism and emotion contained within are astounding.  I've had this album since it first came out, and I can honestly say that it's well over-and-above anything of it's time, and most anything thereafter.  Buckley had more guts and talent than 99.999 percent of the garb on the shelves for the past 3 years.  I'll admit, it took me a few listens to get past the radio friendly &quot;Last Goodbye&quot;...that is a solid track, but the genius and prophetic musicianship of the rest shines.  Truly.  Give it some time and LISTEN.  Original, soulful, bleeding, tender, anger, elation...this work has it all.  Oversaturated with substance.  It's a true classic.  We lost a muse of the ages.  Read &quot;Dream Brother&quot;.  You'll feel it.
B0000027RL|4.0|The album that started it all for America's best band of the 1990s. Ten was recorded in the whirlwind beginnings of the band. They had just signed Eddie Vedder as their incendiary lead vocalist and lead guitarist Mike McCready was yet to learn how to fit his spitfire solos into the songs which were primarily written by rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament. The unfamiliarity they had with each other is reflected on Ten. Firstly the sound is awful - I know the album was mastered in 1991 but I have CDs from the 1980s that have better sound than this. Eddie's vocals are buried in many songs (a fault rectified for VS), and the drums sound muffled and understated. McCready launches into a solo during any break of 2 seconds or more, whether it is warranted or not. This sounds like I am giving them a fair serve, and I guess I am. I have 8 or so live albums from Pearl Jam where they perform all the Ten songs superbly. If they were to re-record Ten today it would be a completely different album (providing they didn't use the equally murky Binaural recording equipment). Classics such as Even Flow, Jeremy, Alive, Black lack so much on the Ten album. Even Flow is painfully slow, Jeremy has too much production done on Eddies backing vocals, Alive is also too slow and precise and Black should be acoustic lead for best results. Songs like Garden and Release sound great on Ten though. 5 star songs on a 1 star recording - an average of 4 for mine.
0790729628|1.0|I give this a 1-star rating for Director's Cut.  The original version rated 5 stars.  The DC removed much vital information, like the background to the exchange when Decker is picked up to be forced back into work as a BR.  The DC also inserted an idiotic scene of a unicorn trapsing through a glade - looked like it was lifted directly from &quot;Legend.&quot;<br />I would venture that some preponderance of the intelligentsia expressing preference for the DC saw the OV first, thus they have already been exposed to the background info before seeing the DC.  If you see the DC first, good luck.  I wouldn't recommend seeing the DC at all.  The OV is one of my favorite films.  I resent that people who feel they know what the rest of the population's tastes &quot;should&quot; be have determined which version we may view.
B0000028UK|5.0|Pearl Jam return from Ten with a better balanced album, with Eddie Vedder focusing his anger on abused children (Daughter), absent parents (Daughter, Go), guns (Glorifed G), music executives (Blood) war(Dissident) and the human race (Rats) as a whole. Their most angry album - every song with the exception of Elderly Woman has an axe to grind. Eddie's vocals carry this album - he sings every word like he means it, and that carries through to the listener. I personally skip over Blood, Rats and WMA now, but these songs are so politically inspired and angry they are worthy aditions on this firey album.
0670880728|5.0|This is a must read for any woman who has been through the twenty-something singles experience. My book group read this, and it was the best discussion we have ever had. (a lot of wine was consumed that nightm and the next day there were many hungover e-mails sent back and forth in bridget-speak) It is hysterically funny and satisfying at the end. I also recommend the sequel.
B000002UAX|4.0|The White Album contains music of every possible style around. George's mind was lost in the Indian highland, John was coming to terms with heroin addiction, Ringo was forced to add many of his parts in later on, and Paul hit the piano over the guitar. All these factors made this the most diverse Beatles album they ever released. It is emotional stuff too - take a listen to Lennon's Yer Blues on CD2 for an insight into real pain. My favourites songs are Johns (Dear Prudence, Happiness Is a Warm Gun, I'm So Tired, Yer Blues and Cry Baby Cry), Pauls (I Will, Back in the USSR, Blackbird and Helter Skelter) and Georges (While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Savoy Truffle). People complain that this should have been a one CD album. Even if you remove the 'filler' tracks, you would still need a second CD to contain all the classics - so why not have the madness of Revolution 9, the carefree ...Monkey, and country Rocky Racoon. Definitely not the Beatles best or easiest listening work - Rubber Soul and Revolver take this mantle easily, but probably the most interesting collection of songs.
0395645662|5.0|In the Giver, the main character, Jonas, lives in a perfect, organized world. There is no crime, poverty, or prejudice, and everyone's happy, and everyone has a job, there's even control of the weather. And whenever someone was not able to function in the  world, they were &quot;released&quot;. Everything is assigned; spouses, jobs and even kids are assigned. You get your job when you are twelve, at the ceremony of twelve's, there is also a ceremony for the other years, but this is the most important. Well, Jonas is assigned for a particularly special assignment. He was chosen to be the receiver of memories, who kept all the memories, feelings, and knowledge from Jonas's community and for everywhere around the world. The previous receiver gives Jonas all the memories, and he has to keep them. But Jonas thinks that the memories belong to the people, and secretly him and the Giver devise a plan to give them back.<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book that you cant put down. Parts of it are hard to understand, and I'd only recommend it to someone who is a decent reader of all books. The book offers characters that you can relate too, and a brilliant plot. If you're in the mood from a great book don't miss this one!
B000002U8A|4.0|I don't get why most other reviewers bust on this album. Okay, granted that this isn't as awesome as &quot;Rio&quot;, and has a very forgettable song, &quot;I Take the Dice&quot;, everything else is fine. &quot;The Reflex&quot; is classic, &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; may have slight reminders of David Bowie, but not enough to sound alike, and is danceable/catchy. &quot;(I'm Looking for) Cracks in the Pavement&quot; is a nice song. I can't figure out why everyone else hates it. Hey, look at it this way: it ain't as bad as &quot;I Take the Dice&quot;. &quot;Of Crime and Passion&quot; is faster, and then comes &quot;Union of the Snake&quot;. &quot;Shadows on Your Side&quot; is catchy. &quot;Tiger Tiger&quot; is an adventurous instrumental piece. Last, but certainly not least, is &quot;The Seventh Stranger&quot;. It induces tears at times, it's that sad.  Again, a good buy, except for &quot;I Take the Dice.&quot;
6305807086|4.0|This movie, although not a publicized at it ought to have been, is incredible.  Saying that I would also have to add that I am a John Malkovich fan.  Not as good as his sinister roles, but just as enjoyable.  His ego portrayed in this movie seems to convey what all people think of actors while off the &quot;job&quot;.  And more to the point, how they see those not in the craft.  Darkly humorous and an overall fun movie to watch.
B000002V1D|4.0|&quot;The Wedding Album&quot; signifies a listenable return for Duran Duran, with the ensemble being (at that point, 1993) Simon, Nick, John, and Warren. &quot;Too Much Information&quot; begins the album, which is fast, and begins to show the senior DD members' political side, i.e. &quot;Destroyed by MTV, I hate to bite the hand that feeds me.&quot; Next up is the romantic ballad (but not too slow) &quot;Ordinary World&quot;. Then &quot;Love Voodoo&quot;, a mysterious song. &quot;Drowning Man&quot; isn't very good, to me at least. Ditto with &quot;Shotgun&quot;. &quot;Come Undone&quot; is up next, a moody song, but is addictive. &quot;Breath After Breath&quot; is interesting, in that some of the song is sung in Portugese. Next, my personal favorite, &quot;UMF&quot;, which is the sexiest thing I've ever heard! Fellow female Simon LeBon fans, this is worth the album alone. Lyrics like &quot;Put it to me baby, you can feel love tumblin' down,&quot; and &quot;I just wanna wrap myself in ya baby, we can tell the world we're foolin' around&quot; really prove that Simon is totally irresistible. A cover of &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; follows up next, which is pretty good. &quot;None of the Above&quot; is all right, and &quot;Shelter&quot; is good, another sweet wanting song. &quot;To Whom it May Concern&quot; and &quot;Sin of the City&quot; are strange, the former being almost completely awful. The latter is alright, but I don't particularly prefer listening to it. Another political song, about a New York nightclub going up in flames. BUY THIS ALBUM, if you're a long-time DD fan, or even if you aren't. Even if you just got into them, as I did, this album is a MUST! *By the way, to set you straight (DD haters) Duran Duran were the second most popular &quot;Teeny bop&quot; group (besides the Beatles). And besides, &quot;Teeny bop&quot; is an okay phrase to use with them, though not accurate. It better describes a singer/group who COULDN'T play an instrument, a.k.a. Debbie Gibson, Menudo (Ricky Martin when he was a teen; awful, just like he is now), and of course, the unforgiveable Osmonds in the '70's. At least most of DD could play an instrument. And the &quot;Boy Band&quot; title for them makes a bit more sense, mostly attributed to their looks. (Come on, would YOU say that Justin Timberlake is hotter than Simon LeBon?!)...Not to mention that Simon can sing one hell of a lot better. But I don't know why people call N'Sync and BSB &quot;Boy Bands&quot; when none of them can play an instrument. Sure they can sing...just not that well, and like girls. Simon has a sexy, MASCULINE voice. Unlike Justin...but I'll stop comparing now, though I've gone on a rant. Anyway, just keep in mind that Duran Duran set the stage for classic music videos on MTV, and awesome fast pop songs.
0345298349|5.0|I often return to \\"Gorky Park.\\" I almost didn't go there at all. The film was not very good, although I liked Joanna Pakula. One day I read \\"Polar Star\\" (literally in one day, since I could not put it down) and I was hooked: I had to read \\"Gorky Park.\\" Almost ten years later, I think I've read it ten times. I can always spare a day or two for one of my favorite books.<br /><br />Welcome to the world of Investigator Arkady Renko, whose superiors use him, whose wife doesn't love him, whose country is like an insane asylum where the patients have the run of the place and sane people like Renko do the best they can. This is a great mystery novel, but the level of Smith's writing puts him far above the level of what we expect from \\"genre\\" novels. His characters became real people for whose fate I really cared. His plot is complicated but not overwhelmingly so. He does not trick the reader. And his detective, the militia investigator Arkady Renko, is one of the most memorable detectives in fiction: smart without being pedantic, intelligent, patriotic (yes, our Arkady truly loves his country), loyal to his friends and the woman he falls in love with. This is not the picture of a perfect man, but that of a basically good man. Renko is believable in his feelings and attitudes, and that is due to Smith's talent. Also thanks to the author we get an almost Dickensian description of Moscow and the inner workings of criminal investigations in the old Soviet Union. I felt I was in Moscow, and I finished reading the book truly caring for the characters in it, particularly Renko. Smith's novel is powerful, well-written, engaging, insightful, and a lesson in how talented writing can be applied to genre fiction for the benefit of everyone involved. \\"Gorky Park\\" and the other Renko novels are so far above genre, they make the rest look really bad, and they provide hope for genre novels in general: talent should not be divorced from entertainment. Excellent read.
0553573403|5.0|I had given up on tome like fantasy epics... Until I read a short story by Mr Martin in the &quot;Legends 2&quot; collection, called &quot;The Hedge Knight&quot;, and I was hooked!  I've read all the 3 available books of the Song Of Fire And Ice series. Simply put, this is incredibly well written fantasy/adventure series for those who enjoy the genre, but really don't care for a children's book.  This is adult reading, and rather habit forming (I can't recall the last time I bought a hardcover fiction book, but I couldn't wait for &quot;A Storm Of Swords&quot; to come out in paperback!  3 great books so far, and I would give 6 stars to each one in this series. Adult readers, who want to get into this story won't be dissapointed.  There's enough intrigue to rival histories of the Hundred Years War &amp; the War of the Roses to keep  the reader interested &amp; reading till the wee hours of the morning, and often making it difficult to make it to work on time! Enjoy! Try this first one. I believe you will like it!
B000056K04|2.0|I have been a fan for almost ten years - I go to the concerts, own all the albums, love about every single song....until now.   This album is just plain disappointing.  Where is Dave?  I miss him.  It's such a tragic sell-out, pop-culture, bubble gum, wannabe story. If you must purchase, The Space Between is the only decent song.
B00000F1D3|5.0|I do! Cher newest album is a #1 hit. The songs are too hot, and you just can't hwlp but want to sing-a-long and dance the night away. Cher sounds absolutely great. her voice is very powerful and fantastic. I especially love the Cher Bot(R) vocal effects in Believe.
0800141601|2.0|Richard Gere stars as an American Lancelot in King Arthur's court.  Sean Connery dodders around as King Arthur and Julia Ormond... well, she looks pretty as Guinevere.  But that's all she's required to do here.  They make a boring trio- but poor Connery's the most boring:  he gets all the dialogue about justice and honor and everything Camelot stands for... which, apparently consists of wearing matching blue uniforms and carrying torches.  And being a good citizen and having no personality.  <br /><br /> Oh yeah- and what happens to the boring guy in a love triangle?  If you don't know the answer to that one, then &quot;First Knight&quot; is the medieval film for you- because it contains nothing medieval whatsoever.  For those of you who want a movie to make you feel like there was a reason you chose to see it, rather than staying home and trimming your sideburns while watching a &quot;Full House&quot; rerun... well, you won't enjoy it. <br /> The only person allowed any personality is Ben Kingsley as Malagant- a character who replaces Mordred in the story- and that's because he's the bad guy and you're SUPPOSED to hate him.  In the original tales, Arthur fathers Mordred with his own half-sister and this sets up Camelot's fall and Arthur's death.  Evidently, paricide and incest are too controversial for Jerry Zucker and his safer-than-milksop movie.  I can see how these themes might offend the middle-of-the-road movie-goers.  Too bad no one worries about offending people who actually like good movies. <br /> Of course, since they dumped all the religious and mystical  stuff and aimed the movie at people who don't know anything about King Arthur, why not call Malagant Mordred anyway?  Or why not call King Arthur Dudley McKinney and set the story in the Bronx, or in a lighthouse or on the moon?  Or better yet, replace the actors with sock puppets and save their giant salaries.  Donate the money to libraries so they can buy the unfinished John Steinbeck translation of&quot;Le Morte D'Arthur,&quot; or T.H. White's &quot;The Once and Future King.&quot; <br /> Why'd they make a version of the Arthurian legend minus anything remotely legendary?  I don't know.  I don't want to know.  But I do know I never want to see this movie again.  Instead, I'll be watching &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail.&quot;
B00003CXSP|4.0|Like the novel, Ridley Scott's Hannibal is a journey into Lecter's universe. Julianne Moore said it best: this film is like an &quot;hallucination&quot;. The hallucination of a madman (in this case an almost godly-superhuman madman not your real-life serial killer) in which the madman is the hero.<br />The Silence of the Lambs was basically about Clarice Starling. Hannibal is more than ever about Hannibal Lecter, and so the movie must be as morbidly perverse as the doctor himself, because this is his world. It's his movie. Starling had her chance to be the star in Silence of the Lambs. Now Lecter gets his in Hannibal.<br />Director Ridley Scott is able to capture the essence of Hannibal's universe, FIRST through beautiful, luscious visuals (this film is much more beautiful than Demme's Silence - hope John Mathieson will not be forgotten come next year's Oscars), THEN through classical music (without sounding pretentious I think Hans Zimmer's original score also has a very classical root - hope Zimmer is not forgotten come next year's Oscars - this is a masterful score), and FINALLY through gruesome, shocking images. I'm sorry but the violence was necessary for this film, because, again, it is Lecter's world we are entering. Frankie Faison (who plays Barney) also said something interesting that brings further understanding of this film: &quot;Silence of the Lambs was more in your head, while Hannibal is more in your face&quot;, and that's exactly right. Since this is a madman's hallucination it wouldn't make sense to hide us from its true horrors.<br />I'm disappointed, not by the movie, but by the reaction of most critics (but thank you Mr. Corliss). I'm not going to use that old excuse and say critics didn't understand it, but your enjoyment of a movie depends on the way you perceive things.<br />My only problem with the film is that the supporting characters lack the depth of the novel, particularly Cordell Doemling and Krendler. I would have liked to see Mason'ssister Margot who was erased for the film. The film's ending is an interesting one, although very different from the novel.  As different as the ending is the last two minutes WERE in the book, only it doesn't occur at the same time in the story. <br />Hannibal has flaws, but it remains a strong, moving (I was moved by the dynamic between Lecter and Starling, especially when it all comes together in the end), sensory experience. Hopkins remains hypnotic in most scenes (the Academy, remember this). Julianne Moore delivers the goods, particularly in the emotional scenes. Gary Oldman as Mason Verger is chilling with his rusty, raw voice (hope the makeup for this film is not forgotten come next year's Oscars, that would be a crime).<br />...let Hannibal haunt you!!! And don't compare it too much to Silence of the Lambs, because it's not the same kind of movie and its aims are not the same.<br />Note: Hope the studio goes all out on the DVD and make it the ultimate Hannibal Lecter collector's edition. Documentary, deleted scenes (I think there's an hour of unused footage, so put it there please), in-depth commentaries, behind-the-scenes photos, maybe a little word from Thomas Harris (that would be a dream come true Mr. Harris), and so on, and so on.
B000002KAT|5.0|A co-worker let me borrow me this cd, and I knew that I had to buy a copy for myself.  I cannot believe how utterly amazing this album is.  I have listened to it repeatedly since I bought it, and still have not tired of it.  This is one of the best purchases I've ever made!
0671004107|4.0|I think most people that read this book don't get past it's surface of a search for extra-terrestrial life.  Certainly, it's a flashy surface to the story.  This book is really more one of faith, and how a faith in science and a faith in God are not necessarily contradictory, and in fact are very much alike.  This is NOT a book about little green men, it's book about how different people believe in different things, and how their goals can bring them together to do great things, even when the reasons behind their actions are very different.<br />Worth a read!
0441172717|5.0|This was the first trek onto the sands of Dune, the first tale of Paul Muad'Dib and the Atriedes name that would haunt the planet of Arrakis forever.  This novel stands as a true pinnacle of science fiction, the alpha and omega of fantasy.  Mind you, I am not a Dune fanatic that believes every novel ever touched by Frank Herbert is gold.  I simply believe that this novel is one of the most finely crafted masterpieces of all time.<br />We are presented with a word unlike no other.  The Imperium is headed by an ignorant Emporer, and feuding houses war against each other in a legalized game of assassination.  Two feuding houses, Atriedes and Harkonnen, battle for control of the planet where melange, the spice and currancy of the Imperium, is found.  This spice allows mystical power and longevity, to say the least.  And with this simple outline, the world of Dune is created.<br />With social, political, environmental, and religious strands woven into this grand tapestry, we are shown the world of Dune.  Never have we seen a world on such a grand scale...a world that we can actually see and feel.  This is not a world of paper, but a world of color, life, and spice.  We are not visitors of the world, but wanderers of Dune, Fremen travelling the sands.<br />Yet, I am not going to rave about the book without giving small rants (every novel, not matter how great has some flaws).  At some points, this novel can drag.  Many of the dialogue is internal, and the long winded sentences can slow some down (many reasons why my companions have thrown down the book).  Yet, there is another part of this novel that I loved, yet many others hated: the novel is deep.  Deep, enthralling, detailed, and engrossing, and many readers are not ready for that level of experience.<br />So, in conclusion, if you are a reader of science fiction and fantasy, or are just looking for a good read, pick up Dune, and live the life of Dune once more.
B0000029AL|5.0|Aerosmith started with a bang on this album. They established a unique style early on and have always managed to keep this unique sound. &quot;Make It&quot; is a surprisingly motivational song, which starts the album off with an appropriate &quot;Good evening people, welcome to the show&quot;. &quot;Dream On&quot; is one of Aerosmith's best and one of rock's best. Few songs can compare with the haunting feeling and emotional power that Aerosmith was able to achieve with just a few chords in this song. &quot;One Way Street&quot; is a combination of rock and blues and is one of my personal all-time favorite songs. &quot;Mama Kin&quot; is an Aerosmith standard and another song that is very simple yet you can't get out of your head. &quot;Write Me a Letter&quot; is an upbeat, fun rock/blues combo about being on the road away from loved ones and the need for communication. &quot;Movin' Out&quot; is another favorite of mine, with an absolute explosion of emotion throughout the song.     That being said, Aerosmith came together on their first album and displayed a chemistry and love of their music that few bands can appropriately display. This album is an excellent addition to any music collection.
B00000ICN5|4.0|SRV was one of the greatest. This ablum features the studio versions of some his classic tracks such as 'love struck baby' and 'texas flood'. Well worth the listen. However, as with most of his albums, there are a bunch of forgettable tracks which diminish the impact.
0676591914|3.0|This book is about a girl named Susanna.  It is written by Susanna Kaysen.  At the beginning of the story she is put in a taxi and sent to a mental hospital.  The name of the hospital is McLean.  She meets lots of teenage girls named Lisa, Polly, and Georgina.  Georgina was Susanna's roommate.  Susanna did not like one thing about the hospital.  It was the rooms.  They were really tiny with high, small windows and bare mattresses.  If you walked in the hallway you could see people either sitting or laying on the mattresses.  To enter or exit there were two locked two doors.  Lisa was one of the popular girls in the hospital.  She did not like the hospital.  She tried to run away beacause she was bored.  The problem was that she always got caught by one of the nurses.  The nurses there were really nice.  Later on they met this patient named Valerie.  She was a fun person to be with.  So everybody liked her.  Eventually everyone except Valerie were sent back home.  Susanna was the first person to get married after she got out of the hospital.  Later Georgina gets married too.  They both keep in touch with each other.  For a while they lived in North Cambridge and visited each other.  Then Susanna moved to Boston with her husband.  I recommend this book to someone who likes to know every single detail about other people.  This book has so many characters.  Although it is a good book.  I suggest that everyone should at least try reading this book.
B000001F6N|5.0|I can still remember the chills that hit me when I heard John Mayall's piano and Peter Green's guitar on the opening track. Paul Butterfield's first album punched me in the gut and John Mayall's 'Hard Road' delivered the uppercut that hit me in the jaw and knocked me out to the blues ever since. I prefer this album over the Eric Clapton beano album (just) because it highlights John Mayall much more, showing how good he on harp, piano, organ and guitar. The other factor is Peter Green! His simplicity of style and playing demonstrates that you do not need to play notes at a million miles an hour. The feeling he gets on many tracks from a single note, particularly the 'supernatural' is unsurpassed. It was a great pleasure to hear Mayall redo 'A Hard Road' on his recent album 'Padlock on the Blues'.
B000056K04|3.0|I purchased &quot;Everyday&quot; on the first day of release anticipating the style I have come to adore the past 9 years:  raw, passionate, transport-your-soul DMB.  Can't find it on &quot;Everyday&quot;.  Those of us who spend our hard earned dollars to hear the live shows will be gravely disappointed with this over-produced (go away Glen Ballard) badly in need of substance (Steve Lilliwhite) album.  The 2000 tour gave us a delicious taste of what we will be craving for and that taste is missing on this Ballard release.  There is no &quot;Sweet Up n' Down&quot; or &quot;JTR&quot; or &quot;Bartender&quot;. There are, however, a few redeeming qualities:  &quot;When the World Ends&quot; is VERY lustful (although its title doesn't imply such), and the title track &quot;Everyday&quot; will make you happily move your feet in an attempt to do that thing Dave does with his feet. Dave's voice, too, is still seductively smooth. More than anything, this album makes me most grateful for live tape trading circles...I can at least hear &quot;Sweet Up n' Down&quot; with Boyd, and the rest of the band, when I want the taste of rare steak.  I find the overcooked, overprocessed, tough chew of &quot;Everyday&quot; a bit hard to swallow.  The true essence of the songs are merely flickers through the cloud of production/participation of &quot;Top 40&quot; Ballard...and the true reward we fans will have for our long wait on this fourth studio release will be when our ticket stubs are torn as we pass through the gates to hear DMB live, without Ballard. Buy &quot;Everyday&quot; just because it is DMB...and spit out the rest to clear your mouth for the raw meat of the upcoming tour.
B0000027RL|5.0|Basically, I can't say enough about this CD. Pearl Jam is my favorite band and this is my favorite album. All of the songs are fantastic and all of them fit together extremely well. Obviously, Eddie Vedder is the singer of our generation and his performance on Ten is outstanding. I know this album gets lumped in with grunge, but it really isn't a grunge album outside of the fact that they're from Seattle. It really isn't quite as driven by melodies and chords that Nirvana's music is. Although Nevermind is considered to be a better and more influential album than Ten, I can't think of any rock album whose sound has been copied more than this. Most of these attempted replications have been momumental failures (see Silverchair and Creed). Considering that this was Pearl Jam's debut album, it is an amazing achievement. This is, in my opinion, the greatest album of the 90's. Unfortunately, that isn't saying too much.
B0000029DD|5.0|What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said?  Nothing.  I'll say this, though.  This album moves me like no other.  It is at the absolute top of my favorite album list, and I wish all musicians out there strived to achieve beauty and say something in their music like Jeff Buckley.
0553579908|5.0|I am an ardent reader of fantasy, and even though I must have read more than a 1000 books in the genre and found many of them great, I always knew, I hadn't found my favorite... till I read &quot;Game of thrones&quot; the first volume in this series. It had ALL I ever wanted of a fantasy series.<br />Accordingly I awaited this second volume with a mixture od anticipation and dread. Often middle novels in a series are slow and transistory, the exposition is done in the first part the resolution of the plot lines left to the final volume. Often fans of a series defend that as a necesarry build up, a good example would be the &quot;wheel of time&quot; series by Robert Jordan which consisted of &quot;necesarry build-ups&quot; for the last 5 volumes without resolving anything. George R.R. Martin proves that isn't a necessity. If anything Clash of kings surpasses Game of thrones.<br />Clash of Kings is fast, things happen, plot lines are resolved, not to say decapitated. At the same time new characters and plotlines are introduced to fill the gaps left, but never in a number too great. The most interesting part though is originality. Martin is finally an author that has grasped that humans can be more diverse, strange, exiting and interesting than any fantasy creature. He also doesn't follow rules. Anyone can die, even characters he seemed to build up as heros, that makes us care all the more for the survivors.<br />***Spoiler Warning*** Don't read on if you didn't read game of thrones*<br />&quot;Clash of kings&quot; starts were &quot;game of thrones&quot; ended. Catelyn tries to find a compromise with Renly, Arya is still on the run, Theon Eddard's ward is sent to his father, to bring him to the Stark's side, Tyrion takes over as hand. Newly introduced as a &quot;point of view&quot; character is the onion knight a follower of Stannis, one of Martin's best creations, but then Martin has few second best ones.<br />All in all a masterwork of modern fantasy.
B000056N8X|4.0|I thought this movie was excellent.<br />I thought the first Highlander was awesome, but lets face it, it doesn't hold up well over time (especially after you have followed the series). The issues of immortality have been tackled in a much more thorough way in the series, and Endgame tackles the ULTIMATE issue for immorals of good character, which is...I won't spoil it for you.<br />Endgame has a much better plot line, although somewhat rushed.  Jacob Kell is not a very scary bad guy though. Most of the time, you just want him to shut up.  It is completely NOT plausible that Donnie Yen's character would be weaker than him.  The fight scene between Adrian Paul and Donnie Yen is one of the BEST WEAPONS scenes EVER.  That is saying alot.  For any of you who are Jet Li fans, Donnie Yen fought Jet Li to a standstill in Once Upon In China II it one of the best martial arts movies in history.<br />Better, braver storylines, much better swordplay...what else do you judge Highlander movies by?
B00000F14B|4.0|I confess, I am a Music Man freak.  I sing allong to the soundtrack at least once a week, and I still can't get enough of it.  <br />What makes me love the musical so much is that the music and the settings make me feel like I really am in &quot;IOWAY&quot;.  I see Professor Harold Hills all over the place in real life, and this play shows you that they can be human beings and have anima (soul).  Robert Preston was born to do this role.  It is a true shame that after the fame he achieved on the stage and in this film of The Music Man, he did not recieve as much fame in his later movies.  It's hard to believe that he was a common secondary actor in westerns and had never used his singing capabilities before The Music Man.  <br />I know of many well- educated Marian Librarians who need Professors like Harold to show them that they are special and better than any other kind of company.  When Sirley Jones sings &quot;And if ocassionaly he'd ponder, what makes Shakespeare and Beetoven great, him I could love till I died.&quot;  My liberal arts mind melts into putty.  <br />The movie never looses the touch that the original cast had to the play.  The reason is because the director, Da Costa, was the director of the play on Broadway as well as the film.  The scenes and lighting move allong in the film as they would on a stage.  Most of the scenes, for example, are concluded by a shillouette light on a main character that fades.  The choreography of the dance scenes are spectacular, and very well constructed, like you would expect them to be on a stage.<br />The DVD comes with a lot of great extra material.  Shirley Jones is the narrator of two doccumentaries.  Much behind the scenes infromation is unvieled in these doccumentaries.  A feature that I use a lot is the English subtitles, which are placed in the black part of the screen so you can easilly sing allong to the wide array of songs.  There are the usual talent files, original trailers, and more.  For any fan of musicals, the doccumentaries are a treat all by themselves.<br />I have not focused  a lot on the story of the movie, because I suspect you have already seen this classic film or have heard of the play.  If you have not seen or heard of the play, I won't tell you the story anyway, you have to see it for yourself.  Believe me, it's worth it.  Before you know it, you will be singing &quot;76 trombones&quot; to your hearts delight.
B000050FEN|5.0|One of the best and most frightening movies of the past 10 years, &quot;Se7en&quot; contains on the edge of your seat terror, great acting by the police duo of Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, and disturbing realism. David Fincher, who later directed &quot;Fight Club&quot;, is on top of his game here, crafting a horribly disturbing script about a serial killer who matches his murders with one of the seven deadly sins. Freeman and Pitt watch as the murders become more brutal and brutal, as the corpses pile up and each deadly sin is fulfilled. And in the nail-biting last 30 minutes, the clever plot twist brings out the cold-blooded killer (played by Kevin Spacey in a small role).<br />This movie is made better by the chilly and dark environment that Fincher chooses to use for the city. The dark and rainy city streets make each murder seem worse and magnifies the frustration of Pitt and Freeman, who seem helpless in their pursuit of a killer that they cannot capture. The DVD is packed with extras, from actor-director commentaries to deleted scenes to alternative endings. You can see just how much work went into making this movie, from the crafting of &quot;John Doe's notebooks&quot; to set designs. The extras included in this edition of the movie make it A SOLID BUY, on top of the digitally remastered widescreen version of the film on the first DVD.<br />This is arguably Fincher's masterpiece, although with many movies ahead of him it is hard to say what he'll do next. Freeman has never been better, playing the grizzled cop vet teaching Pitt the ways of the street. An underestimated thriller upon its release, &quot;Seven&quot; will eventually take its place with &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; as the best horror-thrillers of its time.

0804106304|3.0|Have you ever imagined how your life would be if you moved from &quot;your country&quot; to &quot;their country?&quot; Amy Tan, author of The Joy Luck Club, did a fantastic job of pulling me (the reader) into the lives of four Chinese women that were affected by their &quot;move&quot; from China to America in the nineteen forties.  The &quot;move&quot; later affects their daughter's choices.  The minute I picked up the novel I was mesmerized with the memories shared, lessons learned, and four very different mother-daughter relationships. I enjoyed the cultural aspect of The Joy Luck Club.  The game from China is the organizing principle of the book.  June's mother says, &quot;[My] idea was to have a gathering of four women, one for each corner of the mahjong table.&quot; The author clearly tells stories of the four women and their daughters, and how it effects both their lives.  The author indicates that June benefits a great deal from this club, when she takes her mother's place after her death.<br />Naturally, daughters and mothers have frequent disagreements.  Amy Tan shows this thoughtout the book, which creates a strong tone of reality.  I can relate easily with the daughters, in their desires to escape from parental guidance and gain freedom.  Afterall, even now my mother uses her past experiences to aid in guiding and shaping my life.  I feel that I will treasure that practice and apply it to my children as well.  Because of this book I now look differently at my mother's final verdicts.  As I read I kept in mind the thought- if the daughters would have just listened to their mothers, and not their uncompromising minds, they could have avoided so much pain.  For instance, comments such as &quot;If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold.&quot; This thought speaks clearly for the reader, bringing truth and meaning to the text.  If the lips are removed, protection is not present, and therefore the teeth will not be as they should. Applying it to The Joy LuckClub - if the daughters do not take their mother's nurturing advice the results of rebellion may end in suffering.  If I were brought into the situation (as one of the daughters) i would have dealt with the situation just as they did. Fortunatly, I gained wisdom being the reader, and will apply the wisdom to my daily life, and especially my personal encounters with my mother. Nevertheless, the mothers in this novel have their way of instilling an irritating feeling in their daughters character with comments such as, &quot;You want to live like mess.  What I can say?&quot; Are all moms alike?  The majoriy of mothers are pros at laying a guilt trip or just saying things to get us to think... it works for me.  The daughters in this novel somewhat pick up on this concept as well. Not much reading took place before I was standing back and observing all angles of the mother-daughter issues.  This is due to Amy Tan's rmarkable choice of words.  Although well written, this novel is a challenge to follow - keeping up with which character is speaking from page to page.  The confusion contributes to the reader's intense curiosity, which makes the read more exciting and real.  Read The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan and find out for yourself.  I did, and I am truely rewarded because of it.

0812550706|5.0|This book takes place in the future, after the first invasion of an alien race commonly known as buggers.  The next invasion is inevidable, and the world believes it to be soon.  Time is running out, and a child prodigy known as Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin may be the human race's last hope.  The population on Earth has gotten so high that the International Fleet (the Earthwide government) has ordered that only two children may be brought into the world per family.  Only by order, may a family have three children without being looked down upon.  Peter was the eldest, a genius, but too cruel.  Valentine was the second, a genius, but too mild.  Then the governement asked the Wiggins to have another child, a Third.  Ender was that child.  It seemed he was the combination of both children.  He was approved and they moved him to a special school where he would learn how to fight in Zero-G, and hopefully move up to Command School.  The IF has high hopes and will work him thouroughly if not breaking him, or possibly killing him.  This is by far the best book I've ever read, in the Science Fiction genre and others.  If you read one book in your life, read this book.  Lend it to your friends and family.  It'll spread like the plague, except it'll be liked by all.
B000002UAU|3.0|Have a feeling that my dislike of this recording relative to other Beatles recordings is the hype.  Not a bad record, just bloated with lots of ordinary songs.  Yet I was lead to believe it was their masterpiece. What a crock. The Who Sell Out, another &quot;concept&quot; record released that same year is far superior. On the plus side, Lovely Rita and A Day in the Life are wonderful, but 2 great songs on a Beatles record?  Heck, Let it Be had more than that.  Perhaps judged in the context of it's time it was great, but so were Abbey Road and Revolver and they still sound great.  I won't go into &quot;Within Without You&quot; because I if I do I will have to dock it another star.
B000021XS0|5.0|I have listened to DT since the beginning, and have always like them a lot.  But this recording sets a mark which they themselves may find difficult to match, let alone any others.<br />To give some background, I'm 38, still have an extensive *record* collection as well as CDs, and have been a long-time Yes, ELP, Led Zep, 'Sabbath, and Metallica fan. Tastes also include Jazz and Fusion and some classical. I &quot;Just Say No&quot; to Country and mainstream dance crap.<br />Long after purchasing 'Scenes From A Memory', I still listen to it regularly. Sometimes daily. Without a doubt, I think this is the most phenominal recording ever made. Dazzling riffs, stunning vocals and wonderful songs that get better and better the more you listen.  It is the answer to the question &quot;What would happen if you put together 5 musicians, each (arguably) amongst the Top 5 in the world at their instruments, and they actually stayed together awhile?&quot;<br />After listening to this CD for the first time, and after the 10th, 50th or 500th time, I still think to myself &quot;What a ride.&quot;
B000002UAR|5.0|In many ways this is my favorite Beatles recording.  Ambitious and artful, yet it still rocks like the earlier recordings. For me that's the best of both worlds. Tempted to give it 4 stars because of the inclusion of &quot;Love You Too&quot;, but I just can't. Worth the price just for &quot;She Said She Said&quot;.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This soundtrack surprised me.  I knew that I wanted to listen to it, and I borrowed it from a friend.  I didn't know that I would spend the next couple of days listening to it back to back.<br />I was a little wary of modern interpretations of Old Time music.  I love the Alan Lomax collections, and I was afraid of what would be lost in the translation.  There is something about field recordings of folk music that a studio cannot capture.  They have a certain realness about them.<br />Well, I had nothing to fear.  Each of these songs is treated like a treasure, with respect and reverence.  One track, &quot; 'Po Lazarus &quot; is an Alan Lomax field recording with prisoners singing while they work.  &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; is also the classic Harry McClintock version.  There are no egos in these recordings, and each track is about the song, not the singers.<br />&quot;O Death&quot; deserves to be singled out, as it flows through you with a certain undeniable power.<br />I recommend anyone who enjoys this album to do a search for Alan Lomax.  You will not be disappointed.
B000002UB3|5.0|Though it was released before Let it Be, Abbey Road was the Beatles last relase, and a fine one at that.  Still sounds fresh, like it could have been recorded yesterday. George weighs in heavy with 2 great songs, and latter half shows John and Paul at their finest. Holds up as well as anything they recorded. Too bad they couldn't have done a few more like this.
B00003A9QI|5.0|This is a pretty score. I never saw the movie but, I read the book. I really like Rachel Portman's work on &quot;Emma&quot; so, I bought this and I am satisified.
B000002UDB|4.0|Not their most ambitious record, but one of the most enjoyable. A few misfires early on, but really picks up steam on the latter half.  Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane alone make it better than Sgt. Pepper.
B000002HPT|4.0|Ever since the '70's Progressive Rock era paved the way for overblown '80's self-indulgence, the artistic quality to music has been lost to hyped-up, radio-friendly, instantly-popular hit singles that have the shelflife of a dying horse. The only relatively new band that has managed to inspire the spirit of musical experimentation is Tool. That's what makes Dream Theater's music a breath of fresh air, and &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot; has to be one of their best albums. There are recognizable elements of Queensryche, King Crimson, Yes, and early Metallica, all blended together to showcase great musical talent on the part of the band members, both in a technical sense and in an artistic sense. The tempo changes are reminiscent of Rush (maybe not as complex, but still just as explosive), the juxtaposition of ethereal synthesizers with heavy guitar licks (heavy both in distorted crunch and in the energy and feeling the players put into it), and the great lyrics and vocals come together seamlessly in songs like &quot;Hollow Years&quot; and &quot;New Millennium.&quot; Not quite loud enough to appeal to chronic metalheads, but the musical proficiency of this band is enough to attract true fans of progressive rock. This is a wonderful album from a wonderful band who put the art back in art-rock. It's an album that is destined to take your way of thinking about music to a different plane. Listen to it!
