B003EROKVG|2|Did not seem to have an noticeable impact on the wiper.
B003CK5QL8|3|First time replacing the seals so I'm not sure if I did it wrong or its just not a great product, but they still leak.
B001SLEMFE|5|Although I was a bit skeptical of the quality of these covers (ie. too inexpensive to be good) , I ordered them on the basis of the positive reviews I read.  Yesterday, we installed the covers on all 4 seats. They installed easily, fit the seats very well(they even fit over the arm rests), and appear to be durable enough to handle the wear & tear from our (large) dogs, who often ride with my wife in the van.  They have a flap @ the seam between the seat & back which pulls the fabric snugly into the seat, so that there is no wrinkling or sagging. Moreover, they look good.    I would recommend these without exception
B007LIBO40|5|Great Look<br />Good Price<br />Would recommend<br />Good Price<br />I like the look of the product on my chevy silverado 2013
B00DJ68I2E|5|Great Product easy to use Love my garage even more!! if thats even possible.
B0010DY4J4|5|I have not used this either but I am sure it will do the job its made for. I love ARB and the quality is there.
B000DZS6IA|5|We love this ultraguard for our suburban.  It stays on, doesn't wiggle.  Have not had any trouble with it.  It adds the perfect touch to our suburban.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Works great. Reviews from auto and marine sights say it's the best. Drys without greasy residue.
B00FXLPOIO|5|There was no type of instructions but these went on easy. I have to say they look great on my 2007 JK unlimited X. I got the red and black covers on a red JK. Looks fantastic and for the price of 150.00 which included the front and back seats, with no shipping cost you just cant beat that. Everything fit like a glove but the head rest I think they could have done better.  I wonder how long they will last in the Texas summer heat with my doors off and top done. I will try to update after the summer.
B003KFR5N2|5|I have an F-150 and replaced both OEM struts and the original shocks.  Wow--what a difference!  Tightened up the handling significantly--10 year old truck that rides like it just rolled off the lot.  They went in easily and fit beautifully.  I've had difficult experiences changing out struts before so I was a little leery but these went in very easily.  If you have the right wrenches and socket sets, it is an easy install.
B0006309HU|2|I purchased this product with anticipation and got it fully installed the 7 color L.E.D rings did not work well, only 4 worked properly and when receiving the wires some were pulled out on the lights. After using for about an hour all the L.E.D rings stopped working, I really like the HID fog lights they work great and look great, but I'm trying to contact Pilot Automotive and discuss this problem. I believe it is a defective set of lights, I don't want to turn anyone away with my bad experience I am going to try and get a new set and hope they will work.
B003VAY8GI|1|does not work
B00F9CVSDM|5|Very durable design, vibrant white still shining brightly on my red car after many road trips and car washes. Transfer takes a little extra TLC, I had to go over the transfer paper a few times before it would stick. Larger than I expected, which is great for me - but be sure to measure. Thanks to Rad Deszigns for fast service, too!
B005C6KIVS|1|Bought 2 of them.  They only worked once each. No longer connects or broadcasts to bluetooth.
B003UM9GDM|3|Sadly, the rubber pads don't stay in place, come dislodged very easily. Not sure, yet, how I want to try to resolve this potentially serious issue. If the pads slip that easily, what's going to happen while I have it in the air? ;-( Other than that, I love the thing! Made working on my bike so much easier!
B002FZJ806|5|WORKS AS WELL AS THE OTHERS COSTING TWICE AS MUCH
B0015PN010|5|Great quality, this is a must when working with ball joints, too small for my lower control arm, but worked great on upper. 07 Ridgeline.
B00480J4J6|1|This is the wrong bulb for my 2006 Prius even though the compatibility check said it was correct.  I bought the correct bulb at auto parts store for a lot less......$15.
B007OUXGNC|5|LOVED IT
B0012TPVC0|5|Just managed to get around to trying this out last weekend and it worked like a charm.  It handled all the dirt and grime on the chain and I didn't have to remove the guard to use it.  Felt well built and the chain came out very clean.
B004UL9MEK|5|Didn't want to blow 200 plus on new caps. Got these they fit looked good for 15% cost of new set.  The plastic is a bit thin. One cracked while installing it.
B001N2O3PM|5|Good quality.  Good price.  Helps to give your license plate installation a finished look. Installation is a breeze to complete.
B003YL15V0|5|I work at a church and was trying to find something to give my volunteers as a sign of appreciation. If you've ever had to do this you know the problem. Most of the stuff out there is just little knickknacks that look cool, but ends up in a box sometime later and it's hard finding something that fits a wide range of people. You can go the gift card route, but that's been done too much and I wanted something practical that they might actually use. This was a great solution. This probably wont stand up to heavy use as some reviewers have pointed out, but for ladies to keep in their purses and guys to keep in their glove box/pocket, for quick tasks, this is a good option. All of my volunteers were very pleased with the gift and liked getting something they could use.
B00F6AR1HE|5|High quality well made kit!  Fixed the sagging door on my 1988 GMC C3500
B0054DCF2Y|1|The color was faded, design was cheesy, spandex was cheap, and was for a childrens helmet! So I cant even use it...
B000IYLFUM|4|Good quality be aware does not come with hardware and you will need star and torx sockets to remove the hardware from the old unit
B00BILA15O|5|So far, so good. Batteries arrived fully charged and ready to use. They seem to charge properly. Time will be the true test.
B00G3DRNZ8|5|After having the issues with my lawn mower, weed wacker, and the carburetor on my old Chevy, I read and was told / sold on &#34;Carb Defender&#34; as the solution to protect the carburetors against the damage ethanol causes. I had already bought this product from my local speed shop a few times, and more than 90 days after my first use - no issues or corrosion in any of my stuff. Bought this last round from Amazon.com to see if it is same, yep. - Good to go. I recommend this to anyone who has had the experience of an engine not running right after you let it sit for a while. - It's the ethanol damage from the fuel we now get out of the pump. I was told this stuff protects the metal from harm, not just makes the fuel last through storage. So far, so good.
B00IV71YVI|5|Exact fit for my vehicle, and even came with all bulbs already installed. Couldn't be happier, easy to install.
B001A72IS4|5|I was looking for a functional and inexpensive riding jacket and found exactly what I was looking for in the X-Element Men's Black Mesh Padded with Level-3 Advanced Armored Motorcycle Jacket. I love the way this jacket fits and feels, and it seems to be well-made for the money. The mesh material allows the jacket to breath, and the liner keeps my torso warm on chilly days. Remember that if the temperature is borderline cold when you ride, you may want to consider wearing a long-sleeve shirt underneath even though the insulated liner extends down the sleeves of the jacket. My best advice if you are considering purchasing this jacket is to order one a size or two larger than you usually wear. For example, I'm about 5' 10\\" and pretty heavy at about 260 pounds. I'm overweight but not what you would consider obese-looking. I usually wear an XL or 2-XL shirt or jacket comfortably, but this jacket is a 3-XL and it fits absolutely perfectly. Please pardon all the adverbs. I highly recommend this jacket!
B000KYW5ZE|5|No installation required. Well made, matches the original product that came with the car at time of purchase! Streamlined & fits well in a pocket or small handbag.
B000W0RQ8C|5|I got this because of the black finish and replaced the old chrome one.  Also, I like the style.  It looks more balanced when on the receiver when only the tube cover is in place.  Good quality too.
B000NXEO60|4|good fit.
B004TC1L80|5|great price and product..working like it should..fast shipping
B009URVR1U|5|Easy to install. Cheaper than most websites offering vw products. Perfect match. Would buy again for another vw owner. Very happy.
B00877SL2M|5|These are a terrific replacement for tag lights on vehicles that use the 194 such as 2003 Mazda Miata MX-5, !993 Ford Ranger XLT, and 2002 Jaguar X-Type,  I've also used these to make the non-functional rear side markers on my Miata operational as a little mod.  A great replacement for 89 Thunderbird/Cougar LS digital instrument cluster illumination (the factory bulbs go out frequently).  These run very cool, use less power, and are whiter and brighter than standard bulbs.  LEDs are polarity sensitive so if inserted in the holder improperly 180 degrees they don't light up, just flip them round.
B0072GV6FI|5|Took less than 30 minutes for each door.  Once you figure out how to pop off the trim you just pull off the old seal and install the new one.  Use a hammer to put it place instead of trying to push with your hands.  Use a plastic scraper to push seal into tight spots.  It's very simple and the seal is much better than the factory one on my 2008 Ram
B0000AXQE8|2|After 1/2 hour on the 12V outlet, it still didn´t boil
B00KOSKOH2|5|👍
B00FA8GYDY|5|Great decal!
B00480J4KA|5|When our 2005 Prius got \\"pink eye\\" (one headlight turned red) I called the dealer and ask them about it. They quoted $275 to replace... EACH side! I called my regular mechanic and he said to search the internet for a replacement bulb then he would install it for $60. I found this one and was encouraged by the positive reviews so I ordered one. Then I noticed some people recommended a video on youtube showing how to replace it yourself. After I little searching, I found [...] and once the bulb arrived, it was about 20 minutes of grunting and scraping my knuckles, but the job is done and the headlight works and looks perfect! This was the left side, which is a bit harder to get into, but not impossible. Don't follow the videos that go on about taking out all the screws and removing the bumper; that is absolutely not necessary, as long as you don't mind working in cramped quarters, and maybe scuffing your hands a bit. Thanks to everyone who reviewed this and made the video and thanks to Amazon for selling this product at a great price!
B00DDV3LAE|1|This is NOT marune grade!!!! Not spark or waterproof be aware!!!
B0002MACJ0|3|Broke one of the hooks first time using it with the Highland cargo basket.  The hooks do not fit right on the front end, when the cargo basket has the wind shield installed.
B004AFTDC2|5|They keep your drinks cold and hot. When I oput ice in them it last all day . very good cups I recommend them to one and all
B0002JMIEK|5|Have a 2006 Acura TSX and usually wax/polish 3 times a tear with instant detail in between.  This product is by far the best for finish appearance! Not sure how long the finish will last but I was impressed with the ease of application and removal.  Did not stain the black plastic trim as some of the polishes are guilty of doing (especially the orange one - you know the one that I refer to. Also no swirl marks. Car looks fabulous!
B007PVHXMK|5|This is as good as the OEM and is very easy to replace.  Price from Amazon is about half of what is charged by other auto store.
B000BRJTZE|4|works great
B000CB94JU|5|After I installed this activated charcoal filter I no longer smell the exhaust gases that I used to smell before when I was using a regular filter. It makes a big difference.
B00FS2TL8C|5|BEST EVER
B000GU5IH4|5|Excellent, good quality and fits perfectly on the bike and is easy to put over. Protects it from dust and rain. Definitely recommended.
B00AB2PBU6|5|It's gorgeous!  I was really surprised -- and thrilled -- with the looks and the ease of putting them on.  They arrived in two days and the cost was very affordable.
B002MPV4EC|5|This helmet is great it has alot of padding it also fits great
B00KBBL4H6|5|Product as described.  Excellent quality, will last the rest of my life.  Needed a gauge rated to 100psi for the tires on my Kayak Trailer which are rated 90psi.  Fast shipping.  Good company with good products, highly recommend.
B00N6D7K38|5|Best replacement to the OEM fog lights in my 2005 Chrysler 300.  Super bright and white, not yellow like the OEMs.
B0007M1ZGE|4|HAD TO GRIND DOWN THE  COVER ON THE BUMPER.  WORKED FINE AFTER THAT TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR TO COMPLETE THE JOB.
B004SSAF32|1|This was intended to keep the dust off while parked in an enclosed garage.  When exposed to the sun's UV rays, it deteriorates within 2 or 3 weeks and tears easily from the wind.  The China-import silver poly tarps do a better job than other car covers, which can't handle the sun's damaging UV rays.
B007CFK10U|5|Very easy to install ...love it .took me 1 hour to install , fit better than factory muffler , will buy for my other trucks
B000C2SIMS|5|Very high quality belt.  Materials and construction are at least as good as the OEM Acura belts on my Legend.
B003ZS503G|3|The holes didn't match.  Had to drill new holes, then it was OK.  Took quite a bit longer than it should have.
B00N2DX7JI|5|Lowered my bike just right/along with front. Bike feels safer with minor suspension adjustments corners very nice!
B001U8UUWE|4|I have a dog, and these seat covers work because i can wipe them off.  I do not know how long they will last, they are alittle thin but they do the job.
B0047A5Q26|3|It's a good sturdy lil key holder ... nothing really special, except it is 'Pink'! I have a Z & it was one of my favorite colors! More than that ... It holds keys really well ... it's the only purpose it has & does it well!!
B00OUM8GLY|5|Fit a Range Rover Sport perfectly
B0051SUMV8|1|the description says it will fit my '02 F150, the packages says 04-08!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and does not look the same!!! different lock!!!! i wanted the \\"round\\" lock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! upon installation attempt THIS WILL NOT FIT !!! ONLY FOR '04-08...SO STAY AWAY
B000CQOIVO|5|Jack is very good quality for the price and was easy to install.  Jacks works great.  Shipment was received quickly and with very good packaging.
B00AW03F3M|4|These keys fit my infiniti key fob about 95%. Not exactly 100% fit, but it fit barely so not really big issue. Nissan dealer cut keys and work perfectly. I say it's slightly a little bit bigger but will still go in in key fob, just have to pull hard to get it out lol. Rate 4.5 for price.
B00N06KYJ8|5|A++=++
B0087XOTWW|4|Bright and cool white; not a warm white light.  They're taller than the 921 bulbs I bought these to replace, but it worked out OK in my application (2003 Toyota Corolla reverse lights).  If your application has limited space for the bulb, keep that in mind.<br /><br />Unsure on long-term durability - the white plastic base doesn't feel very substantial.  I don't see any heatsinks, so running these for long periods could overheat and kill the LEDs.<br /><br />LEDs are polarity-sensitive, unlike regular incandescent bulbs.  If they don't work the first time, remove the bulb from the socket and turn it 180*, and try again.
B000Y8UBB6|5|I bought two. Awesome!
B000CSGUWM|5|works great on my wood splitter
B0089UEOKA|2|After installing this on my EK I noticed that the header was 1-2 inches to short from stock which caused issues with O2 sensor mounting correctly
B000C9HWQE|5|Perfect fit.  Item arrived as described!
B0016ISDMC|1|The one I received had the gasket coming off, so I couldn't rate it well.  Overall, I like this brand.  Just had a problem with this one.
B000TYSBGW|5|this was a perfect fit for my 73 Ford F250.  it operates smoothly.  I can't complain one bit.
B001LHVOVK|5|SWEET
B0064SGRPE|3|scrap the drilling required mounting fiasco and just mount it with zip ties and zip anchors.<br />looks great once installed, but a pain to get to fit right, too much of a curve to it.<br /><br />but a lil ingenuity, heck we are jeeper's after all, and I have it installed and looking good.<br /><br />JeepOn!
B000SLHRKM|5|Installed this on my Z3 and it tripled the carrying capacity of the car.  Holds a suitcase or duffle up to 34\\" wide and 19\\" deep without going over the edges.  Even holds those giant rolling suitcases.  Be careful opening the trunk with a lot of weight on it, the trunk lid may drop onto your head or arms/hands.  Also got the BMW Z3 fitted luggage cases so not an inch of trunk space is wasted.  Car can now carry enough luggage for a month long vacation.
B00EOYUK94|5|Still love this!
B00AJEX1U8|1|Product came broken in half and the box was messed up pretty bad. Hope I get a replacement.
B0031HKWFM|5|Thanks in part to Hal's review, above, I took a chance and ordered this part for my 2005 CRV (assembled in GB) back left door.  Like him, I found the part other places, including my Honda dealer, for over $100.  Could not understand why the other three doors are all in the $20's or $30's (still can't).  In any case, I just had to trim one small peg off the edge of this actuator for it to all go back together with the white plastic dust shield.  Everything seems to work fine!  I'm a happy camper.  I'll use the unspent $$ to buy a tool!  A small caution.  The illustration of this part is IDENTICAL to the old actuator I was removing, which had me even more puzzled.  The part that Amazon sent is not quite the same as in the picture.  I was worried about it when I held them side-by-side, however it did not make any difference on installation.  Good luck!
B00QFY2BCK|5|Very easy and works very well.
B000W1XX4M|5|Takes the cel off
B00DLMMP2U|5|Phenomenal quality. I currently installed three kits on my vehicles. A crown vic, f350, and f150. Customer service is outstanding and tbe shipping was fast. Very satisfied.
B000YPL6PO|1|I agree with the poor quality statements, pliers do not spin, the spindle spins inside the device.  total waste of money.
B006FQXO4C|4|I bought two for a Buick Regal. They work ok but on one the horn alarm is very sensitive. I'm not even aware I touch the button. Now imagine this happening late at night or wrong place & time. On the other one the trunk button is sensitive, it somehow gets unlocked and I'm not aware until I am driving down the road. I took them apart twice, cleaned them. Tried using the old rubber seal but its better with the seal they provide. One day I'll buy a new remote or new car.
B0051E4AMY|5|So when I first installed these I was so angry because the car wouldnt start up but turns out it was user error lol (FYI try priming the fuel pump the switch is in the driverside kick panel). Once I installed these it seemed like the car may have gained a few horses over the last coils I put in them from ebay
B000GROI2I|5|Works great - plenty of room for what I need. Easy to slip on and off the sissy bar, and adjustable when needed.
B009TGAFQU|5|Do you need this dipstick? No you don't. But you do want this because it looks much better than the stock plastic stick.
B001KQ9L94|4|So far so good
B003EM9F5M|5|It stopped my death wobble.
B0036G9BT6|5|Had my firs set of bags stolen off my quad.  Got these and they are exactly the same.  After one season of bear hunting they looked brand new and hadn't faded.  Best on the market for soft bags.
B00UKXSIM4|2|Biggest pain to work with.
B0010Z4MDK|5|INSTALLED A WHILE AGO WORKING WELL
B000HBNV58|4|Works very well for screeching car doors or trunk, or any metal-to-metal friction. A little goes a long way, and while the product is good there really should be an applicator tip. The nozzle is blunt and rather broad, so you can either apply it neatly using a tool or try to squeeze out a lump and flick it into the right place. You can guess which method I opted for, but it was effective regardless.
B002PQS8Q0|5|Perfect
B003PO69VC|5|Once you start using quality products you can't go back. All of my car care is done using Griots Garage materials. These cloths work great at removing all of the wax products, even after letting the product sit for a bit it comes off quickly with these.
B000E1AVPE|5|I read the description and reviews and the installation and utility of this hitch are as advertised.  Installation was relatively easy.
B008PTN992|4|Never used one of these scanners before and found fairly intuitive to use and understand.  Would recommend this to others.
B000CB7ASW|4|Would have given it 5 stars if the pump was marked for 05 Chevy Tahoe front windshield washer pump, or something along those lines. I ordered both the front (Trico 11-513) and rear pumps (Trico 11-517) and they both looked identical, until I opened the packages and compared them side by side. After removing the old pumps, I found out that the rear pump has a wider electrical connector. Installing the pumps was easy, once I figured out how to remove the plastic plugs on the fenderwell liner. I used a claw hammer without a handle. Be sure to make note of which water tube goes on which pump (if you replace both pumps). On my Tahoe, the front pump water tube was all black and the rear pump water tube had a yellow end on it. The electrical connectors are different sizes and will only fit the correct pump. Have had them installed for a month and have had no problems and no leaks. They work great. read my review for the rear pump Trico #11-517 for additional comments and tips.
B003BDW0TM|5|This makes my 09 Sierra sound so much better now coupled with my flowmaster cat-back exhaust. Installation was simply w/minor drilling( dont be scared its easy). Those who have had problems either installed the filter incorrectly or had problems with their truck before. Hands down best filter I have EVER used.
B003OAES8I|3|I think these would look best on a lighter colored Jeep. Mine is dark green and didn't make much of a difference. After you remove the back to the adhesive tape you really have to get them on perfectly the first try. I was a little bit off and they have gaps which is causing them to gradually come loose all together. if your careful, and have a light color paint it's a fairly inexpensive upgrade that would look nice. Just be careful lining them up right!
B00BG9KD74|3|I open the package and  I noticed right away that, it was  the wrong parts that I needed for my project I waited for a while to receive my package and to find the wrong items  if it had under ten dlls. I probably wouldn't bother to return it and go through the drama  But this was just under one hundred bucks So I went ahead and followed the returning items routine  it took something like two months after several attempts to get my refund the only reason I issued a three star was because Amazon finally got involved to help me out with the situation
B007JC6V6E|5|I purchased 2 of these for my best friends last christmas. (we are all huge cat lovers) They loved them! My friend has had hers on her car for like ever now and it's been through a lot. Still stuck on there like glue!
B008XN3FEE|5|Perfect. Just as posted.
B000WJZ1N0|5|I started using this now it is the only product I clean my bike with. Instead of getting this little case, I would buy in bulk. It is such good stuff that you will run through it pretty fast. If you want your Harley to shine the way it did the day you bought it, S100 is for you.
B004WE9I3K|5|This cleaner works great on my new leather sofa and it doesn't cost a fortune.
B004R7LIF8|3|Compared to those powered by batteries, this simple power plug adapter type works pretty well.  After all, who wants to replace the battery up in the ceiling all the time?<br />However, the mounting kit is a total joke.  The clamp is completely weak, not really 'clamping' onto anything securely. Imagine these weak clamps stay on the constantly vibrating garage opener unit for a long period of time - if you think they will stay on, you are fooling yourself. My opinion of these clamps:<br />1. Flimsy<br />2. useless<br />3. unreliable<br /><br />I had to drill small holes in the plastic housing of the garage opener to affix the laser pointer.  Anyway, you will have to use your imagination to get this done.  The bottom line is, if you cannot mount the laser pointer securely and reliably for long term use, what's the point of using the laser to guide the parking anyway ?? - every once in a while the pointing position changes, oops..
B00MHEMNIO|1|I give them no star's  I have a 08 r1 and the parts they sent me don't fit up I have tried repeatedly to contact them to get instructions or pictures online with product installed or a customer service number but keep getting the run around I would recommend buying American made or a set of Vortex a little more expensive but it's worth it.
B001KS6FPA|1|There are no specs on the listing to indicate which vehicles these wipers are designed to fit. The impression is they are universal. Not so!<br />Don't believe what anyone says this wiper will not fit a 2007 TOYOTA FJ Cruiser<br /><br />This product purports to be a universal fit. It is not.<br /><br />Like dozens of other victims, this falsely advertised product does not fit the 2007 FJ Cruiser as it specifically said that it would. It does not fit a ton of models they claim that it does. I should not have trusted the Amazon applet saying it fit.<br />The wasted gas and hassle of parking and queueing up in line at the post office sucks enough. The money wasted is a bother.
B00LNE8SJ2|5|AAAAAA++++++
B001J7K2VK|1|What kind of Chinese inferior product is this? It does not even stick to the surface and I bought 2!
B00042L0IA|4|I thought it was neoprene but it's vinyl!!!  That's ok, jack is protected and looks nice!
B004AMDYTS|4|Fine so far...like all cabin air filters, kind of a pain to install, but worth it.  Shipped quickly, adequate packaging...overall good experience.
B00HS5V9Q4|5|could not be happier, installed no problem and stop like new.
B003XFXK5G|5|My husband bought this product 15 years ago at a car show and a gallon goes a long way, but when it ran out, we had a hard time finding it. I was beginning to think I had to go to another car show to buy more when  I checked Amazon and the product was there, sold by an outside party. We have an airplane that my husband wanted to try the Carnauba on.  The plane looks beautiful and the red and blue stripes really shine now.  It truly is a wonderful product as it lifts oxidation and leaves a beautiful shine and smoothness to the surface of planes, cars, boats, etc. Shipped quickly, in great shape, no problems.  Give it a try, you can't go wrong.
B00BQVF8J0|4|Great product!
B000UHDUQE|1|bought two (for a 97 kx125, 87 cr80).  these fit neither bike.  actually it fit the kx but was 2&#34; short so no point in using it. on the CR it was too wide at the top- it may have worked but i didn't want to risk it breaking the fender.  i'm returning them both.
B0002STS2Q|5|I purchased this so I could gap spare plugs for our snowmobiles. Works perfectly and I appreciate the little hole which is used to open the gap without compromising the electrode.
B005MVB2WM|4|I like it but it's not perfect.. I wish there was some kind of way to stack two of these on top of each other that both locked in the wenches from falling out as well as reduce the space in the drawer of you have both a metric and sae set. That would have made this product ideal to me.<br /><br />Now, it's still a great product and I recommed this to anyone. If you have wrenches and need to organize them you won't go wrong with this product.
B0002SR88C|5|A very useful tool which is almost indispensable.  Does the job very well.
B00842A7F4|5|worked for my 2006 Honda Civic EX
B000G72UOQ|5|I bought this shade for my 2009 Honda Fit based on recommendations from [...]    It fits well in the large windshield of the Honda Fit.  Although it does have to go over the rearview mirror.    I received the \\"shiny\\" metallic version of the shade, which I've heard can start to flake off over time.    In the past I have gotten the non shiny fabric style shade which I think might hold up better.  But so far so good with this one.
B00Q3DNZ2I|5|Bought for a low beam on an '08 Chevy Silverado.  Everything worked after installation.
B000C2SCDS|5|I always look for American made products, especially when it comes to automotive parts. Gates has a quality reputation for a reason, American made products of high quality. And at a very good price. I'm sure you could find a foreign made hose for a bit less, but your going to replace that hose WAY before you replace this Gates product. If you have ever had any measurable amount of time handling and using rubber(insert dirty joke/comment here) then you know that not only are there very different grades but that you can feel if it's good rubber or not when you touch it and see how it moves. This hose is very flexible but also with some rigidity. It does resist kinking very well but is very easy to maneuver around your engine bay. Fantastic product and keeps us Americans working.
B0038N8706|5|Fender trim exactly what I needed.  Quick shipping .  Good job!!!
B00A7Z509Y|1|Stopped connecting to my phone after a few months.
B00063X38M|5|This was recommended to me by a boat shop as being the best product for gluing rubber seals around the bottom of fiberglas outboard motor covers. So far it is holding very well and is rated over a broad temperature range.<br />Be aware - it works like contact cements, you must be able to coat both surfaces separately, let them become tacky and assemble.
B009PXCOZ2|3|Conform to my expectation and I's okay for me. Appreciated and useful, the color nice and fit to my car
B005GX3GFW|5|EASY TO PUT ON AND OFF THE WHEEL!!
B00C7S9K8Q|4|Works great. Very bright.
B0026MCPF8|5|It fit, it works.
B001AIZ5HY|5|I used this 3M restorer on a 2005 Toyota Sienna. The lenses were about 75% clouded over and one side was worse than the other. I followed the directions exactly and it worked far better than I anticipated. I bought mine at Walmart and the auto service techs there said they use the same product in their shop to restore headlight lenses.<br /><br />I wore out the rechargeable battery in my drill and it really took a long time to get a very fine finish to remove all the swirl marks and my hands ached afterward, but the results  were well worth it.
B002LRSZHA|4|After about a week of use, the gloves are fraying at the finger tips just a bit. I've never owned gloves like this before so I don't know if that's a natural occurrence. I will have to keep an eye on it. No complaints other than that.
B0079LOF3Q|5|Love it!
B000JLIVX8|5|I just wanted to say this is the perfect solution for people who aren't in the snow removal business, but need a plow to clear a driveway more than 30 feet. Easy to install, easy to use, pushes snow 6 to 8 inches deep down a 1,300 foot drive without any issues.  I've used it for two winters now and can't say ANYTHING bad about it. I not only use it on my drive, but honestly look for neighbors and friends to plow out every time it snows. You can't beat the price, it's durable, not overly heavy and it pushes snow without fail. If you can't afford a $4,000 plow, or have a vehicle that really can't hold the weight of one of those hydraulic beasts, shoot even if you have the money and a 1 ton truck, this is the plow for you!
B00BMU9B0W|4|Look great for the price! However, I received one with a small crack, didnt think it was a big deal and put it on anyway, it flew off a few weeks later, Im assuming the crack caused it not to secure tight enough. Hoping the seller will replace.
B0066S2CR4|5|This is about one third the price of the OEM part from Mercedes. Only been installed about two weeks, but working so far, and I'm tickled about the price.
B000Q5P1AS|5|I purchased this to fuel my 6 ATVs. It works just fine and was about $270.00 less then its closest competator. I was some what hesitant to buy it because the only review it had was very bad. Quality control on some chinese products is definately hit and miss. The one I got works fine and I think $239.00 is plenty for a 25 gallon gas can with some wheels welded to it. The pump works in both directions. The wheels are sturdy enough for my use but may need replaced if you were planning to drag it all over constantly or over rough terrain alot. The welds are strong and professional. It would be nice if the nozzle had an on off of some kind but it works fine without it. There was a little welding slag in the tank that needed to be rinsed out. No big deal! I used water and blew it out thoroughlty with compressed air. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and I like the volume the pump puts out. It is enough that you can quickly fill ATV and lawn mower tanks but not so much that you end up dumping fuel all over. For reference it will suck a 5 gallon gas can dry in about 90 seconds of spirited cranking. As far as weight goes, it is heavy when full but is very easy to pull up the ramp of my trailer. You defineately wouldn't want to lift it in and out of a pickup on a regular basis unless empty. I am pleased with the purchase and would do it again. Hope this helps someone. Good luck.
B00755JMYS|5|Great product and surpised a the light
B00FRHOO9O|5|Works great and easy to install.
B001C955FI|5|Quietest ceramic pads ive tried. Low dust and no noticable fade...the hotter they get, the more you are inclined to trust them. Perfect on my modded is350 dd/weekend track
B000CMKESO|5|I am a big fan of Husky liner products.. They are great. I have bought the floor mats for all of my new vehicles for the last 7 years. They really protect the carpet.<br /><br />I just bought a new 2011 F-150 FX2 and bought the Weatherbeater floor mats for it. I was so pleased with the look and protection I have now bought the splash guards for it. When they arrived I was impressed with them.... They are not some cheap flimsy plastic guard. They are a preformed hard plastic that matches the contour of the fender perfectly. They come in black but are paint-able to match your vehicle, which is what I did. My FX2 sport model F-150 has everything painted, bumpers, door handles, grill surround etc. So it was an easy decision to have these splash guards painted to match the truck...  And it looks really nice.<br /><br />As a note, I looked at and considered the OEM Ford splash guards but they were a soft rubber type and rubber will curl over time and I didn't want to deal with that down the road so I found these Husky liner guards to be a more permanent solution for long term use.
B000VBEG0S|5|Fit perfectly
B00JIJ4LWW|4|Definitely brought my chairs back to life.
B0051D3MP6|5|Works on all my 12 volt batteries:  ATV, lawn tractor, auto and truck.
B0016ITQCS|5|Fit and working perfectly so far.
B001KQCC5O|5|This is a great replacement option compared to what Mazda would want for an OEM part. The price here on Amazon is amazing compared to what you would pay at the local part store. The part fits great and works as expected.
B004VFVFC2|5|Will purchase again
B0052SF0LO|4|Easy to install, adjustable and the cats will trigger it which is part of what I wanted. I plan to buy two more of these.
B000LY7JNG|5|Bumper looks GREAT! Its sturdy and very easy to install.  This is actually my second one.  Hit a deer and saved me thousands of dollars in damage.
B0053OIMK8|4|Took way to long to get but is cool
B00BBFEG08|4|Perfect
B000ZMZKX0|5|Great product! Sturdy and holds up quite well! Just dont brush against it when you are walking by your car with it on because it is pretty sharp.
B005XO3OII|4|I have a 2011 Dodge RAM 1500 with a built in DVD player. The previous owner lost the headphones so I was apprehensive about buying a set that wasn't from the dealer. I read many reviews and was encouraged that these would work right out of the box and they did. I installed batteries and turned them on and they worked. Thanks for all of the review to read they saved me a lot of money.
B000XECJES|3|Love Microfiber Cleaning cloths. Be aware, if  &#34;Sold by: Amazon.com LLC&#34;, they short you one cloth. Unable to find a way to contact them like would other sellers. The cloths themselves work well. Like have the different colors so can designate specific colors for specific jobs.
B00CIB5RCU|1|Did not work after charging. Totally useless. Got a refund.
B005MZXEIS|5|I had looked all over our town for this magnet after our grandson was sent to Afghanistan.  When I couldn't find it locally, I looked on Amazon.com and found this seller.  I thought perhaps by the time I ordered it and it was sent out, it would be along time before I would get it - surprise!!  It arrived in less than a week.  It is a nice strong magnet and stays put after attaching to our car.  Would definitely buy this product again and from this seller for sure.  I, also, purchased the red, white and blue \\"Support our troops\\" magnet from this seller and that arrived along with the yellow ribbon.  This seller went above and beyond to get the magnets to us in a very short amount of time.
B00AH04STC|5|Covers arrived promptly and are a great fit.  I would like to see a different way is secure them to the old seats, but overall they are great.
B005KSPZZM|5|Love the mat! Looks great.
B006FUT0CS|5|I am extremely impressed with this product. It works far better than I expected. As a detailing enthusiast who lives in an apartment building without access to a water hose or private driveway, I'm stuck with either taking the cars to a relative's house, or surreptitiously trying to do a two-bucket wash at a coin-op spray booth place. Neither is usually viable in the winter. (In the summer I will resort to the relative's house, but it's less than ideal because I'm expected to talk to them and interact with their children, instead of focusing on clay barring and proper orbital polisher pad selection.)<br /><br />This wash and wax spray is a game changer for me. I was extremely skeptical that it could replace a traditional two-bucket wash process for appearance maintenance, but it genuinely can. It actually provided better results on a moderately dirty car than a wash alone would, because it provides gloss enhancement that washing alone does not.<br /><br />Think of this as a detail spray that cleans. However, be aware of these caveats:<br /><br />-  You will need a lot of quality microfiber towels. It is very important to make sure you wipe the wetted panels in a single direction, using a clean section of microfiber every time.<br />-  If your car is seriously filthy, such as with caked-on mud, salt, or mag chloride, this won't be enough. Find a hose.<br />-  This product will work best on finishes that are already in decent shape, ideally those with a functioning layer of sealant or wax. If you have bugs, sap, tar, and whatever else ground in and adhered to your paint, this will not take them off. It's not a substitute for a clay bar.<br />-  If you over-apply it, it can cause smearing or streaking. I found misting the surface without using enough to cause drips worked well.<br />-  Work from the cleanest to dirtiest parts of the car (usually top to bottom) and save separate microfiber towels for the dirtiest sections.
B0021VO9G2|2|The Good: Plastic case sturdy enough for home mechanic use.  The brass components are nicely painted.<br /><br />The Bad: Poor build quality.  Shafts spin in the knobs easily.  The tips are of questionable quality.  I was able to use the small one for standard valve cores, but the others didn't work.  The small one wouldn't grab the valve core well enough.  It barely worked.<br /><br />Overall, like most made in China junk it is hit or miss if will work.  Sent it back to spend my money on something better.
B000GOFDZM|2|Wasn't what I would call a CUSTOM fit. Would not buy again, may actually return product.
B005E5D7CY|4|this fits my 2002 toyota corolla well, but the plug did not fully snap into the pump motor properly.  I had to reuse the old pump.  Fortunately, the old pump was OK.  At the time I bought the reservoir, it was the cheapest replacement available, so it's all good, but be careful if you actually need the pump.  you might have some troubles with it.
B004FFHJ14|3|A little bulkier than I expected but overall the quality was good and it fits the car nicely.
B000HEBR3I|5|excellent, pumps kerosene very fast
B006ACYXTQ|4|like the mirrors,but the drivers side one doesn't lock in place at all,so have to return it.Getting ready to send it back,hopefully it won't take for ever to get the new one.
B00HJCUEZS|4|It was a little trying to get it and stretch it into place, there were not enough sticky velcro tabs to make it lay and stay the way I wanted it. Over all great color and nice protection for the dash!
B009DJOWG2|5|Great rear bumper for my 01 Toyota Tacoma. Fit like a glove. Replaced my old rusted stock tacoma bumper and looks great. Comes with all parts and brackets. received in the mail very quickly
B00A14QM52|2|For my application, the light brightness and color did not match.  The other three button clusters on the steering wheel all have working lights still, which are blue green in color and dimmer than this Dorman replacement.  The Dorman also was closer to white light.  In my opinion, you would need to replace all four button clusters at the same time if you are going with Dorman.  If you only need one, it’s cheaper to go with the factory part.
B000OQMK58|5|The wheel cover is attractive and it helps me grip the steering wheel.i would buy it again if needed. Like.
B0015YBYCS|5|Covers are as described. Thick fabric and easy to apply. They haven't been on the tires very long, but I believe they will hold up well in Florida sun and heat. Very pleased. with them.
B000JZY93U|5|The positive reviews regarding this product were right on target.  Replaced the worn out lifters relatively easily and these replacements are excellent!  Couldn't be happier.
B00DTWANVW|2|Flimsy, but good parts for a project. WARNING: return shipping is high
B000CFUK7Q|3|I own a 2002 Ford Focus with 2.0L Zetec with a 5 speed transmission.  I bought this to replace the stock airbox due to its poor quality and all of the bolts shearing in half due to corrosion.  This will drastically increase valve train noise, and create a \\"whoosh\\" whenever first and second gear are engaged.  At higher RPM's when the engine really screams and the sound isn't overbearing.  You will also notice a change in the idle, as it will make it slightly more rough and pop every now and then.<br /><br />I installed a magnaflow high flow catalytic converter along with a Walker OEM sized catback exhaust, and replaced the resonator with a 24 In section of tailpipe. The coilpack and all 4 wires were replaced with OEM specs, and the fuel filter was also replaced.<br /><br />The engine has 197,xxx miles on it and on the highway at 70MPH with cruise control will pull off 35 MPG.  This thing will also burn the tires on dry pavement surprisingly well for a 4 cylinder, but due to torque steer is a little uncontrollable.  When the pavement is wet, I have managed to hold a burnout until 4th gear as well.<br /><br />The silicone boots are durable, but the mounting hardware is a poor threaded rod and nut and the EGR pipe interferes with this rod and strips it out very easily. For such a high price I expected a better connection, which is why I gave it 3/5.  I replaced this rod with a hex bolt and have not had any problems.  Make sure to disconnect the battery cable for awhile to reset your ECM, as the airflow will change significantly.<br /><br />If there is any problems with idle, let it run for awhile and check all the connections after the MAF sensor because any leaks will make the engine run lean and will cause overheating.  The rubber boot to the throttle plate needs to be snug as you might introduce debris into your intake and rotating assembly.  Do not touch the throttle plate with any type of solvent or your greasy hands either.  Use compressed air, or a clean microfiber to clean out anything that might have landed on your intake.<br /><br />The kit comes with a tamper proof torx bit the size of your MAF sensor screws.  I found this little wrench after I went and bought a whole set for $20, just a heads up.<br /><br />It comes with stickers but they make your focus look like a rice burner. Mine look good on my laptop!
B009VTIX5K|3|The shocks did not meet my expectations.  The money I spent on them versus handling and the preformance of the truck was no difference than a set of monroe's.
B003CEQZRI|2|This is easy to install and program for the vehicle if equipped with the OBDII data link port. This appears to work for diesel engines as I seen that for an option when programming. This does take into consideration of the engine size. It will report mileage in both kilo-meters and miles. It incorporates the use of both gallon and litre data. The overall mileage can be displayed as MPG, GPM, GP$, and $PM. I wish that it showed a &#34;real time display&#34; of current mileage so I can easily see the difference running empty or with the current loaded status. The only way I can see doing this is to reset the unit from scratch and make a run.<br /><br />I bought this because I never seem to know the mileage I am getting in my pick-up. I have and edge that tells me current mileage in real time but I can not find a feature in it to keep track of average mileage. With gas prices crazy high I can not often afford to fully fill up the fuel tank and this tool works great to help me determine my mileage. I do like the leaf feature to show myself how hard I am working the vehicle. I first installed this on my Saturn and it was easy to get all 5 leaves but since I use my pick-up primarily as a work vehicle hauling loads, towing a trailer, or in city traffic. (I live in a town with a stop sign nearly every block) I have only been able to get 4 leaves up.<br /><br />Overall I like this to see my mileage and as a reminder to keep my foot out of the gas supplying the large appetite of my 5.4l triton.<br /><br />One other note and this is an issue that caused me to drop a star off. I purchased the splitter cable to install this in an effort to use the edge programmer as well. For some reason this will not work if my edge is plugged in. So I must choose one of the two. In the end I believe the edge will win and this will just be a toy item for use when driving my daily driver car around. If I would have known what I do now I think I would have purchased this because of the incompatibility with my edge and the intended use was for my pick-up.<br /><br />11-5-15 The Edge won and I did find a way for it to keep a log of my average mileage.<br />The battery in the Lemur monitor does not last long at all. It has set blank for months now. Once the fun wore off I feel my money could have been spent better elsewhere.
B000UV8FNS|5|Product works great, I have no problems. They came here on time. They fit right into where I needed them to go, and very easy to instal
B00MUYQM9M|5|👌
B005H123TI|5|Work great.  Seems expensive for foam, but this is cheaper than other brands, and work just as well.
B00153XSWI|5|SAVED money over the local parts houses!<br /><br />It feels great to do our own auto maintenance, while saving tons of CA$H, beating up the parts houses...
B00S74WBLM|5|Great product, simple and easy to install and programing (auto programing).
B0000CBILL|4|TOUGH CLUB!
B000OL08ES|5|Genuine HD Part, easy to put together, came with hardware for small or large hitches. Well made metal piece . Not cheap plastic. Will look as good as new 10 years down the road
B000LEPT5G|3|It reads and erases codes for my 2003 rav4 but when it comes to I/M inspection and maintenance monitors it would not determine if monitors were ready, it read &#34;N/A&#34;.  I needed that info to determine when my car was ready to get an inspection sticker instead of going to the garage every other day.  Used a friends scanner instead, an actron cp9175. That one told me if the monitors were ready.
B000C2Q3GQ|5|perfect, seems like very good quality. it fit perfect in my 1992 ford f-150. it showed up to the house very quickly.
B0049984BA|5|Bought for my 09 Smart car, same product as the dealer but 40.00 cheaper. will be buying again when needed
B007I6K4I2|5|Fit my motor perfectly. Price was very reasonable.
B005SUX9MI|5|Tool works  great. Only 2 complaints, the instructions need a few pictures, and the 25mm install tool would be nice.  I have service manual so not really that big a deal.
B000CSW6KM|5|No problems of complaints. Great Fitting on My NISSAN A LITAMA GXE 2000 Model. it's fits really well and may ordered agin in the futures for any other item. Glad I am found this item thru you. Thank you for nice products.
B00KTIR1ZU|4|Did work on my Malibu but had to take to locksmith to have it set.
B004L035UW|5|Fast shipping... Item as described....
B01171RQV6|5|I ordered these for my husband's 2010 Jeep Wrangler and they fit perfectly. Installation couldn't be easier with the pre-applied adhesive - I was able to install them myself!
B00KSOGTWG|4|good
B000LNBLTK|4|thay were good, but not very good, any way thanks.
B0012DKFEK|5|Got it, good!
B0009VF1AY|5|Been using this item for quite awhile.Works well with openings on most alloy wheels.Lasts fairly long and cheap enough to replace when necessary.I always have a spare.  I just ordered two.
B004ZF44DU|5|Quick easy install as promised. Great buy so far!
B008MU2PHQ|5|Shirt was delivered on-time. My only complaint was that the sleeves are a bit on the short-end, but that is up to the manufacturer to solve...
B005FK7IZ0|5|Fits great and stops on a dime. Easy to install and looks great. Painted calipers to match the brakes. Red and chrome.
B00DU24YKW|4|Product is great. Packaging is terrible.
B0006JLW84|4|We were able to install this replacement lid easily and quickly.  It fit well and mated with the old interior hardware to open and close it.  It is a real bargain at the price.  We did seal around the edges and screws on the roof to weather seal it.
B0002Z9R16|5|I had ordered replacement blades (passenger side and driver side) for my 2007 Toyota Sienna.  Only this one fit on the driver side.  The other blade ordered (the smaller of the two) did not fit the passenger side.  The new blade (this one) is on the driver side and works just fine.
B00FRHOMNM|5|Nice wipers
B007FTLJKY|1|Do not buy! Did not work on my window!
B00BITJM4W|4|Easy to install very satisfied. .
B004UL5V40|3|it is a little big and the light died really fast.
B00802FG68|5|I installed this on my 1999 F-350, It took about 20 minutes and they work great.
B00EMHTB5W|5|I bought one of these for both of my Subarus.  The Emblem is well made nad beautifully crafted.  I took the precaution of putting about 20 coats of Liquid Glass Protect Coating on each one before putting on the cars.  One is garaged and one is not.  But, they are so nice that they deserve to be protected.  If you are a Mason, this is a product to be proud of on your car.
B00188V1OW|5|Perfect fit
B0038AWH82|5|I have a black Sport Trac, and these accent the back nicely. Installation was all of 5 minutes. Super easy.
B005ZWM0R4|5|Does exactly what it is advertised to do, easy to use, worth every penny. Knowledge is power, this easy to use program gives us backyard mechanics much needed power again to do our own repairs to our vehicles. No more wondering what to do with a vague something, maybe this code from one of those cheap hand held code readers. This programs gives the code, but also a means to dig down to specifics and the monitoring program is great to record while driving so when that problem that only happens at a certain speed or situation wheels it's ugly head, you can capture the readings from your car's sensors and analyze them back at the shop or home. If you are a do it yourself kind of person , this program will be extremely helpful to you.<br /> About the seller, good deal, fast shipping, delivered what they advertised. I would definitely do business with them in the future.
B002OC9B4I|5|I use in every car and my RV...
B000BVQ7YG|1|These were way too small for a Chevy Beretta. Barely fit over the back but no way the seat part was going to fit. Couldn't even get a corner on. The fabric is very thin and cheap. It's going back.
B009Z7O3S4|5|I love the way this looks on my Red/Black/White  2012 Kawasaki Ninja and it is on there too I put the top on a little crooked and could barely lift it up to move it straight. I'm very happy with this purchase.
B0097BFB0C|5|I am so pleased with my $11 key (less than $15 after shipping) that is the exact same thing others want $50 for.  I had it cut for $4 and it works like a charm.  Their (other products and their) CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS GREAT.
B000BZJMIU|5|I choose this part because the name and the price, it is the right part for my Sunfire with 2.4L motor
B00BT5ZNES|3|the looks of the products is the same ...however was surprised that it was made in china. Though Ive paid SGD400++ which made in Japan cost SGD800++...<br />quality tells everything.<br />no worries..prompt delivery by seller. cheers
B00J5BPMA8|5|Works great and is so much cheaper than from the auto parts store.
B000GU3498|2|Cheap Chinese plastic part but it looks the part and works, comes in singles so if you need a pair buy two
B00TEHDXPO|1|It broke when I was fastening it to the car. Very poor quality.
B0002U1TXK|4|Well, it did just that.  It went from faded grey to black.  I had to apply 3 coats, but it got the job done.
B00CS6VELI|5|Great quality! Looks awesome in the man cave!
B0062B2OL4|2|I have only had this product less than a month and it is already broken. Very disappointed in the product.
B000JIND4S|4|This item is described exactly, as mentioned. Being that I use it for extra security purposes for my classic hobby car, this item was ideal. The only issue, which could be perceived in either light is: the lock barrel tends to get stuck from time to time, when unlocking.
B004ULCATY|1|Wrong finish...need to return item.
B000E4PVD8|4|Fast, and was just what I needed, although I had to buy a different tool to put the thing in, but that was ok
B002JPA770|5|This shade fits perfectly in my 2012 Subaru Outback and I can put it up quickly.  It's a little stiff, but rolls up easily enough and has its own velcro strap for storage.<br /><br />UPS managed to screw up the shipment and the box ended up at their office and didn't move.  I contacted the shipper and they 2nd day air shipped me a replacement at no additional cost to me.  They were really on top of the issue and kept me up to date the whole way.
B00TOK3Z0E|5|great
B000EEXGNK|5|fit and looks great
B00BER8T1K|5|Good
B007CLSJRQ|5|Great price compared to local Subaru dealers and fast shipping. Could not be more happy with the purchase! A+++
B004P1WNUU|3|Decent product.  The rings on the latch that keep the half top secured broke easily, the bow thingy is rattles and is annoying, the quick release bow knuckles break easily!  It is a pain to put up and down alone.  The top is quieter than OEM.
B000BM8RT8|5|it looked like a good thing, but my error I bought the wrong one so had to return. Happily return was quick and easy.
B005NRUPDC|5|Very good product, easy installation, good quality and great output and visibility, will be buying a set for my low beams.
B000BRJOVI|5|I like it better than the hard covers. It is smaller and it has a zippered top so you don't have to take the cover off to turn the gas on or off.
B001G64954|4|Have had them in for a year now and they are just fine,  fast and easy to install, I am not a mechanic, but I do like to be able to save money on things I can do myself.  This is one.
B00ATY2LYA|5|Bought this for a friend. Fits well and has been washed and worn in the rain no problemo. A good buy
B00OMT6UEK|5|Helpful and Fun. Work great
B000TYOQVQ|5|I haven't been able to control my a/c knob for a month now so I was very happy to receive this!
B001KQAAAS|5|Perfect fit and easy to install
B006P89R00|4|Quality patch with a nice white border. Basic and a bit bigger than I expected. But it is a quality patch.
B004AE0DAY|5|Perfect couldn't tell it was replaced works well!
B000BW8NLA|5|Outperformed other cheaper rotors. Worth the couple extra bucks for the ACCEL brand. Recommended.
B001C6NL52|5|IT KEEPS SOCKETS EASY TO FIND<br />FITS GREAT IN TOOL BOX<br />WOULD RECOMEND TO ANYONEANYONE WANTING TO ORGANIZE THEIR SOCKET IT'S THE BEST
B004NBO8BE|5|The tank arrived in good condition, fully assembled as stated, and with new tank straps. I installed it and it all fit perfect. Put fuel in it, cycled the key a couple times and tried to start the truck and it fired right up. I have had no problems with it since. All lines came plugged to ensure the tank remained clean on the inside.<br /><br />Only recommendation I have is to pick up some sticky foam tape to use to on the tank where it meets the bed frame. The originals don't come off the original tank and it doesn't ship with any. Wash the frame indents with brake clean to get the shipping oil off the tank so the foam tape will stick to the metal.<br /><br />Overall a great buy to rehab an old fuel system.
B008MAZNR0|5|NICE BLANKET THAT MY GRANDSON WILL LOVE
B001MS229Q|1|I bought the AutoSock for my Mazda CX-5 (Front-Wheel Drive with 6 speed Manual and Traction/Stability Control) and unfortunately was terribly disappointed. One day of Snow and I was so excited to try these down our Street (I live on the end of hill on a dead-end street).  I had checked all the YouTube clips, made sure to get the right fitting AutoSock and was almost certain that I was gonna drive through the snow with ease as they have demonstrated.<br /><br />I drove down our driveway, found my vehicle slipping in the snow/ice even with traction control on and with Nokian All-Weather Tires installed (which is another disappointing story in itself).  Put on the AutoSock which is not a big deal and started to drive.  I think I was able to get traction for about 3 meters when the wheels started spinning and I saw my AutoSocks start to fall off (I was not driving with a lot of throttle on the Gas).<br /><br />I simply put them back on again (I think I did this 3 or 4 times) and the AutoSock just couldn't provide the traction to get up a hill.  Eventually in maybe 1 hour of not giving up on my Auto Sock, they eventually just had tears all over the place and gave up on me.  So in other words my AutoSocks were good for 3 meters of hilly snow covering, and that's all it could give me before they were too damaged to use and I was too fed up to handle.  I wish I had documented my experience with photos but I was so certain these things would work and so ANGRY that they didn't, that taking photos was the last thing on my mind.<br /><br />Spent my money and a lot of time researching another supposedly superior European product only to be very disappointed with the results.  I know there are a lot of positive reviews for this product, but unless someone is willing to stick these on my vehicle on a snow covered hilly street and prove that I was the problem and not the product itself, my mind is set.<br /><br />My recommendation:  ALL-WHEEL DRIVE (hello Subaru) and designated SNOW TIRES (Not an All-Weather tire) in the Winter!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Michael M.<br />Vancouver, BC, CANADA
B0067ECOZW|5|Always been buying this oil filter and it has amazing results.  I change my oil every 5,000 miles and might consider changing it at least 10,000 now since the filtration style of this oil filter lasts quite a while.  The oil still glows amber when I drained it out and I can still see through it like it was new.  Usually it's so black that it stains anything it touches and I can't see anything through it.  K&N is known for all their high performance quality products and the price can't be beat either.  I will keep buying these filters for all the cars in my family and help them change their oil as well.  Easy to twist in and out.  Might be better with gripped material on the top, but they have the wrench off model instead which is a bit expensive I have to say, but also does the job completely.
B000NTE6LW|5|I was very happy finally have my gas tank door fixed.  This was very easy and did not take long at all.  One recommendation to make it even easier... loosen the hose clamp that holds the gas line to the frame.  If you follow the gas line down from the fill hole, it will bend (approx 12&#34; down from the fill hole).  There is a hose clamp at this bend.  Loosen it.  It will give you a little more &#34;wiggle room&#34; when you are fitting the door assembly thru the hole.<br /><br />My boss had this same problem on his truck.  He took it to the shop. They charged him $50 for parts and $100 for labor.  This is way cheaper and is really easy.<br /><br />Shipping time was great too, even with regular shipping.  Thanks!
B004DB81F8|5|This is an uncommon fuse, which probably explains why it is expensive. Installed them upon receipt and so far no problems
B0067UCHM6|5|Worked well, roll's smooth, easy to install.
B00HDU7FQW|5|Very Nice
B00CNI1SDA|5|One of the most powerful condition. Great product.
B00596QVHG|3|The tips are great, but when used with fast setting products the tips will set up quick and you will have to replace them and the thing about replacing them is they are not cheap, over priced for what they are.
B00OR1HF4W|5|Like the look  and fit. Nice
B000ALBS0K|5|I only purchased one of these for an '01 Jeep Grand Cherokee and it worked flawlessly. No more holding up the rear gate to load up my groceries.
B00651CLCS|5|Quick upgrade and easy install, still get great reception and don't have to worry about car wash damage from long factory piece. Looks great and works as described!
B000GZV7NI|5|Great bolt set. Would be a little better if it came with a fitment guide, but overall definitely what I expected.
B005O1A13G|5|oem mats...great price
B005LGZO6I|3|plastic cheap s***, but good looking, ok to stick on a tool box, but no way i stick this on a car
B001FAI9UM|5|Glad I bought this with the flares I bought. Made it very easy to install the new flares. Recommend this kit to someone who is buying a flare kit
B001NQKH76|3|cheap sticker
B001OZQEKA|5|Great stuff!
B001CIWFVG|4|Very pleased with the easy installation and ease of use with this product. I give it a 4 star instead of a 5 only due to the fact I had a defective product  that was originally sent and had just a little hassle getting my account credited and a new item shipped.
B0023075SA|5|Great. Thanks
B000AMADZA|5|Let me preface my review by stating that I bought these lights in 2004 for my '04 Pontiac Vibe when it was brand new. I hated the orange turn signal lights in the clear lens of the headlamp and thought this would give me an updated look. I was blown away by how cool they looked once installed. I received a lot of comments from people who were seeing my new car for the first time, even from people who were not into cars, about how they like the blue lights. I still have these lights in my Vibe and they are still just as blue today as they were the day I bought them; they have not faded at all.<br /><br />I came here today because I bought a Subaru Forester and I wanted to get the same blue turn-signals for it as well. I thought I'd do the courtesy of leaving some feedback on these great lights in case anyone wondered about the quality. They are more expensive than OEM replacements, but they last just as long and look nicer. After looking into how to replace the turn-signal lights in the Forester, I only wish these lights installed themselves ;)
B000HKG2WS|1|Unlike any dollar store nail clipper, this clipper will simply not cut nails. There's a fundamental design flaw as it does not have enough pressure to cut nails.
B00O84WNNG|5|Works great.
B0001L0DFA|5|It's an excellent nozzle that exceeds anything I've ever used.
B009EQDOY0|5|I tried using this Gloss It Leather polish on my GT3 as well as my 15 year old audi TT. Simply amazing. Ill let the pics do the talking
B0016LA5O8|5|must have adapter for the CTEK Multi US 72002 12v charger.  Makes keeping you car charged easy buy just plugging into the cigarette outlet in your vehicle.  Easy to go from one car to another.
B0096UAZH8|5|Best lights i have purchased. They work great and are very bright! I have them mounted behind a tinted back glass and they are still extremely bright. They do well on a accident scene! I highly recommend them to any Fire or Rescue personnel!
B000BZGCKQ|1|I thought I that did my research on this fuel pump before I made my purchase? The instructions state that \\"A new filter screen is required (sold separately). Failure to replace the filter screen will void the warranty.\\" Really?<br /><br />Speaking of the fuel pump warranty, this was something that I missed checking on before I ordered this pump #67657, so I assumed that the warranty information would be included with the installation instructions in the box, I assumed wrong, there isn't any warranty information included in the box. If you go to the manufactures web site ([...] on your smart phone, good luck, you will need to find it on a computer.<br /><br />The stated 5-8 day delivery was really 10 days, so If you need the pump sooner, you will need to pay for upgraded shipping, Smartpost, is ok if you don't need you part very quickly?<br /><br />I hope the install goes better than it has so far, still not sure what to do about the filter screen, don't know if I needed one, what is the screen on the bottom of the pump for? Is it a filter screen?<br /><br />Maybe I shouldn't read the installation instructions and just install it?
B000CGROBA|5|The leaking steering box input shaft seal is a common problem on vintage cars, and the common fix seams to be to buy a new or rebuilt unit, at $100 to over $500.  This is a great alternative fix, and it worked for me.  I replaced the seal in my 1965 El Camino, and also used Lucas power steering fluid Stop Leak Just to be safe.  I think part of this problem may be due to using the new thin power steering fluids.  Back in the  day, they used automatic transmission fluid, but the Lucas works great.  I removed the box from the car to work on it, easier that way.  I used a windshield trim removal hook tool to remove the old seal, and a socket and hammer to install the new seal.  Don't forget to put fluid all over the seal before putting it in.
B00HHG910A|5|I purchased these as a gift for my daughter who has had to purchase two replacement set of keys within a two week period.  They have been great and she uses it often!  Definitely worth the money, especially when you consider the alternative!
B00B5ZYY38|5|Received quickly and worked as expected. No issues.
B002GCKV0E|1|does not work , compass and temp only clock works
B002J858HQ|5|smells just like the first day I purchased my car.  Love this stuff
B0016H0O6G|5|I have a carrier attached to the trailer hitch on my 97 Buick. The carrier is for coolers or duffel bags etc. It does not have any lights and extends about 3 feet from the back of the car. I drive all around the country and you never know about weather or driving conditions. I didn't want somebody bumping into my rear because the directionals, tail and brake lights are largely obscured by stuff loaded on the carrier. I bought and mounted this set onto the carrier for greater visibility. They work fine and plugged into my 4 connector trailer light harness in the car.
B000C7NBRU|5|Everything suited me, excellent goods, thanks to the seller, successful sales to the seller! Thank you very much! Good luck!
B000AMXSUM|5|Great lights - really bright
B000M5Y720|5|Great lights.  Really light up the night.  Exactly what we were looking for.
B004ZF3TZY|5|The kit was extremely easy to install and had everything I needed. It works great and is so much brighter than the old halogens. I got the 6000K bulbs and they are exactly what I was looking for. A little blue tint that looks cool and lets people know I have Xenons and yet not outrageously blue like the 10000K. I considered the 8000K but I think I made the right choice.<br />I'd recommend doing this mod. Its easy and definitely worth it.<br />I would also recommend aiming your headlights very carefully after installation. Its better to aim them a little further down than stock just because they are significantly brighter. Please don't blind people. Xenons really weren't meant to be in reflector housings to begin with.
B001FCJYLI|3|Only 2 problems. First the guard had a 3 inch scuff, I would have complained but it took a week longer than Amazon promised to get the guard in the first place.<br />Second, one of the screws supplied is a socket head, Allen, screw. A wrench is supplied but it does not fit, not even close in size.<br />Otherwise a well built guard at a good price.<br />I would not recommend buying from Amazon any piece that cannot be shipped by FedEx or UPS or USPS. It took over a week for the shipping company to get the guard the last 55 miles to my home. Original delivery date was Dec. 28 and the part arrived Jan. 7. It arrived near my house on Dec.27, so it could have been delivered on time.
B008032QSI|5|Perfect replacement for my original filler neck on my 96' Ford Ranger. My old filler neck was corroded and the smell of gasoline was always present when driving my truck. The price was right and I was already having my brake lines done on my truck so install was easy. Fast shipping as well. Hopefully I wont need another one of these for 19 more years!
B004XCRHXO|5|Just installed these rear pads on my Mazda 3i 2005. Perfect fit, easy to install, are quiet with a low amount of dust and most importantly - do a great job of stopping the car. Will be using Prime Choice pads for my front brakes when I need to replace them.
B00FS2TL8C|5|worked great for my Honda Fourtrax.
B000HI11MQ|3|The guage set is great,however the can tap is terrible. It leaks badly
B001JSYFW6|3|OK, my two star review is because, although the product smells really nice, a mellow sort of natural vanilla, It has only lasted about 10 days. I even opened the bag only very slightly at the top (it would have been too strong if I just took it out completely) and left it hanging there. It smelled nice every time I got into the car, but now the scent is gone unless I squeeze the bag a little. I could take the bag completely out of the plastic and that would flood the cabin with more scent, but I think the scent would not last very long. If I'm using the product incorrectly, let me know and I'll change my review rating. Again, the scent is very nice and worthy of 5 stars but the scent does not last, which to me is an important part of the product.
B001L9ZGX0|1|I really needed this for the holiday season but I never got it. Because of that along with several other gifts meant to be given for the holiday season I was out a significant amount of money because of my purchases and empty handed!
B002XLHUQG|4|This product is definitely worth the extra pounds you'll haul.  It won't make you feel like you're on a block foundation, but it makes the trailer much more still when people walk around inside.  Very easy to install and take off.  I'd give it five stars if it weighed less, but lighter strong materials would probably have cost more.
B000PAM9KO|5|Fits and works ad expected. Great price.
B000E28JZC|4|I didn't expect this to make any performance difference but it does seem to allow more air flow over the stock filter. I had a custom Dyno tune done post install and the tuner commented that the bike was getting more airflow than the previous map.
B005FMU21U|5|Dont risk using this escential parts from a third party manufacturer. Even if they say are OEM. I let my mechanic install one just to get out of the initial problem breaking the promise not to install aftermarket again. And thy are not cheap either. Just a few bucks. Genuine rules.
B00PV5ES7U|5|Nice heavy duty mat. It was easy to cut to fit my truck.
B002OP3V0U|3|i have a 12 foot clam shell trailer. Needed two of them.
B00NUJ35T6|5|Work great
B000CQSKV8|5|Easy to install and wire using the harness adapter.
B009B324ZG|2|Claims that this doesn't fog but it does fog up if its cold out. Looks good but terrible when it comes to fogging.
B007TWOKSU|5|Kit works great. Shock extensions are a great alternative to having to buy longer shocks. Wouldn't hesitate to buy from Fat Bob's Garage again
B000CB01EW|5|works great,thanks
B00BENM7T4|5|This fits my Chevy cobalt great! There's plenty of extra room but since my car is smaller there's extra room. I'm very pleased. It reaches all the way down to my tires!! I don't have to worry about pesky cats! The price us great and the quality is very good! It comes with a lock and chain to lock the cover in place. I would recommend this to anyone. Thank you!
B002MZ6LDG|5|This plate frame was purchased to go on a Plum Crazy Daytona and looks great.  Sturdy quality and seller provided fast shipping.  Well worth the dollars.
B007Z9250C|5|beautiful light works great.
B00HFDH1KC|3|I three starred it because the adjustable part to make the wheel camber seems cheap and it bent when I tightened it so I will be switching the out these are kind of temporary they work the rest of it is stront but I wouldn't recommend cambering the wheel with these.
B00FBKW3RC|1|DONT EVEN TRY IT ITS A WASTE MONEY AND TIME !  ITS A KINDA OF GARBAGE KIT  GO AND SEE THE LINK  [...]
B001PWFPE8|5|This thing is fantastic!! Every truck owner should have one. It was pretty easy to install, just don't let the nut sert fitting turn while you are turning the little install tool(You'll see when you read the directions). The best upgrade I have ever put on a truck! Everyone wants one when they see it, it is funny to watch someone open the tailgate and force themselves to let go of it and watch it fall softly to the open position
B00C25413I|5|Great product, great fit, great price! This helmet is better made and a better fit than a more expensive one ordered by a friend. I am glad I found it. Being on sale at a great price was also a plus.
B008BLKZJG|4|Works great
B00KRXXI18|5|Perfect fit
B002N4KI08|1|This wiper is absolutely terrible. The top and bottom of the blade did not make contact with the windshield. I returned the blade immediately. I have a 2009 Toyota Corolla which is way too common of a car to not have a wiper like this work on it.
B00387ZSXG|5|It is 21mm or 13/16\\" and if you are looking for the front ones, they are the same as the Nissan Titan 34mm or 1-5/8\\".<br />Good luck!
B00EPRBVS4|3|Product is great. Perfect fit and looks good. The only problem that I have is that it was missing two bolts that are required to finish the install. Added too much time to go get the needed hardware to finish the job. Otherwise great product.
B005MEZIYM|3|Can't see the word cadillac very well
B004Z89R9S|3|it looks great but to get the alignment correct is hard to do without loctite. other then that its cool
B0031HJFM8|5|worked great as a replacement unit<br />the 02 sensor that was being replaced had caused my friends beloved s2k to run poorly.<br /><br />this unit fixed everything!<br /><br />fitment was perfect!
B0073METR8|5|Excellant product. Fast shipping. This product was a perfect replacement part. All connections are the same size and the fitment  was the same as the original part.
B0002NYE3Y|5|Right up my alley...js
B0002SRL20|2|I like this gauge a lot, but when I received it and hooked it up it would always be 5 pounds off. I'm not sure if there is a way to recalibrate it or if I just got the lucky defected one. It is just annoying to know that the gauge built in is usless. I'm not sure if I can get a replacement or anything, but atleast it does half the job.
B008LMNGA0|5|Excellent quality! How can you not love this sticker?! I ended up ordering another to have on hand and the first one is on the base of my power chair. Arrr!
B000AMBO9O|5|I have a Lexus LS400 with 145k on it and it was throwing the catalytic convertor below efficiency threshold. I put in two cans of this cleaner and the engine light went off within a couple of miles and has stayed off for more than 400 miles. The codes no longer show up on my scanner. I live in California where passing smog can be a trial. Anything below 95% efficiency on the cats throws the codes so I am happy and will definitely add more to the car before smog time rolls around again.
B007XG6MYM|5|I have had been sitting on a leather chair for the past three years--it is my chair.  I never thought about cleaning it, conditioning it, or protecting it.  It seemed to wear very well, and everything seemed fine.  Then I had the opportunity to try Tantex Leather Conditioner.  I was sent a bottle for review, and I followed the simple instructions on my leather chair.  I was amazed to see the leather perk up and look better and cleaner than it ever had before. The directions said to clean the leather if it was dirty, but I did not think it was dirty.  Notwithstanding, the leather conditioner still removed the dust and dirt that I could not see.<br /><br />As I am now sitting on the chair that has been conditioned, I can say that it seems a little bit sticky (it is a hot day outside, so that may be why), but I can tell how nice the leather looks.  I am glad that the chair is protected since I find myself practically living in this chair when I am at  home and blogging.  I can hardly wait to see how it will work on other leather things such as our car seats.  I am glad that I had the opportunity to try this product, and I certainly plan to continue to do so.
B0015YBYCS|5|very sturdy and thick.  Actually used these as seat covers in a minvan.
B0062WBSB0|5|Good price compared to what I paid in the pass. Got 2 for less than the price of one.
B002W2A108|5|nice
B00TQ6W2JQ|1|i bought this item and within 1 week  the rubber turned to rock and my technician is going to have to do the work twice. u know what that means for my wallet and now we found out too late and according to amazon.
B002W2QI96|2|As some others have mentioned, pay close attention to the picture, as the lanyard reads &#34;Football Club Chelsea&#34; instead of Chelsea Football Club (CFC) that I'm assuming you know and love by browsing this item. They do get 2 stars from me though as the picture is accurate, although it is difficult to tell seeing as though the phrase wraps.<br /><br />The upside is that the price is minimal - I'm off to look for an officially licensed product now myself.
B000M5Y720|5|Will buy again
B00BD62X9Q|5|Works very well!  There were two issues: (1) the instructions for removing the inside plastic trim in order to route wiring was woefully inadequate and resulted in some trial and error and (2) running the long power wire from the back of the vehicle to the battery was more involved than indicated...I finally took it to a garage with a lift for this.  But, once past these installations issues, it works like a charm!
B005V0EBFO|5|Excellent for keeping you car clean - especially if you have kids!!
B004XA4UU4|5|very comfortable I would buy it again!
B004ME8MZ0|3|fits my 2012 Avalanche mirrors perfectly, however, they vibrate a little too much for me.
B000NCOKZQ|5|For the price it is unbeatable quality and efficiency. After one year of installation still works perfectly without any problem.
B000FPY9ZM|5|Great item fast delivery
B00CFCI9AY|5|great
B008CFTL64|5|works very good
B0009YDPFO|4|This is old school but it still does the job.  All these new canvas things are terrible ideas for trash cans in your car.  Every so often I take this thing in and run it through the dish washer...good as new.
B00KF9180W|5|all very well.fast shipping.
B00H8WYAWW|3|The picture shows the seatbelt covers but it doesnt come with them. It was very difficult to get on my stearing wheel but it is very cute.
B0013F6SL6|5|Highly Recommend this for your Jeep! I love it on mine!
B006O83OFU|5|great bling! gold, 420 sized chain, 100 links, enough for my 1963 honda Trail 55 Honda Cub. Not the original size chain for the bike, but changing front & rear sprockets I was able to use this chain. It has been on and used for at least 6 months now and with no issues at all. being removed and installed over a handfull of times aswell.
B001GS9W5E|3|Works well, takes a while to open and close.
B000E7UIWE|4|good assortment of bungees, so far we haven't had any issues with quality
B004OZLNE4|5|Great product
B005EVARDU|5|I gave it 5 stars cause it comes with a bypass.<br /><br />Pros: nothing bad to say it is a very nice unit would always install this over other brands very easy to install EVEN IF U ARE NEW TO ELECTRONICS if u know how to plug in a night light u can do this to.<br /><br />CONS: no cons<br /><br />GET R DONE
B004SJT2HQ|4|I got the right part for a decent price. Delivery was good too. It fixed my problem with the cruise control not engaging.
B000IZ3K4U|5|Works as intended. (2006 Pontiac Solstice)
B00M3NEBMK|5|Purchased for hunting and couldn't be happier. My brother and I hunt in Montana close to the continental divide. Some mornings our day will start in sub zero temps. These will keep the wind from burning your face.
B005I5TW2E|5|I use this product in my work. The price offered here was a lot cheaper than purchasing it at an automotive store.
B00CIVU0K4|4|I was severely disappointed in the fact that it only comes as a single and not a pair.  Should be very clear that they are sold as singles and not in pairs, had to another one.
B0055XHBHC|5|We bought this in December and couldn't wait to try it. We have now had it six months and we have NEVER slept better in our camper than we do now. We both love this mattress! We are now looking for one like this for our home. Super great buy! This fits perfectly in our campers and works well with the storage area below the bed. Very easy to lift for bed making.
B001O9FXDU|1|This was installed professionally and it does not work, I will need to pay to have it uninstalled and returned.  I am very disappointed!
B00H26J1FU|5|I don't have a car right now but hubby does ride in them and I thought that having a 5 in 1 tool like this one would be great to have around no just for emergencies in a car but for emergencies at home. This auto glass breaker and seat belt cutter also has a flashlight and emergency beacon so rescuers can find you if they see it and are trying to find you.<br /><br />I have an emergency kit at home and like finding new things to add to it. The power went out in my neighborhood several times last year and having flashlights and other emergency products in my kit makes me feel prepared in case of a more dangerous emergency like an earthquake.<br /><br />This is a great tool to have and it came with 2 emergency mylar blankets which can help keep you from suffering hypothermia in the cold.<br /><br />We popped in some batteries to check it out and everything works on it. Ken even used the seat belt cutter to cut some old fabric in half to see how sharp it was and it's pretty darn sharp. This is a great product to keep in an emergency kit or your car.<br /><br />This is the first window breaker tool that I've ever owned and my husband was thrilled that it also had a seat belt cutter along with it. Both of those things are must haves for anyone who owns a car because you just never know when you're going to need them.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a deep discount in exchange for my honest review.
B002SSGAZG|4|I thought it would be thicker, but seems very strong.  Getting the backing off is a pain, like most other products with backing, but it sticks great.  I'd been using gorilla tape on my trailer under belly fabric, but this is much better.
B000KPU8JI|5|great product for tracing out shorts. glad i got one for my tool box.
B00099YORC|3|Works very well, but WILL move around the garage floor, either little by little with normal use, or alot if kicked/walked on by family members, pets etc. The fix is easy: $5 at Lowes will get you a special kit that will anchor the mats securly to the floor. Problem solved!
B001TE0IMG|5|I got this for my RV, for appliances such as the blender which require more than 400 watts. Be advised, this does not come with the cigarette lighter plug for a reason; those cigarette plugs are not designed for more than 400 watts. So you hook this one up directly to the battery. Enjoy making smoothies in the great outdoors, next to your battery!
B0033BW06K|5|Mopar Fans...; this is a must have item.  Proudly show off your colors!!  This is an awesome gift to give.
B001GF3R62|3|I GOT this  Shield SOME years ago and when they OFFERED ... a \\"LIFETIME\\" Warranty !  Then, a YEAR or TWO ago, the WARRANTY  was ONLY 1 year and NOW..... 90DAYS???<br /><br />Mine IS FALLING APART and If, I could Find MY \\"LIFE TIME WARRANTY \\" , I would sent it back!!!
B000BWE4RC|1|i installed this fuel pump on my honda trs 350 4 wheeler and it worked great for the 5 minutes i used it.i then went on vacation for 2 weeks.when i got back and tried to start my 4 wheeler the fuel pump would not work.
B00801RSIS|5|My factory spring snapped so I needed a new set for my 2001 Grand prix GT. These fit perfect and easy to install. Rides like new!
B00JJZ2HTE|3|Support the gate, but do not assist the opening like others.
B005UVN1PU|5|It fits pretty good and has lasted 6 months so far, so I'm pretty happy with it. But I remember I had to do a slight modification inside to it to make it fit.
B001SLEPB0|4|Good quality.  The only thing was a slight defect in the stitching in one place, which required me to reinstall it with the defect on the far side.  Hope it will prevent severe heat on the steering wheel in summer AZ heat.
B008F8Q8K0|5|Very nice. I wish the bulbs were included, but it was a good buy and really spruces up the front end.
B00CPLHCJO|2|No! No! No! Do not waste your money here. Pull time is nill, then you have to wait for 30 minutes for battery to &#34;cool down&#34;
B00KOPEHFU|5|Great graphics and the right size for the tailgate of my truck.  Looks awesome.
B00BHH1QT4|5|Arrived on time and worked well to aid in keeping the spray perpendicular to the surface better than a finger on the valve did.  My wrist bends easily with this tool in a way it didn't without it.
B000CMFSWG|4|Holds mud and water well when getting in during bad weather. Only flaw is that the rubber tends to stain, that is the only reason that I only gave a 4 star
B005MW8FTY|5|What more can I say? These boots fit good, my son likes them and they seem durable and well made.
B003GV46MI|4|I needed a product to fill a small, quarter-inch crack in a hot water boiler system. Water was leaking out of the cast iron boiler onto the basement floor. Boy, what a mess for such a small crack. Lab-Metal filled the crack and stopped the leak. It got me through the entire winter and saved me big dollars until I could afford to replace that boiler in July of the following year. You should also buy Lab-Solvent when using Lab-Metal which will assist in thinning out the material so that it can be applied much more easily.
B009EVOWPU|4|IHelpful info if you are looking to buy this.  There are NUMEROUS complaints about the instructions.  If you download the instructions, open it in Adobe PDF Reader, NOT a web browser, you will see an option for Layers.  Open the layers and click on INSTRUCTIONS for every page,  The instructions will appear.  Not sure who's idiot nephew at Bestop was hired to design their web site or their instructions, but my past experience with their products has been good.  I will be ordering this when my new Hard Rock Rubicon arrives.
B000E2CSVS|4|Good article.
B00GUDCVN0|5|Auto-liftgate stopped working so I took the headliner down from inside the car and pulled the motor apart.  Couldn't find any problems with the motor or the wiring.  Found a post online that said this part solves the puzzle and even though I still don't understand why, he was correct.<br /><br />I pulled the liftgate cover off, disconnected the old part, put this in place and the liftgate works like new again.
B00H1IBKIK|5|Awesome
B0014JN68O|3|If you plan on hooking up to a gas bottle you'll need a quick connect-to-regulator hose. That being said I mostly do like the grill. The smoker plate helps evenly distribute the heat evenly. It's pretty small and best used for 1-4 people. The latch is a little flimsy but the base is surprisingly solid.
B0002EXJI4|5|This product was a great buy. Not only did it ship quickly but it also arrived undamaged. Thanks for the fuses they realy helped out.
B004I0KA3A|5|My mom and dad's old minivan had headlights that were about as clear or transparent as a bottle of Italian salad dressing, not the low-calorie, but the super yummy creamy kind! I looked these replacements up and they were delivered on time and in great condition. My folks were impressed. I installed both of them in about 20 minutes and they have been looking sharp. And you can see (the road amongst other things) whilst driving at night now.
B000BUQOAE|4|The water doesn't Make it into my tank from the sprayer, good pressure just not angled correctly.
B00504TN8G|5|I got this a s a gift for my mother, since we have a corgi, and she LOVED it! We've had it for a while and it hasn't started to come off. I think it's great quality. It's definitely smaller than what i had hoped for, but overall it's wonderful!<br /><br />Yes, I would recommend this product.
B007MVAVAY|5|Working great so far.
B00C7Y2URI|5|Product arrived timely and works great.
B000CN7J40|5|I bought these for my wife for Christmas.  The product came well packaged and was a snap to install and had a great fit.  The directions were included, which did make it easier to install.  They look great and definatley are custom fitted for the trailblazer.  The company who makes them was marked as EGR.  Highly recomend to others.
B00F6E1J8C|5|Bought Mopar police wheels for my snows, but it just wasn't ...right.<br />These caps finish off the winter tire and wheel package perfectly!
B00009WC2Q|4|Worked as advertised. No problems encountered. Much better price than I found on the site recommending it.
B00FS0WFAA|5|Received promptly, Worked great!  Just what I needed to install a new driver seat bottom and foam in my 2008 F150 that I purchased from The Seat Shop online.
B000S34NG6|5|It was what was represented, direct fit and easy to install. Just take your time to make sure gasket aligns properly. Unit has been on for 6 wks or so and no problems.<br /><br />  Thanks, Steve
B00BVE064O|5|had these on for a year so far.. no issues. as bright as the 1st day we got'em.
B00BVE3BVO|1|First started blinking and then stopped working.<br /><br />bought 4 hid kit only 2 are working and 1 is blinking.....<br /><br />9145
B000CO9AXM|5|worked great for a 94 chevy silverado.
B001O0G58Q|5|These lugs were placed on the new 20 inch black and gun metal wheels on the new Dodge Charger. Looks awesome !
B000P8FIIQ|5|Perfict breaks
B005IUT7S8|3|water pump and idler guide pulley dont fit 2009 wrx... prolly should of read a few more reviews before buying
B006K6P68O|3|it slips easily when a heavy object is dragged on top of it...material should have been more soft, it gives a feeling of solid plastic.
B009HXNB2A|5|I install this on my Yamaha Stryker and it fits like a charm. I did double check that the magnet in the end is secured properly and would not come loose while the engine is running (I heard horror stories about this in the forums).<br /><br /> My only gripe about it is that the OEM plug is 17mm and this one is 14mm, but after installation no oil is leaking out so I guess it's ok,<br /><br />Now if your going to ask me if it does really work, and that it will manage to attract metal filing inside my engine? Well, we all have to wait for my next oil change to find out
B0049U1NDK|5|This prodict cost me in the past four times more then this one.<br /><br />Good quality in great price<br /><br />I think that every MX5 owener should get those as a spear parts.
B00E6A4JMA|5|Love it. I'm a WOW fan and I had to have this. It looks really great on my car.
B005KLT8ZC|5|great light  it will be on my next street rod.  not available locally, only at amazon at a very reasonable price
B0067MES6C|5|Installed fast, look great and work good as well. Another quality Woodcraft product that installs quick, fits great and most definitely does the job.
B002EOVDII|5|The charger works fine and it took less than a week to arrive. Check first for fit if your iPhone has a bulky case like a Smile or a Otterbox because it wont fit. Nevertheless it was very cheap to buy and it works.
B0008D6NK0|5|Good product. Small and useful. I like its appearance. I don´t know if it will be durable, but it seems to be well constructed.
B00I0EJRLG|5|I was shocked at how smoothly this clutch engages. It has performed beautifully with my 7.5: P/W ratio AWD car making 400 WHP with<br />4X 285X18 R compound tires.
B003VLBPJA|4|have not used yet for anything as i just bought it to keep on my bike in case i needed it for any reason. but it looks good and hooks securely on my bike and folds up enough to keep under my seat until i need it.
B003072D6E|3|The large was to little for me
B006WEJW6G|4|Excellent product! When the rain comes, you just need to wip with this in your finger and &#34;wala&#34; all it's gone, like magic!.<br /><br />I don't give 5 stars, because they need to do just a little strong, to mantain this straight in your finger, but it's work very well.
B001HX2O26|5|This car decal is awesome! It looks great on a window, bumper, or any part on your vehicle. I have gotten many compliments. I love this product. It shipped quickly and arrived to me in prime condition.
B00F3I92FI|1|Did not fit my car. I ordered the right size, and the bulb was probably the right size, but the notches on the thing to install it in my headlight housing didn't fit.
B000X9AXR8|5|The VIAIR 400P is very impressive and works as advertised. The carry bag with the pockets is a plus for sure.  This compressor has a long power cable and air hose for the extra convenience.  It was worth the purchase.
B0064MX7US|5|perfect
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works Great.  Product folds away neatly.
B000SL4AA2|2|I bought this tire pump because my current tires are old and starting to leak, and I can't afford to replace them until my next couple of paychecks roll in. I figured having this thing would be more convenient than running to the gas station every day, and WAY easier than having to actually call AAA because my tire is so flat I can't even leave my own driveway.<br /><br />Using it is pretty simple and easy. Plug one cable into the cigarette lighter, plug the other into your tire valve, hit the power button and... immediately cover your ears because this thing is LLLOOOUUUDDDD. If you're stuck on the side of an interstate, the noise wouldn't be a problem, but I doubt my neighbors appreciate this racket in our otherwise tranquil community. It vibrates and flops around on the ground, so thankfully it has sturdy construction to withstand beating itself up.<br /><br />THE ABSOLUTE WORST PART... is the locking mechanism on the bit that goes on your tire valve. When you unlock it to take it off, the air starts hissing back out of the tire, and the pump gets stuck on the valve for a little while, so you race to yank the stupid thing off, all the while listening to the air you just pumped in hissing back out. Pretty sure I lost 5 PSI this way, and when you consider the racket and time it took just to put that 5 PSI in there, it's pretty wasteful and irritating.<br /><br />Overall, I'm going to keep it for emergencies. I'd much rather use this thing and limp to the nearest gas station than wait on a tow truck if I get stranded with a flat. But I don't trust it to fully inflate my tire under any circumstances. It seemed to get stuck around 30 PSI when the target was 35. Instructions suggest jacking up the car so the weight isn't sitting on the tire, making it easier for the pump, but I'm not keen on trying that unless I absolutely have to.
B002UXDS40|5|You will need this if you order the heated clothing. You really need it to control the temp. great to be able to set the items to different temps.
B000BNZPT2|1|This did not fit my truck as suggested by amazon. 2009 Dodge Ram 1500.  I am returning it.
B00KFQ28P4|5|It's very good and easy to put on ...
B000C7TV6K|5|Everything as described. Very pleased with products and quick shipment.
B0012GTVVA|5|FOR A SMALL PURCHASE IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE
B00FO3B3EU|5|nice bright led, I used it as a pilot lamp to show that the lights are on.
B0002MBVGI|3|While both the WeatherTech and Amazon's fitment tool states that these mats will fit '97-'03 F-150s, it depends on how you define \\"fit\\".  They do fit as in you put them in and they are small enough for the floor space.  In other words I can put on a size 48 pair of jeans and they'll fit me fine, I'll just look really funny but will still \\"fit\\".  They are not contoured so do not follow the outline of the cab and there is a little less than 1 inch of extra space on either side of the mats for both the driver and passenger side.<br /><br />Another issue is there is no retainer ring aka hole for the floor hook so there will be a bump in the mat on that spot.  They do however grip onto the carpet very well as there are plenty of spikes in the back of the mats so if you can live with the bump they might work for you.  The mats' thickness is good at about 1/2 inch and the material is fairly soft and squishy so are very comfortable for your feet.<br /><br />Since I wanted a custom fit similar to the OEM Ford mats that came with my F-150 (which are now worn) I exchanged them for the WeatherTech Custom Fit Front FloorLiner for Ford F-150 (Black).<br /><br />Weathertech W9 Classic Premium Rubber Mats
B004GETAX4|5|I lost this trim piece when I hit a tire on the expressway.<br /><br />Was going to purchase from the dealer, but this was way cheaper. High quality & fits my 2008 Ford Focus SE perfectly.
B000C30J1U|5|2004 Malibu 3.5L. Fit was perfect.
B00480N104|3|I bought this product to replace the OEM bulbs on a 2004 Tacoma. I'm not sure the different colored sections made that much of a difference. I think the main improvement came from the fact that they were brighter than the OEM bulbs which were already seven years old.<br /><br />Pros: Brighter than the OEM lights.<br /><br />Cons: One of the bulbs went out after 14 months. The bulbs I swapped out were still going after seven years. I expected these to have lasted longer. I ended up putting the original bulbs back in. Luckily I kept them, just in case.
B002ONTBMO|5|Arrived quickly and applied with ease. Watch out for those pesky little air bubbles!
B001EOV492|1|Wrong item. Did not fit my truck. I looked up part for my vehicle and it was the wrong part. I had to send back and had to pay to ship back.
B00EAVKLCM|1|Item was very cheaply made
B0002KKIXC|5|I have been using this to stuff to spot clean my carpets and car mats for 15 years.  I have yet to find a stain it couldn't fix.
B00IJG32PW|5|Best baby sticker ever. I have one for my truck and I gave one to my best friend.  So many people ask me where they can get it. Ha. You have to find humor everyday.
B00M9IJJGW|4|Easy install, fits well, looks good, lightweight. Minor issue was the oil drain hole didn't quite line up so I had to widen the opening with drillbit. Seems to take hits well without cracking
B007J7G4HK|4|Could be a lot mor AMBER, more of a WHITE YELLOW than a true Amber - Looks good on my car
B004I16TBQ|5|Great fit and fast shipping
B001TI5IIQ|5|I have a 2003 Vibe that the headlights were in awful shape, barely put out any light. I used just the first step and they were already clearer, two to  three times brighter. The other steps were performed and while not new looking, most definitely, clearer, brighter and safer. Well worth the cost (low compared to other \\"kits\\"). As other have mentioned, be prepared to spend time rubbing the plastic. All told it took a good hour the get them as clear as I think is possible. Less time is possible, but it is worth a little extra effort to get them right.
B003OB2MXU|5|Best quality for its price hands down!  I can't believe some people spend in the upwards of $130-180 for Samco or Perrin.  Save a little cash and pick this up...you wont be sorry.
B001KSCEZK|5|This was an exact fit for 2004 Maxima SE passenger's side mirror. Arrived well packaged and in perfect condition. Has instructions for removal of old glass or for going over existing glass. I removed my old glass, cleaned up the surface area with some goo-gone and affixed the new mirror in just a couple minutes. Looks great!
B000C847FY|5|Very well built product than the stock one....I would give this a 10 but I can not
B000WPHI4O|5|Seems to be made very well. It is very loud, almost too loud for a small scooter or golf cart. But luckily it is adjustable and works well.
B001EAQTRI|5|I use a Bluetooth receiver to play music and podcasts from my iPhone through my car's speakers. This little device completely eliminated the quiet but annoyingly persistent whine I was hearing due to engine noise. I can now turn it up as loud as I want and the sound is completely clear. This did not affect the bass or take away any sound quality whatsoever... in fact, if I didn't know better, I would say it improved it. It sounds much richer now. I am very, very pleased, and only sad I didn't buy it sooner.
B008A8Z810|5|Perfect quality and arrived on time.
B0036VRQ70|4|look likes it worked
B00029WSZ4|5|Simple, worked well, looks great
B00MTILNA2|3|its a generic version of the real thing...we were able to make adjustments and make it work kinda!!!
B000WKJMHK|5|works great seller contacted me to verify proper fit because amazon wasnt always right. but it work for my ATV. I tore the other seal on shaft and this one only came with one. So I would look to make sure you don't need two.
B0012TZ04E|5|for my ninja costume for Halloween this year.  It's lightweight and easy to breath through!  Great buy, will use it again next year!
B000BQW5LK|5|Should have bought this thing before trying to refill the transfer case with gear oil, I ended up making a mess and had a hard time getting the job done.
B004W5TJME|5|Perfect match.  Delivered on time as promised
B00155237W|5|I live in the Golden state, where you can't do anything to your ride...I've had this on for about 9 months...been pulled over for speeding, tint, speeding, never has an officer even mentioned it. The original reason I bought it was to subdue the bright appearance of the license plate, does that perfectly.
B0091QKXQ0|5|This is the second Core helmet I've purchased.<br />I bought this one for my wife, and it is fantastic!<br />She doesn't like to ride with me too much yet, but for those days when I can coax her &#34;into the saddle&#34;<br />I wanted her to have her own helmet that fit properly.<br /><br />This does the job.  Please use the sizing chart!  It is there for a reason.  Don't go by hat size, or what<br />size your other helmets are.  I am usually an XL in other helmets and hats, but I am a Large in this helmet.<br /><br />I feel confident that this helmet will keep my wife and I protected in case of an accident, it is very well made,<br />and very comfortable for hot weather.<br /><br />It's been in the 90's here these past couple of weeks, and this half helmet really works great.<br />And the price is great for a DOT approved helmet!<br /><br />Buy it, you won't regret it.
B002LQIP3K|5|Worked. Like. Acharm
B007KPU5BC|5|NICE PERFECT FIT
B000JZSPBM|5|This replacement lift took about 10 minutes to install and the liftgate now easily stays up on its own. It appears to be well made. To replace the lifts, use a smaller screwdriver to slide the clip back at both ends of the old lift. Be sure to have someone hold the liftgate up for you while you swap the first one. After that, one lift held the liftgate up. To mount the new lift, using the screwdriver pull the clip back to allow the door end to go over the ball and push the clip back until it seats and holds the end in place. Grab the black part and twist until the car frame end aligns with the other mount (it will be a bit stiff to rotate). Then again pull the clip back and push the hole over the ball at the door frame end. Push the clip back in place. Repeat for the second lift. The task was easy, and other than holding the leftgate up, didn't require any particular strength or great mechanical skill. Our back lift now functions as it did originally.
B00ECYBSNS|4|I like these for being seen,more than seeing. the mounts were loose where it connects to the light,so I shimmed it with some thick gauge plastic.
B007P6Z88G|5|It will look nice in your truck and easy to install
B001FDB190|5|Great fit save.s gas
B0040CVXYQ|4|If you are like me I would recommend this to anyone who does work on there Toyota, I have used up a few already.
B001EOV492|4|Product works excellent very durable great quality was shipped promptly and all parts was in box including clips thanks guys
B006AU5MW0|5|Exactly what I wanted and fast deliverary!!
B000EQ8GTM|4|We installed them on our Subaru and they work fine.
B00537FAI2|5|I bought this hitch, and had a local shop install it for me, but I can tell you that if you are handy, and have a buddy to help, you can do it your self. The screws and bolts attach perfectly, but there are two bolts that have to be attached through the spare tire compartment. So far, the hitch is showing no rust after 9 months of use.
B005K97RRA|5|Battery was as described and arrived just a few days after ordered.
B007TEIS6I|4|This a good solid fair weather glove. It has good ventilation, and some protection. They do allow good feel for the controls. One bit of strangeness though. I have fairly large hands so I ordered 2XL. I have to squeeze my hands though the cuff, but once in the glove it's a comfortable fit. While the cuff is tight, the fit lets me  know that 3XL would be way too big. Anyway tight cuff or not the gloves work great.
B001AWK5XE|5|The device did not come with sufficient fluid, good thing I had ordered the refill, not knowing if and when I would need it.
B000KL4M6M|5|My stereo receiver has been replaced three times, so I figured it would be smart to get a new harness pigtail for the next deck. This is the exact factory clip on my 92 Cherokee. It was also pre-stripped, and arrived sooner than expected. Works phenomenal!
B002PYBZJO|5|Works great on a 2000 Toyota Echo
B008X02UC0|4|Purchased for my HHR. So far so good, ill update when i get some mileage on them, went with new sway links to. I recommend you do to.
B00318NQFY|1|Advertised wrong - does not fit a Fiat
B0024NT0EI|5|Bought these after-market headlights for my son's Focus. The plastic in the OEM ones was so degraded they just made kind of a glow in front of the car instead of lighting the way. These lights were very easy to install & make night driving like it was when the car was new. Minor complaint; they're not LED Halo lights, they're halogen. Not that that's bad (they work great). I just wish the marketing people wouldn't lie about being LEDs just to get your money.
B003D1QVJ2|5|The best money can buy at protecting your wheels.
B000CIPUR8|1|Did not work on my 1999 VW Golf, check engine light still on after following instructions. Cleared code manually, barely drove car 13 miles and check engine light came on with code P0420.
B000CITK8S|5|This works perfectly to keep my bike battery at full charge when not being ridden.  I definitely recommend this for any one who has a motorcycle.
B005H2L4V0|5|Haven't read the other reviews, but I really like mine.  It cleans the inside of my car fine - for stains and ground-in mud, I use a whisk broom and/or foam cleaner first.  I like the long cord, so that I can reach all parts of my with it plugged in.  Best of all, I like the &#34;reverse switch&#34; because I have a dog booster seat with an inflatable cushion, and I can easily inflate it with this vacuum.  So, for me, it cleans well and it blows air  and it reaches all parts of the car.  What more do I need?
B005G8DDSM|5|How can you not love Smokey?
B0015RWLFE|5|these are really great aftermarket disk rotors at an awesome price!!  Highly recommended for anyone who wants to step up the performance without breaking the bank for brembos!!
B00CL4EHE8|5|Perfect ,looks great on our cars!!
B000VU9D20|5|It is what it claims to be. Nice quality too.
B000EVU89I|5|for the price, you can't go wrong. I've used this countless times as a mechanic and it works every time! Never had issues w/ the hose or fittings like some other people. The thing is you really don't need to tighten the hose more than by just hand-twisting the hose in to tighten. You are only measuring peak pressure, not trying to hold psi over time. The o-ring does it's job for measuring compression more than enough. Some people gave bad reviews because they don't know how to use tools properly.
B000GTYOVG|5|Purchased these turn signals for my Ryca build (conversion fron a 2006 Suzuki ls40 to a cafe racer). These rear turn signals were a nice scale for the finsihed cafe racer and the halogen bulbs made them bright enough, even in day light. (DOT Approved) Had to make small metal brackets for the stems and attached them to the top bolt of the shocks. Opted for the black housing which makes them unobtrusive and well integrated with the color and the current design of the bike. The price is very reasonable making them a great buy!!!!
B005Z8HAUK|5|Its all that the product review said it was, I tried it out on my RV, that is what I wanted it for and it does what it was supose to do. Would recomend it to others.
B004YJTIRO|5|Should have installed 75k miles ago!  Picked the nose of my truck up 2&#34; as promised, and the ride is unequalled!
B001F02NCW|5|This looks just like the picture, gave it as a gift and they loved it.  It fit just right.
B007O1X4AQ|4|As advertized
B001A4EAV0|3|I bought this for a specific job I was doing on a 2002 ford taurus.I was ready to use it when I discovered it didn't fit the over flow tank.I don't have a gm and I still can use the funnel but it was disappointing.
B00AFVT44M|4|What can I say..... it's an oil filter. Seemed to fit OK, no surprises.
B0002KKIVY|5|smoked out and got my go Kart up and running after having some trouble prior to this. Read good reviews about this before I bought it and agree that this is worth the money. Ended up using it on some other small engines that I had just because. I would purchase again in the future.
B00O81BMW2|5|We use this when we travel back and forth to Ohio from Indianapolis... very durable!!!
B00I7EM8GU|2|Did not fit my 2012 Hyundai Tucson.  Replaced with a Wix filter that fit fine.  The two filters appeared very similar, but the wix slid in with no problems.  This filter bent whenever inserted.
B00ATXEPQI|5|Only one issue with this item and that is the cigarette plug tries to open into two seperate pieces when you remove it from the socket.
B005Y1WBXE|5|These helmets are great fo the price.I really like the two visors.I would like to know<br />where to order replacement visors as mine are starting to scratch from all the bugs
B000KL6Y8G|3|I have bought this type before from Cabelas and they were for a F150 and they fit perfect these do not fit well on the passenger side the cut out for the seat bracket that holds the seat on the floor is off by an inch and the corner has to be pushed sideways to fit well. I can live with it but would not buy again.
B00480N0SC|1|Look good when on, however they quit working in less than 3 months
B000JZY7IW|4|These parts were priced right and shipped / arrived very quickly. The installation was a snap (literally), with some help from my son to hold the lift gate up. It was probably less than 5 minutes to complete. The only negative is that these struts have a stronger lift force. The tail gate comes up more quickly, which is not really any issue, but it takes a much more significant force to lower it.<br />For the difference in price we will live with it.
B0002KNVPE|5|Exactly what it describes.  Fit all my 2002 S10 needs.
B00T6KSQNS|5|as described
B002P8CLKC|4|It works.  lol, I installed it myself after watching a how-to on youtube.<br />Mirror works and my wife now can now see cars on the side.<br /><br />yay
B007YWNV2G|2|I thought this would fit and didn't.  I should have researched more the connection/connect first before I bought the product.
B006VENTAM|5|They worked great for the once a year they are used for Hawaii safety inspection on my lifted jeep.
B0052XL24I|5|Replaced 10 yr old o.e.  sensor . Part is a light gray color and the casting is a little rough. However the part installed and is performing fine. Only time will tell if it holds up to the temperature the turbo engine puts it through. It was about half the cost of o.e.part. Standard free shipping took about 7 days.
B005ETO8ZU|5|Fit no issues.
B004C6M5BU|5|Good quality thick leather.  The attachment strap is plenty long for attachment to my Harley V-Rod. I would have liked a quick open strap, but I don't plan to get in very often so this will do nicely.
B00AW82TQS|4|I love these led assemblies. I have many of them in many applications. Have installed them in friends' camping trailers and hunting cabins. Easy to wire, lots of light fora low current draw. Perfect for small solar applications.
B000CJ2URA|5|Perfect replacement for my Discovery 2 thermostat.
B0097S3RRY|5|Nice way to show running achievements.  Can't wait to get my 10k!
B00D8X9FSY|5|[[VIDEOID:mo2R26MVQ82T6KV]]Phusic stands for a fusion of \\"Ph\\"one and M\\"usic\\" and this speaker sure blends the two nicely together.  I want to start with the packaging, this unit was packaged very nicely and comes with a line-in, travel carrying case and a USB to micro charging cord.  The unit is noticeably heavier than expected and weighed-in at 10.1 ounces.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />*Great sound - speaker sounded good with all types of music but sounded best with vocals and acoustic guitar.  Heavy metal, rap and rock n roll were not as good sounding but you can only expect so much from such a small speaker.  I could hear bass notes down to 60 Hz, after that test tones were imperceptible.<br />*Excellent Value<br />*Very small size<br />*Comes with a line-in outlet and cord, not all units have this feature or come with a cord<br />*Can use a speakerphone - integrates nicely with your phone<br />*Controls on the front of the unit - so if you can't find your phone or it isn't nearby you can still control your music<br />*Huge 800 mAh Rechargeable Lithium battery - lights up red when charging, red light turns off when done charging.  Also, Lithium batteries have no memory effect so you can charge this speaker up anywhere, anytime<br />*Once paired with computer - will stay paired even after periods of inactivity, a very nice feature<br />*Very nice rubber feet, really stuck to the surfaces that I put it on<br />*The buttons on the front can be setup to have a really high degree of volume control.  This was a really nice feature because I listened to this speaker at work and could have a large range of control while still staying at a relatively low volume.<br />*Worked with my Mac and Windows 7 and iPhone seamlessly, easy to pair and stay paired<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />*Heavy - 10.1 ounces, this little cube is over half a pound - it is because it has a solid little speaker in there - not for hikers<br />*One time the Bluetooth speaker got scratchy.  I thought it was the music but it wasn't.  I thought I had blown the speaker but I hadn't done that either.  I turned the device off and then on again and this fixed the issue.<br />*Blinking blue light on the side of the unit - this can easily be covered up with electrical tape though.  It seems every device I test that is Bluetooth has this and I don't know why as it can be distracting<br /><br />I found that music sounded best when this device was centered right in front of me.  The crossover nicely protected the speaker from damage - I could hear bass notes down to 60 Hz but after that nothing.  The upward firing speaker filled the room with sound, which ended up sounding surprisingly good for an inexpensive tiny mono speaker.  This unit is ideal for around the home or office or for travel.  I would not hike with it though due to its weight.  If you are going car camping than you will be fine.  This unit would also be ideal for someone who has a car without Bluetooth - as they could use the speaker and speakerphone in one tiny unit.  I liked this product very much and am considering getting more for my niece and nephew.<br /><br />I was provided a sample from the manufacturer for a fair and honest review.s the music but it wasn't.

B00AZJFWJ0|5|I am very happy to say this product exceeded my expectations so far. It provides much improved level of brightness and so far has out performed my past purchases of headlights for use in my vehicle.
B0054NGCW8|1|Lousy...product, don't trust the information on the box, it's not the active matrix TFT, but regular TFT with low resolution, low viewing angle. The monitor case has a hole at the back which is supposed to be a on/off switch installed. But it's missing with a hole right there and the pictures on the web doesn't show this. Otherwise, I wouldn't buy it.   Don't buy it, waste your money.
B0016VIUU4|5|fits great, no slide, easy to clean.
B0084DNIWW|5|Perfect
B000CSNK8O|3|Have been putting this brand on several trucks for the past ten years. This is the only time I had a problem. Had to use knife to cut away extra material around all edges.ALOT OF EXTRA.  But $45 for something that probably less than $10 to make and package, and then I have to trim to look nice sucks. Too much hassle to return. Free shipping is nice, but took longer than suggested to arrive in Hawaii.
B001XRWH9Q|5|I just stepped up to the Corsair V from a Scorpion EXO 1000 and I could not be happier.   The scorpion is a really nice helmet with a lot of nice features. But the Arai has a history of safety and innovation that no other helmet can match in my opinion.   I wear an xxl scorpion and ordered a xxl arai but the salesman suggested I step down a size. He was right. Xl fits perfect.   First thing I noticed is the outside of this helmet is noticeably smaller than the scorp. It's way lighter too. I opened all the vents for my first ride, and just a block later I closed all but the rear and center top vent because the vents work! The scorpion never seemed to vent. I could not feel it anyway. The arai will create a mini hurricane if you want.  The fit and finish is excellent. The paint job is really nice.  Some people have complained about the padding material. I have no problem with it.   I have not changed the visor yet. Some hate the system. I have watched videos and if you follow the instructions it works fine.
B00HXC86TA|5|While Bridgestone's description of this tire says it's more touring oriented, they also say it replaces the 023. I find it to be so close to the 023 that I don't notice a difference. My riding style is more to the sporting end of the spectrum, but I use sport touring  tires to improve mileage. The T30 is an excellent value, providing equal mileage and handling vs Michelin Pilot Road and Metzler MEZ8 at a lower price.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|I have not had the need to use it yet. After receiving it, I checked to make sure all of the cables were included and plugged it in to give the device a full charge. Everything seems to be working fine so far.<br /><br />One of my cars doesn't get driven very much and often has a low (not totally dead) battery. I would always need to jump start it from another car. I'm hoping this &#34;Micro-Start&#34; will allow me to jump start the low battery in a much shorter amount of time. I like the fact that it is much more compact than a Lead Acid battery jump pack that I owned several years ago. Not only did I buy this &#34;Micro-Start&#34; for car batteries, but it should work with lawn mower batteries and cell phone batteries as well.<br /><br />Costly? Yes, but since it has multiple uses I'm betting that it's worth it's price.  I can only hope that it doesn't disappoint me when I need it the most.

B008LP8SLE|5|The sticker is of high quality, but be warned, the &#34;Left&#34; probably will take offence!  I had it on my tailgate for about a week and some clod actually tried to force me off the road!  I value myself and my truck highly, so I removed it,

B008Z3VRWO|2|Poorly designed as it does not reach the bottom of the trunk area. Doesn't stop thin items from sliding forward.
B000MG40QW|3|To be honest I don't think they are a big deal. I had big expectations on these lights but after I put them on there was no major difference. although it was little bit brighter than the one I used to have on my car, the original standard make. You would expect that for twice the money you'll have at least twice the light.
B00FPNLDLW|5|THIS IS GREAT FOR MY TRUCK DRIVER HUSBAND.  IT HELPS HIM  WITH HIS LEGS, BACK AND BUTT DISCOMFORT HE WAS HAVING BEFORE USING THIS SEAT COVER.
B000C9Y0NC|5|Good air filter great prices
B0078U9ZM4|5|Excellent item. All parts included and fit well according to the installer. Packaging was very good with no damage despite the overall weight. Will be shipped in two cartons. With several thousand miles all seems good. Have noted a small increase in mpg as a bonus. Would reccomend.
B0002SR8AK|3|Hard to use in limited space. You have to flip it over to change direction of adjustment. But it does work.
B002S84QX4|4|It was bit difficult to put it on.  There is no instruction on how to tie them so I hope I did it correctly.
B0034ZUZM6|5|best value and price found anywhere. install, fairly uncomplicated.all parts complete, instructions easy to sipher.would buy product again.wish it came with a cover.
B004BWU8H8|5|Ordered product to secure items when the doors are off. Product was here in less than a week and came in mint condition. All that was needed for install was a 18mm socket and some elbow grease. Total install time was around 15mins. Very pleased with the item and it adds an invaluable after market feature for my jeep.

B00B7LO5AW|5|Fit perfect!!  Son very happy for his car
B000GTLYKK|1|The regulator on this tool is just about the cheapest POS I have ever encountered . . .even considering the quality of other things made in China.  The fittings leak, and all test results are rendered unreliable due to the generally poor quality of this tool.  Save your money and buy something made in the USA by a quality tool company.

B001T9AREK|5|Prefect only way to tell all of you people out there works great.....
B000SL4AA2|4|Ordered our first, and later ordered one to have in the back of each car.  Good deal, and definitely important the moment you find yourself on the side of the road
B000GS316G|5|Perfect fit and perform exactly as expected.
B000CMEQH4|3|I had a Carbon Fiber License plate holder that got over tightened and cracked so I was looking for the same one to replace it.  In the picture this one is what I had before, but when it came it is actually metal with carbon fiber inlay, so it is not really the holder they are showing in the picture.  It was also a little larger than my old one so it doesn't quite fit as nice in the spot around my plate, I do think this one will be more durable and it doesn't look bad, it just wasn't really what I was expecting and didn't quite fit as well as my old one did.
B000CIK7Y4|5|Had it installed and it sounds an looks great,  Packaging was great and items were well protected.
B002XA0ZJQ|5|Got this as a gift for my grandma, and she loves it! She said it was perfect for her car, and that is very sticky.

B0014EXJVS|5|I was looking for a boost gauge (along with some others) for my car and didn't want my car to be filled with gauges and be all \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" looking.  Dashhawk was perfect for the job.  I can monitor everything without having 10+ gauges.  Just one device that will do everything and no wiring.  Just plug it into your OBDII and go.    To the guy that's complaining about it not being compatible with his car... you should have done your research first before you make the purchase and then complain about it because you didn't do your research.  Everything is available at Dashhawk website.      P.S. The firmware was out of date on my unit.  Make sure you download the latest firmware from Dashhawk website and update.
B004A8TSSS|5|very nice
B005IRN8U4|5|Exactly fit
B006B2XD4G|5|Needs a fuel injection computer to run, but my C90T fuel mileage went up to 54 mpg without the computer, but it runs lean and backfires. Overall a very excellent set of pipes, very throaty idle and light throttle, wide open very loud and sharp sound, many other pipes are louder. EXCELLENT
B000GV95G8|4|These are very heavy, solid, and good quality pegs.  My only gripe is the cost.  I bought 'em because I really didn't have too many other options (short legs) and am completely happy, but really feel like a $100+ price is ridiculous.
B0021USOM8|5|Pleased
B001GH1PU0|4|nice quality!
B002N4PYY8|3|The wiper works well altho it steaks one hairline streak across my window. It may just need to get wiped off, not sure yet. the wipers work well and are quiet. The package however - came in all broken up. thankfully the blade was small enough where as it did not damage the product.
B004MQAYYU|3|I am not understanding what the Certification entails on this. I noticed the adjuster points on the lenses differed from left to right between left and right (different heights). Stock are usually ground to a specific height so the SAE aim adjuster can be used (Hopkins). The marker bulbs had to be shimmed snug (I used folded over zip lock bags with a hole punched in them) in order to fit the housing hole without rattling. One side, the lens was crazed  where the two halves were joined.<br /><br />I dunno, priced better or not, when something states New AND OEM replacement, I just don't feel that the words &#34;Kind Of&#34; should be something you get to feeling was left out of the item description.......<br /><br />I now wonder what significance a &#34;CAPA Certified&#34; tag really provides you.  Oh well it puts light on the ground (blobs). I wish someone made a good EU certified assembly for this application. The beam pattern would be so much better.....
B00EDWJXEU|5|Fit perfectly and lay flat, a good quality product. They trap dirt and sand and should last for years. I am completely satisfied with this purchase.
B003NAU3XI|1|What I received was nothing like this photo.  This looks kind of H shaped but what I received I think may be for a middle row which my cargo van does not have.  I'll probably try to cut it to the shape of the driver's side to salvage something out of it.
B000C7Y8RC|5|exact replacement for the OEM part. works and looks just like the original switch at more than half of the cost.
B00JE4GWI2|5|Works great.  If you can't get AM stations with this try switching the antenna connectors around.  That worked for me.
B0009MZI4M|3|This plastic tank repair kit is great. Worked well for my application. I have a split in my tank due to the weight of the tank being put on the strap, so I sealed it with this. Seems to be holding...
B005JU5VH8|5|I've never thought much about windshield wiper blades. I buy new ones when they start to peel away from the wiper holder and usually have them installed when I get an oil change or at the auto parts store. I've never in my life even attempted to change the blades myself - until now.<br /><br />I began by looking up how to replace the windshield wiper blades for my car in the manufacturer's manual. I have a 2005 Chevrolet Impala and Chevy made it seem pretty easy in the manual. Unfortunately, when it came down to actually performing this task, the manual's instructions left a lot to be desired. It just wasn't clear to me which way to pull the blades to remove them. Chevy said to pull them towards the windshield, but that apparently means a different direction to them than it does to me. I finally figured it out after watching a video on YouTube after searching the internet for how to remove the blades.<br /><br />The instructions on the Bosch package were also a little ambiguous for me. It wasn't clear to me at first that there is a latch that has to pop up on the Bosch blade before you slide the shepherd's hook on the wiper through the blade. I will confess without shame that it took me nearly an hour to figure that out. In my defense, this was the first time and the old blades didn't have such a latch so it didn't even occur to me that the Bosch model would. Once I figured the latch out, the rest was easy.<br /><br />I actually really like the latch - the blades seem even more secure to me than the old ones I had. While I've never personally had a blade fly off the car while driving, I have heard of it happening and it never hurts to be a bit more secure. The last thing you'd want is to lose a wiper blade in a thunderstorm.<br /><br />When I got my oil changed in early December 2010, I had them change my wiper blades with some very inexpensive ones. They worked well enough. I replaced those cheap blades with these Bosch blades just two months later at the end of January 2011. Since the old blades were practically new, I was able to get a good feel of the difference between those and the Bosch 22A ICON Wiper Blade. I have to say, as someone who never paid any attention to wiper blades unless there was a problem, I do believe I can see the improvement. The old blades streaked just a bit - not enough to interfere with visibility, but it was there. The Bosch blades wipe the windshield very well, leaving a very clear view of the road without streaks.<br /><br />I ordered both the Bosch 22A ICON Wiper Blade, which I've reviewed here, and the [[ASIN:B005JU5YCU Bosch 22B ICON Wiper Blade, 22\\" (Pack of 1)]]. I studied the product descriptions for both models carefully and also examined the two blades side by side when I received them and I honestly can't tell a difference in the 22A and 22B models. If there is one, it totally escapes me. They seem to be interchangeable and can be used on either the right or the left side of the car. Although some cars have use wipers of different lengths on each side, my Impala uses 22-inch blades on each side.<br /><br />The manufacturer claims that these blades will last approximately 40% longer than other blades, and while only time will prove whether this is true or not, having looked at the Bosch blades next to my old blades, I can believe it might be true.<br /><br />I would say that if you are looking for a better wiper blade, then the Bosch  22A ICONS Wiper Blade is a good choice.nuary 2011.

B0068FYELM|1|they are a nice tire but add say 4 ply they are only 2 ply i will keep tires anyway but they are not as advertised hope they hold up good they where shipped fast
B00JUUNGR0|4|The product was exactly what was from order. Made by HJC with all the quality of material and parts that would be expected for the higher end HJC models like RPS/RPHA 10. Got a replacement for one that broke from dropping helmet (RPHA 10) and although the shipping took abnormally longer than I would have thought, it fit perfect and now the shield operates good ass new. Install was a piece of cake and recommend this product if you need a replacement shield base plate.

B00067Q1RS|5|I've found that most magic potions aren't.  But, this stuff really works exactly as advertised.<br />We had pine pitch seemingly by the gallon on one of our (white) cars, and after a few hours of work and a good car wash, it's totally gone.. Some of it had hardened over a period of 4 weeks, so it wasn't easy.<br />Great stuff, but a bit pricey.
B003NTPE9W|4|Worked better than I expected to spray rockers through holes previously drilled to mount side pipes in my classic Trans Am. Eastwood products are always high priced but some, especially their private label items such as paints, are worth the price.
B0045JYUY4|5|This is a perfect fit for a 2005 honda Odyssey. Installing the was very easy. I did have a cracked bracket which the seller quickly replaced.
B001GJ3E2K|4|Nice brush and works well for cleaning the wheels on the car. Hope to have many years of service from this product

B003REP8PI|5|I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend and I'm pretty jealous. They are a nice way to support the team. I might buy another set for my dad too. Oh, one review says that she received one, but mine came as a set.
B002JXGC2G|5|This filter works well on my Buell Blast. You have to buy the oil for the filter separately. This filter looks good too.
B004UM6DLE|5|I bought this to get rid of the rusty specs in my paint.  I was using a angle grinder next to my truck for a couple weeks.  Bad idea.  I noticed that I had a bunch of tiny rust specs stuck in my paint.  I tried to wax them out clay them out wd40 them out and nothing worked.  I found this on amazon and decided to give it a try.  I sprayed it on and watches the rust melt away.  It was incredible.  It did not harm the paint at all.

B0007WTE08|2|The handle is too short. There is no way to get a mechanical advantage and effectively roll the dynamat on to the surface of the sheet metal. The density of the dynamat material is more then what this little roller and little handle can handle. There is nothing heavy duty about this tool. It is a weak tool and ineffective in installing dynamat. There is no way you can produce enough pressure to smooth out the dynamat over an uneven surface.  You would be better off going to the hardware store and pick up a roller used to install Formica.
B00HG2UEBA|5|Looks and functions as advertised.Seems sturdy but hopefully I will not experience how effective a &#34;crash&#34; barrier it can be.
B008HZKBH2|5|I installed these rear (and front) pads on my 2007 Passat.  They are an exact fit and they provide outstanding stopping power...better than OEM.  Some may not like the initial &#34;bite&#34; of a semi-metallic brake pad, but I think this is how they should feel.  The original pads are semi-metallic.  These pads have a good bite and they will stop you very quickly and smoothly using only moderate pedal pressure.  I don't know much about the brake dust these will produce, but I am really not concerned due to how well they stop the car.  All brake pads produce dust, and I would rather not trade better performance for less dust.  I was concerned about the lack of reviews for these pads, but I can highly recommend them!  If you want pads that will stop you quickly and confidently, you will like these pads.

B005GK23SQ|3|I received my dolly last week and finally had the opportunity to assemble it today. Delivery was fine even though the delivery person was not thrilled about carrying this 70lb box from his truck. Assembly took about an hour only because there are a lot of nuts, bolts, and washers to work with. Everything came complete, so I was pleased that every nut and bolt was in the packaging. This is a very sturdy piece of equipment and can easily support a Harley Ultra Classic. However, remember that the Ultra is still an 800+ pound bike. The ad would make you think that, once you roll your hog onto the dolly, you can push it around with your pinky. Not so. It still takes some heavy pushing to move it around the garage, even with a smooth cement floor. Also, the support lifts are too smooth. Once you engage the lift so that the wheels are off the ground, there needs to be a piece of rubber placed under the lift so that it does not slide.<br /><br />Pros: Heavy duty construction, easy assembly, easy operation<br />Cons: Wheels do not turn easily when supporting a touring bike.<br /><br />I sense that I will need to replace the wheels with something more heavy duty. For a lighter bike, however, this dolly is a no-brainer.
B002R0YMXC|5|Perfect fit to my camry!
B00FFXDTEQ|3|I'm unsure about this light bar. It looks like it is good quality, and rated an IP68. I tried to open up the light so I could silicone it all up before installing as many have complained of condensation, but I couldn't even get it tore apart because there was a bunch of sealant already. The problem I'm having is that the LED's look really small compared to other light bars I've seen, and I can not find any LED chips online that match these. Also the light bar pictured had the wire coming out of the center, mine comes out of one of the end caps. I will be installing this light bar in the next couple days so I will update later with how that went.
B00I2CK3RS|5|Super bright.
B0071HE2SQ|5|Good unit and the price is right.  Tested it out before install on the helmets which should go easily.  Would I buy it again, absolutely.  Note this is the initial observation, and not a long riding experience, but I'm positive with this buy.  I bought this bluetooth for less than I could purchase the Gold Wing plug and play, and of course dealing with all the wires is a hassle.
B000FGJOTW|5|Exactly what I needed
B007TKJMB2|3|Not white like image and material same as others with same price. Freezes to rv roof in alaska so dont plan on using rv in winter without damaging cover.
B000OAX7WE|5|Got caught in a giant ice storm going up a hill.  Everyone else even some 4WD vehicles were sliding backwards down the highway.  Pulled over, put these on my little FWD car, and putt-putted straight up the hill safely.  Will they last forever?  Probably not.  Are they a good emergency item and a good value?  Absolutely.<br /><br />ed: Lost one after driving about 45 on clear pavement looking for a place to take them off.  I figure I've used them about 100 miles 75% on snow before one broke.  That's pretty good.
B005C1C956|5|I had ordered this Raccoon Tail for an event and it surprisingly came in very fast to me! I ordered it on the night of October 1st and it came to me on October 4th! I had gotten it in a cardboard envelope. My Raccoon Tail is about 12 inches and a lighter color brown than the one shown. The chain is fairly thick so you don't need to worry about it ripping off. All in all, I find this to be a great product, you may take your chances though since it is a REAL Raccoon Tail and anything can happen.

B007LIB94K|5|I love this took awhile to get it on my steering wheel. Put it in the dyer for a bit to warm it up and went on fine.
B000E3AP5I|1|I guess I should have listened to the majority of the reviews but my daughter wanted them so badly.  HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!  Tore within a month of using.  Not entirely sure if it is because they do not fasten very tightly or that the product is just cheaply made.  VERY DISAPPOINTED  I don't want to even give them 1 star but apparently I have to.
B003UT090Y|5|Good stuff, German car shampoo, nourishes the finish as it cleans. Does a good job. Worth looking for.
B00E0OSDPQ|5|Finally, a good solid can that holds gas.  Sounds simple but if you've ordered some of the other jerry cans you'll know what I mean.
B00192KZIA|2|This product was a good buy looks great and fits nice but only after not even one summer of use it already has two cracks in it from the sun little dissapointing
B00XE2BHXK|1|Bad quality, glue is not strong enough.
B00JBIAFJ8|5|Quick delivery.  Direct Bolt-in fit.  Nice look.  Huge difference in visibility at night.  Installed on my RV.
B0043X48VC|1|Pretty much useless...will not work over Rx eyeglasses unless you have the tiniest pair ever.  Avoid these and find another pair elsewhere
B0009H51WQ|5|Great savings.......same part as from dealer, only cheaper.
B001FGGU1G|5|Product worked perfectly.  I did have a few issues getting the shim into place, but that isn't the starters fault.  I recommend starting the bolt from the engine side and placing the shim on the edge of the bolts.  Then lift the starter in place and screw in the bolts.  Starter does have a higher pitch starting sound.
B00528WCTC|4|Good color. But it has these strange black triangles on each corner that kind of bug me.  Would not be an issue if covered up by a thin frame though.  The plate metal could stand to be just a little thicker too.
B00DTBTBWK|4|Good product. Only thing that could be better is the adhesive on the heat pads. It seemed to stick better to the wax paper backing than it did to the heater pad.<br /><br />Otherwise, fast shipping and good product.
B0022XSDVQ|5|boughtt this  chrome lower chain guard to replace plactic one looks so much better. to install you have to remove back tire. Guard fits like a glove.
B000CSKKX2|5|i think that this is a cheaper deal. i change the plugs every year seems to work fine in the small engines
B00HPEXB7S|5|Love my owl family stickers!
B000EQS2IC|1|This showed as a replacement for ACDelco C3914 but it is larger and will not fit the housing.
B001AIZ5HY|3|Improves your headlight but no where near new.  Also your going to have to continually maintain your headlights or your lights will go back to the way it looked.
B00J0FC19Y|5|Good value. OEM part that fits perfectly.
B003YV1NJE|5|Great selection!  It was exactly what I needed and it fit perfectly.  Plus the price was great!!
B003YMRO3W|5|The price is excellent and I have no complaints. They do what they are made to do, stop the car
B0031HMS7C|5|Repair for 2000 toyota 4runner 6 cylinder.  Perfect fit delivered on time. Save big $$$$ with DIY utube videos on removing starter and replace of copper contacts and plunger.
B007AOQORC|5|Excellent. It worth every dime.
B00GX4Y9AY|1|Bought this charger in oct 2014. Used it once right after I bought it and it worked great. Kept in the car charging once every 3 to six months and never had to use it. it was in my mind an insurance policey. Yesterday 5/22/2016 I needed it to start a lawn mower . It was dead so I plugged it in in the house. Lights blinked and all looked well.. At 2 am woke to a house full of smoke and the detectors going off and the charger had fryed it self and started burning the window sill i had set it on. It is a fire hazard. and should be removed from the market place. Im not a dont know nothing kind of person and no way am I taking any blame for doing something wrong. BAD MADE PRODUCT.
B000S2KN02|1|Be careful about this listed product sold direct from Amazon. I bought a similar one last week. It failed to work properly..I question it's origin. It arrived and was per cheap junk work..not typical Cardone quality. I believe some supplier is ripping off Amazon folks thinking they are getting real Cardone remanufacture.<br /><br />I cannot get a return-refund because I discarded the original box. What a rip-off!<br /><br />Check for the genuine remanufactured Cardone 42-309 right off the Cardone website. I bought the real one (remember the Cardone link picture) from another auto part vendor (Summit.
B00T7CE0YY|5|nice and looks good
B00K8EX1Z4|5|Exact duplicate of original equipment.  Fast delivery, too.
B000C5YCYS|5|Installed this in about 1/2 hour.  Took my check engine light/VSC Trac lights away.
B0009OMYC4|5|Good Quality.
B000S34NG6|4|this atp te-6, work good for two weeks  now I got to return it  pay for shiping and get partial refund.this is the last time I buy from amazon.,
B004HJAS7K|5|This steering wheel cover is wonderful! It fits great, looks great, is comfortable to grip, nice for our extreme weather in WI.
B0002MBHPS|4|Description didn't specify, but these are 18.5&#34; wide x 24&#34; high. Looks good so far, have not mounted them yet. They're are as good a quality HD mud flap as is available for my lifted 2500 HD 4x4. Making a removable mount so that rocks and stones will be blocked from hitting my boat. Nice cheap price too.
B009ES3F0Q|5|Installed these on my fj cruiser front bumper and they are great. Just remember led are flood so they don't have a very long range but great to ligth all the area around you.
B005Y2129M|5|Lightening speed delivery from this seller, as listed, NEW - bike was up and running 3rd day after ordering (7-7-14)  - running great!
B007UTPUDQ|1|Very expensive hitch, I looked at it as an investment, it being Aluminum, I figured it would last as long as I would ever need it. There is no doubt, it won't.<br /><br />I know there are many different grades of aluminum, this one certainly has to be one of the lowest. My issues started day one, when putting the ball assembly together as instructed, the tightening force needed to secure the balls to the hitch warped the aluminum. At that point, I reached out to the company that made it, asking if this was normal, ZERO reply.<br /><br />Next, I utilized the hitch on a trip I bought it for. After roughly 500 miles, the metal on the hitch has worn and deformed to the point I don't see the longevity in this hitch at all. The trailer I was towing was less then 1500lbs (keep in mind there is a 10K rating on this hitch) and to have this type of wear/damage after 500 miles really makes me wonder how it will look with a larger load for a longer period of time, I'm not even sure I would trust the strength to try and even use it for something heavier.<br /><br />I'm truly disappointed in this product, and I hope this helps others from being disappointed in their next hitch purchase.
B00ITA9BDU|3|Dinner than I expected them to be.
B000C55SZK|5|Keeping your car at the right height is what you want,  then install these babies on your car. I can adjust the height and ride with the air fittings that come with the shocks soft or hard,  high or low. Have fun with these Max- air shocks
B00BHD6HK6|5|Thank you
B00JMXGCF8|5|Really did the job
B000C846NW|1|I tried this locking gas cap on my 07 Chevy Colorado and it set an engine right away....same code as if the gas cap would have been left off.  The treading of the cap looks quite different than the stock cap and it does not appear to get a good connection of the filler neck.  I've used Stant locking caps on other vehicles with no problems, but this one is not worth buying for a Chevy truck.
B001GJ3DZS|4|Works!
B00AWE0GKI|5|Great Product, Fast Shipping, Easy to assemble
B00IY4JBF4|1|Goes out of gas very quickly and the czech tool came off after the first week while cleaning the pipe, dont waist your money
B000XEGEWG|5|These are great microfiber cloths for the price-- a good size, too.  I use them all over the house, it's amazing what a difference that microfiber makes!  They clean up so much faster.  I've even gotten rid of my stainless steel cleaner, because wiping down my fridge with a wet microfiber, and then a dry microfiber does a better job than any of the stainless wipes out there.  I use them dry on my eyeglasses, too, and they're wonderful for that.  The only thing to watch out for, is that they really need to be washed separate from other rags-- the lint and fibers were attracted to the microfiber.  They didn't work as well.  Also, don't use fabric softener with them.  My husband did that and they are ruined for anything other than regular rags!  But I loved them so much that I'm ordering another set, and now we know how to take care of them.
B00BJHS6RM|5|Was looking for a growler that I could transport for 2+ hours and keep the contents cold. Purchased two and very pleased with the results. I haven't taken before and after temperatures like some reviewers but they remained cold for the 2.5 hr trip. Would recommend this product.
B000E0Q7G2|5|It would be nice if KYB made a complete kit for Vibes and Matrix.  Putting these parts together was expensive.  One part did have a manufactures defect and Amazon was great about handling the return.  Overall great product.
B00JEUI0OU|5|These fit my jeep perfectly. They look nice and are very durable. Perfect for any weather and debris that might fall on these mats and they are easy to clean. I would recommend!
B000FFF3GG|5|Excellent quality.  Thanks
B004J2V0ZO|1|bad luck, bought 3 , no one last more than 3 weeks
B00DMWJJ6O|3|well boot is very good quality but its not comphortable like other shoes... think about it carefully before buying.. also i wear 45 so i bought 46 and it comes to me very very big... buy the number which you wear 45=45 46=46
B000UVCK9S|5|Nice lights easy to install work great. Can be used steady or blinking or to follow the beat of the music. Nice item. Everything you need for the installation is included in the box.
B00G1Y4QE0|1|Wasn't happy with the color it says red but it's more like a maroon not a typical red
B0027V2VJS|5|Bolted straight to my Momo Steering wheel hub. And to my &#34;Made in Italy&#34; Wheel. Already have 2 friends wanting to buy one.<br /><br />Think of it this way. It makes for good Antitheft. And you can keep your steering wheel warm for those cold winter days.
B002P2TWNM|4|I bought this extended jack foot because the stock jack that came with my trailer did not have enough travel to raise the tongue high enough.  Also the jack foot that came with the trailer was no higher than 2\\" at best, which was pretty much useless.  I actually over extended the jack to raise the tongue off of the ball to disconnect the trailer and damaged the jack.  After getting a replacement jack, it was decided to purchase an item such as this one to lengthen the jacks height limit.  After using this extended jack foot, I have never had this issue again.  The only downside is that it has to be removed before traveling and then re-installed when needed for use.  If this unit is left on for any length time, it will fill up with water.  The manufacture should have put a 1/4\\" to 3/8\\" drain hole in the bottom to allow it to drain.  I drilled one into mine.  I liked the carter pin with the built-in snap ring lock though.
B0063MI7KE|2|Not as advertised
B00KJGCEXG|5|I cut it on Home Depot for free and programmed it my self ,Love it
B00TEICVHY|4|I guess Toyota has multiple sizes for switch blanks because this is small for those in my 2005 4Runner.  I used a small set screw and its fine. Nice unit.
B000CRDLZM|5|This works great.  It's very simple to use and eliminates the subjective element from the &#34;twist the belt 90 degrees&#34; method.  I find my measurements aren't consistent, probably due to my technique, but the average of three measurements is consistent enough.
B001XM8MBS|4|So far so good. Two pockets for the mirrors when the car only had one.  Hopefully this will hold up
B0040N3PGO|5|Soft smooth ribbon type lanyard, so it doesn't cut or hurt around my neck, like most lanyards do, and it's perfect for me, because I'm always losing keys, this one is long enough to hang around my neck if I choose to, or just sits in my purse, it has reflective flowers on it so when I am searching for my keys, it is easy to find.
B000C14UP8|4|One of the bags were open but all the parts were there.
B00KCDQBQM|3|The hubcaps are a good replacement and seem of good quality for the price. However, when i received my package in the mail i opened it up to find they had only shipped me 3 hubcaps?!
B003NVFGY8|5|Big difference in quality compared to others. Worth the money.
B00993FU7M|5|This starter works great on the 32cu.in. military engines with minor fitting. Also has has a built in solenoid which saves wiring.
B000M5Y72A|5|I drive on an unlit, windy road at night and these bulbs have made a huge difference from the original bulbs. I have a 1999 Ford Ranger and this has created such a positive experience in my night driving. I can see so much farther down and to the sides of the road, I can relax while I navigate the curves at high speed. Worth every penny!
B000UNRJ5Q|4|Great product
B007HRHM9G|5|the parts loook great!!! look good on my car!! they are more black then grey and blend well with my black wheels.
B00DFUOIIC|5|good
B004A2GOK4|4|No issues as a direct replacement for a 2011 Ford F-250 Diesel.
B001GEYQUY|3|Covers came but there were no instructions in box and it seemed to be missing tie straps.  They fix but not right w/o straps.
B0047DDB70|5|Sits much higher than stock.  But, since i frequently have an overloaded trunk, its ok.  Comes with all hardware needed for installation, which is a big plus. Would recommend to someone looking to go from sagging to perky.
B0002MBBIQ|4|Installed these tie-down Bully Clamps on my 2001 Dodge Dakota about one month ago.<br /><br />Easy, straight forward install. Just need a socket wrench.<br /><br />Multiple holes, of differing sizes, allow for easy attachment of ropes and hooks.<br /><br />Will upgrade to 5-stars if they still work in a couple of years.
B004043LJY|5|It fits good and works like an OE headlight lens plus it has the main headlight bulb already installed easy to put in.
B001KPELKY|5|Works awesome! Color is a perfect match. Drys fast. I havent used the clear coat. But so far so awesome!
B00IEJSU74|5|great
B002QS0JFA|5|Perfect thank u
B00GH88YZM|5|the best ice scraper I ever owned or used.  Great product!
B00KAJAZYM|5|Excellent magnet!
B0009IK5US|5|2 weeks of sleet, snow, and rain into the pair and they're doing their job as promised.  So far, an excellent product for an excellent price.
B00JIHC36K|5|Very bright in color even in day time, I replaced both side at the same time for my park light.
B0002SRFOE|5|I used a modified tap handle with a socket welded to it for many years.  A friend at work had these, and I thought it was a pretty good idea.  I like um!
B000EQB784|5|This fuel filter is working good.
B0009IQWZU|5|Works fine and fit my xl7 perfectly.<br /><br />13 more words are required for a review so I added this useless sentence to suffice.
B00CPGQ1GO|4|Kickstand as expected, no issues.
B000NNGNL4|5|good product good price
B00LMRES30|5|Awesome
B001JQRZS4|3|ok
B002NXNWLG|5|Love it!!! Looks so cute on the back of my Trailblazer!!  Can't wait to buy a few more items!!! Highly recommend !!
B004ZJZ0BG|4|working well under another pair of gloves. they are a little bulky with the battery packs but they are working.
B001J8S2IE|5|LOVE them!! They especially were a life (and carpet) saver this past winter! Terrific purchase!
B0049IKSJM|5|Looks great.  Well built and with the monorack (bars) fit my 2001 Suzuki GS500E perfectly. Great product for the price.
B007NJXQ0W|5|The headers were recommended by an online auto supply, but turned out to be for off-road use only. I ended up getting the short headers and am pleased with them.
B000J38SEI|5|Worked good
B00DX89CRI|5|I've bought a total of three of these pants.    They are expensive, but they are well made, hold up to weekly use, and look great. They have even \\"passed\\" in my Business Casual work environment so long as I iron them.    On \\"cool\\" mornings (~40F) they are able to keep my legs warm on rides that last over an hour. Arizona \\"Summer Heat\\" is as expected - Everything is HOT!    Buy these. You'll love them. Just be careful who you buy them from on Amazon. One retailer wanted almost $60USD More for the same pants!    Update (1/1/2015):  So about two months ago I high sided while wearing these pants. I was only going about 30mph, and yes it was most defiantly my fault. :(    Everyone wants to know how these things will work. Well, now I can tell you! The outside fabric took a beating, as you'd expect. However, nothing got past the Kevlar. Not even one grain in sand!     Only injury was a friction burn on my knee -- which you can't avoid unless you happen to ride with knee guards/pads.   I'd place the burn around a level 2 burn.     Despite my injury, I've bought more. I'm a firm believer in this product.
B00BI79FYG|5|on time , amazing product , and great technical support !
B00029K630|5|Exactly what you expect, gives your car a more finished look instead of raw metal corners, looks nice and classy, a good purchase.
B000BYB5A4|5|Perfect OEM fit for my 2000 VOLVO 80. Would recommend to anyone changing the plugs, original Volvo plugs have four points on them. USE THIS PLUG!
B00FKESOMW|1|The valve caps do not appear to be anodized.  A gloss clear coat may have been sprayed on as there are nicks and dimples all have an uniform gloss coat.  They look better in the photos.  My rims have threaded valve stems about 1\\" long, one good thing about the caps is that they cover more of the valve than another set I bought.  Would have rated higher if the finish was better because a satin anodized finish would match my rims nicely.
B000WPUG8E|5|just what i needed for the summer road trip on the motorcycle, big enough to hold all that is neede
B003XFTUHI|5|This plate looks awesome on my 14' Mustang. Only issue is that buyers, please ensure your state is ok with only one license plate (rear). In my case, i purchased it, but in Texas it is mandatory to have 2 state issued plates. I really dont feel like taking this off  my Stang as it looks ultra awesome, really hesitant to use it as a collectable. Very Fast shipping and an official licensed Ford product manufactured in the USA. It isn't made of the strongest material, but is metallic and glossy. Far better than other plates. Looks classy on my Pony. LOVING IT !<br />Highly Recommended.
B005F9IS82|2|Quick delivery and perfect fit, but twice as loud as the original blower motor that was already starting to go bad.  Had to return it.
B000JZUUME|5|My lift arrived \\"stuck\\" in the open position. I noticed reviews from other customers who had the same \\"problem\\". I put problem in quotes because it turns out to not be a problem. I went ahead and installed the lift (I had to force the liftgate open a bit with one hand so I could place the lift on the upper bracket). After I tightened the lift onto the bracket, I pulled down gently on the liftgate, and the \\"stuck\\" lift broke loose and has functioned perfectly since. Maybe it comes from the factory sealed open lightly? I don't know but it works!
B007VR8PA2|4|I have done decades of automotive work, and used the typical 12 volt tester for most of that time. This tester is better as it provides a way to hold the wire for piercing. The problem is that the wire still can move out of the way of the point. If the wire holder was redesigned as more of a trough than a V shape, it might work even better. I like this tool better than my other testers, but find it less than perfect.
B001P11SF4|5|A valuable PLUS for my vehicle. Very easy to install, and works as promised. If your are looking for a great controller, this is the one!
B008E7RYAU|5|Very good
B007PYC5MK|5|Just the right weight, good enough venting for SoCal, best looking non-leather jacket I've found.  Really nice armor!
B008ZDYLC2|4|The scanner connected easily to my 99 Silverado.  I had to manually go through the menus to pick my vehicle since it is older than 2000.  It found the error code for the ABS system plus an intermittent code for an O2 censor that I had no idea was starting to go bad.  Very easy to use and the Code Lookup is extremely easy.  For an older back yard mechanic, it sure is great.
B004HMISEM|5|MY TRUCK SITS ABOUT 10MONTHS IN A GARAGE. EVEN THOUGH I START IT UP EVERY FEW WEEKS AND I LIVE IN 70+ DEGREE WEATHER YEAR ROUND, LATELY DURING HEAVY ACCELERATION MY TRUCK WOULD COMPLETELY CUT OUT WITH A BIG THUMP/JOLT. I CHANGED FILTERS, PUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLEANERS, ADDITIVES BUT NO IMPROVEMENT.<br />I EVEN ENDED UP  BUYING A SEPARATE FUEL LIFT PUMP.  ANOTHER TWO MONTHS GO BY AND I CAME ACROSS THIS RED BOTTLE. DUMPED ABOUT 3/4 IN TO THE TANK AND 200MILES LATER, TRUCK RAN BETTER THAN NEW.
B005GYA6CW|5|So far, the brake pads work very well. The problem with other pads I 've used is that the glue holding the pad to the backing plate lets go and the pad falls off.  This does take years to happen so time will tell with these pads.
B000HPS4C4|3|Note that this product does not come with the \\"stem puller\\"you need to put in R-14.I really cant understand this,Its not a common shop tool you would have \\"on hand\\"like a tire pressure gauge,and it's cheap 3-4 dollars.Its just a major inconvienience to realize this when you start & cant get the refrigerant in.After all,it's a RETROFIT,one can only assume that means you have the old hardware and must uninstall it.Rather overpriced,but everything and more(or less)comes as described.
B00480GZ9I|1|I'm trying them one more time then THAT'S IT . We bought these last July now 13 months later one burnt out?  They put out great light at night but having a life of only a year is pathetic, maybe I got a bad one? because only one burnt out and no it was not from touching the bulb ( when I install ANY auto light I do it with a fresh pair of clean gloves on my hands to prevent skin oil transfer )<br /><br />I will try them one more time and then move on to a different bulb if they burn out in such a short time again.
B001G7JC2S|2|Only high fan/blower setting worked... Took all of 20 minutes. Took out floor mat used to kneel on... Pulled panel under the glove box off... Pulled carpet back out of the way STUBBY Philips head screw driver... Undo (2) Phillips head screws... Unplug the old one install new one then plug in.... Fan works on all speeds now.  2000 Camry 2.4 Le
B003Y8GPKY|4|Haven't used it yet but it looks to be of very good quality
B0000DYVN9|4|Wish the material felt better (feels like those $5 throws you can buy anywhere) but good product overall, works how it should and pretty darn good price!
B0035U7LRM|5|My 30 year old Suzuki GS1000 needed the charging system repaired, so I bought this in conjunction with a new stator. The Compufire was a relatively easy replacement, as it is somewhat larger than the stock unit. The wiring is huge. I made a mounting bracket under the battery box and it fits OK. The bike now puts out over 14V at road speed, as well as around 13V at idle. I have accessory wiring on the bike that includes extra gauges, a 55/60W halogen headlight, and in the winter heated gloves. The charging system has no problem keeping up.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone needing a replacement regulator/rectifier.<br /><br />Updated January 2012. I now have two old Suzuki GS1000 bikes, and each has one of these regulator/rectifiers on them. The series regulator is the best way to go. I see over 13V at idle and a steady 14.2 while riding.
B0049MZBF4|1|The installation instructions were TOTALLY INADEQUATE! I poked around on my 2006 Subaru Outback, removing panels and finding nothing. Finally I did a google search and found<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This video was nearly perfect (one screw not mentioned) and then the installation went smoothly. It still took about an hour, but if I had had good instructions it would have been a 20 minute job. The product works fine. Thank goodness for the web.<br /><br />Update 11-15-2013 This item failed after about a year, the second time I pulled a trailer. The car filled with smoke and scared the living heck out of us. I had to tear the connector out of the car with my bare hands. The black box was melted, and four fuses were blown in the car. Lucky it did not do any real damage. At least I have not found any yet. I sent the product back to Cequent, a Reese company, and their response: \\"This isn't our product!\\"<br /><br />Huh? Now what?
B0006IX87S|5|I purchased this for washing my car at home. I use well water and there is something in it that causes spots when I wash my car at home. Installation was a  snap and I am happy to report my spots are gone. Will def purchase again when the time comes.
B00CHDEVLW|2|The part was cheaply made and very flimsy.  Had to buy one from a junk yard that was sturdier than this one.  CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.
B00K6TPZEG|5|Couldn't be more satisfied...Looks great
B000E4NBPS|5|Exactly as advertised and fit my husband's Tahoe perfectly.
B00K6976RK|4|These were a direct fit for 84 NISSAN (Z31) 300ZX brake lights.
B00FBWJXDC|4|Took a long Tim to arrive but turned out great.
B002N3RQYA|5|Wash and wax my 40 foot motorhome in about 1 1/2 hours using wash and wax all and the telescoping wet and dry mop worked great no up and down the ladder great shine without buffing
B000CM0WTU|5|exact replacement fit, come with everything you need. easy install, clean, the same as OEM but for a better price.
B00684TAYY|1|Did not work Very upset and not satisfied
B0077Q5TLU|5|I just installed the TireMinder on my motorcoach and toad. Seems to be working great so far. One tire reading 3 lbs low and Tireminder alerted me of the problem. So far so good and I would order from this vender again.
B000C59M2U|5|They fit correct in my car,great product...
B004XNQLB2|5|Great price fast shipping too.
B00DU0D3J2|5|I bought this for my girlfriend as a birthday present an she loved it! We love the way it looks and fits and she looks great in it. Very nice quality especially for the price.I was kinda hesitant at first about buying it, but now I'm glad I did.
B00G6KT64O|5|As Described. Worked on my 2000 honda accord EX coupe. 4 cylinder
B00027GTPQ|5|The local dealer would have had to order it as well so go ahead and save a buck and cut out the middleman.
B000EQU11S|5|I bought this part, as many others did, to install fog lights in my Corolla LE '05.  This is a Pontiac Vibe/Toyota Matrix light switch but it is the same part number for the Corolla as well.  I bought the actual fog lights and noticed that my car was prewired for them, so after dropping in the actual lights  in their respective spots in the front bumper, there was already a factory harness to plug them in. But they also needed a relay, that goes in the fuse box under the hood and this turn signal stalk which has the extra light switch for turning on the fog lights. Install was very easy, direct replacement for the factory unit, plug and play.    I am very happy, this is a high quality OEM part and works as it should, flawless.
B00CFR8A9O|5|Thanks
B00I8ZIC4A|5|For 15 bucks this is a cheap easy way to make your car a little bit different. Just got them today and put them in within 20 minutes and they all look amazing. The license plate lights give the exterior a whole new attitude and the interior lights give a great blue shine everywhere. Add a few more blue pieces in interior and have a whole black and blue theme
B00CMDVAFM|5|I love this air freshener. This has lasted for me approximately a month in the past and I hope it will last at least a little over This time so I will keep on buying this brand and scent every 30 days
B00HXC8YLU|4|The Twin Iron is black mid-weight leather with cream leather accents on upper sleeves have been `worked' to give a `used' look.  They are not reflective. The jacket and has more pockets than most jackets in this price range. Features five zippered pockets - 2 Handwarmer and 2 Chest on front outside and 1 placket pocket inside and 2 Velcro pockets - 1 for mobile devices on left side and another on right side located inside the jacket.  The waist has snap side tabs for adjustment and the Scooter Collar has snap closure tab.  Venting is provided by zippered openings - 2 front horizontal shoulder intakes and 2 vertical rear exhausts and each sleeve has a zippered cuff with perforated webbing.  The zippers have standard pulls without strings.  I will definitely be adding some kind of string pull to the rear vents so I can more easily open and close them myself and probably the front vent so it will be easier to operate them when wearing riding gloves.<br />The removable fully-sleeved thermal liner features 2 Velcro pockets - 1 for mobile devices on left side and another pocket on right side. The liner is held in by one continuous zipper. The liner sleeves are not connected at the wrists. They do stay in place with a sleeved shirt but if you have a thick sweatshirt they sometime pull inside out when taking the jacket off.  The jacket does not come with armor, nor are there any provisions for adding it.<br />I am 5'8\\" with apparently a 42\\" chest.  I can fit a tee and sweatshirt underneath with the liner in place but it is snug. Without the liner it fits fine. The sleeves are long enough.  I ordered a size X-large.  Haven't rode with the jacket still alot of snow in Minnesota in March. By the way the site motorcyclegear.com has great pictures of jackets and nice reviews.
B0002SQYTG|5|Incorrectly identified by Amazon as a &quot;Dial Tire Gage (sic)&quot;, it is really a pencil-type.<br />An excellent and wonderfully compact Tire Pressure Gauge.  Compared its readings with those obtained from my Accu-Gage instrument, and they differed by only one half (1/2) psi..
B00W6CWLV6|5|It arrived early and was just what i wanted :)
B00HXVD5D8|3|Did not work on a 2008 Mercedes, which is why I bought it.  It just said that it couldn't get any results, but the screen showed it was working and I could hear something click twice under the hood or dashboard.  I tested it on a 2011 Honda and it worked just fine.  Maybe Mercedes just wants to make sure you have to bring it to the dealer.
B000TYMYEC|5|Fit like they were supposed to. Sadly they are made in China :( but best price I found for lower arms
B00002243X|5|I need a long booster cable since in case i ended up my car needed to be jumped (and it's 2 times already in like this year),  i need a long jumper cable that can reach far enough regardless of the position of my car.  The 2 times my car run out battery, the car is not in a good position where another vehicle can just park side by side..
B00NY4V3BY|5|I had bought a previous bracket that said it would fit a SBC with long water pump and it just wouldnt work and came with no instucrions at all i later read other people had issues as well. To be honest it was a POS. So i admitted defeat and bought this and was very happy with it, its simple and seems pretty universal I would recommend it.
B000CITK8S|4|Great for keeping the batteries charged on my \\"garage queen\\". There are times when my classic car isn't used for several months (especially during the winter). Now I can be assured that the batteries will be fully charged and ready to go no matter how long the car has been in storage.
B005N221G6|5|Illuminates the whole cabin and always get people asking where I got these blue LEDs. They will get you blind over time. Its basically a backlight
B00KIYGYN0|5|It came on time and i didnt have any problems connecting it to my car.
B003FSIFWO|5|Installed on my 2013 Silverado. Took a couple of hours because I took my time and wanted the install to go without any hitches. Read instructions and watch video on you tube and you should have no problems. Definitely noticed an immediate horsepower gain once you hit the gas and as you continue to accelerate to open throttle the engine sounds like a beast (I have a 5.3L). MPG gain wasn't dramatic but improved. I didn't remove the negative battery terminal and didn't have any problems with sensors or any other issues. I would definitely buy again and recommend to anyone looking to install on their Silverado.
B002BHZ1L8|3|Within the first month the reflective strip on the leash fell off.  Also, it's only on one side of the leash.  A few months after that the pewter hook on the leash got so bent out of shape I had to get a replacement at my local hardware store for ~$3.  The little light was basically useless, especially since it only lasted about 2 weeks    The collar has held-up fairly well.  The only issue with it is a slight thin crack in the plastic that hasn't given way...yet.  Reflective strip is still there.    Since you get two pieces and the collar has held-up fairly well I gave it 3 stars.  Also the leash is still usable, besides the defects mentioned above.  I use this set on a ~60lb pointer mix.  If reflectivity on the leash is important I would not recommend this set.
B000COS0F6|4|Good replacement for Jeep Grand Cherokee lug nuts
B00B3HXQPA|5|The secret to using Lord Fusor; I haven't found a way NOT to use these puppies. Just make sure whatever you are doing do it fast; the stuff sets so fast you have about 5 minutes!
B0006IX896|5|Exactly as described. Great seller!
B000W0MOD4|1|unless you just accept the default combination.  It was impossible to set your own combination as described in the instructions.
B000BQO22U|5|These really added a nice touch. They seem very decent and do what they are supposed to. I put this on my BMW 328 in conjuction with a low profile steel plate frame. When assembling the cap, press hard until you hear a loud snap. A couple of times I thought it was on, but when testing the secureness, it pulled off.
B00JWS60MS|5|Great
B000CITK8S|5|No problems yet.  Just keep my ATV plugged in and she's ready to go when I need her.  Works good.
B000P155CM|5|If you're painting a car with glass in place, as most of us at-home folks do, you need to buy this. It's definitely not cheap, so try to use it wisely. That said, it can totally make the job -Just think of the hundreds (thousands) you're saving if doing it yourself.<br /><br />Way it works is this: The roll spits out the top of the box and you're presented with this blue tape with a white piece of paper stuck to it's adhesive. Use scissors or a very sharp razor blade to cut this stuff as you absolutely can't tear it. You then stick the thicker blue exposed portion under the molding/trim/what-have-you and with gentle pressure lift away from the panel. At which point you remove the backing paper and stick it down. The corners can be especially tricky, definitely use a dedicated piece just for them. Lots of dirt and contaminates get trapped in there, so make sure to blow it out and clean it good with wax and grease remover.<br /><br />I used to be a professional autobody painter, this stuff is SOP anytime insurance or the customer won't pay to R/R a piece of glass.
B004XGV74K|5|great staff
B00I8IR680|1|This filter was supposed to fit my 2014 Nissan Rogue, but it didn't.  My local Nissan dealer pulled out the old filter and showed me the difference.  Unfortunately, I missed returning it within 30 days, so get to eat the cost.
B003A2SRZA|1|The glop is more trouble than helpful. It feels like it has melted and does an inadequate job cleaning my keyboard.
B0002MAB8M|5|Item works better than I expected, very secure grip, would certainly buy another. The price of the bar was also something that impressed me
B004FSQ8KO|4|works fits well
B004QMDKPA|3|Quality was nice but the size didn't work out for me. I normally wear a 11.5 and a size 12 was way too big so I had to return them.
B0009H51MG|4|good filter
B0018ENCHU|4|Very nice mirror with good images.
B008BTN83S|3|Seems to work fine, sort of hard to tell as I replace another product (DynoBeads) with this one and they both seem to balance as advertised.  Tedious to apply into innertubes already on a motorcycle, so I recommend putting them in your tube 1st, then put the tubes in your tires with the beads installed.  Kit contains all you need and is a good price for all you get.
B00J36N9LO|5|Great quality....strongly made.  Good price.
B00HWSTB58|5|Yes.  Worked exactly as was suppose to.
B004M5SHZE|3|They stick great and look great, but are a little smaller than I hoped.  They are only about an inch or two tall.
B00CMX20H4|5|A loud air horn that everyone can hear especially cars that are cutting you off. I installed it in my bike and it is a very ideal horn to have. It does not take a lot of room to put it in. Air has no delay coming out from the tank. Once you press the horn button it will activate the canister.<br /><br />I really like it. RECOMMENDED to bikers.<br /><br />Thank you.
B004YID69G|5|This bar saved me from several thousand dollars worth of damage to my new truck In a ice storm when I hit a parked dump truck bar held up great for impact and still usable just not as good looking as it was only had minor damage to my truck where it moved in mounting slots recommend to anyone
B004LEO1DI|5|Very nice product it was direct replacement to existing bracket easy to install
B007VWYMUY|5|Quick ship and great product
B000RMGMPS|5|tool worked as expected and was delivered early
B000KKLLFS|5|fits the valve stem on my 2007 Honda civic.  what more could you want from it.
B000CEFT1Y|5|its a unique decal.<br />My jeep looks special once i stick it on my side window.<br />thank you for the free gift.
B000CO9YME|2|Nice hoist, crappy shipping/packaging. The package arrived in pieces on an 18 wheeler. Fortunately the truck driver let me scour the floor for as many of the loose fasteners as I could find.<br />Bad news is the garage project I anticipated being done in January still isn't. But today I finally had enough space to open up what was left of the package and see what I needed to scrounge for.<br />At least one each of the big bolts are gone along with most of the nuts, washers and lock washers.  The Jack handle is MIA and most likely since I didn't open up the package when it arrived to see the carnage I am left holding the empty bag.<br />The hoist itself appears to be as heavy duty as I expected. After a trip to the hardware store tomorrow and another $30 in nuts, bolts etc. it should be operational. Except for the handle.....
B00AQ29FOY|4|Purchased these to replace original product, which would have been quite expensive to do..  Very satisfied.  Other than not having car logo, they look great on my car. Price as reasonable and met my budget needs.
B00069CN2I|5|These mirrors are just what I expected. They are easy to install, fit perfectly, project far enough to see along the side of the trailer and do not vibrate in the wind. I feel that they are better than the built-in extending mirrors, and cost far less. I have not had to adjust them since the first time I set them up.
B009J3MCDM|4|it is nice and bright, would be a 5 star if the other bulb was working...returning it and hopefully i get a replacements.
B00LNQBQLW|5|very good
B000JFJLP6|5|Works very well, I am very happy to have it in my wife's car and it has already saved us twice
B00EO0SGTY|5|Excellent ,working just perfect on all 14 options . price is great for this product , but remember its only for 12V car adapter .<br />and other thing is that on adapter u got on/off switch so even if u leave light plug in  you can just turn off directly on this switch. (red color)
B00DDZWAZW|1|This battery worked fine for a couple of months and suddenly stopped working. My iphone wouldn't update the battery percentage (for instance it would read 100% all day) and then it'd die. That wasn't a big deal, I was just sure to keep it plugged in at night. However, now it's officially dead. It won't turn on, even when I plug it in the Apple logo flashes on for a few seconds and then reboots. Endless cycle. I was hoping to send it back and get a new one but it's not an option. Unfortunately I got a lemon and it's too late for me to do anything.
B00AA3S62G|5|perfect fit. Comes with acc. marker/ back up lights. Nice Touch.really nice way to upgrade the look of you tercel of give it a facelift or in this case a tail lift
B0018CUFCC|3|I haven't pulled anything yet so I can't say for sure if it has helped that much yet.I don't think my mileage has increased.
B00OC5BIHI|3|Item is as shown but it's a stretchy thing. Not exactly what I was looking for. Makes me feel like a little old lady so I took it off the steering wheel. My mistake for ordering. A bit too busy for me.
B004HK2DK4|5|Perfect!  For half the price of one Toyota hubcap, I got four that look pretty much the same to me.  Tired of paying top dollar for Matrix hubcaps that keep falling off, so I'm very happy with these.  They took no time at all to install!
B000BXME7I|3|Could be a little bit taller and could have a better pour spout.
B00KRAI3GG|5|Nothing special. Just a regular floor mat runner, exactly as expected.
B002G27IAK|3|This is an ok light only down side is the paint used chips off really easy
B004A11784|2|I ORDERED BRACE USING YOUR PART NUMBER SELECTOR FOR A 2011 FORD EXPLORER AND RECEIVED BRACE FOR GMC ?? REENTERED INFO AND GOT ANOTHER PART NUMBER???? DEEZEE GIVES YET ANOTHER NUMBER AT THEIR SITE?
B001O05S0C|4|it looks very nice, seems to run smoother with slightly faster throttle response, haven't checked mileage yet.  Only negative I noticed was the clear plastic cap was flimsy and needed finesse to make fit correctly, the brass terminals have a plastic feel about them as well.  The coil is well built, but one hole did not line up perfectly so I had to run the bolt through from the opposite side once first just to cut threads for it to follow, then it went together fine.  The wires fit great with just a slight loop towards the distributor side, looks nice.
B000TCAXPG|1|Image in the mirror is cruked.It is not clear view as images look oblong.The mirror do not fit properly and does not look good.
B0065CX2AM|5|easy to install
B0058RN28C|4|i ended up not using the fillers  but it worked great not sure what else to say but it worked
B00651BDZY|5|Fits my 2015 F250 perfectly. Now I can pull into the garage without hitting the antenna on the roof.
B0009IBJE4|5|Schumacher SSC-1000A SpeedCharge Battery Charger and Maintainer with 50-Amp Battery Clips is Perfect<br /><br />Schumacher SSC-1000A SpeedCharge Battery Charger and Maintainer with 50-Amp Battery Clips is Perfect
B003IS3HV0|5|I think this product is great, I tried it on a sopt on my couch that is about 5 yrs old and had it professionaly protected when I bought it. I was very pleased it seemed that the old protectant had a plastic feel to it and leather honey made it feel like normal great leather. The web site is great and informational I will spread the word about this product and keep up the good work.
B003IHPR4G|5|Needed to replace our trailer jack, this was easy to install and works great!
B0014JN68O|5|Likely the best portable I have had.  Gets hot for great cooking.  Simple to use and stows well in coach
B006G14FK8|5|great product.
B006LO3JPM|5|Great
B00EG0HLIY|4|The only problem I had with this item is I ordered the 8 inch stickers thinking they where 8 inches tall not 8 inches tall form corner to corner so the hatchet man and hatchet girl are really only 6 inches tall
B009ZM4XFM|1|Lights are Plug & Play but 2 out of 10 worked. Cheap Lights from China. If they work they look good, but know that only 2 to 4 will work.
B0051P31A0|5|Battery needs no fluids added, it is ready to go right out of the box.  Came charged up to 12.8v and is working fine so far.  Check back with me in two years of scooter riding with it.
B009NOZ4RI|5|Its high quality and very happy the colors look good
B0088ARGH4|5|Very nice addition to my jeep.
B005FKE5OW|5|I have had these on for two months on my 2012 Sequoia. Daily driving and towing my boat. Stops well and hardly any brake dust. But honestly I was happy to get rid of the OEM disc that warp quickly. Thanks Amazon for the good price, will buy again!  Update! Almost a year and mixed driving/towing a boat. I also drive a bit hard and these brakes keep up just fine. Now I do realize my Sequioa is 7000lbs and my brake rotors do heat up. I have noticed a few times a little 'noise' coming from the brakes under very hard braking. After a few minutes the brakes cool and go back to performing normally. But I noticed this even after just putting these on when they were new. OEM lasted 26k before they were warped badly. I see lots of folks not liking this product and maybe my brakes will only last this year but so far so good.
B00FEXE7MU|4|The lip fit well and came as described. Installation was easy, although the 3M tape I bought did not quite stick to the lip despite being marked as for body molding. I just used some 3M body adhesive glue instead, and it now has a solid hold. The screws also add an extra level of support and peace of mind. Overall a very solid product.
B00HHGRWWE|5|Received them on time and they were just as described. Got them both installed and it they were a perfect fit with no modifications at all. Excellent service. Thank you.
B000BYGETG|5|Fast Service quality and price.
B00F0LZEFA|1|Product is ok, very easy to install, looks great. However, it took numerous emails, a complaint filed with Amazon and almost four weeks to be delivered. Product worth purchasing but from another dealer.
B006QLHOY2|3|Did not come with the adhesive pad so so I have not been able to put it on.
B001GJ3EJS|5|gets the job done. The comfortable grip I'd say stands out as a positive
B000CB2MBW|1|Amazon websites states this part is original equipment equivalent and will fit on my 2006 Acura TSX. Took it to an Acura dealer to have it installed thinking I can save few bucks buying it on Amazon. Wrong!, It cost me almost $70.00 for the pump from Acura, plus $149.00 labor. Merry Christmas to me...............
B001U2DPUE|5|really works well the increase in signal gain average 4 to 6 dB durable ,compact and worth every $$
B003VL93YE|5|It took the tiny, way-too-small that is standard on the Honda Element, and made doubled the viewable area. Perfect size fits right over the existing mirror. Night driving is good too (even though it doesn't have the reduced reflection mirror like the OEM one does). Great job Broadway.
B001PPHOU8|4|Bought this with the Mishimoto radiator because my stock one blew a seal and I thought new hoses would be good. Since the Mishimoto radiator is bigger than the stock one, I had to shorten then top hose a little bit so that it wouldn't be rubbing on the fans or kinked. My only issue is that I had to modify them and that it was hard to cut them right lol.
B002C5MEWS|1|When i purchased this item, i was excited, but it turned out to be a big dismay. I was expecting a lot more for $42.00. What i got was a shocker.  All plastic cut pieces with chrome finish bended in paper envelope.  What a loser product this is.  Made out of plastic with chrome finish just like the ones being used for the side molding of a 70's vehicle. The Seller did not specify what material is he selling, so he is actually deceiving the buyer of buying a pre cut metal chrome inserts nicely packed in a box, for a Range Rover front Grille, whereby he sold to me pieces of plastic strips with double sided adhesive tape to be placed on top of the slats of the freaking front Range Rover Grille, exposed to all weather !!!.  Only an IDIOT would buy this for $42.00, the seller practically made me an idiot. How would double sided tape hold the plastic pieces on a course surface front grille, and exposed to all weather ??? I would put a price on these pieces of plastic crap for less than $8.00. AND I WOULD NEVER NEVER EVER TELL YOU ..\\"THE BUYER TO BE DECEIVED\\" .. TO BUY THIS JUNK CRAP AS I WOULD CALL IT. SO DON'T BE DECEIVED BY THIS CHROME GRILLE SELLER, DON'T BUY IT...

B0049KXF4A|4|A nice replacement for my lost hub cap's on my 09 versa. the only difference is no nissan emblem in the middle of the hub cap.  since i got four for the price of one, not a bad trade off.  fit like a glove.
B00AML9HME|2|This product is way too tight for 2013 Dodge Charger. I installed when the temperature was in the 90's and it didn't help while it took a lot of effort to get it on the vehicle I had to remove it since it was way too tight. It's best to custom order from other manufacturer's to ensure an exact fit.
B0009IQXFO|5|Great smell. Works fine. Good price.
B00DTEDT0C|1|Stated fits 2011-14 SMX plus boots. Did not fit.
B007IQHXBI|2|This product did nothing for my Chevy truck.  Not that much else has helped either.  I have always had excellent luck with BG 44k, but I don't believe it is available through Amazon.
B00JI86L2Q|4|I am very happy with this replacement Antenna. It fit my 98 infiniti i30 great. The installation/repair was not too hard but not what I would call easy. Set a side an hour or two and watch some youTube and most people will be able to do it.
B0002Z2MZE|5|I have used May different leather care packages but this one I am very happy with.  It comes out quickly so be ready for it.  Directions say rub in and clean off extra.  Did that and it cleaned a lot of dirt out on the initial cleaning.  Wiped off the extra and no dirt came out with that second scrub.  I used about a quarter sized for each car seat part, seat and back.<br />The smell is pleasant too, doesn't smell like cleaner and it didn't linger long either
B00DTEFSWY|3|too short to chase main cap threads
B00700E8QA|4|Good.
B00C7Z4KHU|2|Even though it says to measure the length, they didn't say anything about side bags or antennas.  Had to use it for a smaller bike we already had.
B00DI3DV6G|5|Great organizer for my car.
B009PIKHYW|5|We have Husky liners and Mud guards on all our vehicles. GREAT products! Reasonably priced and the quality and fit are perfect!
B00QU03BBY|5|Just what I wanted
B00FFGPGEY|5|The sticker arrived pretty fast, and it seems to be good quality. So for I haven't been able to find anything negative to say about it so I give it 5 stars because it's exactly what it's supposed to be.
B000AMKU58|1|I bought two cans of this product, and after 2-4 sprays per can. there was no pressure left in the can, although you can hear liquid when you shake it. My locks were still frozen, so I got a cup of boiling water and poured it over the outside of the lock and it worked like a charm. Save your money, use boiling water.
B003I25GJM|5|I had to do a reorder on this product since one blew off after 2 wwks on  i realy enjoy the look
B00EZ7WCYQ|5|great gift for boys or girls who love sports.  reminds me of the sticker books of years ago my grandson loved it
B00B5OB7O8|5|These LED light strips are really amazing , they're very bright and really easy to install. Recommend !!!!!!!
B002T3FTTI|1|Very poor craftsmanship. Original filter is one piece and this is two pieces glued together with heavy glue seams. The material the filter is made of is cheap and feels like it will fall apart as you touch it. While it fits, I will be getting an original filter from my Honda dealer.
B00NOBRRXU|5|Super easy to install just plug n play and install under seat, took less than 15 minutes. It is already programmed for Stage 1 mods. A must have for the CRF250L if you get exhaust and open up the airbox, really gives it some awesome power and very easy to change settings.
B008CLPN2Y|4|Easy install. Did notice a difference in throttle response.
B009GPMR9W|5|I love this helmet. I am stationed at Fort Bliss and everyone keeps asking about it. It looks great and fit very well.
B00186CWSI|5|These lights are bright! It helped a bunch seeing at night and i get compliments all the time. must have
B00B1DSWSC|5|eGreen Auto Parts delivers on time with quality parts and FAST service. I ordered this mirror and the post office left it (LOST IT) in Eddison , NJ. for a week and when I contacted eGreen Auto Parts they shipped a new one the same day 2-day mail and as promised by them it is as good if not better than OEM (factory).<br /><br /> Keep up the good work and loyalty to your customers and like myself, we will buy from you time and time again.<br /><br />  Thank you, Bruce
B00B2PW5R8|5|Rugged durability and excellent grip on the floor
B000C2Y2E6|5|Ran the item number after I found the part at an online auto supplier. Amazon says it didn't fit my car but I took a chance that the part number was right. It arrived super fast thanks to Amazon Prime. I saved about 45% over what the parts house wanted so it was a good deal all the way around.
B0059JHASW|4|I got this from Auto Zone, not here. I do buy a lot from Amazon and depend on reviews so I thought I would contribute. The filter does fit properly. I can see how some others couldn't get it in without mods to the air box but it just needs a little tappy tap and it slips right into place. This is for a 2015 Patriot 2.4, manual by the way. Yes the engine does sound a little meaner now. I was surprised but it does have more pep when you get into it. I drove the car about 700 miles before changing the filter so I do have a baseline to compare it to. I just put it in so I do not have MPG #'s yet. I will try to update when I get those.
B000M5W25E|5|Still working well & good price.
B005FKSRZK|5|VARY Nice as advertised.
B00DZ77210|5|A+
B008KZJP94|4|Exactly what I was looking for! I was in need of rubber mats as the New England winters can be pretty rough on a cars interior, however I was scared to buy a generic cut to fit brand. These mats fit perfectly in my 2010 Accent Hatchback and I would highly recommend, the only reason I took away one star was for the high price.
B009MA1LI4|5|Bought for 2014 Harley Iron 883. I am 4'11&#34; and was found out it was already as low as Harley would go with it (11&#34; shocks). Even with the lower seat I was tiptoed so my husband found these 10 1/2&#34; shocks online. They arrived on time, he said they were easy to install and best of all they lowered my bike enlighten to ride. It's amazing what a difference that slight measurement can make and the ride is very comfortable.
B000BGHTK2|3|I purchased for homebrewing in the garage. I was hoping that using a drinking water hose would have eliminated the &#34;hose&#34; taste, however the water did taste &#34;hose&#34;. I even ran it through an inline water filter. Probably says something for the filter as well.
B00K5I5YLW|5|Excellent! Used on my plow trucks in high traffic areas in blizzard conditions. Best light bar I have owned in 12 plus years, of plowing.
B0090Q2NLE|5|Don't think... just buy it.  I have owned 4 of these now.  They last about 3-4 years before the sun eats the retract mechanism and the strings break.  But until then they are the easiest and best I have ever used.
B001FAIA3I|2|This armrest is ok, but I feel it could be better.  It's better than nothing, but it was a gift to my dad and I was a little disappointed.  I have 2 main problems with it: 1. It's just too soft.  That sounds weird to say, but it really is just too soft.  I wish they had used a higher-density foam inside.  2. I also wish it sat farther forward.  I'm about 5'10\\" and my dad is about the same and when the seat is adjusted to a normal and comfortable position for our size, the pad is so far back between the seats that our elbows only make contact with the front edge of the armrest.  I'm considering cutting the bracket and rewelding it farther forward, about flush with the front of the top of the center console, so our elbows have something to sit on.  Honestly, for the money, I'd look at other armrests out there.
B00065TT9W|5|I use this daily, because it is great at removing grease and grime, but does not dry your hands out. The dispenser seems to be heavy-duty and made well and the cleaner will last along time.
B003B30WGA|1|Installed this upper and matching Moog lower rear knuckle bushings on a 98 Cadillac Deville.  7 thousand miles later this part the upper rear knuckle bushing is separated and no longer holding knuckle in place properly.  Both drivers and passengers side bushings were replaced and both have failed by 7K miles.  Extremely poor durability for a suspension component.  Since Moog is supplying an unreliable product I am trying alternate brand to see of any aftermarket holds up.  I can not recommend this particular Moog component based on its lack of durability.
B00H874CMA|5|Perfect fit on my 2013 Camaro v6. You'll want a 13mm socket to install. A socket extension is a good idea but not required if you have a compact ratchet.<br /><br />The bar is most noticeable you're in a tight turn with a fair amount of yaw, like when you are on a narrow flat freeway on ramp or making a u turn. It's a nice improvement in drivability and easily the best bang for your buck upgrade.
B009DK5YQS|5|excellent, highly recommend them
B005GL86Z4|5|For the price and my needs this works just fine
B002MAEHTG|5|thought it was a real grill... strips look good
B00DUFC9JW|5|Great product, super durable and easy to use!
B0013FSR7E|5|lowest price available,free shipping and received in 2 days,part was original ac delco part.would recommend to anyone.
B0006O2PM6|5|My friend asked me to order a case of these car fresheners which I puzzled me at first... He said his dad put them in clothing drawers  and clothing storage areas to help keep cloths smelling fresh... Got it in 3 days too... So happy with that sale... hope you are too.
B009RV1TXU|5|Can't beat it
B00452EO7Y|5|This little panel packs a punch. Even on partly cloudy days, it has enough power to juice up a smartphone in around 3 hours. It is, however, a good idea to have a battery pack with the panel, even if it's not a Goal Zero pack, as the Goal Zero packs are pricey.  Just buy a AA battery pack that can be charged via USB, or if you have extra laptop batteries you can take them apart and use the rechargeable batteries inside them with a battery pack. [[ASIN:B009TN0S92 Dual USB 18650 Mobile Power Battery Box Charger For Rechargeable Li-Ion 3.6-3.7V]] Also, the panel has a mesh zipper pocket that holds the device you are charging, too. The entire panel weighs about a pound, making it great for camping.
B00651CBO6|5|Looks great, works great, I thought maybe I would lose some reception with it but the 1 station I listen to that is weak to begin with comes in crystal clear.
B001C6Q8PM|4|I was missing one light on my license plate and bought this to replace it. This is not the same quality as OEM, but it's just a license plate light so i think it is sufficient.
B00D329DI2|4|They are not bad but not as described. They looked pretty deep on the picture but in real life they are just flat. Price is good for that quality. But we needed more deep mats.
B009P0QGRM|1|It Does Not Work
B000LG9AXQ|1|When I receives this remote it looked almost new and looked like it wasn't going to give me any problems...WRONG! I tried syncing this to my truck a Chevrolet silverado 2004 and did not want to work. I had better luck with my old remote than with this crap. The only good thing I got out of it was the battery and the rubber padding on it. Countless times I tried fixing one thing after another, going inside and out to see if it worked. It didn't feel it was properly made. Overall it was a complete waste of time, waste of money, and I feel like I got ripped off. I wouldn't buy from here anymore..
B000T9LZDI|5|Used this stuff to polish up bolts, barrels, bushings, carriers, hinges, trigger sears, hooks, pins, etc.<br />i could go on for forever. with a dremel and a felt tip it does serious WORK. worked on dozens of guns and still have 3/4 of the tube left. just buy it already.
B004NYJPXW|5|easy to install. looks great
B00943S48E|5|These clips were very easy to install in our Rav4. They have kept the bumper perfectly in place since they were installed. The price was also reasonable.
B00BJCHVPK|5|Many of these weed products come in large containers and the sprayers break before you can use all the product.  These give me a chance to use every drop, instead of wasting money.
B000TXSF6E|3|The product description does not indicate if the wrap would cover all header tubes plus the collector. The image shown does show a complete wrap, but I felt I would purchase one kit and see if another kit would be needed for the collector...no big deal.<br /><br />I followed the directions measuring tube length, adding 8 inches for each bend and used the chart given to calculate how long to measure and cut each strip for my one and a half inch diameter tubes.<br /><br />To my surprise, total length came to 44 inches. Needless to say, it will require three of these kits to wrap four tubes plus a two and a half inch by twelve inch collector to complete the job and leaving me with seven feet or less of the wrap left over.<br /><br />Other reviews convinced me that the product indeed reduced under-hood temperatures, and the thermo protection is what I needed to solve a problem of one header tube situated too close to a coolant heater hose. I am confident that this exhaust wrap will do what I expect it to do, but I am disappointed that it is going to cost three times what I expected, and I blame Thermo Tec for not adding this critical piece information in their description. If I had known, I would not be spending $51+ for three kits, but instead, I would have purchased the DEI fifty foot kit for $37.<br /><br />In all my years as an Amazon shopper, this is the first time I have been burned this badly.
B000CQUTEO|5|Very reasonably priced and are of good quality and fits my Suzuki samurai drive shaft perfectly.<br />I highly recommend it.
B007AJG7WO|4|Nice!
B008P73JX0|1|I really wanted this to fit. It was my fav shirt that I bought. it's too small so now I have to send it back I'm very mad.
B000ZZQ5RM|4|Cheap and protects my mustang sitting in garage.
B004TCXWLY|5|Exactly the part i needed.
B001DUEWJ6|5|good sturdy looking part, seems a lot tougher than the stock one it replaced
B001W6LGGS|4|I would have given this product five stars, were it not for the inability permanently to remove the guidelines when the screen comes on.  It's necessary to push the button every time, and nothing in the instructions or on the Peak website tells how to turn them off (or on).  For all of that, the display is crystal clear, the camera is unaffected by rain, snow, or car washes, and the bluetooth works very well.  It also eliminates expensive and extensive routing of wires from the back of the car to the dash.  It is, however, important to be careful where you install the transmitter.  The system seems to work best in conventional sedans--my installer simply secured the transmitter to the cable running from the trunk lid down to the back-up lights.  It's out of the way, yet it has a clear path to the inside front of the car.  In a pickup or an SUV, you'll probably have to put the transmitter behind a trim panel inside the cab or otherwise closer to the front of the vehicle.  A clear \\"line of sight\\" is the key, and the back wall of a pickup cab will degrade the signal enough to make you unhappy.  I had a professional put mine in, as I don't like to mess with the car's wiring in any way.  He hardwired it to an open circuit on the fuse box, though it still has to have the inline fuse that comes inside the power outlet adapter. Total cost of installation was $120.00, plus tax.
B005O0175I|5|Came Quickly and was an easy fit!  Easy to install.  Very happy with the product and price! Cheaper than other similar products!
B001FGRQZA|1|I was really disappointed with this part.  I got it cause of good price, but quickly found out that you get what you pay for it.  It caused me an extra half a day trying to install it, until I gave up and took everything back apart and check the dimensions, just to find out that the width of the spacer is about 0.3&#34; more than the original part and does not fit into the mating bracket.  The quality of this Chinese substitute looks really crappy.
B005DEITCY|4|It is as seems but I had to cut 4 1/2 inches off to fit my old large buick steering wheel correctly.  This was more simple to me than returning the item for a smaller size.  I bought the 15 inch at an auto store and that was way too small so I thought this would be perfect.  I just wrapped a few thin strips of duct tape around the ends that met and another on top to keep it neet looking.  I am a woman and the idea of heating in the sun and pulling tightly around the wheel does not work for me with smaller ones.  No arm strength I guess.  So ladies, keep you life simple.  Cut it to fit with a kitchen knife.
B004I16X8U|4|Item appears to be made of quality material and a great price!  I will further comment after install.  Thanks again for the fast service.
B000AS1XYE|5|I USED THIS LUCAS HEAVY DUTY OIL STABILIZER AS I WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH DRI STARTS. THIS PROBLEM HAS GONE COMPLETLY. 1984 F150 302
B00473V668|5|very useful
B00BBJVOJU|5|Fit perfectly and operated just as it should.
B0001XPC7C|5|Nice size pocket or auto coin holder
B00HSY1BTK|5|Highly recommend!
B00CWRDQEQ|5|Great quality! I'm a weekend warrior and use them from a small honda civic to ford expeditions.<br />Just did a whole rotor and brake job on my morther's in law jeep and it perform flawless! No complaints here..
B00C5TJ96A|5|I welded this pipe in for a friends ES Lexus 330 and it worked perfectly. I put it in back in October 2013 and still working great. I do suggest if you are going to do this on your own to know what your are doing. But if you do, it's a great inexpensive fix for the Flex pipes of these type of cars.
B000ASICUW|5|seems to be working fine. odor seems to be gone also. course it is cold weather now so that could be a factor also.
B000KL1G02|5|very friendly and very efficient thanks indeed very happy with the product are excellent sellers all perfect and no complaints hamables demaciado excuse the tardansa for qualification but are actually very efficient thanks. Thank you.
B001AJKRNA|4|There has been a lot of comments about these type of mirrors having too much vibration.  These perform well.  I needed to make sure I could see around my trailer while going down the highway and when backing it up and these do just that with little vibration.
B001OCVCQO|5|The boxes arrived with minor damage and worked perfectly mounted as over the rail boxes for our new Tundra.  The latches and chains seem strong enough but time and heavy use will tell
B005FNKSMW|5|the battery worked as expected. good price.
B000V2W0GE|5|Why buy this product from RV supplies stores when this is the same thing and you pay a lot less.  This works great with no problems.
B001SLEM7W|5|Got thease seat covers for a 2010 highlander limited with leather seats. the material is thick enough to give you some insulation from the cold seats  The fit is very good, nice and snug. and the gray looks nice with the gray interrior best bang for the buck at twice the price. Highly recomend these covers.
B0002T8FM4|5|Great for saving Water
B007HRN3QC|5|i oder fan and moter and small repaif part for a 1996 lancer slide on truck camper all good not chep but goood
B00C3VDF1U|4|It's a nice upgrade; it looks great on the motorcycle because it make it look like a ready to race one; it makes it easier to ride because of the wind avoidance and i don't have to get so low over the bike by the way. About the fitting, you have to put some preassure over it to make it fit the mirror holes but is very easy to do (and install). I'm very happy with this new accessory. The only bad fact about it (tha'ts why i give it 4 stars) it's the fact that it turns the wind against my helmet and I hear a lot of kind of storm noise and the intercoms don't work properly (a lot of environment noise around 45mph or higher). I noticed that the air noise reduces when i shut all of my helmet vent switches.
B002MY6ZZG|5|Good part
B003808EWA|4|Great product but was missing a few screws so I had to go buy them myself. Otherwise a great product.
B00GXRM11A|4|Arrived on time. Its a part  was missing, but I honestly havent used it yet as I totaled my car before  got it :( It does fit as it should though
B000S2UFXC|5|Purchased as a backup.  The price was right.
B006ZITPA2|5|This was the perfect bundle for our Walkman!!
B00152C1OA|5|Easy to install in less then 30 minutes. Product meets and exceeds all my expectations. Filters are easy to clean
B00681BE2S|5|Got spare key and transponder from Internet, both worked great.Was able to program transponder myself with included<br />instructions. Saved money, OEM quality.
B003CEJXGI|4|One tab cracked during installation, other than that no complaints. It's not OEM, but at this pricepoint it's a great buy.
B004ZF39T0|5|Seriously one of the best HID kits I've ever owned. Using my 9006 socket kit with 6000k on my 97 buick park avenue ultra (yes I do have it projector retro fitted) anyway, I love the 6000k color not too blue. It looks nice. I'll be purchasing 5000k bulbs to see which ones I like best!
B001UEBXNS|1|Im a professional european auto mechanic.  Ive totalled out numerous vws and audis for people using these aftermarket sensors.  They have a tendency to leak coolant through the sensor and pump coolant through the entire wiring harness which causes corrosion on every plug end of the harness.  Not worth saving $10.  You can find the factory sensor online cheap.  The brand for the factory sensor is Elth.
B004LEYIHW|5|Best oil I've used. I run a pro-tuned Subaru with a big turbo. I used to burn oil with Mobil 1. It stopped when I switched to Motul.
B0009JKGII|4|Worked on gum that was stuck to the side of my car (someone, not I, must have thrown it out their window - ugh).  It required quite a bit of scrubbing to get it off though.  Wasn't just a spray and wipe.
B000BRCKTG|5|used this in my 2009 heartland toy hauler.. it was identical to the original that came out of it... 5500 onan marquis.. gas
B00KSUA6HY|3|They worked
B000CIXZPW|5|Everything fit well and was of better quality than the OEM parts. I also like the fact that you grease the links.
B00FQQFCQU|5|Nice touch especially if you're old school I'm in my fifties love it!
B00D8IKE9S|5|Took under a minute to install both.  The literally snap on.  Now I can lift the hatch about 1/4 of the way, then the lifts take over and  open it the rest of the way.  I hate that I waited so long to replace them.
B0015RTSH8|5|nice product, plug and play, fit perfect well worth the purchase price, came in a box sealed in plastic other than washing off the protective oil it was ready to install
B006ZCKJVW|5|Would purchase again fit truck excellent easy to install look very nice on truck husband was very pleased with my purchase
B00IP3YQBS|4|Description says the tee is black but received orange. Which my husband is perfectly fine with.  Gave 4 stars because the wrong color was shipped.
B00EO1F9I4|3|Not to happy.... More hype than actual performance.... Didn't notice any change from the stock parts I removed.....
B0002Q80GS|5|great product and service
B008Y7PHV8|5|It was perfect
B000630AEC|5|This air fliter has been a great investment. Lifetime filters are the way to go and the performance improvement alone is worth it.
B000YMLLY8|5|So far so good.  Hardwired, instructions good. Tailgate Light Bars get mixed reviews. This company has better than average reliableity. Also if not mistaken  life time warranty.
B009AD9J00|5|perfect
B004QF1JFU|5|I bought these gloves for my boyfriend as a gift. He loved them. He went down and the right glove saved his hand. Great Product!
B007VLFECU|5|I like the bright white color and it draws 1/4 the power of the old incandescent bulb with more light output.  (This will allow the RV battery to hold up longer.)  Make sure it will fit in your fixture since it is larger than a standard bulb.
B00GI781AK|5|Great transaction and nice product
B00361V162|5|a must have
B000COCRHI|5|I was having trouble getting the back hatch of my 97 explorer to latch and found that the old bushings had broken off. These worked perfectly as replacements.
B0002ILK4K|5|Old air mattress inflator as good as new.
B003TMHXBU|5|just received last week with the toolbag I also ordered. Seems like it's good construction and I dig the design, though I haven't had much real experience with them yet, so I can't speak to their longevity. I do wish they were a bit bigger, but when there's only one size you don't get many choices!
B000WJAH5M|5|worked great! easy to install
B0115NK3FW|5|Worked out great for my project; thanks amazon,com!
B00B265S12|5|Package arrived in 2 days. All parts were included. Installation took a little longer than expected but Rough Country had an online step by step that really helped. Would recommend to anyone wanting to change the appearance if their truck.
B009SAAK7G|5|great work light on the Kubota, really bright, very low current draw
B00G2CF9FQ|5|Great product very fast delivery and great price
B00K8XDGSC|2|I was little disappointed with this touch-up paint. The color doesn't entirely match with my deep crystal blue car. I used it on a small area(2mm) where paint had chipped away due to debris hitting the hood. I wanted to give 1 star but giving 2 because something is better than nothing at least its covered now. But I expected the color to be exact as my car color and hoped from distance we won't be able to see the chip, but I can see it.<br />I will post the picture later.
B00UCENGCI|5|Great Looking Decal!
B000KK2E0E|3|This product is a great safety idea, and a great convenience for all trucks. It was very easy to install, but could have come with better instructions and pictures. The foam protector and sleeve was a bit of a mystery because the manufacturer never describes its purpose, or how to properly position it. As a result I had to fiddle a lot with the positioning until I discovered the exact spot it needs to be placed in to prevent the cable getting pinched between the ram and the tail light lens each time the tailgate is closed. The manufacturer also claims that the same model works on Ford f-150s from 2004 to 2012, which is not true. It 'fits' on my 2012 F-150, but the ram is too short and it does not allow the tailgate to open to the fully flat position. When open, the tailgate support cables are still quite slack, and any weight placed on the tailgate has to be supported 100% by the ram. A great idea, but it needs some tweaks to get it just right for the 2012 Ford F-150.
B000ZMHNK8|5|easy to put on<br />smells a little bit<br />great results for long lasting clean shower and bathroom<br />love that stuff
B002XUXUTS|4|The item performs as planned. I've owned it for a few months now and it has been through rain and storms. The one flaw is that it senses the pavement. However, it is very good for safety. A person walked by as I was backing out and it immediately went off. Great product and sturdy construction.
B0084UJHNO|5|fits perfect and was quick and  easy to install
B004C69NTC|5|good filters at a good price
B001FZNIL2|1|Junk,  ripped in a month
B003E3OG0K|5|Much better than the originals fitted at the Toyota dealership for 4 times the price.
B008BE04C6|5|much better than OEM bulbs
B00AV2HONS|4|it saves me many times but the material will melt with the time
B00SFKMRT4|5|Ok
B0092G3IEI|3|Good product
B00BLZ9XQK|5|yay for consistent flash rate
B00590V1N6|5|Came nicely packaged in a box that arrived on time.  Mirror installation was easy and self explanatory.  Hardest part was pulling door panel off to gain access to harness.  Product works fine and I would buy it again if I needed to.
B00061SMS0|5|After breaking two cheaper pullers while trying to take the pitman arm off my jeep I bought this puller. It worked very well.
B0002NUNB6|5|This product is a great tool to take out the swirl marks and fine scratches off the paint, one should know that it should be applied panel by panel either by hand or buffing machine / the one complaint that i have is the bottle arrived with a different look and on it it did not say that it is Perfect it II.
B000IY99ZU|5|I bought this tensioner for my 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan. I also replaced the serpentine belt and idler pulley with Gates products. So far all work great. Makes me wonder if Gates is the OEM supplier to Chrysler.
B004Q3OEV8|4|This car seat is beautiful.  The colors are vivid and the stones are set in good.  I would have given it 5 stars if it was easier to attach on the bottom.  I had a really hard time finding a place to latch the hooks to.  Eventually I just snapped them together but the bottom tends to ride up.  I'll spend some time this weekend trying to adjust it better.  It's really pretty and comes fast.
B009IHOT6C|4|Does bring down the drone quite a bit, if it was a little longer,  like 7-8 inches in length, as opposed to 6. It would definitely get rid of drone completely. All in all, does what its supposed to and does make my highway drive more enjoyable.
B00CUREA5C|5|Big towel. Absorbs a lot of water. Dries nice and no streaks. Would buy again. Very good product. Works great.
B00FEE17X6|5|BOUGHT THESE LIGHTS TO PUT ON MY BOAT TRAILER AS REVERSE LIGHTS. SUPER BRIGHT AND WORK WELL. LOW AMP PULL SO DOES NOT NEED A RELAY IN THE CIRCUIT, WIRED DIRECT TO THE REVESE ON THE TRUCK.
B0024E6ZRW|2|If you own a toy hauler (Energy) it's not nearly tall enough..  Should have returned it but didn't that was my own fault, however if your trailer is low enough to the ground it might be ok?
B00YI3IGA6|5|Wonderful!<br /><br />I live in CA's HOT Central Valley.<br />Such a difference in interior temps now!<br /><br />My pet LOVES hopping in our leather upholstery vehicles now!<br /><br />My husband normally doesn't care for anything in/on his car. He noticed the difference today while driving to the coast.<br /><br />ShadeSox may be a Walking Billboard. I've been asked about them at the gas station and retail parking lots.<br /><br />Great as stocking stuffers. So light - great for mailing small, practical gifts to friends and family!
B009ZUNAAS|5|great keyring
B004NV2ERO|3|The end of the stem goes in a slot in the base, with washers on either side to fill out the slot, and a screw through the whole thing. Well, ha ha, the joke's on you: They don't provide enough washers to come close to filling the gap! You can tighten it all you like, but you'll break the base before it'll ever stay put at speeds over 45 mph.<br /><br />So instead of breaking the base, you just add some more thin stainless washers until it's semi-snug, slop some blue Loctite in there, and tighten it up.<br /><br />So bearing in mind that you'll have to spend a buck or two on some thin stainless washers to make it actually work right (and the loctite, but you need some anyhow), it's otherwise perfectly fine.
B0041CG336|5|The airhawk worked beautifully. We bought it for a trip and rode over 5000 miles. The adjustable pressure valve allowed for changes in air pressure when needed, and provided for a comfortable and enjoyable trip.
B005I5BV5A|5|I am thoroughly happy with this purchase. I'm so glad the mats were what I hoped they would be. Thanks!
B000EQB6NU|5|For the price, you can't beat this air filter. I would have paid double to triple the amount at any auto shop. Does the same job any overpriced air filter would do.
B000VZH0CA|4|The metal is a little thin, but a decent product.
B0002Q81W6|5|This is a fantastic way to store your plug for the trailer hitch. It keeps it form dangling around and getting caught on something.
B0023VAZQ8|5|great i love this product it work just as it should will buy agaain if needed  the s u t
B002GOLH50|5|This is what I was looking for to replace my Virago 250 headlight. It even came with light bulb installed!!
B00FASOCTW|5|A+
B000TYOS3C|5|Snapped right into place.  Must insert at bottom, then pivot into tailgate and press until it clicks at top.  Just like the original which was damaged when removing it incorrectly.
B00DVWH1HY|2|These decals were cheap
B004GFPGEU|5|Super cute!
B006ZWKV2E|5|I read other reviews, but ordered this cover anyway. I have found it to be very useful. I purchased this for my antique british pickup which is very small. We had to customize it a little, but the magnetic clips work fine and hold it down very well. It keeps the leaves out of  the truck bed. I would recommend this cover. Also the material is a very good grade.
B00EGS5LQA|5|Got here fast. Worked perfectly.
B007O1XBQS|5|These little lights are amazing! Endless possibilities and I keep ordering them, haha I have a pretty large inventory in various colors. They are usable for just about any project and wire for 12v without issue. I've had them on my truck in exposed elements for over a year now without any issues. I highly recommend
B000ET5TBM|4|I purchased these for a higher mileage vehicle to replace a set that was installed by a mechanic claimed were OEM plugs the last time my car hit the factory recommended mileage for a new set of plugs. Sadly they were not OEM but even cheaper and slightly incorrect but still functional. After putting these plugs in, it feels like the car is performing slightly better but I also did quite a bit more work replacing sensors and performing general maintenance so its hard to say overall. When I ordered Amazon was out so I got a few plugs from other sellers through Amazon - some plugs came in the proper packaging, some were simply shrink wrapped and I'm assuming where for mechanics. I'm confident in these plugs based on my research and they were the right price. It was only a 20% increase in over all cost for me to use these plugs vs. OEM plugs which is a solid bet towards a longer life of my engine especially when the life of most plugs are rated for an extreme number of miles.
B003TLOSS2|5|The product was shipped on time and just what I ordered. I am very satisfied with my tire valve and would do bussiness with them agian
B005T69IN0|3|It cuold have been a perfect item if all the parts would have been together. I returned it. and got a refund to buy another kind.
B002SA0VYU|5|Love theese gaurds, great item for a great price well worth the money easy to install nice looking really protects your hands .
B004SX5HNA|5|Item as described works great in back window
B002BHWZFI|5|effective, easy to use, easy to carry
B008J83E4Y|2|This type has a very light light and will not show you every think, and this is because of the type of bulb. I hate this one because I expect when I'll buy this one I'll get the bight bulb, In the contrary, I found that this bulb doesn't show me most things. My recommend to every one want to buy this one must be sure this bulb will get disappointed hopes.
B0009JKI1I|5|They are just what my green car needed & I like frogs. They are easy to clean & do not slide around.
B004RUZLXU|1|Handles were cut improperly and didn't fit. Completely a waste of money!
B000FPZYGA|4|Most of the parts in my kits where Dana and Spicer parts so at least you know that they are not some cheap china import.
B00NR8D9AA|3|fog light pieces needed trimming
B0072IDARI|5|Update  Fit my 150 lancer but this does fit but it drops carb. down were it's almost imposable to get at idle adjustment screw.But can still be done! It works good! I found out some of these manifolds from various places make carb. sit higher or lower so watch out!
B000MT7OSK|5|The goggles are very nice indeed and the only gripe i've got is that your peripheral vision is a bit limited. Other than that - Pimpin!
B00D7T4LX8|5|I teach in a rough neighborhood. Some weekends I go to my class to get some extra things done and I get nervous walking to my car in the pitch dark. I have this attached to a keychain to which I've also attached pepper spray and a whistle.  I feel like my &#34;self defense kit&#34; is now complete. I really hope I never need to use this but it feels solid and strong, I think it would definitely help should I ever need it.
B001CO2HRC|5|this product looks great and I can't wait to put it on my car.
B00230J3M6|5|shipped quick,fit perfectly, Bring on the snow!!!
B00LHJFNIC|4|Direct replacement for my 01 Odyssey LX.  Now I have my 1 & 2 speed back.  Took only 15-20 mins to swap.
B000NZ4E7M|5|Very pleased!  Makes the car look very sporty and does a great job reducing wind noise.
B000GU1X96|5|These are awesome.  I cut the round spot where the Yamaha emblem goes on either side of my Nytro snowmobile hood and popped these in.  They work great!
B0019C2VDM|2|Bracket broke before I could get it installed.  Poor quality plastic bracket.
B003SZ3GK0|5|work out good on my sporttrac
B00HQ5HKAK|4|These covers seem to be vey well mad. They were a little snug for my 2011 Malibu but that was a plus. I prefer the snug fit ,it makes a neater looking job. If you want a factory look, go to a pro, If you want a decent cover for the money, these work well'
